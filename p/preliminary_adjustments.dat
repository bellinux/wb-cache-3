40|$|Graduation date: 1965 This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design and}} evaluation of an instrument that can detect known signals in noise. This detector uses two integrators to sense {{a difference in the}} received signal between half-cycles of the known signal. The detector is useful for sensing signals in the approximate frequency range of 100 cps to 35 kcps. As an example of the sensitivity of the detector, a 100 cps sine wave can be reliably detected in random noise where the peak signal magnitude is one-fortieth of the rms noise magnitude. The detector circuit is small and is economical to build. The instrument is quite easy to operate and the results of the detection process are known within one minute once the <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> have been made, A complete circuit diagram and a detailed set of operating instructions are given...|$|E
40|$|Solar radiometers, {{which are}} used for remote sensing of {{atmospheric}} aerosols and absorbing gases, have traditionally been calibrated by the Langley method. Temporally variable conditions, however, can significantly bias the zero-airmass intercepts obtained by this method. In this dissertation, {{a number of new}} signal processing techniques are developed to better characterize aerosol variability and use it to obtain improved intercepts under a broad range of conditions. The techniques include (1) an extension of Forgan's method, using correlation between optical depths at different wavelengths to model temporal variations; (2) spectral/fractal analysis and filtering to identify systematic atmospheric variations and distinguish them from noise; and (3) error correction using correlation between results from different data sets. These techniques, along with some <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> and an algorithm for estimating ozone content, are incorporated into an iterative processing scheme that both calibrates the instrument and provides improved estimates of each optically significant atmospheric constituent. Finally, the characterization of aerosol variability is further enhanced by analyzing data taken with a customized radiometer that measures diffuse skylight as well as direct sunlight...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} automatically refine existing 3 D building models with laser points acquired from a terrestrial mobile mapping system (MMS). 3 D models derived from aerial imagery are in general less accurate than 3 D information derived from terrestrial laser scanning. Therefore, point clouds are used to refine these models {{in order to make}} them precisely correspond to the scanned façade geometry. After a preliminary global registration using the ICP algorithm, each visible façade is individually processed and compared to a filtered point cloud containing only the façade points. First, an individual registration fits the façade plane to the laser points. Then the façade corners are detected in the point cloud by analysing changes in the gutter height. As façade contours can be skewed by lateral cornices, the latter are also detected to refine delineations. Finally, façade corners are adjusted in order to restore original connections between buildings. As a result, each façade of the model is accurately positioned and delineated thanks to the laser point cloud, whilst respecting the structure and the topology of the original model. The façade number and verticality are preserved. This algorithm was tested on several data sets from different MMS and showed satisfactory results, without any <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> from the user. 1...|$|E

The experimental data used in this work are inferred from solidification experiments on a refined Al- 3. 5 wt% Ni alloy performed with X-ray radiography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. These in situ and real time observations allow the accurate and direct determination of the grain origin (heterogeneous nucleation on particles or fragmentation), of the density and of the equiaxed front growth rate. The LGK classical dendrite growth model is {{used to evaluate the}} front undercooling (ΔTC) corresponding to the measured equiaxed front growth rate. Then, the corresponding cumulative distribution of active refining particles is determined. From this cumulative distribution, we derive the corresponding Gaussian and log-normal laws to obtain the nucleation undercooling distribution of active particles. Results are discussed and compared to available measurements in the literature. The standard particle distribution parameters (density of nuclei, mean nucleation undercooling and standard deviation) are determined. We plan to use the determined nucleation undercooling particle distribution in a stochastic CAFE model for the grain structure without <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the nucleation undercooling...|$|R

40|$|Models {{to predict}} the ground motion for {{earthquakes}} that occur in subduction zones are of great importance for earthquake risk reduction and mitigation {{in many parts of}} the world where there is a significant hazard from large earthquakes along the subduction interface and from earthquakes within the subducting slab. Most existing ground-motion predictive equations for subduction-zone events are primarily based on strong-motion recordings from Japan, Cascadia, Mexico, Alaska and New Zealand. In contrast, few records from South and Central America have been included in global predictive equations to date, although a major proportion of the seismicity of these regions is related to subduction-zone processes. The development of a strong-motion database from subduction-type events in South and Central America is therefore an important and essential step for ground-motion prediction in these regions as well as other subduction zones in the world. In this project two databases of strong-motion records from subduction-zone events along the Peruvian-Chilean and the Central American subduction zones have been developed. The Central American database compiled during this study consists of 554 triaxial ground-motion recordings from both interface and intraslab-type events of magnitudes between 5. 0 ≤MW≤ 7. 7. The database compiled for South America consists of 98 triaxial ground-motion recordings from 15 subduction-type events of magnitudes 6. 3 ≤MW≤ 8. 4, recorded at 55 different sites in Peru and Chile, between 1966 and 2007. These datasets have then been used to investigate the extent to which global and regional models for subduction regimes could be applied for the prediction of ground motions from the subduction events in these regions, following a maximum-likelihood approach. Regional differences in the ground-motion amplitudes amongst the South and Central America subduction zones are examined and <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> to existing equations are made in order to resolve the differences between observed ground motions and predictions from these equations. This has led to suggestions for the prediction of ground motions from subductionzone earthquakes in the South and Central American regions.

40|$|Numerical {{ice sheet}} {{modeling}} {{is a rather}} young discipline: it started in the 1950 s. The "first generation" models developed at that time are currently being replaced by "new generations" ones, such as e. g. ARCTIC-TARAH. ARCTIC-TARAH is a Bert Bolin Center for Climate Research spin-off from the Pennsylvania State University Ice sheet model (PSUI). When the Bolin Center received PSUI for subsequent independent development and adaption of the code to Arctic settings in 2010, an initial inspection of the source code suggested that PSUI also contained a module that allows {{for the treatment of}} glacial hydraulics. A numerical ice sheet model including coupling of ice dynamics and hydraulics is an extremely important tool in testing new hypotheses of former geological events. E. g., based on the recent finding that Arctic Ocean sediments contain a very distinct signature, {{it has been suggested that}} ice dammed lakes at the south-eastern margin of the late Weichselian Eurasian ice sheet drained into the Arctic Ocean in a catastrophic event around 55. 000 years ago. The aim of this thesis is to perform a reconnaissance analysis of the glacio-hydraulic algorithms in ARCTIC-TARAH, as "inherited" (but never with published record of functionality) from PSUI. The work is carried out in two steps: first the routines and algorithms describing the hydraulics are located and explored, and then these routines are tested and verified by performing experiment simulations. The investigation of the program code reveals the presence of two hydraulics related modules in ARCTIC-TARAH. The main tasks of the module Water are to initiate lakes and oceans and to adjust hydrostatic pressure in each lake. Further, with the module Move Water activated, transportation of water (e. g. in rivers) is possible. Results from idealized experiment simulations verify the functionality of the routines in the module Water. An in-depth analysis of the module Move Water suggests that there is a mismatch in time units when solving the equations describing flow of water. Experiment simulations also support this flaw detected in the flow model. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> were made to the source code  of the module Move Water, which made it possible to simulate the transportation of water both under an ice sheet and in rivers on land. However, these adjustments do not solve the problem of mismatching time scales, and the numerical solutions obtained from the experiments were observed to be unstable and, therefore, possibly incorrect. To be able to perform more advanced simulations in support of the above mentioned hypothesis, the flow model in the module Move Water needs to be improved or replaced. One solution to the problem with mismatching time scales, could be to use a so called multiscale solution in time...|$|E

40|$|National ozone {{monitoring}} and education centre (NOMREC) of Belarus has engineered a trace meter of surface ozone concentration, {{which has been}} exploited at Minsk ozonometric station since 2004. The method of differential absorption in spectral area 260 - 290 nm is utilized. The instrument provides obtaining absolute concentrations of surface ozone and does not require any calibration under condition of exact <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustment</b> of optics. Otherwise data observed contain a systematic additive and constant error. A generalized source of error is the incongruity of spectra of sounding radiation along a route with ozone and along a zero path route without ozone. It is shown, that usage for calibration of padding dishes with a known concentration of ozone does not solve the problem. To eliminate a systematic error of measurements, the procedure grounded on detection and elimination of differences in both spectra is offered. Unknown exact ozone concentration does not hinder solving the problem, it will be found simultaneously with the sought difference in the spectra. Some examples of applying the method are described. We have investigated differences between measured local ozone concentrations and concentrations averaged over the route by means of natural simulation of local atmosphere circulation generated by thermal convection.

40|$|In {{its present}} state, the corpus of {{knowledge}} constituting {{our understanding of}} the Chrysococcyx 'malayanus' group is too unorganized to be used directly as the foundation for a modern systematic appraisal. A n attempt is here made to rectify this by overhauling the available facts. Stemming from this exercise, a few simple <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the nomenclature and taxonomy of the group are suggested. The taxa here recognized are C. minutillus (with subspecies peninsularis subsp. nov., albifrons, cleis subsp. nov., minutillus and barnardi), C. russatus (subspecies aheneus, jungei, misoriensis and russatus), C. rufomerus, C. crassirostris and C. ruficollis. The type description of Cuculus malayanus Raffles, 1822 being recognizable as a femalephase Chrysococcyx x. xanthorhynchus (Horsfield, 1821), C. 'malayanus' becomes known as C. minutillus Gould, 1859, the next available name. Chalcococcyx niewenhuisi Vorderman, 1898 is transferred from the synonymy of C. crassirostris to that of C. minutillus. Chalcococcyx poecilurus Gray, 1862 is disassociated from the populations currently under this name (hereafter called C. russatus misoriensis) and held in abeyance as a nominal taxon whose reality and relationship to misoriensis require further investigation. The records of 'malayanus' from Cambodia and Cochinchina are questioned. Those from the Philippines are also examined: whereas the extant specimens are all referable to the Bornean form C. russatus aheneus, most of the unsupported records are judged from their descriptions to have been based on female-phase C. xanthorhynchus amethystinus. A n aheneus-like indivudual netted on the crest of the Main Range in Malaya indicates a situation requiring further study. C. m. minutillus is not known to breed outside northern Australia. Records of this form from the Lesser Sundas, the Moluccas, Celebes (Peleng I.) and southern New Guinea (Utanata R.) are here regarded as being of non-breeding visitors; the holotype of niewenhuisi from Halmahera is presumed to have been one such. C. m. barnardi and the southern populations of C. r. russatus are also migratory; one specimen of the former and several of the latter are here reported from southern New Guinea, to which region they are doubtless non-breeding visitors. A russatus-like form from Timor requires further study. The ranges of C. rufomerus and C. crassirostris are possibly largely governed by the distribution of their putative host Gerygone dorsalis; old, poorly documented records of crassirostris from Sorong, Halmahera, Ternate, Ambon and Gorong, whence no species of Gerygone has been reported, are considered to require confirmation. Attention is drawn to the interesting relationship between C. minutillus and C. russatus as these species are here construed. In Borneo they appear to enjoy breeding sympatry without hybridizing (C. m. cleis, C. r. aheneus), whereas in Australia they appear to be hybridizing on secondary contact (C. m. minutillus, C. r. russatus). Such a situation has parallels elsewhere in zoology. Finally, it is suggested that the colour of the bare periophthalmic ring or eyerim of adult females is of taxonomic significance within the group; however, for females of several forms the colour of this character remains unrecorded...|$|E

40|$|The {{ostracod}} Cypridopsis vidua is {{a highly}} mobile crustacean which frequently occurs in beds of submerged macrophytes in lakes or ponds. A laboratory experiment consisting of eight different treatments was performed to test if this species responds to fluctuations in predation risk, food abundance, hunger, and plant structure by trading off conflicting demands such as searching for food in the sheltered lower zone of a macrophyte or shifting to nutritionally more rewarding patches in the exposed upper zone of this plant. Stems of the macrophyte Chara fragilis covered with a variable amount of periphyton were used as plant structures. To signal predation risk, chemical stimuli derived from tanks containing cyprinid fish were used. The ostracods responded to predator signals by spending significantly {{more time in the}} lower zone of the aquaria and by increasing swimming activity especially during the initial phase of encountering the signals. Both with increased hunger level and high food abundance the time spent on Chara increased. When only a single stem of Cham was offered, time spent swimming in the lower zone of the aquarium increased markedly compared to the presence of three stems. In response to different predation risk and food abundance, C. vidua ostracods performed shifts in their vertical microhabitat use {{as a result of a}} tradeoff between foraging and antipredator demands.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the issues of}} designing the two-zone digital microwave sensors for the car alarm systems with high stability characteristics and capable of adaptation to external noise. The existing analog circuit-based microwave sensors for car alarm systems {{have a number of}} essential drawbacks: [...] high level of intrinsic noise to cause the "false" alarm of response sensors; [...] non-stable characteristics caused by the application of analog components at the environmental temperatures from - 30  tо + 60  С. This requires sensor readjustment during the transition from the summer season to the winter one, that is, essentially, hard to implement; [...] uneasy adjustment of a mounted sensor with variable resistors; [...] adjustment characterstic nonlinearity and high power consumption; [...] impossible to implement the auto-compensation and adjustment algorithms to the repetitive external actions. To overcome abovementioned drawbacks the paper offers a circuit of digital microprocessor-based (PIC 12 F 683 processor) sensor with HF oscillator running in pulse operation mode (pulse ratio 20). It allows 6 - 8 times decrease of power consumption up to 2. 1 mA and twice reduction of noise amplitude. Filters with useful output signal are of digital implementation. This enables us {{to reduce the number of}} electric components of sensor in half and to increase characteristics stability. For remote adjustment of sensor (with the key fob of car alarm or by GSM link) 16 gradations of sensitivity are entered for zones of warning and alarm. The reference levels of digital comparators at each gradation of sensitivity are so generated that the sensor has a linear adjustment characteristic (distance of movable object detection versus gradation number). An application of digital signal processing and sensor capability of data exchange with the main alarm module through the bus allows us to implement the original algorithm of automatic correction of sensitivity across the warning zone of sensor. It means that the sensitivity gradually decreases under repetitive external effects (downpour, passing cars in the streets with heavy traffic, etc.) and with returning to the level of <b>preliminary</b> <b>adjustment</b> as the intensity of external effects decreases.

Like other gain-control- free blind phase-offset estimators, it measures the amount of the cyclic shift by which the (four-folded) phase probability density function (pdf) is rotated under an unknown phase-offset. Estimation of the phase-offset-induced cyclic shift is conducted first by measuring the received data phase pdf by a canonical phase histogram procedure, then by estimating the phase-offset-induced cyclic shift through a cyclic cross correlation-based procedure between the measured phase histogram and a reference phase pdf evaluated within the zero phase-offset hypothesis. Actually, the estimation procedure is presented in a generalized version that considers a tomographic projection of the bidimensional (magnitude/ phase) pdf of suitable nonlinear transformations of the received data. The tomographic projection performs a magnitude weighing on the pdf, and this, in turn, results in an improved overall estimation accuracy, as shown by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations here performed to assess the estimator performance...|$|R
40|$|The CONSORT dosing {{algorithm}} individualizes {{recombinant human}} FSH (r-hFSH) doses for assisted reproduction technologies, assigning 37. 5 IU increments according to patient characteristics: basal FSH, body mass index, age and antral follicle count. A prospective, uncontrolled, international, 18 -centre, pilot study of normo-ovulatory women aged 18 - 34 years inclusive undergoing a long agonist treatment protocol was performed. Follitropin alpha filled-by-mass (GONAL-f) dose was {{assigned by the}} algorithm and {{was intended to be}} altered only for risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Primary end-point was number of oocytes retrieved. Dose groups containing >or= 5 patients were analysed: 75 IU (n = 48), 112. 5 IU (n = 45), 150 IU (n = 34), 187. 5 IU (n = 24), 225 IU (n = 10). Cancellations due to inadequate response were higher than expected in the 75 IU group (12 / 48). Overall, a median of 9. 0 oocytes were retrieved (8. 5, 8. 0, 10. 0, 12. 0 and 8. 0 in the 75, 112. 5, 150, 187. 5 and 225 IU groups respectively). Clinical pregnancy rates/cycle started were 31. 3, 31. 1, 35. 3, 50. 0 and 20. 0 %, respectively (overall, 34. 2 %). Two patients had severe OHSS.

40|$|Haptic {{feedback}} to lower limb amputees {{is essential to}} maximize the functionality of a prosthetic device by providing information to the user about the interaction with {{the environment and the}} position of the prostheses in space. Severed sensory pathway and the absence of connection between the prosthesis and the Central Nervous System (CNS) after lower limb amputation reduces balance control, increases visual dependency and increases risk of falls among amputees. This work describes the design of a wearable haptic feedback device for lower limb amputees using lateral skin-stretch modality intended to serve as a feedback cue during ambulation. A feedback scheme was proposed based on gait event detection for possible real-time postural <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> perceptual test with healthy subjects in static condition was carried out and the results indicated over 98 % accuracy in determining stimuli location around the upper leg region, suggesting good perceptibility of the delivered stimuli...|$|R
40|$|EXPLANATION OF THE TEST PROCEDURE General Tractors {{are tested}} at the University of Nebraska {{according}} to the Agricultural Tractor Test Code approved by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers and the Society of Automotive Engineers or official Nebraska test procedure. The manufacturer selects the tractor to be tested and certifies {{that it is a}} stock model. Each tractor is equipped with the common power consuming accessories such as power steering, power lift pump, generator, etc., if available. Power consuming accessories may be disconnected only when the means for disconnecting can be reached from the operating station. An official representative of the company is present during the test to see that the tractor gives its optimum performance. Additional weight may be added to the tractor as ballast if the manufacturer recommends use of such ballast. The static tire loads and the tire inflation pressures must conform to the Tire Standards published by the ASAE and SAE. Preparation for Test The engine crankcase is drained and refilled with new oil conforming to specifications in the operator 2 ̆ 7 s manual. The operator 2 ̆ 7 s manual is also used as the guide for selecting the proper fuel and for routine lubrication and maintenance operations 2 ̆ 2. The tractor is limbered up for 12 hours on the drawbar, using each gear with light to heavy loads during the limber-up period. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the tractor is permitted at this time. Any parts added or replaced during the limber-up run, or any subsequent runs, are mentioned in the individual test reports. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is to be used during the drawbar runs. PTO Performance Power take-off performance runs are made by connecting the power take-off (or the belt pulley if no power take-off is available) to a dynamometer. During a preliminary power take-off run the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative may make adjustment for the fuel, ignition or injection timing and governor control settings. These settings must be maintained {{for the remainder of the}} test. The manually operated governor control mechanism is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer. During the power take-off runs an ambient air temperature of approximately 75 0 F. is maintained. Maximum power is obtained at the rated engine speed specified by the manufacturer with the governor control lever set for maximum power. This same setting is used for all subsequent PTO runs. Time of the run is two hours. Whenever the power take-off speed during the maximum power run differs from the speeds set forth in the ASAE and SAE standards, an additional run is made at either 540 or 1000 rpm of the power take-off shaft. Time of this run is one hour. Drawbar Performance Maximum drawbar power is shown for the normal field speed selected by the manufacturer. All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the power take-off runs. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated engine speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified. Maximum drawbar power is determined within the following limits: (1) slip of the drivers must not exceed 15...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurposeWe {{analyzed}} the intermediate and longer term changes in patients’ waiting times following {{the implementation of}} an electronic medical record (EMR) dedicated to ambulatory treatment in both medical and radiation oncology. Methods and materialsA pre-post study design was developed to assess improvements in patients’ waiting times, defined {{as the number of}} days between key steps in patient management preceding the first treatment. The postperiod began 1 year after the EMR go-live to allow for a <b>preliminary</b> period of <b>adjustment</b> to the new EMR. The EMR under study was closely integrated into the clinicians’ workflow, being designed as a care pathway information system to provide real-time support to the coordination of the entirety of care processes involving all the care personnel. ResultsThe large majority of the waiting-time indicators decreased over time, with decreases ranging from 2 to 28 days. However, an important time lag was necessary to see an improvement, to the extent that better access was only observed in the final months of the postperiod. ConclusionThe study highlights the potential to design EMR applications that capitalize on tight workflow integration, both in medical and radiation oncology, to deal with the fundamentally collaborative nature of cancer care delivery...|$|R
