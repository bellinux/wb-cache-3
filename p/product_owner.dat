50|$|The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> can cancel {{a sprint}} if necessary. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> may {{do so with}} input from the team, scrum master or {{management}}. For instance, management may wish the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate {{the value of the}} sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, {{the next step is to}} conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.|$|E

5000|$|Direct {{shipment}} is {{a method}} of delivering goods from the supplier or the <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to the customer directly. In most cases, the customer orders the goods from the <b>product</b> <b>owner.</b> This delivery scheme reduces transportation and storage costs, but requires additional planning and administration.|$|E
50|$|Empathy {{is a key}} {{attribute}} for a <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to have—the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> converses with different stakeholders, who {{have a variety of}} backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.|$|E
50|$|The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> {{represents}} the product's stakeholders {{and the voice}} of the customer; and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> defines the product in customer-centric terms (typically user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies. Scrum teams should have one <b>product</b> <b>owner.</b> This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution. This role is equivalent to the customer representative role in some other agile frameworks such as extreme programming (XP).|$|E

50|$|Communication is a core {{responsibility}} of the <b>product</b> <b>owner.</b> The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The <b>product</b> <b>owner</b> role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving {{as a proxy for}} stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of mobile devices has made great progress and today they account for {{a large proportion of}} the internet usage. This trend poses new demands on web developers as more companies and <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> want to customize their services and products for this new market. In this study we examine the pros and cons of the strategies desktop-first and mobile-first in the development of adaptive interfaces for the web. The study aims to create guidelines for situations in which each strategy fits well. The purpose of the study is to create an understanding of how these strategies can help developers and <b>product</b> <b>owners</b> to develop adaptive interfaces based on different goals and objectives. The study was conducted through the development of two high-fidelity prototypes for the redesign of an existing website. A literature review was also performed to create a deeper understanding of the subject. Our conclusion showed that mobile-first was preferable when building a website from scratch. However, there are cases when desktop-first may be preferable, for example, in the redesign of an existing website where the foundation is already finished. Furthermore, the study has led us to the realization that there are many purposes of different websites making the subject complex. Therefore, the developer should always make an evaluation of the <b>product</b> <b>owner's</b> goals and objectives in order to choose the right strategy...|$|R
