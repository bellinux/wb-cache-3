40|$|This {{research}} {{is done for}} MBA programme in project Management year (2010 / 2011) in the University of Moratuwa. The main objective of the {{research is}} to study the trend towards Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) initiatives in the northern province of Sri Lanka. The School buildings, hospitals, housing construction and common building construction were considered during the study. One divisional secretariat division (Vadamarachi East) was selected for the field study since this division was affected by both Tsunami and war {{and there are lots}} of development activities in progress by various organizations in the Province. The data were collected in stages (a) to analyze the managerial initiatives,(b) the field level initiatives and achievements. The managerial and coordination mechanism information were collected through interviews with the relevant authorities and theinformation from government policies and new Act enactment. The application and implementation status were analyzed through field visit to the project locations which have been implemented by various organizations in the selected divisional secretariat. There were lots of national level initiatives took place after Tsunami. A solid development management and monitoring strategies were developed, but in the field level achievement was far away from the target. This was confirmed from the field level physical work done, the type plans developed by various organizations, the existing local authority’s standard for building approval. The DRR initiatives not properly implemented in the field level. The reasons were identified during the analysis as follows: (i) Disaster risk reduction is not adequately considered as a priority in development planning processes, (ii) Inadequate enforcement and authoritative powers to implement and monitor disaster preparedness and mitigation measures,(iii) Lack of technical and legal framework to integrate DRR into national and sectarian planning, (iv) The responsible body not realized the importance of disaster risk reduction application, (v) The political situation in the province and the lack of understanding between central and provincial governments is negative for DRR achievement, (vi) the provincial council give priority for other subject. (e. g. : political solution and administrative power sharing) and (vii) Lack of public awareness, people mentality and cultural believes (Vasthu). The following recommendations are proposed for future development to change the situation in positive direction. The local authority capacity and awareness among the responsible people need to be improved (refer chapter 4. 4 & 5. 6). The existing coordination mechanism between national level and local level need to be improved (refer chapter 5. 6). The authority for implementation of DRR initiatives should be more decentralized. It is important to create appropriate focal point in the field level to ensure and monitor the DRR activities implementation (refer chapter 4. 1). The authorities should consider DRR initiatives during land allocation for construction purpose (refer chapter 5. 6). The NGOs and INGOs need to maintain proper coordination mechanism with the responsible authority to implement the DRR initiatives successfully. The annexure 9 attached as guidance for future application. The National level: The central government should appoint a permanent coordination body involving ministers, government department, NGOs, UN agencies and private sectors. The government should accommodate <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> to ensure the sustainability of the initiatives The donors should insist the authorities to accommodate DRR activities during the financial assistant...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the importance that {{is attributed to}} a variety of financial and non-financial performance measures depends on the type of use - evaluation versus reward. Survey data, collected on a sample of industrial companies, provide consistent evidence of a difference in the importance attached to performance measures for these two uses. More importance is attached to both financial and non-financial performance measures for the <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation</b> than for variable rewards. The study also shows that the influence of production strategy and departmental interdependence on the importance attached to performance measures differs for evaluation and reward uses. A production strategy focused on differentiation by product-performance has a negative effect on the importance attached to financial measures for variable rewards but no effect on their importance for <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Moreover, departmental interdependence decreases the importance attached to financial measures for variable rewards but not for <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Departmental interdependence also has only a positive effect on non-financial measures for <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation</b> and no effect on non-financial measures for variable rewards. Overall, the data suggest that it is essential to distinguish between different uses when studying performance measurement choices and their determinants. ...|$|R

40|$|Contact {{sensitization}} {{in children}} is frequent. However, because exposure to sensitizing agents varies rapidly, {{it is of}} utmost importance to perform a <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of patch test results. Our purpose was to compare our data on contact sensitization in children during the past 7 years to our previous 1988 - 1994 findings, {{in order to identify}} emerging allergens and update our pediatric series. From 1995 to 2001, 1094 consecutive children were examined. Of these, 997 patients were patch tested with our pediatric series, which includes 30 allergens, whereas 97 underwent patch testing with 46 allergens. A total of 570 children proved allergic (52. 1 %). The highest sensitization rate was observed in children under 3 years of age. No differences between atopic dermatitis patients and nonatopic ones were observed in the sensitization rate. Neomycin, nickel, wool alcohols, thimerosal, and ammoniated mercury gave most of the positive responses. With respect to 1988 - 1995 data, allergy to substances such as neomycin, nickel, wool alcohols, thimerosal, ammoniated mercury, propolis, potassium dichromate, and thiuram mix proved more frequent. In conclusion, as sensitization rates to different allergens show great variations over time, <b>periodic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of patch test results in children is necessary in order to update the test trays...|$|R

When the values of other path network QoS parameters are lower than the critical value, the path shall be prepared for redundant transmission, so as to ultimately improve service QoE score.
