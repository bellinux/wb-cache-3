Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but are afraid to do." ...|$|E

Camille Paglia says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting [...] "nice" [...] they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with Playboy, [...] "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness.

Only after {{being told by}} the Labour Party leadership that the comment was unacceptable did she apologise for [...] "any offence caused", claiming {{that she had not}} intended to [...] "make generalisations about white people". The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called her comments a [...] "stupid and crass generalisation". Nadhim Zahawi, Conservative MP, said: [...] "This is racism. If this was a white member of Parliament saying that all black <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> bad things to us he would have resigned within the hour or been sacked."

2500|$|Sumsion {{also led}} an active {{professional}} life outside the cathedral. [...] He had begun composing {{as a young}} man and continued to accept commissions when he was well into his eighties. Possibly his last work was a set of hymns entitled 'Four Hymns', to words by Paul Wigmore, and published by Oecumuse in the autumn of 1995, only weeks after Sumsion's death. He composed many works for organ and choir, as well as chamber and orchestral pieces and a book of piano exercises. [...] Sumsion also taught piano, organ, and composition privately, adjudicated at competitions, accompanied vocalists and played with chamber groups, and performed as an organ recitalist. [...] His 1965 recording of Elgar’s Organ Sonata, which he recorded in one ‘take’, is now regarded as the standard interpretation of that work. [...] Concurrent with his post at the cathedral Sumsion served as director of music at Cheltenham Ladies’ College (1935–1968) and directed the Gloucester Choral and Orchestral Societies. [...] As a teacher and choir trainer he was said to be demanding yet kind and encouraging, displaying ‘that rare gift that made <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well for him’. [...] Sumsion was honored with a Lambeth Doctorate in 1947 and was appointed CBE in 1961.|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I did when I was mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, a lot of <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E
