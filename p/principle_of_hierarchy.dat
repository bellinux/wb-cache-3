The following excerpt is from Frank A. Salamone's [...] "The Hausa of Nigeria":"The Hausa tend to rank all specialties in a hierarchical and hereditary system. Inheritance is by primogeniture. The Hausa prize wealth {{and use it to}} form patronage links. However, wealth also brings with it the burden of great responsibilities. The patron-client relationship binds all Hausa men to some extent. The Maguzawa are organized into small villages of exogamous patrilineal kin. Conversely, Muslim Hausa local organization is somewhat more complex. The compound, his wife or wives, and their children is the smallest social unit. Other family members, clients, and their families may also inhabit the compound. Therefore, patrilocal extended families or joint fraternal families often inhabit a compound. The mai-gida, or male head of the family, rules the compound. The compound forms a joint agricultural unit. Occupational specialties, however, are at the discretion of the individual. As Muslims, each Hausa male may have four wives and as many concubines as he can support. ... In conformity with the Muslim Hausa <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> wives are ranked in the order of their marriages. The Hausa prefer cousin marriage on either side, although patrilateral parallel cousin marriage in the Fulani style has greater prestige than any other form of marriage. ... The Hausa pride themselves on being a [...] "civilized" [...] people with strong urban roots. They display a genius for organization. Their wards have a village organization, which is under the leadership of the village head. Formerly, there would be a titled official in the capital who held clusters of villages in fief. The emir would be the overall ruler of the particular state, which consisted of a number of clusters of villages. British rule which was consolidated about the beginning of the Twentieth century changed the system in a number of ways, providing greater power to emirs and local Muslim officials." ...|$|E

In other studies we have analysed to which extent scientific “peripherality” has become an increasingly complex phenomenon that is not restricted to national dynamics and cannot be explained {{with the concept of}} “academic imperialism”. The World Academic System was structured in the last four decades through a triple <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> that created segmented circuits, historically constructed at the intersection of the institution of origin, language and discipline. The so-called “mainstream” circuit was based on the distinction between internationalized scientists and researchers restricted to domestic or “marginal” circuits. In this paper, we focus on the world of social science journals in Argentina in order to deepen our insight on the disciplinar specificity of that <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In the first part, we describe the circuits according with their power of “international” recognition, in order to go beyond a mere measurement of “visibility”. Then, we develop an analysis of the database that we have built with the universe of Argentine journals to determine how this knowledge circulates. We observe, particularly, a strong domestic circuit, with little or none international impact, consisting of non- indexed journals published only in paper, resulting in a very restricted distribution...|$|E

40|$|A three-stage {{faulting}} model {{explains the}} observed quantitative relations between long-term precursory seismicity, mainshocks and aftershocks. Seismogenesis {{starts with the}} formation of a major crack, culminates in the corresponding major fracture and earthquake, and ends with healing. Crack formation is a self-organised critical phenomenon, and shear fracture is a delayed sequel to crack formation. It is postulated that the major crack generates a set of minor cracks, just as, later, the major fracture generates a set of minor fractures. Fracturing of the minor cracks raises the average seismicity level. By Mogi’s uniformity criterion, the major earthquake is delayed until the minor fractures have healed and the stress-field has regained relative uniformity. In accord with the scaling principle, the model applies at all magnitude levels. The size of any given initial crack determines the scale of the ensuing seismogenic process. A graphical technique of cumulative magnitude analysis gives a quantitative representation of the seismicity aspects of the model. Examples are given for large earthquakes in a region of continental collision and a subduction region. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is exemplified by the seismogenesis of a M 5. 9 mainshock occurring entirely within the precursory stage of a M 7. 0 mainshock.

40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made in genetic dissection of quantitative trait variation during the past two decades, but many studies still reveal only a small fraction of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and epistasis remains elusive. We integrate contemporary knowledge of signal transduction pathways with principles of quantitative and population genetics to characterize genetic networks underlying complex traits, using a model founded upon one-way functional dependency of downstream genes on upstream regulators (the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy)</b> and mutual functional dependency among related genes (functional genetic units, FGU). Both simulated and real data suggest that complementary epistasis contributes greatly to quantitative trait variation, and obscures the phenotypic effects of many ‘downstream ’ loci in pathways. The mathematical relationships between the main effects and epistatic effects of genes acting at different levels of signaling pathways were established using the quantitative and population genetic parameters. Both loss of function and ‘‘co-adapted’ ’ gene complexes formed by multiple alleles with differentiated functions (effects) are predicted to be frequent types of allelic diversity at loci that contribute to the genetic variation of complex traits in populations. Downstream FGUs appear to be more vulnerable to loss of function than their upstream regulators, but this vulnerability is apparently compensated by different FGUs of similar functions. Other predictions from the model may account for puzzling result...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to get an}} {{understanding}} of the determinants of unscheduled store visits during daylight-saving time so that retail service providers may be able to encourage shoppers to expand their purchases during their sporadic store visits. Design/methodology/approach – From the survey data, two econometric models were constructed, which predicted frequencies and times of shoppers' unscheduled grocery purchases. Based on the findings and behavioural principles, a conceptual model is defined for motivating shoppers to expand their purchases during their intermittent store visits. Findings – A considerable number of consumers make unscheduled grocery store visits to their principal grocery stores when the store is kept open during daylight-saving time. Shoppers are, however, not likely to make significant purchases during these irregular visits. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine changes in shopping behaviour from the switch back of the clock when DST is over. Practical implications – Grocery stores who employ more resources, hoping {{to take advantage of the}} increased consumer inclination to visit stores during daylight-saving time, may struggle to recover their operating costs. Originality/value – The preparedness of consumers to break out of their work and social activities and visit their principal grocery service providers after business hours during daylight-saving time suggests that these consumers could be motivated, based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of needs, to elaborate on the benefits of the store's augmented and engaging services at this time and expand their purchases during these visits. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of consciousness to the reflexive processes {{is one of}} the fundamental problems in psychology. To date, however, many important aspects of this problem remain poorly understood. This article attempts a theoretical study of this problem. The subject of research is the interconnection between consciousness and reflexive processes and also the structure of these processes. This study presents theoretical and empirical materials revealing the interrelatedness of these two fundamental subjects of psychological research. In connection with this issue, I introduce a new methodology for psychological research, which I refer to as the metasystem approach. This approach is grounded in the claim that reflection is the basic procedural means of consciousness and is based on a heterarchical principle. This article proposes a new structural, polyprocess method for revealing the psychological nature of reflection and the contents of reflexive processes. I propose a new explanation for the basic properties of the psyche that underlie consciousness: self-sensitiveness (sensitivity to oneself). I theoretically prove the following proposition: reflection has a fundamental heterogeneity because its processes are localized on completely different hierarchical cognitive levels of personality. In addition, I show that in the structural organization of reflection as an integral process in relation to other (“secondary,” metacognitive) processes, another basic principle is involved — the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> The property of reflexivity (and the process of reflection as a procedural manifestation of this property) should be understood as a species in relation to the more common attribute inherent in the psyche: self-sensitiveness. Elementary manifestations of this property have been observed for the simplest sensory processes. ...|$|E

It is still intriguing to see how comprehensive and thorough social order usually is {{which is based on}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> i. e. dominance and submissiveness. The social actions, identities and ideologies of both superiors and subordinates seem to complement each other and jointly create hierarchical social order which is quite persistent throughout the centuries and in very different social systems. This persistent hierarchical order has been also the constituting and guiding principle for the relationship between managers and employees. Obviously, bureaucratic organisations as well as traditional forms of business organisations such as Taylor's or Ford's factories are hierarchical throughout. But how about modern or even post-modern forms of organisations, such as teamwork-oriented, project-based, collegial and collaborative organisations and networks? Has the iron fist been replaced by the velvet glove? In this sense, the paper copes with two questions: 1. How do superiors' and subordinates' differing social actions, identities and ideologies constitute together persistent hierarchical social order? 2. Is hierarchical order restricted to orthodox organisations or can it be identified in different types of organisations? For interrogating these questions, this paper develops a theoretical model which describes how superiors' and subordinates' identities, ideologies and social action jointly constitute persistent hierarchical order. Secondly, the model will be applied to different (ideal-typical) forms of organisations in order to investigate whether or not hierarchical order persists in different types of organisations. The key findings of this analysis are not very encouraging, but hope springs eternal...|$|E
40|$|By {{recognizing}} to {{the treaties}} and agreements ratified or approved a "superior authority on the laws", the 1958 Constitution has solemnly affirmed the primacy of international norms on the internal legal order. But {{in the absence of}} any precision as to the judicial organ in charge of insuring this principle, it was the constitutional judge to decide. The key decision "Interruption volontaire de grossesse" of the 15 th January 1975, where this organ declined its competence is the cornerstone of a stable jurisprudence according to which ordinary tribunals are implicitly but incontestably charged with what has been named the "control of conventionality". However, if for the Constitutional Council, the article 55 does not create a condition of the conformity of laws to international treaties, it does lay a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> which may be enforced within the framework of constitutionality control Thus, the analysis of article 55 of the Constitution reveals that the prescriptions there contained are aggregated in a double normative content, which leads, under the impetus of the constitutional jurisprudence, to double jurisdictional competence : the Constitutional Council, judge of constitutionality, is in charge of the direct constitutionality prescriptions contained in the article 55 while the ordinary judge, judge of conventionality, insures the enforcement of the indirect conventionality prescriptions implied by this article.

Muscovy maintained both official and semi-official diplomatic contacts with the representatives of the GDL political elite, thus unconsciously acknowledging their prerogative to represent the state.
