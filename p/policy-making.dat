5|$|Bahrain invests {{little in}} {{research}} and development. In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data {{on research and development}} poses a challenge for policy-makers, as data inform evidence-based <b>policy-making.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Policy-making</b> is {{initially}} {{discussed in the}} Executive Council, presided by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, before passing to the Legislative Council for bill adoption. The Executive Council consists of 30 official/unofficial members appointed by the Chief Executive and one member among them acts as the convenor.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Council, {{the two main}} hives of {{activity}} in science, technology, and innovation are the University of Bahrain (established in 1986) and the Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies. The latter was founded in 2009 to undertake research {{with a focus on}} strategic security and energy issues to encourage new thinking and influence <b>policy-making.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party <b>policy-making</b> decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic <b>policy-making.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active <b>policy-making</b> role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial grassroots levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national <b>policy-making</b> decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E
5|$|In between General Council sessions, {{approximately}} 300 {{elected representatives}} from the various districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery. When the General Council is not in session, the General Presbytery acts as the official <b>policy-making</b> body of the Assemblies of God. A 20-member Executive Presbytery, led by the Executive Leadership Team, meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God's board of directors. Executive Presbyters are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic <b>policy-making</b> during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
5|$|His {{seclusion}} from Syrian politics ended {{after the}} Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party took {{power in a}} coup d'état on 8 March 1963. The Military Committee's stated goal was to reestablish a pan-Arab state; a goal Atrash shared. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in Salah al-Din al-Bitar's first government, and {{became a member of}} the Presidential Council, an organ responsible for running day-to-day state affairs. In February 1964 Atrash was elected to the 12-member Ba'ath Party National Command, which was nominally the highest <b>policy-making</b> body of the party.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding elite and a professional elite. The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, their associates, personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals, claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military elite from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90% of <b>policy-making</b> positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite. After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either <b>policy-making</b> or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5% of the families that had members in <b>policy-making</b> offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional elite began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region {{and be able to}} retain its free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and <b>policy-making</b> except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's <b>policy-making</b> powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) was validly {{established}} in October 1976 under The Punjab Development of Cities Act (1976) to regulate, supervise and implement development activities in its jurisdiction area. The FDA {{acts as a}} <b>policy-making</b> body {{for the development of}} the city and is in charge of arranging and supervising major developments within the city. It is responsible for the administration of building regulations, management of parks and gardens and subsoil water management. The FDA works with the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to control and maintain the water supply, sewerage and drainage. The FDA works to improve conditions in the slums.|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian <b>policy-making</b> in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler {{announced}} that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his <b>policy-making</b> decisions, {{to the chagrin of}} Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits. Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937, and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control {{under the auspices of the}} Four Year Plan. In July 1937, the Reichswerke Hermann Göring was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945 {{was sent}} to the Far East. A group was created which was a {{collection}} of RAF forces that were to be used to recover Singapore from the Japanese. Cunningham and Rawnsley flew out to Rangoon via Malta, Cairo, Baghdad and Karachi. Soon after they arrived they learned of the atomic attacks against Japan. On 2 September 1945, Japan surrendered and the Second World War was over. Cunningham was offered a permanent commission in the RAF but he feared his career, if he stayed, would become mired in administration, <b>policy-making</b> staff courses and committees. It would mean flying would become a secondary occupation. He decided to return to de Havilland. The company had asked the RAF to release him the previous summer but had been refused. He was formally de-mobilised in November 1945 and re-joined de Havilland on 1 December.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{made the}} {{transition}} from amateurism to full professionalism in the late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} club chairman Eric Persson. An open member association, the club's annual general meeting is the highest <b>policy-making</b> body. Each club member has one vote, so no shares are issued. The general meeting approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and other board members, and decides on incoming motions. The current chairman is Håkan Jeppsson, who has been chairman since 2010, when he replaced Bengt Madsen. The club's legal status means that any interest claims are made to the club, and not {{to the board of directors}} or club members. Day-to-day operations are overseen by a managing director, who liaises with the chairman.|$|E

5|$|Mikoyan {{became an}} early convert to the Bolshevik cause. He {{was a strong}} {{supporter}} of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade. In October 1952 at the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in <b>policy-making.</b> He backed Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest <b>policy-making</b> body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Zahorchak {{received}} a bachelor's degree master in 1980 from Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, {{and a master}} of education degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986. In 1994, Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on state <b>policy-making.</b> Zahorchak began his educational career in 1980 at the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, where he spent two years an elementary school teacher. In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the North Star School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at North Star until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville-Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his {{three years in the}} district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director. In 1992, he returned to the North Star School District as a principal and strategic planning coordinator. Zahorchak also previously served as an elected member of the Greater Johnstown School Board, and was a Johnstown city councilman, the Johnston deputy major and president of the Johnstown Rotary in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1080s, the {{majority}} of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background; afterwards, intraregional patterns of drafting officials became more common. Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song, the shift of power from central to regional administrations, the localized interests of the new gentry, the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations, and the uncertainties of a successful political career in the factionally split capital led many civil servants to choose positions {{that would allow them}} to remain in specific regions. Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long-distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song, as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects. It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068–1085) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing a quantity of officials in <b>policy-making</b> posts that were proportionate to their share of China's total population. From 1125 to 1205, about 80% of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low-grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Almost 100% of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1450s, {{a great deal}} of the {{legislative}} business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Before the sixteenth century, parliamentary business was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including the General Council and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and <b>policy-making,</b> but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{resilience}} and the thresholds by which resilience is defined are closely interrelated {{in the way}} that they influence environmental <b>policy-making,</b> legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental <b>policy-making</b> and ensuing legislation.|$|E
