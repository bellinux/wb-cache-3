[...] A [...] "joint effort between General Motors, the three dealer associations, and a number of individual dealers" [...] was organized to police compliance. GM local officials confronted reoffenders and required them to repurchase cars sold in violation of policy.

[...] The Court held that the FTC could find a violation of FTC Act § 5 where a practice [...] "had a [...] "dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or create monopoly." [...] The company sought to defend under Colgate, but the Court said that [...] "the Beech-Nut system goes for beyond the simple refusal to sell goods to persons who will not sell at stated prices, which, in the Colgate case, was held to be within the legal right of the producer."

5000|$|... "The {{history of}} the Colgate {{doctrine}} is best understood," [...] the Court said, [...] "by reference to a case which preceded the Colgate decision, Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co. In that case, Dr. Miles entered into contracts with wholesale and retail merchants that required them to resell a medicine at prices that Miles fixed. Park refused to sign the contracts, induced customers of Miles to resell to Park, and then Park sold the medicines at cut prices in violation of Miles's resale-price maintenance program. Miles sued Park for inducing Miles's customers to breach their contracts with him. Citing Coke on Littleton, § 360 and Mitchel v Reynolds, the Court held the restrictive agreements that Miles sought to enforce were invalid at common law and under the Sherman Act as well. In the Colgate case, however, there was no agreement, just a refusal to deal with <b>price</b> <b>cutters.</b> [...] "The Colgate decision distinguished Dr. Miles {{on the ground that}} the Colgate indictment did not charge that company with selling its products to dealers under agreements which obligated the latter not to resell except at prices fixed by the seller.|$|R
