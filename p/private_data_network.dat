40|$|Abstract—A virtual {{private network}} (VPN) is a <b>private</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> that carries traffic between remote sites. One {{of the most popular}} VPN {{applications}} is the “Intranet/Extranet VPN”, which establishes network layer connections between remote intranet sites, using various tunneling protocols, to create an IP overlay network. IPSec, which is very prevalent in industry, is one of these tunneling protocols that not only provide encapsulation/decapsulation but encryption/decryption and hashing. However, an IPSec tunnel often fails to be established due to the management complexity. This work proposes the new concept of authority to alleviate the management overhead by reducing the number of tunnels. The problem of tunnel minimization is first formalized under three conditions- no constraint, a Tunnel Path Length constraint and a Tunnel Relay Degree constraint, and then solved using graphical models and the Zero-One Integer Programming algorithm. The effect of tunnel minimization is also investigated, and at most 90 % of the tunnels are found to be reducible in a general enterprise VPN.

40|$|Abstract: The Internet has {{graduated}} from simple sharing of e-mail to business-critical applications that involve incredible amounts of private information. The {{need to protect}} sensitive data over an entrusted medium {{has led to the}} creation of Virtual Private Networks (VPN). VPNs allow corporations of all sizes to move away from expensive and static private line facilities to the flexible Internet. A Virtual Private Network is the extension of private network that encompasses links across shared or public networks like the Internet. With VPN data can be sent between two computers across shared or public network that emulates a pointto-point link. Packets that are sent using VPN if intercepted on the shared or public network are indecipherable without the encryption keys. A VPN is a <b>private</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> that makes use of public telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy through the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures.

40|$|People and {{machines}} are collecting data at an unprecedented rate. Despite this newfound abundance of data, {{progress has been}} slow in sharing it for open science, business, and other data-intensive endeavors. Many such efforts are stymied by privacy concerns and regulatory compliance issues. For example, many hospitals are interested in pooling their medical records for research, but none may disclose arbitrary patient records to researchers or other healthcare providers. In this context we propose the <b>Private</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Network</b> (PDN), a federated database for querying over the collective data of mutually distrustful parties. In a PDN, each member database does not reveal its tuples to its peers nor to the query writer. Instead, the user submits a query to an honest broker that plans and coordinates its execution over multiple private databases using secure multiparty computation (SMC). Here, each database's query execution is oblivious, and its program counters and memory traces are agnostic to the inputs of others. We introduce a framework for executing PDN queries named SMCQL. This system translates SQL statements into SMC primitives to compute query results over the union of its source databases without revealing sensitive information about individual tuples to peer data providers or the honest broker. Only the honest broker and the querier receive {{the results of a}} PDN query. For fast, secure query evaluation, we explore a heuristics-driven optimizer that minimizes the PDN's use of secure computation and partitions its query evaluation into scalable slices...|$|E

The first wave of global outsourcing began in the 1960 s and 1970 s with the exodus of production jobs in shoes, clothing, cheap electronics, and toys.

Depending on the HE scheme, various functionalities can be evaluated in the encrypted domain, ranging from additions or multiplications only (Group Homomorphic Encryption, GHE), to virtually any computable functionality (Fully Homomorphic Encryption, FHE). We provide a clean foundational framework for HE that permits security characterizations for a large class of HE schemes and shows strong similarities between GHE and FHE. We study these characterizations in order to assess the limits of HE, and show that GHE is obsolete in the quantum world, meaning that any GHE scheme can be broken by a quantum computer. Together with our newly constructed universal blueprint that encompasses virtually any GHE scheme, we know exactly how these schemes must be designed and what the underlying hardness assumptions must look like. To some extent, this rounds off the topic of GHE both in the standard and quantum model of computation. In the standard model (which is presently assumed to be the most realistic model of computation), GHE is still highly attractive as it provides very efficient solutions to a variety of practical problems. On the basis of our foundational framework, we construct new GHE schemes with unique features and show their employability in practical applications. Most importantly, we use the special features of one of these schemes and develop a novel technique to achieve a practically efficient {{solution to the problem of}} securely outsourcing computations.
