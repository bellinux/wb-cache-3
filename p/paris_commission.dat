After a survey of the quantity of TBT used in antifouling paints for ships and the emissions in the marine environment, this article reviews the study on TBT in sediments and mussels along the Belgian coast and in the marine harbours and the imposex-survey with the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus. The results show that the concentration of TBT in the sediments of the Belgian harbours (especially Zeebrugge) are high and contrast with the lower concentration measured in the open sea. The imposex-survey confirms these higher concentrations. As a follow-up of the regulations of the <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission</b> and the CEE a new legislation for the use of organotin containing paints on ships smaller than 25 meters is in force in Belgium.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{contains}} {{general information}} on chlorinated paraffins (CPs) concerning the existing standards, emissions, exposure levels and effect levels. The document {{is to be}} considered as a start for the national discussion during an exploratory meeting on integrated criteria documents and serves internationally as a background document for the working group on diffuse sources of the <b>Paris</b> <b>commission</b> (PARCOM). In the Netherlands no production of CPs takes place. No emission data are available, but the major emissions are likely to occur through use and disposal of products containing CPs. CPs are rather persistent in the environment. Bioconcentration occurs, short-chain CPs {{with a high level of}} chlorination showing the highest potential. Biomagnification, however, is not to be expected. Toxicologically shorter chain CPs are the most important ones. Animalstudies indicate that these CPs may have carcinogenic potential but are non-genotoxic. A tolerable daily intake of 0. 01 mg/kg bw/day at life-time exposure for humans was calculated. For ecosystems provisionally maximum permissible concentrations of 1 mug/l and 50 mg/kg were derived for surface water and sediment/soil, respectively. The exposure levels in the Netherlands are expected not to exceed these levels...|$|E

Since, with the exception of mercury, there are no currently applicable European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values for human consumption, as compiled by the Oslo and <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR) countries. As in previous years, the water quality from shellfish growing areas was good and conformed to the guidelines and requirements of the Directive. Petroleum hydrocarbons were not observed in any of the shellfish waters or as deposits on the shellfish. Chlorinated hydrocarbon levels were very low, evidence of the clean, unpolluted nature of Irish shellfish and shellfish producing waters. Trace metal levels were consistently low with the exception of cadmium in oyster tissue, which was slightly elevated in the 1999 samples from Clew Bay, Inner Tralee Bay, Aughinish Limerick and Kilkieran. However these levels did not exceed the Dutch human consumption standard value or the EU maximum limit of 1. 0 mg/kg wet weight due to apply from 2002.

40|$|Annual {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus budgets for the whole North Sea {{taking into account the}} most recent data available were established. The area considered has a total surface of approximately 700, 000 km 2 and corresponds to the definition by OSPARCOM (Oslo and <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission)</b> with the exclusion of the Skagerrak and Kattegat areas. Input and output fluxes were determined at the marine, atmospheric, sediment and continental boundaries, and riverine inputs based on river flows and nutrient concentrations at the river–estuary interface were corrected for possible estuarine retention. The results showed that the North Sea is an extremely complex system subjected to large inter-annual variability of marine water circulation and freshwater land run-off. Consequently, resulting total N (TN) and P (TP) fluxes are extremely variable from 1 year to another and this has an important influence on the budget of these elements. Total inputs to the North Sea are 8870 ± 4860 kT N year – 1 and 494 ± 279 kT P year – 1. Denitrification is responsible for the loss of 23 ± 7 % of the TN inputs while sediment burial is responsible for the retention of only of 2 ± 2 % of the TP input. For TN, due to the large variability on marine and estuarine fluxes, and to the uncertainty related to the denitrification rate, it was concluded that the North Sea could either be a source (1930 kT N year – 1) or a sink (1700 kT N year – 1) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. For TP it was concluded that the North Sea is mostly a source (– 4 to 52 kT P year – 1) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean...|$|E

40|$|Conceptual {{models are}} derived to {{indicate}} the signs and symptoms inherent in nutrient changes to brackish, estuarine and coastal areas of restricted circulation. These give a structured approach to detecting adverse symptoms of hypernutrification and eutrophication {{at all levels of}} biological organisation, from effects at cellular levels to the ecosystem approach. The conceptual models illustrate the bottom-up approaches to the detection and control of potential problems and the importance of top-down responses. The bottom-up approaches incorporate mechanisms with regard to inputs, retention of nutrients, biogeochemical cycling and the primary production response. The top-down approaches include the detection of responses in high-profile components of the marine system, such as fisheries, sea mammals and wading birds and seabirds, which are often of paramount socio-economic or conservation importance. The management of the above causes and consequences, and following from the adoption by signatories to proposals given by the <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission</b> (PARCOM), can be accomplished by the derivation of Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO) and Ecological Quality Standards (EcoQS). These are given here as a development from the Environmental Quality Objectives and Standards (EQO/EQS) approach. Such EcoQO and EcoQS are regarded as as an aid to monitoring and management of estuaries and coastal waters. That management includes recent proposals within European legislation aimed at monitoring and managing the health and integrity of coasts and estuaries, for example the implementation of the Nitrates, Species & Habitats, and Water Framework Directives. The paper, therefore, discusses both {{the quality and quantity of}} data involved in the science required by managers and the way ahead for assessing and managing the fate and effects of nutrients. Using European and U. S. examples, the paper introduces the major challenge of how the concerns highlighted can be addressed by policy action...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with the monitoring requirements of the 1979 Council Directive 79 / 923 /EC {{on the quality of}} shellfish waters, water and shellfish samples were collected from 22 major shellfish growing areas and analysed for physicochemical parameters, trace metal levels and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations. Fin-fish were also collected from five Irish fishing ports and analysed for total mercury content in compliance with the European Commission's Decision of 19 May 1993 on mercury in fisheries products. Selected samples of fin-fish were also analysed for trace metal and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration. As there are no generally accepted European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish or fin-fish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values compiled by the Oslo and <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR) countries for human consumption. As in previous years, the water quality from shellfish growing areas was good and conformed to the guidelines and requirements of the Directive. Petroleum hydrocarbons were not observed in any of the shellfish waters or as deposits on the shellfish. Chlorinated hydrocarbon levels were very low, evidence of the clean, unpolluted nature of Irish shellfish and shellfish producing waters. Trace metal levels were consistently low with the exception of lead in mussel tissue from Wexford Harbour, which was elevated, and cadmium in oyster tissue, which was slightly elevated in some samples but did not exceed the Dutch human consumption tolerance value of 1. 0 mg kg- 1. The concentration of mercury in fin-fish selected from catches at Irish fishing ports ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 27 µg g- 1 wet weight. These levels were well within the maximum limits set down in the EC Decision for mercury in fisheries products. Chlorinated hydrocarbon and trace metal levels were also very low in fish tissue. This survey confirms previous studies that show Irish fishery products are effectively free from trace metal and chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The normal operation of the endocrine (hormonal) system can be disrupted {{by a number of}} man-made and naturally-occurring chemicals, thereby affecting those physiological processes that are under hormonal control. Such substances are called endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The endocrine disruption issue has alarmed the environmental authorities since the substances involved can hinder hormonal processes causing far-reaching effects on reproduction and development in current and future human and wildlife generations. Effects on some species of fish triggered worldwide concern and initiated a research scheme which is being undertaken by various organisations e. g. United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United Kingdom Environment Agency (UKEA), Oslo and <b>Paris</b> <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR), Japan Environment Agency (JEA) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in order to assess the effects (present and potential), point of generation, levels of contamination and exposure limits. The findings showed that most of the oestrogens are produced by humans and animals and get discharged into river streams mainly through sewage effluents. Fish in particular {{have been found to be}} affected the most even when the oestrogenic levels in water are very low. The probability of future European legislation to eliminate hormonally active compounds from wastewaters suggests that new and alternative methods should be developed for their removal. In this work, the adsorption of 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2) and 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol (EE 2) onto several granular activated carbons and Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers was investigated by batch experiments after a low level detection system had been developed using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Equilibrium experiments were carried out for all adsorbents to quantify the sorption capacity for E 2 and EE 2. For better assessment of the sorbents performance, their physical properties such as surface area, average pore diameter and micropore volume and chemical structure were characterised by N 2 adsorption experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, sodium capacity determination, pH titration, proton binding curves and zeta potential measurements. Adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. Activated carbons were found to be preferable to Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers for adsorption purposes. The adsorption of oestrogens appears to be controlled by hydrophobic interactions. Kinetic experiments were performed with different size ranges of adsorbents at different concentrations and the results were analysed by a particle diffusion model. It was found that concentration did not seem to influence the kinetics of the oestrogen sorption whereas the particle size of the adsorbents influenced the adsorption rate of both molecules. The particle diffusion model seemed to fit the data collected for the adsorption rate of 17 B-oestradiool onto the adsorbents but gave a poor fit for most of the data collected for 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol...|$|E
