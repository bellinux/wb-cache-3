The authors have evaluated the microbial contamination of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes used by medical and paramedical staff. They reported that 100 % of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes studied by their team showed bacterial contamination. Based on their findings, Daoudi et al. suggested that medical staff should wash their hands with care and use hydro-alcoholic solutions after using mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes...|$|R

40|$|Mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes used in {{neonatology}} units {{could be}} colonized by potentiel bacteria pathogens. It {{can be a}} vector of severe nosocomial infections and multi-drug-resistant pathogens. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the microbial contamination of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes, used by medical and paramedical staff. The study was conducted in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Mohamed VI University Hospital, Marrakech (Morocco) in April 2016. The bacteriological study was made on 17 mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> 13 stethoscopes. Samples were taken from all surfaces of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes, with a sterile swab. Bacterial contamination rate of all mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes was 100 %. The cultures of bacteria isolated were polymorphic. Among the bacteria isolated, six multi-resistant bacterial strains were isolated at the mobile phones (35 %), corresponding to 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 strains of E. coli. A strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae multidrug-resistant (7. 7 %) was found on a stethoscope. This study shows that mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes could be involoved in the transmission of severe nosocomial infections, with multidrug-resistance. As part of the prevention of such risks, we must educate the medical staff, users of mobile phones on the importance of hand washing and use of hydro-alcoholic solutions after each use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> stethoscopes...|$|R
40|$|Smart <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> tablet {{computers}} {{are becoming increasingly}} ubiquitous and powerful. They can serve as replacements for currently used input devices, and provide novel functionality not achieved with traditional devices. Furthermore, their ubiquity ensures that they scale well to multi-user environments, where users can use their own devices. Several attempts have already been made to use smart <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> tablets as input devices, but all of these have been one-shot and problem-specific. We present an applicationindependent way to integrate smart <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> tablets into existing systems, using a rapid development process. This approach is based on Marking Menus, but extends the basic idea by employing the special capabilities of current consumerlevel smart <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> tablets...|$|R
