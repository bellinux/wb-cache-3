50|$|Value at Risk (VaR) is {{a measure}} of the risk of investments. It {{estimates}} how much a set of investments might lose, given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a <b>day.</b> <b>VaR</b> is typically used by firms and regulators in the financial industry to gauge the amount of assets needed to cover possible losses.|$|R

50|$|The same trim {{settings}} {{had been}} used as on the <b>previous</b> <b>day,</b> but as there was fresh water flowing into the harbour, the water was less dense and so the submarine was less buoyant than on the <b>previous</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
40|$|Records of {{yield and}} {{breeding}} information for cows {{in the northeast}} part of the United States were analyzed to investigate the influence of days open present lactation, <b>days</b> open <b>previous</b> lactation, and <b>days</b> dry <b>previous</b> lactation on measures of lactation yield. Measures of yield were fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat all adjusted to a 305 -day, mature-equivalent basis. Analyses were conducted on first parity records (84, 356), first and second parities records (140, 233) and first, second, and third parities records (174, 251). The effects of <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open, <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and present days open were fit simultaneously. Best Linear Unbiased Estimate solutions were obtained;As present days open increased from 20 to 300 days open, lactation yields for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat increased approximately 1250, 1350, and 45 kg. As <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open increased from 20 to 300 days open, lactation yields for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat increased approximately 625, 650, and 25 kg. Cows dry 60 to 69 days gave the most milk the following lactation. Cows dry 40 days or less produced much less the next lactation. All three measures of yield responded similarly {{to the effects of}} <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> open, <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry, and present days open;Multiparity analyses were conducted using a model where later parity records could be compared with more unselected first parity records. Adding additional parity information using this model made little difference in how cows responded to <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open;Heritability estimates for <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry were approximately six per cent. Days dry were largely determined by environmental influences. Since heritability estimates for <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open are also quite small, adjusting lactation yield records for <b>previous</b> <b>days</b> dry and <b>previous</b> and present <b>days</b> open is warranted;Multiplicative adjustment factors were developed for fat-corrected milk, milk, and milkfat. Adjustment factors could have a large impact on genetic cow evaluations which currently do not adjust for the largely environmental effects of days open and days dry...|$|R
