The French Minorite friar Alexander de Villa Dei, who taught in Paris around 1240, mentions {{the name of an}} Indian king named Algor as the inventor of the new ‘art’, which itself is called the algorismus.

25|$|The value, or number, zero is not {{the same}} as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using <b>positional</b> <b>notation.</b> Successive {{positions}} of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits.

25|$|The decimal Hindu–Arabic {{numeral system}} was {{developed}} in India by around AD 700. The development was gradual, spanning several centuries, but the decisive step was probably provided by Brahmagupta's formulation of zero as a number in AD 628. The system was revolutionary by including zero in <b>positional</b> <b>notation,</b> thereby {{limiting the number of}} individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics.

40|$|Several {{methods to}} perform exact {{computations}} on real {{numbers have been}} proposed in the literature. In some of these methods real numbers are represented by infinite (lazy) strings of digits. It is a well known fact that, when this approach is taken, the standard digit notation cannot be used. New forms of digit notations are necessary. The usual solution to this representation problem consists in adding new digits in the notation, quite often negative digits. In this article we present an alternative solution. It consists in using non natural numbers as "base", that is, in using a <b>positional</b> digit <b>notation</b> where the ratio between the weight of two consecutive digits {{is not necessarily a}} natural number, as in the standard case, but it can be a rational or even an irrational number.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} some counterexamples to Cantor's {{contributions to the}} foundations of Set Theory. The first counterexample forces Cantor's Diagonal Method (DM) to yield one of the numbers in the target list. To study this anomaly, and given that for the DM to work the list of numbers have to be written down, the set of numbers that can be represented using <b>positional</b> fractional <b>notation,</b> W, is properly characterized. It is then shown that W is not isomorphic to R, meaning that results obtained from {{the application of the}} DM to W in order to derive properties of R are not valid. It is then shown that Cantor's DM for a generic list of reals can be forced to yield one of the numbers of the list, thus invalidating Cantor's result that infers the non-denumerability of R from the application of the DM to W. Cantor's Theorem about the different cardinalities of a set and its power set is then questioned, and by means of another counterexample we show that the theorem does not actually hold for infinite sets. After analyzing all these results, it is shown that the current notion of cardinality for infinite sets does not depend {{on the size of the}} sets, but rather on the representation chosen for them. Following this line of thought, the concept of model as a framework for the construction of the representation of a set is introduced, and a theorem showing that an infinite set can be well-ordered if there is a proper model for it is proven. To reiterate that the cardinality of a set does not determine whether the set can be well-ordered, a set of cardinality ℵ_ 0 ^ℵ_ 0 is proven to be equipollent to the set of natural numbers N. The paper concludes with an analysis of the cardinality of the ordinal numbers, for which a representation of cardinality ℵ_ 0 ^ℵ_ 0 is proposed. Comment: 30 pages, 9 tables, 2 figure...|$|R

This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians.

It is a complicated question to determine exactly when the Chinese started calculating with positional representation, but it was definitely before 400BC.
