5|$|Although G.glutinosum was <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> to have {{occurred}} in Australia and New Zealand, later examination and genetic analysis of collections from these locations showed the material to belong to what have since {{been described as the}} new species G.australasicum or G.exiguum.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{research}} in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey {{confirmed that the}} separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> Some biologists believe that these {{should be regarded as}} separate subspecies and that they are evolving independently.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> {{having a}} crustal {{abundance}} {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, twice that of arsenic, and three times that of tin. Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.|$|E

25|$|Although it has <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> that {{morphine}} was contraindicated {{in acute}} pancreatitis, {{a review of}} the literature shows no evidence for this.|$|R
50|$|A nearby peak called Halgurd, at , {{is thought}} to be 3,607 metres high, and had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to be Iraq's highest mountain.|$|R
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} found some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{observations}} {{argue against}} traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, {{and open up}} the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration {{and what they do}} at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were next, {{passing by}} Ganymede in 1979. They refined its size, {{revealing}} it {{was larger than}} Saturn's moon Titan, which was <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> to have been bigger. The grooved terrain was also seen.|$|E
5000|$|Although it has <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> that {{morphine}} was contraindicated {{in acute}} pancreatitis, {{a review of}} the literature shows no evidence for this.|$|R
50|$|This type of empathetic {{behavior}} has <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to only occur in animals with advanced cognition, such as humans, apes, and elephants.|$|R
2500|$|There is only weak {{evidence}} that omega-3 benefits cardiovascular health, and although omega-3 has <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> useful for helping alleviate dementia, [...] {{there is no}} good evidence of effectiveness.|$|R
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda {{might not be as}} weakened as <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
50|$|She was lost, {{probably}} in the Ligurian Sea (north of Corsica), on 6 April 1944. Her wreck was discovered in 2005, off Genoa. She had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to be near La Spezia.|$|R
50|$|The name Fundulopanchax is {{composed}} {{of the names of}} two other genera of killifish, Fundulus Lacépède (1803) and Panchax Valenciennes (1846), which were <b>previously</b> wrongly <b>thought</b> to be closely related to each other.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{measurements}} done in {{the early}} 2000s, Žut is also the largest uninhabited island in Croatia, being almost [...] larger than Prvić near Krk, which had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to hold this distinction.|$|R
5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this theory {{on a new}} reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> The new reading, which would identify the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković, who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
50|$|A Romano-British villa was {{excavated}} by the antiquarian Richard Fenton, {{hinting that}} Roman influence extended further west than had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought.</b> It {{has been subjected}} to a recent investigation to ascertain its exact location.|$|R
50|$|The trabecular {{meshwork}} had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> {{to arise}} {{from a point}} (apex) corresponding to the termination of the DM(Schwalbe’s line) however it is now considered to extend into the cornea, forming the Dua's layer.|$|R
50|$|All these {{examples}} predate several 75,000-year-old Nassarius kraussianus beads which {{were found at}} Blombos Cave, South Africa (including some colored with red ochre). These beads had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to be the oldest examples of jewelry.|$|R
5|$|Earth-based {{observations}} {{announced in}} 2005 appeared {{to show that}} Neptune's rings are much more unstable than <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, {{it seems that the}} Liberté arc might disappear in as little as one century.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the family}} Turridae {{has been much}} reduced in size, because {{a number of other}} {{families}} were created to contain the monophyletic lineages that had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> to belong in the same family.|$|R
50|$|At {{first the}} Earth-human {{population}} dwindled. Then {{they formed a}} close alliance {{with one of the}} native tribes and also found that they could interbreed, which had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> impossible. On this basis, they recover and unify the world.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Gould {{established}} that the National Gallery’s Portrait of Pope Julius II was the prime version by Raphael and not a copy, as had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought.</b> He was also responsible for a new attribution of a work to Michelangelo.|$|R
5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be much higher than <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E
50|$|Later, Blair {{realized}} that Spencer was indeed behind the framing of Todd. She helped the Llanview police by getting proof that Spencer may have killed John's father, not David, as had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought.</b> He {{was arrested and}} put on trial.|$|R
50|$|Some {{contemporary}} scholarship also {{attributes to}} him the authorship of the anonymous pamphlet Ancient Bounds from 1645, a major work of the period on freedom of conscience; this had <b>previously</b> been <b>thought</b> {{to be from the}} pen of Francis Rous.|$|R
25|$|GAPDH can itself {{activate}} transcription. The OCA-S transcriptional coactivator complex contains GAPDH and lactate dehydrogenase, two proteins <b>previously</b> only <b>thought</b> to {{be involved}} in metabolism. GAPDH moves between the cytosol and the nucleus and may thus link the metabolic state to gene transcription.|$|R
