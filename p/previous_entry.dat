5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the <b>previous</b> <b>entry</b> in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E
25|$|World at War was {{announced}} on June 23, 2008, by Activision, who {{confirmed that the}} game was {{to be released in}} fall 2008, and that the series would revert to its customary World War II setting.

The game is powered by a better version of the , with several improvements made to the physics model. Environments are more destructible and can be set on fire with the flamethrower, whose fire propagates. Dismemberment, as well as realistic skin and clothes burning of the characters were added.|$|E

In contrast to the series <b>previous</b> <b>entry,</b> Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom video game franchises, rather than strictly Street Fighter characters. While the gameplay is largely identical to its predecessor, Clash of Super Heroes features two distinct changes: {{the removal of the}} traditional character assist system and the introduction of the [...] "Variable Cross" [...] attack.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{presentation}} was well received. Nathan Meunier of GameSpot called the graphics {{arguably the best}} of the series, praising the detail put into recreating each level; this statement was echoed by Tim Turi of Game Informer. Jack DeVries and Brian Altano of IGN offered similar praise for the visuals, and described its remixed tracks as [...] "cool" [...] and its sound effects as [...] "spot on". Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer felt Sonic Generations was a worthy tribute to the Sonic franchise, though he still considered the franchise's <b>previous</b> <b>entry,</b> Sonic Colors, to be better.|$|E

This episode, as well as the one that proceeds it, plays around with questions concerning traditional religion and faith.

500|$|... : The main protagonist—she is {{unrelated}} to any <b>previous</b> <b>entry</b> in the Blood franchise aside {{from her first}} name, chosen weapon and abilities. Outwardly, Saya is an innocent and clumsy girl who acts as the shrine maiden at her father's shrine, going out at night to hunt Elder Bairns {{as part of a}} sworn duty. In reality, she is an Elder Bairn who was abandoned and raised by humans. Due to an oath she swore, she is unable to feed on humans herself, and the experiment was designed to see if her nature could be altered. Saya is voiced by Nana Mizuki in Japanese. Mizuki described Saya as she is portrayed in the anime as an easy-going girl who enjoys her school life and shares a strong bond with Tadayoshi.

Nintendojo's Desmond Gaben gave Thracia 776 a score of 9.9/10 in his review: he praised the graphics as some of the best on the system, generally approved of the gameplay improvements despite its high difficulty, and called it a [...] "must-have" [...] for fans of the genre.

500|$|The game's {{main hub}} is a realm called White Space, which the player can explore, {{converse}} with other characters, and access the game's nine levels, {{each of which}} are derived from a <b>previous</b> <b>entry</b> in the series. The levels are split into three separate eras: the Classic Era (focusing on levels from games for the Sega Genesis); the Dreamcast Era (focusing on levels from games for the Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2); and the Modern Era (focusing on levels from games for the Wii, Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3). Each level consists of two acts (one for each Sonic), and ten additional missions such as collecting {{a certain amount of}} rings or completing a level with the help of another character. Upon reaching the end of the level, players are given a grade based on their performance, with an [...] "S" [...] rank being the best and a [...] "D" [...] rank the worst. After completing an era, players must defeat two bosses: a [...] "rival" [...] character and a main boss. Defeating each boss gives the player a Chaos Emerald, and once the game has been completed, both Sonics can transform into their super forms by collecting 50 rings in a normal level.|$|E
500|$|Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood {{sought to}} make Jason more of a [...] "classic monster {{along the lines of}} Frankenstein." [...] From the beginning, Buechler tried to tie the {{previous}} films together by having Jason's appearance reflect that of the damage he received in the previous installments. Buechler wanted the motor boat damage from Jason Lives, and the axe and machete cuts Jason received in Part 3 and Part 4 to part of the design for The New Blood. Since Jason had been submerged under water in the <b>previous</b> <b>entry,</b> the effects team wanted Jason to appear [...] "rotted", with bones and ribs showing, and for Jason's features to have a more defined feel to them. Howard Berger was inspired by Carl Fullerton's design in The New Blood, and wanted to incorporate the exposed flesh concept into his model for Jason Goes to Hell. Berger designed Jason's skin to overlap with the mask, to make it appear as if the skin and mask had fused and the mask could no longer be removed. Gregory Nicotero and Berger sculpted a full-body, foam latex suit for Kane Hodder to wear under the costume. The idea was to reveal as much of Jason's skin as possible, because Nicotero and Berger knew the physical character would not be seen for most of the film.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a non-downloadable album track, {{the song}} {{appeared}} on many charts due to radio play alone. Gary Trust of Billboard acknowledged that without [...] "This Is It" [...] having a digital (distribution) component its chances on making {{an impact on}} the Billboard Hot 100 would not be likely. During the week ending October 21, 2009, [...] "This Is It" [...] debuted at number 19 on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. [...] "This Is It" [...] returned Jackson and his brothers to the chart {{for the first time since}} 1970, when, billed as The Jackson 5, the group marked its sole <b>previous</b> <b>entry,</b> [...] "I'll Be There," [...] which went on to peak on the chart at number 24. Its charting ended a 13-year, seven-month absence Jackson had from the chart; his prior entry was [...] "You Are Not Alone," [...] which wrapped a 26-week run on the list dated March 16, 1996. This song is also Jackson's 26th charted Adult Contemporary title, making him the seventh male artist to score a top 20 Adult Contemporary single in each decade since the 1970s. Eventually, the track peaked at number 18 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Also in [...] "This Is It"'s first week of release, the song debuted on Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs Chart at number 43.

500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] <b>previous</b> <b>entry</b> in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E
