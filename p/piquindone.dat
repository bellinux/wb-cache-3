50|$|<b>Piquindone</b> (Ro 22-1319) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic with a tricyclic {{structure that}} {{was developed in the}} 1980s but was never marketed. It acts as a selective D2 receptor antagonist, though based on its effects profile its selectivity may be considered controversial. Unlike most other D2 receptor ligands, <b>piquindone</b> displays Na2+-dependent binding, a property it shares with tropapride, zetidoline, and metoclopramide.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials <b>piquindone</b> {{was found to}} possess moderate efficacy in treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and notably, was also modestly effective for negative symptoms, though this was just under statistical significance. Additionally, relative to haloperidol, it was found to possesses significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and had a much lower propensity for inducing tardive dyskinesia, indicating its atypical nature. In addition to psychosis, <b>piquindone</b> has also {{been found to be}} effective in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome in numerous clinical studies.|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of experimental and theoretical methods {{were used to}} investigate the stereoelectronic structure of zetidoline, a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist showing Na+-dependent binding. The solid-state conformation of zetidoline is characterized by synplanarity (coplanarity of the two rings with the chloro substituent and the carbonyl group on the same side). The side chain in the crystal adopts a folded conformation which places the azetidine nitrogen atom at about 8 A {{from the center of}} the aromatic ring. Quantum mechanical calculations indicate the synperiplanar and antiperiplanar conformations of the ring system to be of approximately equal energies. The molecular electrostatic potential of zetidoline in a nearly extended conformation shows a remarkable similarity with that of orthopramides (e. g. metoclopramide) and indolones (e. g. <b>piquindone),</b> i. e. two groups of drugs displaying the same D 2 selectivity and Na+-dependent binding. We postulate that the close stereoelectronic similarity between zetidoline, orthopramides, and indolones accounts for their identical mechanism of action in the molecular level...|$|E
