5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>variability</b> seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

The appearance of microbial biofilm in clinical settings is steadily increasing due to several reasons including the increased use of quality of life-improving artificial devices. In contrast to infections caused by planktonic bacteria that respond relatively well to standard antibiotic therapy, biofilm-forming bacteria tend to cause chronic infections whereby infections persist despite seemingly adequate antibiotic therapy. This review briefly describes the responses of biofilm matrix components and biofilm-associated bacteria towards sub-lethal concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which may include the generation of genetic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>variabilities.</b> Clinical implications of bacterial biofilms in relation to antibiotic treatments are also discussed...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{experiments}} on the mutation of RUNX 2 {{have been carried}} out, and the opinions on the correlation of the mutation of the RUNX 2 gene and the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>variabilities</b> are still controversial. Quack et al. said {{that there is no}} difference between the phenotypes of missense, deletion, insertion, and frameshift mutation, but only haploinsufficiency is caused by the mutations [17]. The truncated protein which resulted from the mutated gene may be unstable in intracellular environment and can be degraded rapidly [18]. Thus, different intracellular concentration levels of the RUNX 2 protein can affect the manifestations of the disease. Yoshida et al. suggested that if the runt domain is intact, the mild short stature is observed and that there is also a significant correlation between short stature and number of supernumerary teeth from gene analysis of 17 patients with CCD [19]. He also confirmed hypoplasia of the clavicle and open frontanelle from all of his patients. He mentioned that cleidocranial bone formation by intramembranous ossification requires a higher level of RUNX 2 gene compared to skeletal bone formation by endochondral ossification and the tooth formation by odontogenesis.|$|R

The {{genetics}} {{consist of a}} mix of amelonado, trinitario and selected hybrids. This mix of varieties generates high <b>phenotypic</b> <b>variabilities,</b> including variability in tree productivity, within cacao populations in both smallholder and industrial plantations. Tree-to-tree variability in yield {{has been reported in}} cacao breeding trials under different environmental conditions. However, it has never been considered a limiting factor for agronomical performance of seedling-based cacao plantations. Around 10 000 cacao trees from seven plots under different environmental conditions in a cacao plantation in Côte d'Ivoire were monitored for 2 years. Pod production of individual trees was recorded and annual average tree pod yields were assessed. High heterogeneity in cacao-tree yields was observed in all plots, with coefficients of variation ranging from 56 to 102 %. The distribution of cacao-tree yields in each plot was positively skewed. Analysis of these distributions showed that unproductive trees represented a significant proportion of cacao tree populations (7 %), and the 20 % least productive trees accounted for 3 % of production. The 20 % most productive trees were responsible for 46 % of the total pod production of a plot. This heterogeneity reflects a major imbalance in the agronomical performances of low- and high-yielding trees and also represents possible efficiency gaps in seedling-based cacao plantations, which could be overcome through innovative corrective strategies, opening new pathways for improvement of cacao-based cropping systems.

Two monozygotic female twins had the same IRF6 mutation; however Twin A {{was born with a}} bilateral cleft lip, whereas Twin B had bilateral lip pits and no orofacial clefting. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. The twins' father had lip pits alone and a family history of CLP, CP, CL, and/or lip pits. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was done for all exons of IRF6, and a missense mutation was discovered in exon 4.

In 1979, four OI phenotypes were categorized which were inherited as autosomal dominant characteristics. Individuals with OI present both genetic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>variabilities.</b> Major characteristics of OI are bone fragility, blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, short stature, scoliosis, and joint hyperextensibility. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance are now recognized. Advances in molecular diagnosis {{have led to a}} major expansion in our understanding of the genetic basis for different OI phenotypes. To date, sequence variants in 17 genes are described as causative of OI. These genes regulate the synthesis of type I collagen pro-alpha polypeptide chains, proteins involved in type I collagen processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and proteins involved in osteoblast function. These new genetic associations have also led to uncertainty with regard to the current classification of OI phenotypes. Bisphosphonates have been widely used to improve bone mass and decrease fractures in both children and adults with OI. While effective in many but not all children when administered for 2 – 4 years, bisphosphonates have not proven effective in adults with OI. Studies are limited for treatment of adults with teriparatide and denosumab. Advances {{have been reported in the}} surgical management of OI. Although the role of physical therapy in the management of children and adults was previously described, this important treatment modality is significantly underutilized.
