40|$|SUMMARY Much of {{the recent}} {{controversy}} surrounding the relation between fetal death and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> has centred around the appropriateness {{of different types of}} analyses. In the present paper the interpretation of various methods are discussed with reference to "real " and "hypothetical " data. The pattern of results obtained when the fetal loss rates of a group of pregnancies are tabulated by <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> was found to depend on the risk and parity distributions of the study population. These two parameters did not, however, appear to affect the within "sibship " or "gravidity " group patterns. These findings support the hypothesis that the frequently observed increase in fetal death rates in pregnancy orders above two could be largely artifactual. It is concluded that in any investigation of reproductive events women, and not their pregnancies, should form the prime unit of analyses. The nature of the relation between fetal loss and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> has long been the subject of debate. Much of the controversy has concerned the suitability and interpretation of different methods of study and analyses...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} several family and {{embryonic}} factors {{on the abortion}} pattern in a rural Mediterranean population (La Alta Alpujarra Oriental, Southeast Spain) were analyzed from interview data on 3163 pregnancies from {{the first half of}} the twentieth century. No significant differences in spontaneous abortion rates were detected between endogamous and exogamous couples. The abortion pattern of this population is characterized mainly by family and embryonic factors. High rates of early abortions were significantly associated with maternal age and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> and parental consanguinity was linked with a notable decrease of abortion frequency during the earlier stages of pregnancy. A tendency toward a higher risk for abortion was also confirmed for twinship of the fetus. The interactions identified between abortion risk and maternal age, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> and inbreeding emphasize the important contribution of sociodemographic factors to prereproductive mortality in human populations...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the reproductive history of 3068 women doctors showed {{that the risk of}} fetal loss at a given <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> varied with their gravidity [...] that is, the total number of pregnancies that has occurred before the survey. Fetal loss rates in even the first pregnancy varied with eventual gravidity in a J-shaped manner. They fell from 12. 4 % in women with only one pregnancy {{at the time of the}} study, to 5. 7 % in women with two, and then increased steadily to 36. 8 % in those with six pregnancies. This variation in risk remained when allowance was made for the incomplete nature of some of the reproductive histories. When gravidity was held constant, fetal loss rates decreased with each successive pregnancy. This finding conflicts with previous suggestions that the risk of fetal loss increase with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> and age...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of biological models describing the mother-foetus relationship model encounters methodological restrictions {{resulting from a}} number of variables, their interactions, and the character of predictors (nominal, ordinal or quantitative). The main goal of the study is to estimate the adequacy of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method in research on human breeding ecology. Birth weight, being a good indicator of newborn maturity, was chosen as an explanatory variable. Infants were divided into two groups having a small- and appropriate/large-for-gestational age birth weight. The analysis covered variables connected with the mother’s biological condition and the course of the pregnancy. It was revealed that the birth weight was dependent on the mother’s age, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> the occurrence of miscarriages preceding the studied pregnancy, mother’s health condition and the course of the pregnancy. Applying the CART method allowed the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> to be chosen as well as the mother’s age, and disorders of the amount of amniofluid as those of the highest predictive value. The most striking aspects of applying the CART anlysis are its flexibility and hierarchy. Using CART there are possibilities of computing nominal and quantitative predictors, or both these types of variables simultaneously. The final decision for classifying objects is taken {{on the basis of the}} hierachical structure of classification trees- on the basis of the hierachical questioning. This leads to the designation of the ranking of the factors ’ significance. The obtained trees are simple in appearance (their structure is really analogous to a tree with its trunk, branches and leaves) and thanks to this the obtained results are easy to interpret...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} based {{survey of}} women who had spontaneous abortion in Hungary between 1971 and 1980 has been evaluated. Individual data sheets completed by specialists in obstetrical institutions were used. The ratio of spontaneous abortions was 13. 1 % during the whole period studied but declined during the decade. The maximum occurrence was in the fifth to eighth week of gestation, when more than 40 % of all spontaneous abortions occurred. Thereafter spontaneous abortion ratios decreased gradually with duration of pregnancy. The distribution of spontaneous abortions by calendar month shows characteristic seasonal changes, the minimum values being found from April to July whereas the maximum values were from October to February. The spontaneous abortion ratios increased significantly with the age of mother, over age 40 it approached 50 %.

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to analyze the}} effect of several factors on the stillbirth pattern in a relatively isolated rural population, La Alpujarra (Spain), {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century. The study was a retrospective analysis from a total sample of 2199 births to 525 mothers, allowing for birth year of mother, maternal age, parental inbreeding, family size, birth order, sex, single/twin delivery, and birth interval. Binomial probability distribution of stillbirths provided no evidence for any significantly increased risk in relation to family size. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of stillbirth risk in affected families indicated a significant effect for sex of the child, parental consanguinity, and birth year of mother. Logistic regression showed increased risk in twin delivery and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> one, but not for birth order other than one. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) testing for differences between affected and unaffected families supported a temporal decrease of stillbirths during the period studied. 1. 713 JCR (2001) Q 2, 13 / 42 Biology; Q 3, 71 / 13 Genetics & heredityUE...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to assess {{the extent to which}} household characteristics and behaviours exert their effects both directly and indirectly on childhood mortality through the more proximate factors that can be measured within the context of society. A child mortality model, primarily based on Mosley and Chen's framework, is developed by linking individual and societal factors. Then the model is tested with empirical data from the Fars Province of Iran. The survey data were collected in 1991 [...] 92 in five counties of Fars. It consisted of 10665 interviews and covered 67 villages 14 towns and one city. Three sampling techniques were employed: (1) proportional stratified sampling; (2) cluster sampling; and (3) simple random sampling. Three levels of analysis were carried out in this thesis: individual, societal and contextual. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were done for subsets of variables based on the child mortality model that were identified to be good predictors of child mortality and which were also identified theoretically as proximate and intervening variables. The individual level analysis reveals that place of residence, education of the mother, and occupation of the father from the socio-economic, factors; and age of marriage of mothers, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> and pregnancy age from demographic factors; and visiting doctors during pregnancy, type of delivery, pregnancy duration, birth weight, and vaccination from the health status factors; and housing quality are the important determinants of child mortality in Fars. At the societal level, rural setting, the literacy rate of the villages and assets indexed by sheep per capita are the important determinants of child mortality. Also child mortality rate differentials were found to be compatible with that of additive developmental index of regions (counties). Contextual analysis shows that birth weight, pregnancy duration, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> and house facilities are, in Iran, significant predictors of child mortality. Among all the variables, these variables appear to be the most proximate variables and the other variables, including socio-economic and demographic variables, significant intervening variables. The results of this dissertation support the claim that child mortality can be a sensitive indicator of human development and quality of life both at the individual and societal levels. Most significantly it appears to be prerequisite to fertility decline. The most important finding from these analyses is that child mortality is influenced both by the individual's characteristics as well as by community characteristics. In better words, social organisation as proposed in the child mortality model matters...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{reproductive}} and abortion patterns of {{women living in}} Plaza de la Revolucio´n, a municipality of Havana, Cuba, by studying the factors influencing birth and abortion rates. Socio-demographic data and female reproductive histories were collected {{in a survey of}} 1200 post-menopausal women living in the municipality. Average ages at menarche and at menopause were 12. 71 and 48. 39 years, respectively, thus yielding a potential long reproductive period of 35. 68 years, indicating high fertility. Although the mean pregnancy rate was 3. 81 pregnancies per woman, the live birth rate at time of delivery was only 1. 89 due to the high rate of abortions: 40 % of all pregnancies were voluntarily interrupted. Among the biological and socio-cultural variables that were found to influence the rate of live births were those related marriage pattern, especially age at first union. Demographic variables such as <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> maternal age and marital status were the main determinants of the abortion pattern, with abortion being used as a method of birth control in order to obtain the desired family size, and most women (75. 2 %) using contraceptives...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCleft lip and palate (CL/P) are {{the most}} common {{congenital}} craniofacial anomalies. AimTo evaluate environmental risk factors for non-syndromic CL/P in a reference care center in Minas Gerais. Materials and Methodswe carried out a case-controlled study, assessing 100 children with clefts and 100 children without clinical alterations. The analysis dimensions (age, skin color, gender, fissure classification, maternal and paternal age, birth order and interpregnancy interval), obtained from a questionnaire; and later we build a data base and the analyses were carried out by the SPSS 17. 0 software. The results were analyzed with the relative risk for each variable, in order to estimate the odds ratio with a 95 % confidence interval, followed by a bivariate and multivariate analysis. Resultsamong 200 children, 54 % were males and 46 % were females. As far as skin color is concerned most were brown, white and black, respectively. Cleft palates were the most common fissures found (54 %), followed by lip cleft (30 %) and palate cleft (16 %). Conclusionalthough with a limited sample, we noticed an association between maternal age and an increased risk for cleft lip and palate; however, paternal age, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> and interpregnancy interval were not significant...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{separate}} and joint effects of previous pregnancy history, year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height, smoking and fertility on risk of fetal death. Data were available from a study of female radiographers. Analyses were carried out on 3053 women with a total of 6993 pregnancies. Women reporting problems with conception or previous fetal losses had an increased risk of a pregnancy ending in a fetal death. In particular, women with primary or secondary infertility had an approximately fourfold increase in risk compared with women who reported no difficulties [odds ratio (OR) : 3. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : (3. 02, 5. 07) ]. This relationship was independent of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> and pregnancy history and was more marked in older maternal ages. The effect of pregnancy history was cumulative and possibly multiplicative in effect, with a threefold increase in the risk of losing a third pregnancy following two previous losses [OR: 3. 19; 95 % CI: (1. 60, 6. 35) ]. There were no consistent patterns of risk associated with year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height or smoking status. These results suggest that previous pregnancy outcomes and problems with conception may be the strongest determinants of fetal loss in subsequent pregnancies...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{spontaneous}} abortions were determined using a reproductive questionnaire administered by personal interview to 55 married women with 105 pregnancies. They {{were employed in}} an audio speaker factory and were exposed to high concentrations of toluene (mean 88, range 50 - 150 ppm). These rates {{of spontaneous}} abortion were compared with those among 31 women (68 pregnancies) who worked in other departments in the same factory and {{had little or no}} exposure to toluene (0 - 25 ppm), as well as with a community control group of women who underwent routine antenatal and postnatal care at public maternal health clinics (190 women with 444 pregnancies). Significantly higher rates for spontaneous abortions were noted in the group with high exposure to toluene (12. 4 per 100 pregnancies) compared with those in the internal control group (2. 9 per 100 pregnancies) and in the external control group (4. 5 per 100 pregnancies). Among the exposed women, significant differences were also noted in the rates of spontaneous abortion before employment (2. 9 per 100 pregnancies) and after employment in the factory (12. 6 per 100 pregnancies). Almost all the women were nonsmokers and did not drink; other known risk factors such as maternal age at <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>order</b> of gravidity, and race were not likely to explain the results. Thus, specific exposure to toluene seems to be associated with a risk of foetal loss...|$|E

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of insulin-dependent diabetic women {{who in the}} 1950 s {{were involved in a}} drug trial, 13 (14 %) of those who were still alive 27 years later were reported to have acquired thyroid disease or pernicious anaemia during the follow-up period. This suggests that their diabetes mellitus was a manifestation of a more generalised polyendocrine disorder. The pregnancy history of these 13 women differed strikingly from that of the other 82 insulin-dependent diabetic women: in the diabetic women who subsequently acquired other endocrine disease 69 % of pregnancies resulted in a fetal or infant death, compared with 44 % in other insulin-dependent diabetic women (p less than 0. 01). This risk increased with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> the odds ratio of an unfavourable outcome in women who later acquired thyroid disease or pernicious anaemia, compared with the other diabetic women, being 1. 2 for the first pregnancy, 3. 1 for the second pregnancy, 7. 3 for the third pregnancy, and 14. 0 for the fourth pregnancy. The mean birthweight of offspring of the women with other endocrine disease was substantially lower than the mean birthweight of offspring of other diabetic mothers (2977 g and 3430 g, respectively). These differences in birthweight and mortality could not be explained by the severity of the mothers' diabetes {{at the time of their}} pregnancies, and were evident even before the diabetes was diagnosed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the risk of spontaneous abortion among the wives of male workers occupationally exposed to benzene. METHODS [...] The wives of 823 men working in two chemical plants at the time of the study were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their pregnancies. The analysis of the 1739 pregnancies that ended in a spontaneous abortion or a birth is presented. The firms' payroll records provided all workers' employment history, including dates. Benzene exposure, graded at two levels (or = 5 ppm), was determined for every job, so that benzene exposure for each worker's entire professional life (at these companies) could be assessed. This information was linked to the dates of the pregnancies reported in the questionnaires to enable the exposure status of each pregnancy to be defined (1270 non-exposed and 274 exposed). The frequency of spontaneous abortion, defined as the number of spontaneous abortions divided by the total of spontaneous abortions and births was evaluated. RESULTS [...] When adjusted for tobacco consumption, mother's age and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order,</b> the odds ratio of the association between paternal exposure to approximately 5 ppm of benzene and the risk of spontaneous abortion was close to and statistically not different from unity (OR = 1. 1; 95 % CI (0. 7 - 1. 8).

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} The {{aim of this}} paper is to describe how selected demographic characteristics ‘explain’ the observed variance in the distribution of maternal health literacy estimates in adolescents attending antenatal care in Uganda, as estimated by the ‘Maternal health literacy scale’. Background By the age of 20 years, more than 60 % of Ugandan females are mothers. In the Busoga region of Uganda, the percentage of pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers is at its highest (above 30 %). Design Validated questionnaire survey. Methods The Maternal health literacy scale was administered to 384 adolescents aged 15 – 19 years attending antenatal care in Jinja and Iganga districts of the Busoga region during the period of July 2013 –December 2013. The Mann–Whitney U test in SPSS 21 was used to determine if the two levels of dichotomised person factors, i. e. demographic characteristics, relate to ‘significantly’ different mean maternal health literacy estimates, not strictly following the normal distribution, as measured by the Maternal health literacy scale. Results The person factors, age, education level, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> and prepregnancy awareness about conception, explained approximately 12 % of the observed variance in maternal health literacy estimates. Conclusions Prepregnancy awareness about conception was the single most contributory factor to the observed variance in estimated maternal health literacy levels. More research on women of childbearing age is warranted to explore the impact of further person factors on the maternal health literacy in pregnant adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: The most {{important}} indicator {{of population growth}} is fertility. Fertil-ity is influenced by selection of individual, social, economic, demographic, cultural and bio-logical factors. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the factors affecting fertility (num-ber of live births). Materials & Methods: This was a cross- sectional study of the correlation matrix, which is based on a sample of 500 households in the two-stage random sampling method. First, a question-naire was adjusted and then was provided to interviewers for recording some demographics information and birthrate. To examine the relationship between these variables and fertility model, the {{most important}} influential variables on fertility were selected based on the theo-retical model and using socio-economic and demographic variables influencing on fertility. The data were then analyzed by the path analysis using LISREL software. Results: Mean±SD of parity in 500 married women was 2. 18 ± 0. 904 in Hamadan city. Among the variables, couple education (total effect - 0. 421) and the number of unwanted pregnancy (total effect 0. 27) had the highest effect on fertility, respectively; while husband’s marriage age (total effect - 0. 00365) had the lowest effects on parity. Conclusion: This study shows that high education is a deterrent factor to live births and also shows that the rise of live births is unwanted among families. Also, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that culture of trend towards early marriage and childbearing which are associated with the promotion of education for women and men can significantly increase the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> to prevent the lack of active and aging population.

40|$|BACKGROUND. In Ukraine, much public {{attention}} {{is given to}} adolescent girls and young women as a main ‘risk group’ for terminating an unplanned pregnancy in case it occurs. The objective {{of the study was}} to clarify whether this concern is substantiated. METHODS. Data from a nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey on women of reproductive age were used to examine the relationship of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>order</b> number, age when a woman became pregnant and her marital status to accepting unintended pregnancy. A subsample of 517 women having been pregnant within five years preceding the interview were divided into non-acceptors (unintended pregnancy was terminated) and acceptors (pregnancy ended with live birth though was unintended at the time of conception). Independent variables included pregnancy- and childbearing-related, socio-demographic, and behavioral characteristics. Odds ratios were calculated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS. Controlling for all other factors, being 23 years and younger compared to 24 - 37 years old was positively associated with accepting an unintended pregnancy. With every next pregnancy, odds of accepting an unintended pregnancy decreased by 0. 6. Being married compared to being unmarried was negatively associated with accepting an unintended pregnancy in bivariate analysis, which was attenuated in multivariate analysis because of predominance of the first pregnancies among never married women. Furthermore, women from all other regions of Ukraine compared to women from Western regions were less likely to accept an unintended pregnancy, and so did women of Christian Orthodox and no religion compared to women of other religions. CONCLUSIONS. Attention of public health programs and policies should be paid to the women with children, whose needs in reliable contraceptive methods are not met. Post-delivery contraceptive consultations may be a great tool in overcoming this gap. In addition, women from non-Western regions are at greater risks of terminating an unintended pregnancy...|$|E
