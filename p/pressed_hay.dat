Chester had hoped that he might pick up a few cents, holding a horse or cow for somebody or carrying a market basket, but no such chance offered itself. He climbed up on some bales of <b>pressed</b> <b>hay</b> in one corner and sat there moodily; there was dejection in the very dangle of his legs over the bales. Chester, you see, was discovering what many a boy before him has discovered--that it is a good deal easier to sit down and make a fortune in dreams than it is {{to go out into the}} world and make it.|$|E
60|$|I had not {{intended}} to write again until {{the time of the}} departure of the next mail, as my last letter went off only yesterday morning; but two companies of the 33d regiment are to land this afternoon and to start at midnight, and as this is the first body of European troops who have landed, I think it as well to accompany them to Senafe, sixty miles distant, where Colonels Merewether and Phayre have gone up with the pioneer force. They will not advance beyond this point for some time, and I shall therefore, when I have seen the passes, return, after a few days’ stay there, to this place, which is at present the main point of interest. I should not move from it, indeed, were it not that there is some doubt whether the King of Tigré will permit us to pass. He is at present stationed near the head of the pass with a body of 7000 men, but I fancy his only object in this is to make us buy his friendship at as high a rate as possible. If he really means mischief {{it will be a very}} serious matter indeed; for, although we should of course scatter his forces easily enough, it would give us such an enormous line of march to be guarded that it would be impossible to move a step until we had completely subdued Tigré. I sincerely hope that this will not be the case. But another week or two will show; and in the mean time, as I shall have plenty of opportunities of writing on the subject, I must return to my present topic, which is the state of things at the landing-place here. It is not, as I said in my last, a cheerful place to look at from on board ship, but it is very far worse on landing. The pier is nearly finished, and is a very creditable piece of work indeed. It is of stone, and about 300 yards long, and is wide enough for a double line of rails. One line is already laid down, and saves an immensity of labour; for the goods are landed from the native boats, which bring them from the ship’s side, are put on to the trucks, and are run straight into the commissariat yard, which is fifty yards only from the end of the pier. Before this pier was finished everything had to be carried on shore upon the heads of the natives; and as a boat cannot approach within 300 yards of shore, owing to the shallow water, it may be imagined how slowly the work of debarcation went on. The pier is ridiculously insufficient for the purpose. Even now the ships are lying in the harbour for days, waiting for means of landing their goods, although lines of natives still supplement the pier, and pass bales of goods through the water on their heads. When the whole expedition is here there will be a complete dead-lock, unless a very great increase of landing accommodation is afforded. The commissariat yard is piled with enormous quantities of <b>pressed</b> <b>hay,</b> Indian and English, grain, rice, &c. They are well arranged, and in such weather as we have at present there is no fear of their taking damage from being exposed to the air, especially as the precaution has been taken to have trusses of <b>pressed</b> <b>hay</b> laid down as a foundation for the piles of grain-bags. The commissariat yard is distinguished by the fact that here only do we see women—bright-coloured, picturesquely-clad creatures, a hundred of whom have been sent across from India to serve as grinders of corn. Beside the commissariat tents are a few others belonging to the other departments, and these, with a large unfinished wooden storehouse, at which a dozen Chinese carpenters are at work, constitute the camp at the landing-place. But this is only a small portion of the whole, the main camp being a mile and a half inland; and, indeed, there are half-a-dozen small camps, a cluster of tents scattered within the circle of a mile.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, Australia, {{and around}} the world, baling wire was used in {{mechanical}} hay balers pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted {{the ends of the}} wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had <b>pressed</b> the <b>hay</b> into a tight rectangular bale. These hay balers were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the soft wire for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep castellated nuts in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} NP-completeness [GJ 79] {{is arguably the}} most {{important}} intellectual contribution of Theoretical Computer Science to general scientific knowledge. Thousands of NP-complete problems are known, in scientific areas as diverse as protein folding, statistical physics, or computational social sciences. NP completeness is an indicator of computational intractability, since the computational time of all known algorithms (and indeed all algorithms, assuming that the famous conjecture P ≠ NP is true) scales superpolynomially with instance size. Despite this success, the concept of an NP-complete problem does not completely model experimental reality: the problem is that NP-completeness is a worst-case concept, so any NP-complete problem contains some ”hard ” instances. But the theory does not address the issue of ”density ” of such hard instances, and indeed, NP-complete problems can differ significantly with respect to the computational difficulty of ”typical ” instances arising in practice. Recent years have witnessed {{the emergence of a new}} field of research, at the crossroads of Statistical Physics, Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence: the study of phase transitions in combinatorial problems [PIM 06]. This remarkable development has generated substantial excitement in the scientific [GS 05, Rob 05] and the popular <b>press</b> [Joh 99, <b>Hay</b> 97, Hay 03].

[...] For the primary, he told The Portsmouth Herald that he had spent $200,000 of his own money, including the $1,000 filing fee. Among the field of 14 candidates on the ballot, Ely finished seventh with 287 votes for 0.47 percent of the total. In additional primaries, his numbers steadily improved. At the March 6 Oklahoma primary, for which he paid $2,500 to appear, he finished in fifth place with 5,318 votes for 4.72 percent. At the March 24 Louisiana primary, whose filing fee was $1,125, he came in third, behind only Obama and attorney John Wolfe, Jr., and won 9,897 votes for 6.57 percent. After this, his strongest showing, Ely sent out a letter, later published by Politico, which explained that in Louisiana without buying any advertisements or campaigning, he was able to win 120 voting precincts and out-paced President Obama in 457 precincts. He speculated that [...] "most the votes came from those who concluded 'I’ve never heard of this guy so he can’t be any worse than the rest of these clowns.' It seems a strange indictment of our political establishment that obscurity becomes an asset."After prison inmate Keith Russell Judd won 41 percent against President Obama in the West Virginia Democratic primary (for which Ely did not register), Ely was featured in a Politico article as [...] "an aspiring Keith Judd".

5000|$|Skillman {{is named}} after the Skillman family. The first Skillmans were Dutch, but lived in England before moving to Brooklyn in 1664, {{according}} to family accounts. In 1729, Thomas Skillman ventured westward, buying some 500 acre of farmland on the Millstone River, {{near the village of}} Rocky Hill, for his sons, Jan and Isaac. That purchase was the Skillman family's entry into Montgomery. The Skillman area got its name when the railroads arrived in the 1870s, according to the Skillman family. Joseph A. Skillman, was a teamster who owned [...] "wild Missouri mules," [...] according to family accounts. When railroad workers were trying to lay tracks, their horses got bogged down in thick, clay mud, and Joseph A. Skillman came to the rescue with his mules. Railroad officials also socialized at the home of another Skillman nearby, and the new train station was named for the family. A post office opened in the station and a small village, with a <b>hay</b> <b>press,</b> feed store and hardware store, sprouted around it. It took the Skillman name, too. (While the train station is gone, remnants of the village still exist at the spot where Camp Meeting Avenue and Skillman Road meet. A clay and sculpting supply business occupies some of the buildings.) Also in Skillman was the sprawling New Jersey State Village for Epileptics, a 250 acre complex opened around 1900 that had its own dairy, laundry, and movie theater. Visitors would arrive by train. Skillman was a busy little country place. There were 1,637 residents in Montgomery in 1910, compared with more than 23,000 now, according to Census data. The community now has more traffic, fewer farms and more houses (specifically developments).|$|R
