25|$|For her {{performance}} on Veep, Louis-Dreyfus has received several accolades, most notably six consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series from 2012-2017. Her Emmy wins for Veep, following previous wins for Seinfeld and The New Adventures of Old Christine, resulted in her becoming {{the only woman}} to win an acting award for three separate comedy series. Her sixth win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2016 surpassed the record previously held by Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen for the most wins in that category. Her sixth consecutive win, and eighth acting win overall, in 2017 made her the performer with the most Emmys for the same role in the same series, and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tie with Cloris Leachman for the most Emmys ever won by a performer.

The show however won the top award in 2015, 2016 and 2017.|$|E
25|$|The result was, in many respects, {{the most}} {{advanced}} icebreaker {{in the world at}} the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the broken ice floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even moving sideways. Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian ferry Abegweit had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the most powerful icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> class of her own among icebreaking ships.|$|E

[...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E.

Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E

[...] Burning alive for murder was abolished in 1656, although burning for adultery remained. [...] Thereafter, out of mercy, the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold. [...] Notable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in 1685 and 1726 of Elizabeth Gaunt, found guilty of high treason for her part in the Rye House Plot, and Catherine Hayes, for petty treason.
