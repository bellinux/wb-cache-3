5000|$|Often in {{his books}} such as The Boys of Summer (1972), Memories of Summer (1993), The Era, 1947-1957 (1993), and Into My Own (2006), the {{prolific}} and long-lived ex-Trib sportswriter Roger Kahn—an ambitious junior writer in Rennie's latter years—paused to mention (and quote from) Rennie, [...] "a trim, handsome Canadian" [...] who had [...] "lady friends in several National League towns." [...] One such example, quoted often by others, followed the 20-year-old Oklahoman Mickey Mantle's stunning World Series win for the Yankees (their fourth in a row) against the Brooklyn Dodgers, a truly Olympian battle in 1952. The dutiful, modest young Oklahoman {{seemed to have no}} idea of what his home runs and headlines portended for him. Kahn quoted from the interview between Rud Rennie and Mickey Mantle: [...] "Nice Series, young man," [...] said Rud Rennie, who covered the Yankees for the Herald Tribune. [...] "What are you up to now?""Headin' back to Oklahoma. I got me a job working with the <b>pump</b> <b>crew</b> down in the lead mine.""Work in the mines?" [...] Rennie said. [...] "You're the star of the World Series. You don't have to do that any more.""Yes, I do," [...] Mantle said. [...] "My dad died, you know.""Yes. Sorry, son.""I got seven dependents counting on me." [...] Mantle named three younger brothers, a sister, his mother and his wife, Merlyn."That's six," [...] Rennie said."The baby is due in March," [...] Mantle said.Rennie looked grim. [...] "I can handle it," [...] said 20-year-old Mickey Mantle. Then, brightening, [...] "Anyways my father-in-law, Giles Johnson, says he's gonna name the baby ‘Homer.’" ...|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} a vacation beach cottage, but the Adamsons eventually made it their permanent home. In December 1932, a fire {{started in the}} electrical wiring of the garage. One of the bedrooms was badly damaged, and the entire house was threatened by intense flames. The fire was put out by <b>pumping</b> <b>crews</b> from the forestry stations at Fernwood and Las Flores, aided by the Malibu Beach colony fire department. During World War II, the bathhouse {{was used by the}} United States Coast Guard as a local headquarters to watch out over the Malibu coast.|$|R
50|$|The pumping {{capacity}} was increased in early March, {{when a large}} chunk of the crater wall broke away from the summit of Eldfell and began to be carried {{along the top of the}} lava flow towards the harbour. The chunk, dubbed Flakkarinn (The Wanderer), would have seriously threatened the viability of the harbour if it had reached it, and the dredging boat Sandey was brought in on 1 March to prevent its advance. Professor Þorbjörn Sigurgeirsson provided advice to the <b>pumping</b> <b>crews</b> on where to direct their efforts to most efficiently slow the flows. Eventually the Wanderer broke up into two pieces which both stopped approximately 100 metres (330 ft) from the harbour mouth.|$|R
50|$|After {{crossing}} the Atlantic, Papazov {{and his wife}} planned to cross the Pacific in a similar way. Leaning on their experiences with Dju IV, they outfitted their next lifeboat much more carefully. It sported a full deck, an outboard engine which powered a lit compass and their radio and a water <b>pump.</b> The <b>crew</b> had to maintain around-the-clock steering, and faced numerous technical problems.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 October 1989, a KC-135A Stratotanker, 56-3592, from {{en route}} from Loring Air Force Base crashed into a hill along {{the west side of}} Trans-Canada Highway 2 2 mi north of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick in Carlingford, New Brunswick due to an {{overheated}} fuel pump, killing all four crew members. After five accidents involving fuel <b>pump</b> overheating, <b>crews</b> were to keep 3000 pounds of fuel in the tank.|$|R
50|$|Essex Chief Fire Officer David Johnson {{reported}} that firefighting operations were hindered {{by the fact}} that the blaze was high up in the main structure of the station, which was also heavily smoke-logged. In addition to 15 <b>pumping</b> appliances, <b>crews</b> used three aerial ladder platforms, one major rescue tender, three bulk foam tenders and a thermal-imaging camera in a helicopter to help tackle the fire. Support crews were drafted in from the London Fire Brigade.|$|R
50|$|On 22 November 2015, the church's organ caught fire. This was noticed after smoke {{began to}} {{issue from the}} organ <b>pump</b> and fire <b>crews</b> were called to the church at 11.22am. The fire was {{extinguished}} and no major damage was caused.|$|R
50|$|The Sea Devil {{proved to}} be a very good design. It made 133 {{successful}} diving runs within four months. But during the 134th dive, the submarine got stuck in the sand of the seafloor. By emptying the water cylinders with the <b>pumps,</b> the <b>crew</b> managed to raise the submarine high enough so that the hatchway was above the waterline. The whole crew (including Bauer) was saved, but unfortunately, the submarine sank back to the bottom of the sea.|$|R
50|$|This will be {{very similar}} to the current Rescue <b>Pump</b> with a <b>crew</b> of between four and six. They will have a full range of heavy rescue equipment, a large pump and water {{carrying}} capacity as well as a specialist foam capability suitable for all types of fires.|$|R
500|$|In {{less than}} a month, the leaks were fixed. On 12 June 2017, a [...] hole about [...] below the {{waterline}} caused the ship to tilt six degrees to the starboard side. After emergency repairs, <b>crews</b> <b>pumped</b> out about [...] of water per minute out of the ship for more than 15 hours.|$|R
50|$|Utilizing a {{gasoline}} <b>pump,</b> the destroyer's <b>crew</b> managed to <b>pump</b> salt {{water into the}} tanks and light the boilers off. At 0500, Aaron Ward moved slowly ahead, bound for Sealark Channel; ten minutes later, American motor torpedo boats closed, and the destroyer signaled them to ask Tulagi for a tug. She kept up her crawling pace for only a half-hour before going {{dead in the water}} again.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, a mishap with a pipe nearly {{caused the}} barge to sink. [...] It took {{hundreds}} {{of gallons of}} water into its bilge when a pipe feeding water into it snapped due to freezing weather. Listing, it began taking on seawater {{through a crack in}} its side. A repair <b>crew</b> <b>pumped</b> more than 1,500 gallons of water out of the bilge before it started to level.http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/2003/03/10/2003-03-10_barge_rescuers_keep_concert_.html ...|$|R
5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} {{when she ran}} onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the <b>pumps,</b> the <b>crew</b> managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|R
50|$|Firebrand {{was in the}} Downs on 13 October {{when she}} weighed and sailed for Dover. Visibility was bad during the night and as {{she did not have}} a pilot aboard it is {{possible}} that she mistook some lights ashore for boats at anchor and the Dover pier. Shortly before midnight she grounded and started to take on water. A local pilot came out and tried to get her off, but her back was broken and water was coming in too fast for the <b>pumps.</b> Her <b>crew</b> took to their boats and no lives were lost. Lieutenant MacLean spent some time in the cold water before he was rescued; he died three weeks after his rescue, perhaps as a consequence.|$|R

50|$|Later, {{the fire}} {{spread to the}} ship's coal bunkers, cutting off the fuel supply for the fire hose <b>pumps.</b> The <b>crew</b> {{attempted}} to fight the fire {{for about two hours}} but, realizing the severity of the fire and the limited options for dousing it on the high seas, Captain Francis Inch had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. Eleven ships responded to the calls and headed to the ship's reported position, arriving throughout the day and into the next. In the meantime, several of the ship'ss lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results; all either capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship, leaving no one alive from the first boats.|$|R
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water <b>pumped</b> out. The <b>crew</b> attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|R
50|$|If {{the mine}} detonates at a {{distance}} from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate. This is frequently the most deadly type of explosion, if it is strong enough. The whole ship is dangerously shaken and everything on board is tossed around. Engines rip from their beds, cables from their holders, etc.. A badly shaken ship usually sinks quickly, with hundreds, or even thousands of small leaks all over the ship and no way to power the <b>pumps.</b> The <b>crew</b> fare no better, as the violent shaking tosses them around. This shaking is powerful enough to cause disabling injury to knees and other joints in the body, particularly if the affected person stands on surfaces connected directly to the hull (such as steel decks).|$|R
50|$|Fire <b>crews</b> <b>pumped</b> out the floodwaters and off-duty staff {{rushed back}} to the {{hospital}} to help patients to safety and to try to save any medical files that had been untouched by the raw sewage that had flooded the hospital. Blame for the scale of the damage was laid on cutbacks at Donegal County Council which led to drains outside the hospital going uncleaned for seven months. As a result, the floodwaters had nowhere to go.|$|R
40|$|The unique {{problems}} {{encountered in}} the integrated approach to aircraft and spacecraft avionics system designs are discussed {{with the emphasis on}} recent advances in telemetry as a factor facilitating the integration.

Considerations are given for the multiplexed data bus design applicable to integrated avionics...|$|R
2500|$|At 12:35 Seneca left Wellington and {{rejoined the}} convoy. [...] {{was on her}} way to assist Wellington, expecting to reach her by 17:00. Arriving aboard Wellington, Lieutenant Brown posted lookouts, broke out {{ammunition}} and started drilling a gun crew, for they were still in sub-infested waters, and on a stricken ship carrying valuable cargo to the allies. Repairs were made below decks and by 12:50 hours the ship began to move ahead. By 14:10 the speed was increased until they were making [...] The ship was taking water in the number 2 hold, but by driving the <b>pumps,</b> the <b>crew</b> held it to a level of [...] At 18:46 the ship was down by the head, and although Lieutenant Brown was able to stop her and bring her head back up long enough to regain his course, her head went down again and her engines were helpless.|$|R
50|$|Neptune had {{suffered}} considerably {{from the bad}} weather, {{to the point that}} her captain had warned Vanstabel. On 25, another leak forced Neptune to tack as not to expose the affected section of her hull to water, and to send distress signals. For five days, most of the <b>crew</b> <b>pumped</b> water out of the ship and dropped the guns, ammunition and anchors overboard, until the 28th, at 12:30, when she reached Perros-Guirec and ran aground. 50 men were found dead in the hull, {{while the rest of the}} crew evacuated the ship.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the topic of <b>Pumps</b> with <b>crew</b> centrifugal impeller. Thanks to the benefits such as free passage and efficiency there are many practical applications of these products. Despite this fact there is only few manufacturers dealing with them what results in lack of research and available information in the area. In order to fill the gap, this thesis aims to propose hydraulic of screw centrifugal impeller to the specified parameters. The impeller with a single moving blade will be designed for pumping heavily polluted water and hardly pumpable liquids. Blade will be balanced together with the rotor, while the emphasis will be placed on the highest free passage of impeller. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes literature on the subject, practical part deals with the calculations and adjustments pointing to a concrete proposal. Parameters of designed hydraulics were verified using stationary calculations using MRF model in FLUENT. As a results, two possible solutions are offered...|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could <b>pump,</b> the <b>crew</b> cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|R
5000|$|To start, a {{jet engine}} {{requires}} pneumatic {{rotation of the}} turbine, AC-electrical fuel pumps, and an AC-electrical [...] "flash" [...] that ignites the fuel. As the turbine (behind the combustion chamber) is already rotating, the front inlet fans are also rotating. After the ignition, both fans and turbine speed up their rotation. As combustion stabilizes, the engine thereafter only needs the fuel to run at idle. The started engine can now replace the APU when starting up further engines. During flight the APU and its generator are not needed.APUs are also used to run accessories while the engines are shut down. This allows the cabin to be comfortable while the passengers are boarding before the aircraft's engines are started. Electrical power is used to run systems for preflight checks. Some APUs are also connected to a hydraulic <b>pump,</b> allowing <b>crews</b> to operate hydraulic equipment (such as flight controls or flaps) prior to engine start. This function can also be used, on some aircraft, as a backup in flight in case of engine or hydraulic failure.|$|R
2500|$|The early 1870s, which Unrau {{calls the}} [...] "Golden Years", were {{particularly}} profitable. The company repaid {{some of its}} bonds. It made many improvements to the canal, including the installation of a telephone system. Yet there were still floods and other problems. By 1872, so many vessels were unfit for navigation that the company required boats to undergo annual inspections and registration. In July 1876, {{the crew of the}} Lezan Ragan stayed afloat while loading in Cumberland only by her <b>crew's</b> <b>pumping.</b> She hit some abutments of the locks near Great Falls, and finally sank at the opening Lock 15 (at the head of Widewater).|$|R
50|$|On 21 January 2013, Santísima Trinidad {{suffered}} a broken valve {{which resulted in}} the flooding of several compartments. The flooding was beyond the capacity of the <b>pumps</b> and the <b>crew</b> was evacuated. The ship took on a 50-degree list and sank at her moorings. Santísima Trinidad was in poor condition before she sank; the ship had been cannibalized to keep her sister Hércules operational, as the British refused to sell the Argentines spare parts after the Falklands War. In September 2014, specialists of the Argentine navy began an operation to raise the ship. In December 2015, Santísima Trinidad was refloated and the Navy announced they plan to turn her into a museum dedicated to the 1982 war.|$|R
50|$|In July 1961, Malone {{began taking}} laps on the Daytona oval in the Mad Dog IV. His initial test laps (sans airfoils) {{were in the}} 161 mph range. The machine had been plagued by oil {{pressure}} issues due to the high speeds pushing the oil away from the oil <b>pump.</b> The <b>crew</b> was able {{to solve the problem}} by moving the oil pump {{to the rear of the}} oil pan, and adjusted the amount of oil in the crankcase. In addition, the team was using old tires left over from the Monza race, all of which wearing out after only a couple laps at speed. On August 5, 1961, Malone turned a lap at 177.479 mph, a new track record, and a new world closed-course competitive track record. It broke the mark set by Tony Bettenhausen (177.038 mph) at Monza in 1957. One day later, on August 6, Malone went out for another attempt, but suffered a seized transmission. The car broke into a spin, slid 600 feet, but made no contact. The crew took the car back to Charlotte, North Carolina for an overhaul, and planned to return later in the month.|$|R
50|$|During construction, in {{the early}} hours of 2 November 2005, the roof of a {{ventilation}} tunnel for the project collapsed. The collapse caused a 10 by 10 metre crater to appear near the southbound exit ramp of the Pacific Highway. It also damaged a three-storey building at 11-13 Longueville Road, forcing the evacuation of 47 people. Emergency <b>crews</b> <b>pumped</b> 1000 cubic metres of concrete into the hole to try to stop the housing block from collapsing into it. An investigation by Workcover NSW found that the collapse was caused by geological conditions at the site, the large span width of the tunnel, and inadequacy of roof support. The proximity of the excavations to the surface resulted in the property damage.|$|R
50|$|US Frigate Constellation’s second {{commander}} was Alexander Murray, {{a veteran}} of George Washington’s army, the Continental navy and also, was commander of the prize l’Insurgente. In 1801, Murray was ordered by Acting Secretary of the Navy Samuel Smith to take Constellation from New York to Philadelphia despite the captain’s warning to Smith that the passage up Delaware River was dangerous due to Constellation’s draft of 22 ft. 6 ins. Murray reached Philadelphia, moored Constellation, and assigned a skeleton crew of two officers and fifty seamen. It capsized at low tide, and filled with water. Joshua Humphreys’ yard <b>crews</b> <b>pumped</b> out and repaired the waterlogged hull. Constellation departed Philadelphia for the Mediterranean Sea with the armament supplemented by carronades on its quarterdeck. Commander Murray requested the Navy Department to rerate her as USF Constellation-44.|$|R
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the <b>pumps,</b> leading the <b>crew</b> to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|R
60|$|An old {{acquaintance}} of ours {{was out in}} that same gale, and is even now making {{his way into the}} shelter of the Albert docks. This was none other than the redoubtable Captain Hamilton Miggs, whose ship will persistently keep afloat, to the astonishment of the gallant captain himself, and of every one else who knows anything of her sea-going qualities. Again and again she had been on the point of foundering; and again and again some change in the weather or the steady <b>pumping</b> of the <b>crew</b> had prevented her from fulfilling her destiny. So surprised was the skipper at these repeated interpositions of Providence that he had quite made up his superstitious mind that the ship never would go down, and now devoted himself with a whole heart to his old occupation of drinking himself into delirium tremens and physicking himself out of it again.|$|R

50|$|In May 1934 Prokofiev {{received}} a go-ahead {{to proceed with}} a new gigantic (300,000 cubic meters) balloon, the USSR-2 designed by Chizhevsky and Godunov to reach 30 kilometers altitude. If flown successfully, it could have become the first operational aircraft designed for pilots wearing pressure suits. Prokofiev and Godunov themselves planned to fly the new balloon that, unlike earlier and later Soviet designs, seated only two. The gondola of USSR-2 had an airlock attachment to allow exit into the stratosphere without explosive decompression. Instead of cotton fabric, its gas bag was made of parachute-grade silk, a choice that killed the project. On the night of September 4 - 5, 1934, as the ground <b>crews</b> <b>pumped</b> hydrogen into the silk bag, an unexpected static spark caused by friction of unfolding silk ignited the balloon. There were no fatalities on the ground but the project was shelved indefinitely.|$|R
