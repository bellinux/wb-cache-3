40|$|In {{the alcohol}} {{industry}} {{it is important}} to create non-waste technology for grain <b>processing</b> <b>into</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The aim of research was the development of technology for wheat processing into ethanol and protein product. We studied the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch with glucoamylase of Glucogam preparation. We determined the optimal dosage of the enzyme 8 units. GlA/g of starch, and the temperature of 55 °C. In the study of protein hydrolysis by the concomitant to glucoamylase protease of enzyme Glucogam preparation accumulation of amino nitrogen of 4. 5 mg / cm 3 in 7 hours of bioconversion takes place. Separation of the resulting saccharified mass was carried out by centrifugation into the filtrate and protein mass. Centrifugation was carried out at a rotational speed of 2500 rev / min for 8 minutes. Protein was dried to 5 % moisture content at temperatures not exceeding 35 °C, milled, and examined its properties in comparison with native wheat gluten. The resulting product had the following characteristics: the solubility of 10 %, water-holding capacity of 1. 53 g / g, and fat binding capacity of 1. 9 g /g. We investigated the process of fermentation of clarified wort with the dry solids concentration of 14 %. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of race XII and Saccharomyces cerevisiae of race IMB Y- 5007 in the dose of 120 million cells per 1 cm 3 of wort. Optimum composition of mineral salts was determined. For the yeasts of race XII and IMB Y- 5007 fertilizing with diammonium phosphate in a dosage of 1. 5 g / dm 3 is necessary. The alcohol yield when using the yeasts of race IMB Y- 5007 was 60. 7 dal/ ton of conditional starch, when using yeasts of race XII it accounts 60, 6 dal / ton of conditional starch...|$|E

25|$|While {{the residue}} in the jar is not {{definitive}} proof of winemaking, it does provide strong {{evidence for the}} possibility. Grapes are unique in {{being one of the}} few natural sources for tartaric acid, which is the most abundant acid in wine and often crystallizes into deposits that are left in containers that have held wine. Grapes also have a natural propensity to break down <b>into</b> <b>alcohol</b> by a process that we now know as fermentation where the yeast on the grape skins metabolize the sugar in the grapes <b>into</b> <b>alcohol.</b> This happens most readily in a close container that is kept in room temperature. Whether or not the action was deliberate, storing grapes in jars that were then embedded in the floor would have created conditions favorable for wine production.|$|R
