The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages.

40|$|Nicotine intake is a {{necessary}} but insufficient factor in maintaining tobacco smoking behavior, and nonpharmacological factors associated with smoking play a key role. Some of these factors may influence smoking behavior by eliciting <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> or responses related specifically {{to the belief that}} one is consuming a drug. Greater knowledge of <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> of smoking would improve our understanding of factors that maintain smoking behavior, thereby aiding efforts to develop treatments to counter the influence of these factors. In addition, better understanding of <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> from other means of nicotine intake could help determine mechanisms of the therapeutic actions of nicotine replacement therapy, perhaps enhancing its efficacy in smoking cessation. <b>Placebo</b> <b>effects</b> of smoking or other nicotine intake have received little research attention. In this review, we first discuss common terms and methods of placebo research, especially the balanced-placebo design. We then examine the limited research directly assessing <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> of smoking and other nicotine intake, namely studies that manipulated instructions to subjects about the drug content of an ingested substance. Finally, we examine other studies relevant to gauging the likely magnitude of <b>placebo</b> smoking <b>effects.</b> In an effort to encourage more research on these <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> we pay substantial attention to future directions. Among recommendations are testing the utility of the balanced-placebo design and other rigorously controlled designs, and including multiple measures of <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> in addition to self-report.

25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to the <b>placebo</b> <b>effect.</b> The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment. Research into the placebo treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers shows that this varies widely with society. The <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in treating gastric ulcers is low in Brazil, higher in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands), and extremely high in Germany. However, the <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in treating hypertension is lower in Germany than elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|For many subjectively {{experienced}} outcomes, such as {{pain and}} depression, rather large <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> have been reported. However, {{there is increasing}} evidence that placebo interventions also affect end-organ functions regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). After discussing three psychological models for autonomic <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> this article provides an anatomical framework of the autonomic system and then critically reviews the relevant placebo studies in the field, thereby focusing on gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and pulmonary functions. The findings indicate that several autonomic organ functions can indeed be altered by verbal suggestions delivered during placebo and nocebo interventions. In addition, three experimental studies provide evidence for organ-specific effects, {{in agreement with the}} current knowledge on the central control of the ANS. It is suggested that the <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> on autonomic organ functions are best explained by the model of ‘implicit affordance’, which assumes that <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> are dependent on ‘lived experience’ rather than on the conscious representation of expected outcomes. Nevertheless, more studies will be needed to further elucidate psychological and neurobiological pathways involved in autonomic <b>placebo</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

25|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated that the magnitude of the <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use. Placebo response rates in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|The <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> {{is related}} to the {{perceptions}} and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the nocebo effect. In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those that think that a treatment will work display a stronger <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} test for the {{existence}} of <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> as described by the so-called expectancy theory. This theory, which is the dominant medical theory of how <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> operate, posits that health outcomes rise in individuals' beliefs about the probability that they are getting a beneficial treatment and their beliefs about the efficacy of that treatment. Blinded, randomized, controlled trials provide near-perfect environments in which to test this theory because they offer objective, controlled manipulations of subjects' beliefs about treatment. If the expectancy theory is correct, outcomes in trials offering a higher probability of receiving an experimental treatment should be superior to outcomes in trials offering a lower probability of receiving that treatment, conditional on treatment assignment. The paper applies this test to data from over 200 trials of anti-ulcer medications and finds robust evidence of <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> in trials of H 2 -blockers (e. g., Zantac, Tagamet and Pepcid) and of proton-pump inhibitors (e. g., Prilosec, Nexium, and Prevacid). Indeed, trials of H 2 -blockers manifest <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> that are 50 percent as large as the physiological effects of these medications. Because <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> are not confined to clinical trials, this result suggests that the standard difference-in-means estimator of treatment effects may seriously underestimate the efficacy of anti-ulcer medicationsPlacebo effects, randomized controlled trials, informed consent, blinding, self-selection, expected utility, ulcer...|$|R
