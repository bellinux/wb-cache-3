40|$|This paper {{investigated}} two {{roles of}} public reviews in disaster risk management: 1) providing {{information to a}} <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> about the desirability of a disaster risk management plan and 2) promoting stakeholders' trust in <b>policy</b> <b>maker's</b> decision. Our analysis was conducted by formulating two linked communication games, which described, respectively, information transmission from public reviewers to a <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and an individual. It was shown that there exists an externality between the two games, and the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> accordingly faces a trade-off between the two roles of public reviews. Due to this trade-off, trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and the individual might be prevented. Finally, alternative institutional design for realizing trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and the individual through public reviews was discussed. It was pointed out that a communication protocol that disciplines {{the way in which}} reviewers express their opinions has to be designed in order to realize the two roles of public reviews...|$|R
50|$|In {{his work}} on {{macroeconomic}} modelling and economic policy making, Tinbergen classified some economic quantities as targets and others as instruments. Targets are those macroeconomic variables the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> wishes to influence, whereas instruments are the variables that the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> can control directly. Tinbergen emphasized that achieving the desired values of {{a certain number of}} targets requires the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> to control an equal number of instruments.|$|R
40|$|We {{set up a}} {{theoretical}} model, in which the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> of a tourism destination has to choose how to allocate the limited natural resource - land - between private holiday accommodations (i. e. second homes) or hotels. In a framework of partial equilibrium, the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> minimizes a loss function which measures the loss of political consensus and is de ned by a linear combination of the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and the local community preferences. We can obtain both a corner solution, {{in which we have}} extreme choices of only holiday houses or only hotels, and an internal solution, in which we have a linear combination of them. To do that the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> can use as economic policy instruments either standard policies (indirect control - a Pigou tax - or direct control - regulation) or non-standard policies (a reinvestment commitment of the rm in the tourism destination). The final <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> decision was made by assessing the welfare consequences of the policy implications. ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{option would}} be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{a penalty}} for lying {{as a means}} to reduce {{information}} manipulation. First, we show that the penalties for lying do not always induce an advisor to reveal truthful information. This occurs when the advisor is more biased towards the status quo than the <b>policy</b> <b>maker.</b> Second, contrast to Lupia and McCubbins (1994, 1998), we show that {{the extent to which the}} <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> benefits from an advisor’s valuable information is not always nondecreasing in the size of the penalty. The reason is that a penalty for lying may affect the advisor’s incentives to participate in providing information. In particular, an advisor may choose not to give advice when facing with a sufficiently high penalty for lying, resulting in information loss and decreased quality of <b>policy</b> <b>maker’s</b> decisions. Only when penalty of lying is endogenously determined—i. e. ensuring that the advisor always participate—it helps the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> making better informed decisions. Moreover, with endogenous penalty for lying, the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> may face a trade-off between the need to mitigate information manipulation and the need to obtain information...|$|R

5|$|As a {{workaround}} many <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> try {{to restore}} competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a model where a <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> uses advice {{in order to}} (1) obtain information {{about the consequences of}} an innovation (information motive) and (2) to support political legitimacy of her decision (persuasion motive). We conduct our analysis {{in the context of a}} cheap-talk game with three players: (1) a <b>policy</b> <b>maker,</b> (2) the median voter in parliament or of the electorate and (3) an advisor. The advisor has private information about the consequences of policy. Communication between an advisor and a recipient improves as their preferences are closer aligned. If the preferences of the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> and the median voter are different the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> faces a trade-off. On the one hand, she wants to gain information to judge whether the innovation is worthwhile. On the other hand, she needs to convince the median voter whether the innovation is desirable. 1...|$|R
40|$|Given {{symmetric}} information, it {{is assumed}} that the optimal policy for a <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> is to commit to future removal of tariff protection as this provides the form with a greater incentive to undertake cost reducing effort than otherwise. This policy is shown to be time inconsistent and as a result less cost reducing effort is undertaken than in the credible commitment solution. The introduction of asymmetric information weakens this last result as it allows the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> to credibly commit to at least some removal of tariff protection. As a consequence, the expected value of the <b>policy</b> <b>maker's</b> objective function may be greater under asymmetric information than symmetric information. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2008, a rapid {{shift of}} opinion took place among many {{prominent}} economists {{in favour of}} Keynesian stimulus, and, from October onward, <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> began announcing major stimulus packages, in hopes of heading off {{the possibility of a}} global depression. By early 2009 there was widespread acceptance among the world's economic <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> about the need for fiscal stimulus. Yet by late 2009 the consensus among economists began to break down. In 2010 with a depression averted but unemployment in many countries still high, <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> generally decided against further fiscal stimulus, with several citing concerns over public debt as a justification. Unconventional monetary policy continued to be used in attempts to raise economic activity. By 2016, increasing concerns had arisen that monetary policy was reaching the limit of its effectiveness, and several countries began to return to fiscal stimulus.|$|E
