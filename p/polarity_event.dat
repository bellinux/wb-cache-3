This is the easternmost {{point on the}} margin where pre-rift, syn-rift, and post-rift sediments can be clearly discerned on seismic reflection profiles. A drill core {{to the base of}} the syn-rift sediments revealed 533 meters of thinly-bedded, calcareous, siltstone and sandstone with dispersed detrital gypsum grains and anhydrite nodules. The entire sequence is reversely magnetized, which when placed in the context of the adjacent stratigraphy, suggests that it was deposited during the reversed <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> of the Gilbert epoch (between 4.79 and 5.41 Ma). The environment of deposition for this section is uncertain; however, due to the presence of thin, well-graded layers and a lack of marine fossils, it is possible that the formation was deposited in a closed lacustrine setting. Overlaying the syn-rift sediments are 200 meters of Pliocene to Pleistocene hemipelagic marine sediment with intermittent volcanic glass. This sediment layer is believed to be deposited after the end of rifting due to its subhorizontal seismic reflection profile.|$|E

Palaeomagnetic {{data from}} 101 hand samples {{collected}} in a rock sequence of about 300 m of red beds and igneous rocks of the La Colina Formation (Late Palaeozoic) and Amand-Talampaya Formation (Early Triassic) exposed in north-western Argentina (30 " S 67 " W) are given. Samples were submitted to thermal, chemical and AC cleaning. After cleaning, the majority of La Colina Formation samples showed reversed polarity and yielded a palaeomagnetic pole at 49 " S 343 " E (ag 5 = So), {{which is consistent with}} the K-Ar age (295 * 5 Myr, Late Carboniferous) of a basaltic lava flow situated in the middle of La Colina rock succession. These rocks also recorded a normal <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> (which we haveacorrelated with the latest normal <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> of the Debal'tseva Zone {{at the base of the}} Kiaman Magnetic Interval) and two excursions of the geomagnetic field.

These specimens cover three rather similar {{records of the}} reversed Cobb Mountain short <b>polarity</b> <b>event,</b> having an age of about 1. 12 m. y. On {{the basis of a}} very detailed subsampling every 0. 6 cm, we found that the transition times for the Cobb Mountain geomagnetic <b>polarity</b> <b>event,</b> as seen in the three Lau Basin sediment records, appear to have been as short as 0. 6 - 1. 0 k. y., although the duration of the normal-polarity event itself lasted only about 17 ± 4 k. y. The older (R to N) transition as well as the younger (N to R) transition show virtual geomagnetic paths roughly along the Americas, but shifted some 30 ° ± 10 ° to the east. These paths conflict with Cobb Mountain transition paths recorded in sediments from the Labrador Sea and the North Atlantic, but they are in fair accordance with sediment records from the Celebes and Sulu seas when corrected for differences in site longitude, suggesting that the transitional fields are dominated by nonaxial, high-order spherical harmonics...|$|E

A comprehensive rock magnetic study of the sediments proved that fine-grained magnetite is the principal carrier of the remanent magnetization. No changes in magneto-mineralogy across the polarity transitions in the sediments investigated were found. Calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, AMS- 14 C (accelerated mass spectrometry) and oxygen isotope data, and 10 Be and 230 Th stratigraphies yielded age ranges of 24 - 29 Ka for the Mono Lake event, 34 - 43 Ka for the Laschamp event, 72 - 86 Ka for the Norwegian-Greenland Sea event and 118 - 128 Ka for the Blake <b>event.</b> Two reverse <b>polarity</b> samples {{at the base of}} core PS 2212 - 3 KAL are interpreted as the termination of the Biwa I event (171 - 181 Ka). the events exhibit full inversion of inclination in both cores. the data suggest that the transition process of the Earth's magnetic field during such <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> requires some 1 Ka...|$|R

We hypothesized these regulatory processes {{should also be}} sensitive to a similar cell-cell contact sensor associated with apical-basal <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> at epithelial surfaces. We used two human pancreatic cancer cell lines to explore this hypothesis: one with the capacity to form functional tight junction structures and polarize (HPAFII) and one lacking this capacity (AsPc 1). Occludin (Ocln), a tetraspanning protein associated with TJ structures and capable of establishing external cell-cell contacts, was observed to partially co-localize with Hpo elements YAP (c-yes associated protein) and TEAD (TEA-dependent), which function to drive a proliferative transcription program. Treatment with dobutamine, known to affect YAP, was shown to suppress proliferation in an Ocln-dependent manner. Blockade of protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-ζ) diminished transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of HPAFII monolayers that was not corrected by dobutamine treatment while the loss of TER resulting from inhibition of ROCK 1 could be partially recovered. Examination of normal and cancerous human pancreatic biopsies showed that the cellular localization of Ocln, c-Yes, YAP, and TEAD were similar to HPAFII for normal cells and AsPc 1 for cancerous cells. Together, these results suggest a link between Hpo and signals emanating from cell-cell contacts involving Ocln that may regulate pancreatic cell proliferation through the coordination of planar cell polarity with apical-basal <b>polarity</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report new paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic results from Equatorial Pacific sediments {{obtained}} during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 199 (Site 1220; 10. 17 °N, 142. 75 °W). ODP Leg 199 was designated to collect sediments along a latitudinal transect in the Pacific Ocean {{to better understand}} Paleogene sedimentation patterns and the system of equatorial currents and thus magnetic chronology was an essential part. Continuous paleomagnetic measurements of u-channel samples were complemented by analysis of discrete samples. The results support the overall polarity pattern obtained on the shipboard pass-through magnetometer. Both rock-magnetism and paleomagnetic data show the presence of magnetite as the main carrier of the remanence. The recovered magnetostratigraphy spans from Chron C 20 r (mid-Middle Eocene)) through Chron 6 An. 1 n (Early Miocene) and constitutes an unprecedented record for the Pacific Ocean. Mean sediment accumulation rates range from 8 m/Ma in the middle Eocene to 3 m/Ma in the Late Oligocene. We do not observe short <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> that might account for tiny wiggles in Chrons C 12 r or C 13 r, favoring the interpretation that they represent paleointensity variations of the geomagnetic field. Alternatively, short <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> might have been smoothed or wiped out by delayed remanence acquisition. When plotted against time, paleomagnetic inclinations show a polarity-dependent anomaly, which is larger during times of normal polarity. Possible origins of such inclination anomaly include partial overprint and a non-dipole field contribution...|$|R

40|$|Magnetostratigraphic {{analysis}} of deposits exposed in Cueva del Aleman shows two reversed and two nor-mal chronozones. The lower normal <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> is {{observed in a}} clastic dike and probably predates initial cave formation. Sediments deposited inside the cave proper show a R-N-R sequence and proba-bly date to at least 1. 8 Ma. A fossiliferous clastic dike contains normal polarity with an overlying reversed magnetozone. Audubon’s Shearwater (bird) bones occur in the dike, which is tentatively corre-lated with the lower N polarity zone predating cave formation. If this correlation is correct, the Audubon’s Shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri) range can be extended back to at least 1. 8 Ma, the Olduvai subchron. The caves of Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico, contain evidence of a rather protracted and complicated history. (See Frank et al. 1998, for a description of Isla de Mona.) Many of the caves contain dissolved speleothems, which have been interpreted to indicate at least two separate phreatic events (Mylroie et al. 1995).

The magnetostratigraphic studies revealed that the sediments from this lacustrine sequence were deposited during the Matuyama reverse period, except for the upper part where a short normal polarity episode was recorded. A tephra layer interbedded in the sediments contemporaneous with this normal <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> is dated at 2. 10 +/- 0. 01 Ma by the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method. Using this chronological marker, it can be inferred that the normal polarity episode recorded in the Senèze sequence corresponds to the Réunion event and that {{the age of the}} normal-reverse transition closing this event is ca. 2. 09 Ma. These chronological constraints also permit to (1) demonstrate that the `Villafranchian' mammal fauna found in the Senèze maar is younger than 2. 09 Ma and (2) correlate the climatic events recorded in the Senèze sequence to the marine d 18 O records. This suggests that the Senèze pollen sequence (5 - 120 m depth) ranges from isotopic stage 85 to 76...|$|E

Five holes (Holes 897 A, 897 C, 898 A, 899 A, and 900 A) yielded Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments, which consist mainly of turbidites. Among these, Holes 897 C and 898 A yielded {{significant}} Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments that provided a high-resolution nannofossil biostratigraphy essential for locating paleomagnetic <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> and for interpreting the age and frequency of turbidite sedimentation in the Iberia Abyssal Plain. Pliocene-Pleistocene nannofossils recovered during Leg 149 are generally abundant and well to moderately preserved. Although reworking is evident in most samples, the Pliocene-Pleistocene nannofossils proved quite reliable for dating the sediments. Most Pleistocene zonal boundaries proposed by S. Gartner in 1977 and the Pliocene standard zonal boundaries proposed by E. Martini in 1971 were easily recognized. In addition, several other nannofossil events proposed by D. Rio et al. in 1990 and by T. Sato and T. Takayama in 1992 were recognized and proved valuable for improving the resolution of Pliocene-Pleistocene nannofossil biostratigraphy. The Pliocene-Pleistocene nannofossil biostratigraphic results of Holes 897 C and 900 A coincide rather well with the discerned paleomagnetic <b>polarity</b> <b>events.</b> As a result, the combination of nannofossil biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic studies provides important information for fulfilling the second objective of this leg: to determine the history of turbidite sedimentation in the Iberia Abyssal Plain.

A composite magnetic polarity sequence from sections defines a continuous sequence from Chron C 13 r to C 12 r, from 33. 6 to 33. 17 Ma (Early Oligocene). In addition, a short reverse <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> that correlates to the cryptochron in the GPTS is observed (i. e. in C 13 n). Sequences (transgressive-regressive cycle and confined unconformities) are well identified in Bouldnor Cliff sections marking the sedimentary hiatus as FSST.

The origin of the PEMR has been speculatively related to a change in the Earth’s rotation rate that was in turn influenced by an abrupt overturning of the ocean-atmosphere circulation that occurred during the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) at ∼ 55 Ma. Such provocative genesis for a magnetic-polarity reversal demands the PEMR to be confirmed (or refuted) in additional PETM sections. Here, we present detailed palaeomagnetic and rock-magnetic data from the Forada and Cicogna sections of the Belluno Basin in NE Italy, which contain an expanded and continuous record of the PETM termed clay marl unit (CMU). Our data indicate that these sediments were deposited during a continuous interval of reverse geomagnetic field polarity. We therefore conclude that no magnetic-polarity reversals occurred throughout the PETM. In addition, we studied the origin of the high degree of flattening affecting the characteristic magnetic component directions of the sediments, which we interpret as due to a combination of depositional inclination shallowing typical of detrital haematite, and post-depositional compaction of clays, particularly abundant in the carbonate-depleted CMU...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe human Lkb 1 kinase, encoded by the {{ortholog}} of the invertebrate Par 4 polarity gene, is mutated in Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome. Lkb 1 activity requires complex formation {{with the}} pseudokinase Strad and the adaptor protein Mo 25. The complex can induce complete polarization {{in a single}} isolated intestinal epithelial cell. We describe an interaction between Mo 25 α and a human serine/threonine kinase termed Mst 4. A homologous interaction occurs in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe in the control of polar tip growth. Human Mst 4 translocates from the Golgi to the subapical membrane compartment upon activation of Lkb 1. Inhibition of Mst 4 activity inhibits Lkb 1 -induced brush border formation, whereas other aspects of polarity such as the formation of lateral junctions remain unaffected. As an essential event in brush border formation, Mst 4 phosphorylates the regulatory T 567 residue of Ezrin. These data define a brush border induction pathway downstream of the Lkb 1 /Strad/Mo 25 polarization complex, yet separate from other <b>polarity</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
30|$|Magnetic {{polarity}} {{transitions in}} a Takahashi-Matsushima-Honkura dynamo model are analyzed. Distinctive differences in {{behavior of the}} axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field are found among a polarity reversal and excursions, including short <b>polarity</b> <b>events.</b> At the beginning of magnetic polarity transitions, the magnetic field with the reversed polarity is generated by anti-cyclonic convection columns deep within the outer core. In the case of excursion, it is soon advected by the radial flow toward a shallow interior of the core, and the transition can be detected at the core surface. However, the same process retrieves the original polarity from the deep interior, and the reversed field eventually vanishes. In the case of polarity reversal, on the other hand, the reversed polarity field is persistently generated deep within the core. It is then advected toward a shallow interior of the core, while the generation process of the reversed field occurs successively. The reversed polarity field near the core surface is collected by the downwelling flow associated with convection columns, {{as is the case}} for the original polarity field. The polarity reversal is completed by the advection process, the duration of which is consistent with the flow speed in the core.|$|R

Major characteristic isotopic events were identified and correlated to the standard SPECMAP chronology. In addition, radiocar-bon dating and a few biostratigraphic, geomagnetic and tephrochronologic markers were employed to enhance the reliability and resolution of the age model. The tephra layer of the Toba Eruption at 71 ka helps to anchor the boundary of Stages 5 / 4, and provides a yardstick correlating to the cold period between interstadials 19 and 20 identified in the GISP 2 Greenland ice core.

After a prolonged period of eruptive repose of about 2 Ma, eruptive activity resumed in the island in the middle Matuyama reverse polarity Epoch, with basaltic magmas and fissure eruptions that continued until quite recently (1824), with an eruptive episode of an anomalously high magnitude between 1730 and 1736. The evolutive trends of the related magmas show the presence of a complete evolutive magmatic cycle in the old edifice of Los Ajaches, with magmas evolving by crystal fractionation from alkali basalts to trachytes. In Famara and Tías edifices, magmas are mainly primitive basanites generated by partial melting processes. In the Quaternary volcanism, partial melting-generated basanite-alkali basalt magmas are also predominant, with some superimposed components of crystal fractionation. A significant exception is the 1730 eruption, where the evolution of magmas is completely anomalous in the recent magmatic history of the Archipelago, from basanites to olivine tholeiites, probably in relation with the mixing of magmas from two different magmatic sources.

40|$|Recent paleomagnetic {{results of}} {{extrusive}} rocks from {{high southern latitudes}} (> 60 °S) and high northern latitudes (> 60 °N) have been suggested to reflect a hemispheric asymmetry of the geomagnetic field on time-scales of 105 to 106 yrs, with higher and more stable fields in the north. This interpretation, however, is based on only a few modern-standard paleodirectional data sets and on high northern stable field paleointensity data of rocks that are mainly younger than 100 kyr. The sparsity of modern-standard data questions the validity (and age range) of this potential geomagnetic asymmetry. In 2013 and 2014, we sampled basaltic lava flows in Jökuldalur, north-eastern Iceland, to obtain high-standard paleodirectional and paleointensity data at relatively high-northern latitudes (65. 2 °N). On average, we sampled > 15 cores per site at 51 sites of predominantly Matuyama age. Complete demagnetization was carried out on all samples using AF or thermal demagnetization. We present 45 distinct paleomagnetic directions based on overall N> 10 ChRMs per site and α 95 < 3. 5 °. We obtain a mean direction of D= 355. 7 °, I= 76. 3 °, and α 95 = 3. 2 for N= 45 sites that is {{not significantly different from}} a GAD field. The resulting 45 VGPs distribute around the North Pole, and the global mean paleomagnetic pole (View the MathML source, View the MathML source) is coincident with the North Pole within the α 95 confidence limit. We calculate a VGP dispersion View the MathML source and an average inclination anomaly View the MathML source for our 38 Matuyama age data. The dispersion SB overall supports the interpretation of a dependence of SB on latitude during the Matuyama, while the negligible ΔI suggests little deviation from a GAD field. Based on relatively strict cut-off criteria we also present six new field strength estimates from the time interval ∼ 1. 2 – 1. 83 Ma, thus filling a large data gap of the high-northern stable field behavior. We obtain a median VADM of View the MathML source (VDM of View the MathML source), which is higher than the median VADM of 16 intensity estimates from Antarctica (39 ± 7 ZAm 2) from the same period. A higher northern field is also found when using less strict cut-off criteria resulting in 14 field estimates from Jökuldalur, i. e. we find support for higher field strength in the northern hemisphere as compared to the southern hemisphere during the Matuyama. Finally, we deliver a revised magneto-chronostratigraphic model of Jökuldalur and conduct an investigation of the type sections of the so-called Gilsá normal <b>polarity</b> <b>event</b> around 1. 62 Ma. Our revised model is based on 11 new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. No evidence is found of the existence of the Gilsá event in Jökuldalur.

Two corals have super(230) Th/ super(238) U in secular equilibrium, small excesses in delta super(234) U, and super(206) Pb super(*) / super(238) U ages of 1. 02 plus or minus 0. 07 Ma and 1. 288 plus or minus 0. 034 Ma.

In the first part of the thesis the tephrostratigraphy of the Tongariro area is described. Thirteen rhyolitic tephras erupted from Okataina, Maroa and Taupo Volcanic Centres over the last 20, 000 years are interbedded with local andestitic tephras. The order of succession of the 13 tephras is established by stratigraphy, and is confirmed by their mineralogical composition and by chemical analysis of their titanomagnetites. Seven of the rhyolitic tephras have been previously dated by 14 C, four more (Rotorua Ash, Karapiti Lapilli, Papanetu Tephra and Poronui Tephra) are dated hare, and two others are not yet dated. Six further rhyolitic tephras are of less use as marker beds. Four of these are tentatively correlated with rhyolite tephras from the more northerly volcanic centres and all but one are older than, 20, 000 years BP. These rhyolitic tephra marker beds have provided valuable time control which, together with 12 further radiocarbon dated events has allowed a chronology of the andesitic tephras erupted from vents within the Tongariro Volcanic Centre. Two previously named tephras, Ngauruhoe Tephra and Magatawai Tephra, are given formation status, and a further four formations (Papakai Tephra, Mangamate Tephra, Okupata Tephra and Tetoaira Lapilli) are defined. Ngauruhoe Tephra (0 - 1819 years BP), Mangatawai Tephra (c. 1819 - 2, 500 years BP), and Papakai Tephra (c. 3, 400 - 9, 700 years BP) have all accumulated as a result of intermittent activity from several vents. Mangamate Tephra, with six named members, was erupted mainly from the Tama Lakes-Ngauruhoe area between c. 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Four of the members were deposited eastwards from the Tongariro Massif. The oldest member, Te Rato Lapilli, was erupted c. 9, 780 years BP probably from North Crater. It was distributed in a single lobe to the NNE and is the best andesitic tephra marker bed in rhyolite tephra sequences further north. The youngest member, Poutu Lepilli, was erupted as three lobes (NW, NE, SE) from a source probably at Blue about 9, 700 years BP. Poutu Lapilli has a volume of 0. 9 km 3 and the tephra of the total formation is likely to have destroyed more than 1, 000 km 2 of the pre-Mangamate forest. Ruapehu was very active between c. 10 - 14, 000 years BP. Most of the lapilli and ash beds were deposited east of the volcano and most of the remainder were deposited to the north. The youngest of the units erupted northwards, Okupata Tephra, underlies Te Rato Lapilli and probably has an age between 10 - 12, 000 years BP. Rotoaira Lapilli is prominent north-east of the Tongariro Massif. It was probably erupted from lower Te Meri Crater c. 13, 800 years BP and has been used to define the base of the Tongariro Sub-group. This subgroup is of Aranuian (post-glacial) age and includes all tephras accordant with the present day topography and which have been erupted from the Tongariro Volcanio Centre. Much of the tephra record between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP was lost through contemporaneous erosion and andesitic tephras have been reworked in with Oruanui tephra to from loess beds of late Otiran age. A cool-climate origin for these loesses is consistent with the pollen record of the Tongariro area which shows that between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP there was a change from Nethofagus forest, grassland and shrubland to podocarp-broadleaf forest. This implies a change to a warmer climate during that period. The major erosional unconformities in the Tongariro area are also of this age. An unconformity at the top of the Mangamate Formation (9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP) resulted from erosion during the time taken fro vegetation to recolonise the surface of the thick tephra sequence following total devastation of the forest. Periods of widespread erosion followed deposition of the thick Oruanui Breccia and Taupo Pumice tephra flow units. Widespread present day erosion is probably due primarily to extensive pre-Eurpoean and early Erurpean fires. Late Otiran glacial moraines recognised in five valleys about the Tongariro Massif are older than 14, 700 years BP and moraine on eastern Ruapehu is probably older than 20, 000 years BP. The amount of soil development undergone by andesitic tephra is related to the net rate tephra accumulation. Mangatawai Tephra shows least soil development and had the fastest accumulation rate; Papakai Tephra shows most soil development and had the slowest accumulation rate. The degree of paleosol development also varies according to the distribution of the tephras from the source vents and their related particle sizes; soils around Tongariro were least well development ESE of the massif where the rate of tephra accumulation was highest, and were best developed in the west to south quadrant where the rate of tephra accumulation was lowest. Eruptions of Mangamate Tephra were violent and the tephras were generally very well sorted. These eruptions were from magma of a "new" chemical composition and their depositions was associated with the first tephras erupted for about 10, 000 years from the Taupo Volcanic Centre. It is likely that the upward movement of this andesite of "new" composition and its initial eruption about 10, 000 years ago provided the trigger for eruption of the oldest Taupo Sub-group tephras. Timing of subsequent eruptions of rhyolitic tephra of a "new" magma composition was probably controlled by increases of vapour pressure over confining pressure with subsequent healing of fractures and a new build up of pressure. The concurrent intermittent andesitic volcanism probably had no significant effect on the timing of the youngest rhyolitic eruptions. Ngauruhoe, a composite cone about 900 m high at {{the southern}} end of the Tongariro Massif is considered to have first erupted about 2, 500 years ago and to have completed most of its growth during deposition of Magatawai Tephra. Red Crater which lies within a small scoria cone on the central part of the Tongariro Massif is mainly younger than 3, 400 years BP although the oldest flew can only be dated as younger than 9, 700 years BP. The six lavas extruded before 1819 years BP are olivine andesites; the five lavas extruded since 1819 years BP are basalts. The Te Mari Craters on northern Tongariro have been active from at least 13, 800 years ago to 1896 A. D. Lava was extruded following the eruption of Rotoaira Lapilli (13, 800 years BP) and a large flank extrusion occurred between 9, 700 and 6, 000 years BP. Lava flows from the upper Te Mari Crater were probably extruded in the early 16 th century. North Crater, near the north-western end of the Tongariro Massif probably dated from abut 70, 000 years ago (Stipp 1968) and most of the cone is older than 10, 000 years. A nuee ardente was erupted about 10, 000 years BP and Te Rato Lapilli was erupted about 9, 780 years BP. The upper part of the cone probably dated from 4, 800 years BP and all major eruptions had ceased by 1819 years BP. Blue Lake was the site of the Poutu Lapilli eruption c. 9, 700 years BP and has probably been active more recently. The Upper and Lower Tama Lakes new occupy the sites of many of the Mangamate Tephra eruptions of 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Some eruptions of Papakai Tephra were probably also from this area. Pukeenake Scoria Cone, west of the Tongariro Massif, and the two plugs to its north define a fissure from which extensive olivine andesites were extruded more than 20, 000 years ago. Pukekaikore dome west of Ngauruhoe is possibly an old cumuledome of labradorite andesite flows. Small olivine andesite flows and associated tephra were erupted from a vent near the summit of the dome about 14, 700 years BP. While most of the lahars from the Tongariro Massif are older than 20, 000 years BP at least five occurred on northern Tongariro during deposition of Papkai Tephra, and tree-ring dating provides an estimated age of 1895 A. D. for a historic mudflow from Ketetahi Springs, also on northern Tongariro. Eruptions from the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif are all older than 20, 000 years BP and the youngest may be represented by a nuee ardente deposit from a vent WSW of Tihia. This deposit cams to rest above its Curie point and was radiocarbon dated at > 40, 300 years BP. Eruptions from Rotopounamu Graben and Pihanga are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Lahars from these centres may date back to 0. 6 m. y. but there have been several Aranuian lahars and the most recent were in 1846 and 1910 A. D. Ruapehu erupted numerous tephra beds from 10 - 14, 000 years BP, probably from a northern crater. An extensive as flow from the north-western summit area has an age between 5 - 10, 000 years BP, similar to the age of lava flows from a parasitic vent lower on the northern side. Murimotu Lahars on the lower north-western slopes of Ruapehu span the final 3, 000 years of the tephra deposition. One of the largest lahars, that formed conical mounds, came to rest above its Curie point and is likely to have been initiated by displacement of a crater lake by lave or a growing lava dome. It is probably that this 'hot' lahar, aged between 9, 540 and 12, 450 years BP, occurred during the Gothenburg reverse <b>polarity</b> <b>event.</b> The vent presently occupied by the Crater Lake was initiated probably about 2, 500 years BP and most lahars since that time have been confined to the Whangaehu River. Since 1859 eruptions through Crater Lake have caused two large lahars in Whangaehu River and there have been four cold lahars. The most recent of the cold lahars, on 24 December, 1953 destroyed the railway bridge at Tangiwai about five minutes before an express reached the bridge and 151 lives were lost. Lavas of Hauhungatahi cone, 12 km north-west of Ruapehu, are older than 20, 000 years BP. The explesion craters at Ohakune, about 19 km south-west of the summit of Ruapehu, are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Tephrochronology provides minimum ages for several rhyolite and dacite domes within or near the northern and of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre: Papanetu Tephra was erupted from the site of Kuharua Dome c. 9, 785 years BP towards the end of dome formation; Puketarata Ash was erupted from the site of Puketarata Dome in the Maroa Volcanic Centre towards the end of dome formation approximately 13, 500 years BP; Manganamu Dome is younger than 1819 years BP and Koroi Dome is likely to be close to 1819 years BP; Pukekaikiore Dome is older than 9, 790 years BP; Horohoro Dome is older than 14, 000 years BP; and Motuepuhi Island, Lake Rotoaira, is older than 20, 000 years BP. Ages for several fault movements near the Tongariro Massif are given. At least one fault movement was associated with eruption of the Mangamate Formation. Fault movements at both ends of Lake Rotoaira occurred after eruption of Taupo Pumice and it is suggested that they were in response to eruption of some of the Taupo Pumice from within that lake. The reverse polarity of andesite lava in Tongariro River suggests its extrusion during the Matuyama reverse polarity epoch. The age of > 0. 69 m. y. is the oldest age for lava within Tongariro Volcanic Centre...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution magnetostratigraphic {{analysis}} of three sediment cores {{from the base}} of the volcanic seamount Vesteris Banken in the Greenland Basin and one from the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone revealed records of three pronounced geomagnetic events: the Mono Lake excursion (28 - 27 ka), the Laschamp event (37 - 33 ka) and the Biwa I/Jamaica event (189 - 179 ka). Rock magnetic investigations, measurements of magnetic susceptibility, and ARM and IRM acquisition/demagnetization experiments show that only fine-grained (titano) magnetite (= 1 µm). Besides this, no significant variation in rock magnetic parameters across intervals of intermediate to reversed ChRM inclinations are observed. Therefore, these are interpreted as true records of geomagnetic field variations. The recovered sediments, characterized by only moderate fluctuations in concentration as well as grain-size-related rock magnetic parameters, provided good conditions for the reconstruction of the relative palaeointensity of the geomagnetic field. The recorded geomagnetic events are clearly linked to a drastic reduction in the relative palaeointensity of the field. The lowermost values were obtained for the time of the polarity transition with a trend to higher relative intensities in the course of the <b>polarity</b> <b>events.</b> Event ages and the relative palaeointensity variations, based on different methods, derived from the Greenland Sea sediments investigated are in good agreement with data published in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Embryopathies {{that develop}} as a {{consequence}} of maternal diabetes have been studied intensely in both experimental and clinical scenarios. Accordingly, hyperglycaemia has been shown to downregulate the expression of elements in the non-canonical Wnt-PCP pathway, such as the Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam 1) and Vangl 2. Daam 1 is a formin that is essential for actin polymerization and for cytoskeletal reorganization, and it is expressed strongly in certain organs during mouse development, including the eye, neural tube and heart. Daam 1 gt/gt and Daam 1 gt/+ embryos develop ocular defects (anophthalmia or microphthalmia) that are similar to those detected as a result of hyperglycaemia. Indeed, studying the effects of maternal diabetes on the Wnt-PCP pathway demonstrated that there was strong association with the Daam 1 genotype, whereby the embryopathy observed in Daam 1 gt/+ mutant embryos of diabetic dams was more severe. There was evidence that embryonic exposure to glucose in vitro diminishes the expression of genes in the Wnt-PCP pathway, leading to altered cytoskeletal organization, cell shape and cell polarity in the optic vesicle. Hence, the Wnt-PCP pathway appears to influence cell morphology and cell <b>polarity,</b> <b>events</b> that drive the cellular movements required for optic vesicle formation and that, in turn, are required to maintain the fate determination. Here, we demonstrate that the Wnt-PCP pathway is involved {{in the early stages of}} mouse eye development and that it is altered by diabetes, provoking the ocular phenotype observed in the affected embryos...|$|R
40|$|Extensive geological, {{geophysical}} and geochronological {{data available}} from the Canary Islands establish conclusively that formation of the oldest subaerial volcanic structure of the islands began during the Miocene. A mid-Cretaceous age for these volcanic formations has been postulated in previous works {{on the basis of}} palaeomagnetic determinatiods. The results obtained in the present palaeomagnetic study of Lanzarote include analysis of the record of variations of magnetic inclination in boreholes that penetrate the whole of the oldest volcanic series. They show that the excessive age previously assigned to these formations is due to the utilization of volcanic units with abnormally low (<lSo) magnetic inclinations (LGIs). In Lanzarote, lavas exhibiting LGIs appear interbedded in a volcanic series that, overall, shows a typical Miocene inclination (- 45 "). The units stratigraphically beneath and above the LGI horizons give, in fact, directions consistent with the Middle-Upper Miocene field direction (D = 359 ", I = 45 ", with k = 29, a 95 = 6. 7 " and a palaeopole of 87 "N, 178 "E), thereby confirming the Miocene age of the oldest subaerial volcanics of Lanzarote. Short excursions of the geomagnetic field seem likely to be the explanation for these LGIs, since other factors such as tectonic tilting, post-eruptive modification of the primary remanence or errors in sample orientation can be disregarded. The detection in the Canary Archipelago of volcanic units with abnormally low magnetic inclinations seems {{to be related to the}} relatively continuous record of the geomagnetic field in rapidly growing volcanic edifices, as seems to be indicated by the presence of a few (usually one or two) short <b>polarity</b> <b>events</b> in volcanic suites of several hdndred metres thickness...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{polarity}} {{refers to}} asymmetric organization of cell structure and differential distribution of cellular materials. It is implicated {{in a variety}} of processes including early patterning of organisms, development of organs, stem cell self-renew, junction formation in epithelial cells, cell migration and axonal specification in neurons. In multicellular organisms, the Par complex which is composed of scaffold proteins PAR 3 and PAR 6 (PARtitioning-defective 3 and 6) and the serine/threonine protein kinase aPKC (atypical Protein Kinase C) is involved in all known cell <b>polarity</b> <b>events.</b> This protein complex is thought to receive upstream polarization signals, amplify and relay them downstream to induce cellular responses including cytoskeleton rearrangements and protein localization changes. aPKC is the only enzyme in the Par complex, thus it is a good candidate to amplify polarity signals and to transduce them to downstream. However, neither the substrate specificity nor the regulation mechanism is clear for the enzyme. The catalytic domain of aPKC has been reported to bind to and phosphorylate the aPKC binding domain of PAR 3. To study these questions, biochemical studies were carried out to map the minimal aPKC binding region of PAR 3 and to identify the phosphorylation site(s) of the kinase. The complex structure of aPKC catalytic domain-PAR 3 peptide was solved by X-ray crystallography. The structure, together with biochemistry studies, reveals a set of substrate recognition sites within the aPKC catalytic domain, and allows the consensus substrate sequence of aPKC to be discerned. An unexpected finding from the structure of the aPKC catalytic domain-PAR 3 peptide complex was that the kinase domain assumes an active conformation without the activation loop phosphorylation. This finding suggests that the activity regulation of aPKC originates from a region(s) outside the kinase’s catalytic domain. I further found that the pseudosubstrate sequence of aPKC can directly regulate the kinase activity by inhibiting substrate from binding...|$|R

40|$|Lightning {{detection}} networks {{operating in}} the VLF/LF-regime have been traditionally designed to report cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes with currents above ~ 5 kA while they suppress recording {{of all types of}} cloud discharges (IC) by special methods. Efficient detection and reporting of IC emission has been achieved mainly with VHF arrays. The Munich group studies VLF/LF radiation with methods equally sensitive to CG and IC signals and utilized a new 21 -sensor network (LINET, lightning detection network) to obtain total lightning data by means of a single technique. Three important network features are i) the measurement of estimated currents as low as ~ 1 kA, a range which has attracted little experimental attention in the past, ii) discrimination of IC events from CG strokes by means of a special 3 D-feature in the location algorithm, and (iii) the reporting of IC emission heights. In accordance with general expectations, high IC event rates have been found at low amplitudes. Typical IC’s exhibit multi-polar pulse-trains which defy assignment of a clear-cut sign for the amplitude; however, there is also a large portion of IC events which are sufficiently mono-polar to allow classification as having positive or negative polarity. In most storm cells an excess of positive <b>polarity</b> IC (IC+) <b>events</b> is found; together with negative <b>polarity</b> IC (IC-) <b>events</b> promising information is obtained about discharge types, identification of storm cells and of the onset of super-cell storms and severe weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCilia are at {{the core}} of planar <b>polarity</b> {{cellular}} <b>events</b> in many systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which they influence the polarization process are unclear. Here, we identify the function of the ciliopathy protein Rpgrip 1 l in planar polarity. In the mouse cochlea and in the zebrafish floor plate, Rpgrip 1 l was required for positioning the basal body along the planar polarity axis. Rpgrip 1 l was also essential for stabilizing dishevelled at the cilium base in the zebrafish floor plate and in mammalian renal cells. In rescue experiments, we showed that in the zebrafish floor plate the function of Rpgrip 1 l in planar polarity was mediated by dishevelled stabilization. In cultured cells, Rpgrip 1 l participated in a complex with inversin and nephrocystin- 4, two ciliopathy proteins known to target dishevelled to the proteasome, and, in this complex, Rpgrip 1 l prevented dishevelled degradation. We thus uncover a ciliopathy protein complex that finely tunes dishevelled levels, thereby modulating planar cell polarity processes...|$|R
