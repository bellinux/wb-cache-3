2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of {{radiation}} hardened transistors and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by <b>process</b> <b>engineer</b> David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E

This paper reports the development and application of the process modeling environment Spearmint. The architecture of Spearmint allows for a flexible definition and addition of views which are used for retrieving filtered and tailored presentations of the process models. One distinct view, namely the Electronic Process Guide used for dissemination of process information and guidance of Process Performers, is discussed in more detail. The Spearmint environment has been validated in industrial process engineering cases...|$|R

40|$|Optimum control {{parameter}} setting in complex and stochastic type processes {{is one of}} the most challenging problems to the <b>process</b> <b>engineers.</b> As such, effective model development and determination of optimal operating conditions of electric discharge machining process (EDM) are reasonably difficult. In this apper, an easy to handle optimization procedure, weight-varying multiobjective simulated annealing, is proposed and is applied to optimize two conflicting type response parameters in EDM—material removal rate (MRR) and average surface roughness (Ra) simultaneously. A solution set is generated. The Pareto optimal front thus developed is further modeled. An inverse solution procedure is devised so that near-optimum process parameter settings can be determined for specific need based requirements of <b>process</b> <b>engineers.</b> The results are validated...|$|R

40|$|Tailoring is the {{mechanism}} of adapting a software process {{to the needs of}} a project. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) provides a formal basis and tools infrastructure for automatic software process tailoring. However, the use of a MDE approach can become awkward for most <b>process</b> <b>engineers,</b> because it requires knowledge of MDE concepts and formalisms to implement the required models and tailoring transformations. Proposals trying to address this problem should balance the formality required by MDE and the usability needed by the users. This paper presents a model-based tool and its associated procedure that allow <b>process</b> <b>engineers</b> to automatically generate tailoring transformation rules using a graphical user-interface, obtaining the desired balance. The proposal is illustrated with a running example...|$|R
