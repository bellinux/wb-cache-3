2500|$|Truman State University {{physicist}} Taner Edis, who {{was born}} in Turkey, says the secret <b>to</b> <b>BAV's</b> success is the huge popularity of the Harun Yahya books. [...] "They're fairly lavishly produced, on good-quality paper with full-color illustrations all over the place," [...] he says. [...] "They're trying to compete with any sort of science publication you can find in the Western world. And in a place like Turkey, Yahya books look considerably better-published than most scientific publications." [...] Many of his books have been made into high-resolution videos which are freely downloadable on the Internet.|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{spontaneous}} dissection of celiac trunk {{is a rare}} entity. The spontaneous dissection of the visceral artery occurs without aortic dissection. The {{most consistent}} presenting symptom is acute onset abdominal pain. Complications consist of ischemia, aneurysm formation, and rupture. We report an exceptional case of an isolated spontaneous dissection of the celiac trunk which occurred in a 49 year old male with a previously undiagnosed bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). We also describe the classical appearance in different imaging modalities with a particular emphasis on multidetector computed tomography, and discuss the clinical manifestation and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>BAV...</b>|$|R
40|$|Variable {{coronary}} anatomy {{has been}} described in patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). This was never specified <b>to</b> <b>BAV</b> morphology, and prognostic relevance of coronary vessel dominance in this patient group is unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate valve morphology in relation to coronary artery anatomy and outcome in patients with isolated BAV and with associated aortic coarctation (CoA). Coronary anatomy was evaluated in 186 patients with BAV (141 men (79 %), 51 ± 14  years) by CT and invasive coronary angiography. Correlation of coronary anatomy was made with BAV morphology and coronary events. Strictly bicuspid valves (without raphe) with left-right cusp fusion (type 1 B) had more left dominant coronary systems compared with BAVs with left-right cusp fusion with a raphe (type 1 A) (48 % vs. 26 %, p= 0. 047) and showed more separate ostia (28 % vs. 9 %, p= 0. 016). Type 1 B BAVs had more coronary artery disease than patients with type 1 A BAV (36 % vs. 19 %, p= 0. 047). More left dominance was seen in BAV patients with CoA than in patients without (65 % vs. 24 %, p < 0. 05). The incidence of a left dominant coronary artery system and separate ostia was significantly related <b>to</b> <b>BAVs</b> with left-right fusion without a raphe (type 1 B). These patients more often had significant coronary artery disease. In patients with BAV and CoA, left dominancy is more commo...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} little change in the {{technical}} approach to balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) {{over the last two}} decades. Large-caliber sheaths and extra-stiff wires have been used routinely to accommodate the large balloons used for this purpose. Consequently the morbidity (and possibly mortality) rates have been high. With the recent advances in the interventional hardware, a new look at the current approach <b>to</b> <b>BAV</b> is justified. In this report we describe an 89 -year-old woman with critical aortic stenosis who underwent rapid and successful BAV by the use of a single 8 -French arterial sheath, a regular (and not stiff) wire, and one peripheral balloon. We conclude that BAV can be done easily and safely with the technique and equipment described in this case report...|$|R
40|$|Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common inborn heart defect and a {{continuum}} of a disease process affecting the aortic valve and the thoracic aorta with an increased risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) formation and dissection. Aortic dilatation may be related to haemodynamic perturbations or intrinsic wall abnormalities. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relative contribution of these parameters <b>to</b> <b>BAV</b> aortopathy via integrated analyses. Distribution of circumferential stress in the aorta of <b>BAV</b> patients planned <b>to</b> undergo surgery was analysed using computed tomography imaging and computational modelling. During surgery, aortic biopsies were taken from discrete areas and examined for histological abnormalities. Maximal mechanical stress occurred in the medial ascending aorta in the majority of cases with integrated analyses exhibiting a positive correlation between aortic fibrosis and mechanical stress, both in the root and the ascending aorta. The degree of histological abnormalities and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) activation was also assessed in collected tissue biopsies. Patients with either root dilatation and/or predominant regurgitant valve disease had greater levels of medial wall degeneration in their ascending aorta whereas enhanced TGFβ signalling was present in aneurysmal but also, non-dilated BAV aortic segments, pointing to a genetic trigger. Copy number variation (CNV) analyses in a larger BAV cohort revealed a large heterozygous deletion in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and targeted next-generation sequencing revealed previously reported variants in NOTCH 1, COL 3 A 1, and APOE genes with additional discovery {{of a large number of}} likely pathogenic variants in genes related <b>to</b> <b>BAV</b> formation and aortopathy. In conclusion, different BAV aortic phenotypes were recognised and further analysed. The presence of multiple likely pathogenic variants in sequenced patients suggests a polygenic nature of BAV disease which, in conjuction with local haemodynamic perturbations, supports a mutlifactorial origin of BAV aortopathy.

40|$|Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common {{congenital}} cardiac anomaly in humans. Despite recent advances, the molecular basis of BAV development is poorly understood. Previously {{it has been shown that}} mutations in the Notch 1 gene lead <b>to</b> <b>BAV</b> and valve calcification both in human and mice, and mice deficient in Gata 5 or its downstream target Nos 3 have been shown <b>to</b> display <b>BAVs.</b> Here we show that tissue-specific deletion of the gene encoding Activin Receptor Type I (Alk 2 or Acvr 1) in the cushion mesenchyme results in formation of aortic valve defects including BAV. These defects are largely due to a failure of normal development of the embryonic aortic valve leaflet precursor cushions in the outflow tract resulting in either a fused right- and non-coronary leaflet, or the presence of only a very small, rudimentary non-coronary leaflet. The surviving adult mutant mice display aortic stenosis with high frequency and occasional aortic valve insufficiency. The thickened aortic valve leaflets in such animals do not show changes in Bmp signaling activity, while Map kinase pathways are activated. Although dysfunction correlated with some pro-osteogenic differences in gene expression, neither calcification nor inflammation were detected in aortic valves of Alk 2 mutants with stenosis. We conclude that signaling via Alk 2 is required for appropriate aortic valve development in utero, and that defects in this process lead to indirec...|$|R

40|$|Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV), the leading {{congenital}} heart disease, occurs in 1 %– 2 % of the population. Genetic {{studies suggest that}} BAV is an autosomal-dominant disease with reduced penetrance. However, only 1 gene, NOTCH 1, has been linked <b>to</b> cases of <b>BAV.</b> Here, we show that targeted deletion of Gata 5 in mice leads to hypoplastic hearts and partially penetrant BAV formation. Endocardial cell–specific inactivation of Gata 5 led <b>to</b> <b>BAV,</b> similar <b>to</b> that observed in Gata 5 –/– mice. In all cases, the observed BAVs resulted from fusion of the right-coronary and noncoronary leaflets, the subtype associated with the more severe valve dysfunction in humans. Neither endocardial cell proliferation nor cushion formation was altered {{in the absence of}} Gata 5. Rather, defective endocardial cell differentiation, resulting from the deregulation of several components of the Notch pathway and other important endocardial cell regulators, may be the underlying mechanism of disease. The results unravel a critical cell-autonomous role for endocardial Gata 5 in aortic valve formation and identify GATA 5 as a potential gene responsible for congenital heart disease in humans. Mice with mutated Gata 5 alleles represent unique models to dissect the mechanisms underlying degenerative aortic valve disease and to develop much-needed preventive and therapeutic interventions...|$|R
