5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> and physical disabilities.|$|E

5|$|As more {{information}} about 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards {{the circumstances under which}} he gained and retained gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance, while the police conduct a new background check. 's license was renewed in January 2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} facilitators of {{treatment}} seeking and compliance in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness represents a significant {{gap in the}} current literature. The present study, using a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, attempted to identify facilitators to treatment seeking and compliance through the lived experiences of <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness. Interviews were used to gather information about the experience of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness regarding disability identity development, recovery, interactions with treatment and treatment providers, {{the experience of being}} diagnosed <b>with</b> a severe <b>mental</b> illness, and the impact of psychiatric disability on family, friends, and functioning. Results reflected the importance of religion and spirituality, trust, coping and self-care, disability identity, and social and family support as key facilitators to treatment seeking and compliance in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness. Implications for the provision of services to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness and for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>People</b> <b>with</b> serious <b>mental</b> illness (SMI) {{are more}} likely to have poorer health and poorer health behaviours, and {{therefore}} are at greater risk for cardiometabolic health comorbidities compared to those without SMI. Referral to a specialist cardiometabolic health care nurse may result in increased detection of poor cardiometabolic health in at-risk individuals. In this article, we present the results of the physical health measures of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> serious <b>mental</b> illness who have accessed a community mental health service in a regional centre and argue for the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Our data show the high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, low activity, smoking and nicotine dependence, alcohol misuse disorders, and poor diet among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> serious <b>mental</b> illness. The high prevalence of at-risk factors for poor cardiometabolic health in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> serious <b>mental</b> illness adds support for the role of a specialist cardiometabolic health care nurse in the detection and referral for multidisciplinary treatment to improve the physical health outcomes for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> serious <b>mental</b> illness...|$|R
40|$|<b>People</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> {{illnesses}} die early from cardiovascular disease. Evidence {{is lacking}} regarding effective primary care based interventions to tackle this problem. To identify current procedures for, barriers to, and facilitators of {{the delivery of}} primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses. 75 GPs, practice nurses, service users, community mental health staff and carers in UK GP practice or community mental health settings were interviewed in 14 focus groups which were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis. Five barriers to delivering primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses were identified by the groups: negative perceptions of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses amongst some health professionals, difficulties accessing GP and community-based services, difficulties in managing a healthy lifestyle, not attending appointments, {{and a lack of}} awareness of increased cardiovascular risk in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses by some health professionals. Identified facilitators included involving supportive others, improving patient engagement with services, continuity of care, providing positive feedback in consultations and goal setting. We identified a range of factors which can be incorporated in to the design, delivery and evaluation of services to reduce cardiovascular risk for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses in primary care. The next step is determining the clinical and cost effectiveness of primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illnesses, and evaluating the most important components of such interventions...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines congregations' {{sponsorship of}} social services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders. Using data from a nationally representative sample of U. S. congregations, the 2000 US Census, and the 2006 General Social Survey, I address three research questions: What proportion of congregations sponsor services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders?; How do congregational characteristics affect the likelihood that congregations sponsor these services?; How do neighborhood characteristics and community assessments affect the likelihood that congregations sponsor these services?; Does {{being a member of}} a congregation that sponsors these services affect their members' support for government spending on mental health care? The findings indicate that 8 % of congregations sponsor services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders and that religious ideology affects whether congregations sponsor these services. Congregations located in neighborhoods with disadvantaged populations are more likely to sponsor services if they conduct a needs assessment study of their communities while congregations in neighborhoods with advantaged populations are less likely to sponsor services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders if they conduct a needs assessment study of their communities. Belonging to congregations that sponsor services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders does not have a direct effect on their members' support for government funding of mental health care. It does, however, have indirect effects. People who belong to congregations that sponsor services for <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> disorders and who pray frequently are less likely to support increased government spending on mental health care.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the largest}} single cause of death among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> disorders, such as {{schizophrenia}} and bipolar disorder. Smoking rates are very high among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> disorders, considerably increasing their risk of CVD. In addition, many <b>people</b> <b>with</b> such disorders also suffer from obesity related to inactivity, unhealthy diets, excessive alcohol consumption and some psychiatric medications. Despite increasing recognition of the widespread impact that smoking and other unhealthy behaviours have on increased morbidity and mortality, treatment of physical health problems is often neglected among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> disorders. Research evaluating interventions seeking to change multiple health behaviours indicates that these are feasible and effective.

40|$|Objectives:  Comparatively few <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness are {{employed}} despite evidence {{that many people}} within this group wish to obtain, can obtain and sustain employment, and that employment can contribute to recovery. This investigation aimed to: (i) describe the current policy and service environment within which <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness receive employment services; (ii) identify evidence-based practices that improve employment outcomes for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness; (iii) {{determine the extent to}} which the current Australian policy environment is consistent with the implementation of evidence-based employment services for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness; and (iv) identify methods and priorities for enhancing employment services for Australians <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness through implementation of evidence-based practices. Method:  Current Australian practices were identified, having reference to policy and legal documents, funding body requirements and anecdotal reports. Evidence-based employment services for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness were identified through examination of published reviews and the results of recent controlled trials. Results:  Current policy settings support the provision of employment services for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness separate from clinical services. Recent studies have identified integration of clinical and employment services as a major factor in the effectiveness of employment services. This is usually achieved through co-location of employment and mental health services. Conclusions:  Optimal evidence-based employment services are needed by Australians <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness. Providing optimal services is a challenge in the current policy environment. Service integration may be achieved through enhanced intersectoral links between employment and mental health service providers as well as by co-locating employment specialists within a mental health care setting...|$|R
