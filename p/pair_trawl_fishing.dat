5000|$|<b>Pair</b> <b>trawling</b> is a <b>fishing</b> {{activity}} {{carried out}} by two boats, with one towing each [...] (the towing cables). As {{the mouth of the}} net is kept open by the lateral pull of the individual vessels, otter boards are not required. By utilising the towing power of two boats, and as no otter boards are needed, a larger net may be worked than would otherwise be possible, or alternatively, the two boats can share increased fuel efficiency.|$|R

50|$|In {{midwater}} trawling, a cone-shaped net can be towed {{behind a}} single boat and spread by trawl doors, {{or it can}} be towed behind two boats (<b>pair</b> <b>trawling)</b> which act as the spreading device. Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic <b>fish</b> such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as: cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R
50|$|A factory {{stern trawler}} is a large stern trawler which has {{additional}} onboard processing facilities and can stay at sea for days or weeks at a time. A stern trawler tows a <b>fishing</b> <b>trawl</b> net and hauls the catch up a stern ramp. These can be either demersal (weighted bottom trawling); pelagic (mid-water trawling); or <b>pair</b> <b>trawling,</b> where two vessels about 500 metres apart together pull one huge net with a mouth circumference of 900 meters.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{increased}} efficiency of <b>pair</b> <b>trawling,</b> vessels are able to tow their gears in mid-water at a faster speed to target species which are normally able to escape trawl nets, such as the European seabass. This has caused some controversy, due to {{the high level of}} marine mammal bycatch associated, leading to the British government introducing a ban on <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> for bass in UK territorial waters.|$|R
50|$|The Agulhas Bank is also {{significant}} for fisheries who use demersal <b>trawling,</b> demersal longline <b>fishing,</b> and midwater <b>trawl</b> <b>fishing</b> on the bank.

40|$|Pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> for tuna, Thunnus spp., and swordfish, Xiphias gladius, was {{introduced}} in U. S. Northwest Atlantic waters in 1991. During autumn (October-November) of 1992 under the authority oft he Federal Atlantic Swordfish Regulations, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed observers aboard pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels to document the catch, bycatch, discard, and gear used in this new fishery. The fishery is conducted primarily at night along shelf-edge waters from June to November. In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species. Bycatch also included swordfish, large sharks, pelagic rays and other pelagic fishes, other tunas, and marine mammals...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{sector in}} India has {{transformed}} from subsistence {{level to the}} status of an industry in the last five decades and contributes about 1. 4 per cent to the country's GOP. Mechanization of <b>fishing</b> (mainly <b>trawl</b> <b>fishing)</b> is one of the factors responsible for this transformation. Presently about 47, 000 mechanized crafts operate in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone, harvesting the fishery resources in the inshore waters (0 - 50 m depth) and even beyond. In <b>trawl</b> <b>fishing,</b> the fishermen follow different fishing methods like multiday or voyage fishing, lasting for about 5 to 12 days to get more catch and hence, income. These methods have not only brought higher catch but also caused the indiscriminate exploitation of commercially important fishery resources.

40|$|The lucrative {{external}} market for shrimp and constant {{rise in the}} mechanised <b>trawl</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets not only enhanced the marine fish production of our country but also showed {{the way for the}} growth of an organised sea food export industry and increase in employment opportunities in the subsidiary sector. In this context, a study was undertaken at nagapattinam centre of Tamil Nadu coast where the operation of ordinary trawlers and pair trawlers is common. The study indicates that pomfrets contributed to more than 50 per cent of the revenue of pair trawlers and prawns about 50 percent of the revenue of trawlers. The <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> further provided a new technique to fishermen of this region to harvest the hitherto underexploited valuable resources like pomfrets, rays, croakers, clupeids, carangids and perches in substantial quantity. The introduction of single and two boats high opening trawl nets not only served as diversification of the existing bottom trawling but also directed to redeploy many units to catch commercially important finfishes depending upon the seasonal abundance. The trawl catch forms more than 90 per cent of the mechanised landings and 50 % of the total landings of the state. The study indicates that both types of fishing are economically efficient...|$|R
