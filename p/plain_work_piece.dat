40|$|During the {{machining}} processes, heat gets generated {{as a result}} of plastic deformation of metal and friction along the tool‚Äìchip and tool‚Äìwork piece interface. In materials having high thermal conductivity, like aluminium alloys, large amount of this heat is absorbed by the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> This results in the rise in the temperature of the <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> which may lead to dimensional inaccuracies, surface damage and deformation. So, it is needed to control rise in the temperature of the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> This paper focuses on the measurement, analysis and prediction of <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> temperature rise during the dry end milling operation of Al 6063. The control factors used for experimentation were number of flutes, spindle speed, depth of cut and feed rate. The Taguchi method was employed for the planning of experimentation and L 18 orthogonal array was selected. The temperature rise of the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> was measured with the help of K-type thermocouple embedded in the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Signal to noise (S/N) ratio analysis was carried out using the lower-the-better quality characteristics.
