5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E

25|$|Originally, FMG {{planned to}} {{increase}} the production at Cloud Break to 55 million tonnes through a US$220 million upgrade of the plant, but {{this had to be}} abandoned in October 2009 because of funding difficulties through its Chinese investors. Instead, Fortescue decided to develop the Christmas Creek deposit, at a cost of US$360 million, by building a mine and <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> there and linking it to its existing rail network. Christmas Creek is scheduled to produce 16 million tonnes of iron ore in its first year of operation. Fortescue plans to reach an annual production of 95 million tonnes of iron ore by 2012, downgraded from an earlier target of 120 million.|$|E

40|$|This study {{exploits}} the sequential coordinate randomization {{search method}} for optimizing LNG (liquefied natural gas) <b>process</b> <b>plants.</b> The coordinate search {{is based on}} the idea of minimizing the multivariable function considering one variable at a time. The random element is incorporated in the coordinated search for an exhaustive exploration of decision variable space. A simple implementation with few operating parameters makes the proposed approach suitable for the optimization of highly non-linear LNG <b>process</b> <b>plants.</b> The efficacy of the proposed methodology was tested on the well-known SMR (single mixed refrigerant) and propane pre-cooled mixed refrigerant (C 3 MR) process of NG liquefaction. The main decision variables in SMR and C 3 MR <b>process</b> <b>plants</b> were identified and optimized in terms of the compression energy. The results were compared with the heuristic results, which revealed the superiority, simplicity and suitability of the proposed sequential coordinate random search algorithm for LNG <b>process</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

In April 2013, the benefit unemployed rate in Berkhamsted's parliamentary constituency was 1.7 percent, compared to 7.8 percent for the UK. People from Berkhamsted were employed as follows: 17.5 percent worked as managers, directors and senior officials; 27.5 percent professional occupations and 8.5 percent in associate professional and technical occupations; 10 percent were employed in administrative and secretarial occupations; 7 percent in skilled trades; 6 percent Caring, leisure and other service occupations; 5 percent were in sales and customer service occupations; 3 percent were in <b>process,</b> <b>plant</b> and machine operatives; and 5.5 percent worked in elementary occupations. Of the employed residents living in both Berkhamsted and Tring, 35 percent live and work in the towns, whilst 65 percent commute to workplaces out of the towns, particularly to London. Of the 7,100 people who work in Berkhamsted, 58 percent commute to Berkhamsted to work. In 2011, 9.5 percent of Berkhamsted residents (aged 16 to 74 in employment) worked mainly at or from home; 52 percent drove to work by car (2.5 as a passenger in a car); 22.34% travelled by public transport and 12.73% cycled or walked to work. In 2011, during an average commute to work, was 21 kilometres.|$|E
