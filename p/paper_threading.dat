Brett Alexander is inspired to create with <b>paper</b> yarn. <b>Paper</b> <b>thread</b> proves a unique material {{for him to}} utilise his extensive skills in textile craft techniques.

By contrast, the microfluidic devices in recent use are costly to fabricate due to the complicated workings and processes required and are difficult to utilize without the appropriate training. It is desired that simple microfluidic devices are produced at low cost and by relatively unskilled persons, which will make them available for a wider range of purpose, particular in undeveloped regions.

Acting as skin, boundary, veil, or terrain, the surfaces I created revealed imprints and residues that offered information used to clarify distorted perceptions. I attempted to locate evidence in parts of my body, and in physical matter, that contained a record of history. The work was often site specific, with the wall playing an intrinsic role {{in the construction of}} these pieces, made of <b>paper,</b> <b>thread,</b> and wax. Their surfaces referenced landscapes of the earth and of the body, a mental terrain shaped over time by the paths of repetitive thoughts and the steady advance of emotional forces. In the end, the surfaces asked more questions than they could answer, and it was this mystery within the surfaces that I would devote myself to. The work embraced ambiguity, shadows, and what was hidden beneath the surface...|$|R

Multiple important data concerning the designed expandable tubular threaded joint have been obtained through the study.

5000|$|The Lloyd Loom {{process was}} invented in 1917 by the American Marshall B. Lloyd, who twisted kraft paper around a metal wire, placed the <b>paper</b> <b>threads</b> on a loom and wove them into {{what was to become}} the {{traditional}} Lloyd Loom fabric. Lloyd Loom chairs quickly became very popular in the United States and in 1921, Marshall B. Lloyd sold his patent to an English manufacturer, W (William) Lusty & Sons, who used the Lloyd Loom fabric to create a collection of typical English utility furniture. Primarily due to its durability and secondly the relative affordability of the finished product, Lusty Lloyd Loom as it became known was soon all the rage in Europe. At the height of its popularity, in the 1930s, Lusty Lloyd Loom furniture could be found in hotels, restaurants and tea rooms, as well as aboard a Zeppelin, cruise ships and ocean-going liners, becoming a household name. The Lusty family developed over one thousand designs, and over ten million pieces of Lusty Lloyd Loom were made in America and Great Britain before 1940. Pieces of Lusty Lloyd Loom made in 1922 are still in regular use todayneeded.|$|R

40|$|This <b>paper</b> explores <b>thread</b> {{scheduling}} on {{an increasingly}} popular architecture: chip multiprocessors with simultaneous multithreading cores. Conventional multiprocessor scheduling, applied to this architecture, {{will attempt to}} balance the thread load across cores. This research demonstrates that such an approach eliminates {{one of the big}} advantages of this architecture – the ability to use unbalanced schedules to allocate the right amount of execution resources to each thread. However, accommodating unbalanced schedules creates several difficulties, the biggest being the fact that the search space of all schedules (both balanced and unbalanced) is much greater than that of the balanced schedules alone. This work proposes and evaluates scheduling policies that allow the system to identify and migrate toward good thread schedules, whether the best schedules are balanced or unbalanced. ...|$|R
