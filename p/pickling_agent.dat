5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of hydrochloric acid is in the pickling of steel, to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing, such as extrusion, rolling, galvanizing, and other techniques. Technical quality HCl at typically 18% concentration is the most commonly used <b>pickling</b> <b>agent</b> for the pickling of carbon steel grades.|$|E

25|$|Sodium acetate {{is used in}} {{the textile}} {{industry}} to neutralize sulfuric acid waste streams and also as a photoresist while using aniline dyes. It is also a <b>pickling</b> <b>agent</b> in chrome tanning and helps to impede vulcanization of chloroprene in synthetic rubber production. In processing cotton for disposable cotton pads, sodium acetate is used to eliminate the buildup of static electricity.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and <b>pickling</b> <b>agents</b> may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process {{for the production of}} an easily solderable metallization layer on a non-solderable surface. In known processes, in particular for fast oxidizing surfaces such as aluminium, a previous process step is required to destroy the surface oxide layer which is difficult to handle in plasma etching or when using aggressive chemical <b>pickling</b> <b>agents.</b> In the process according to the invention, the oxide layer is broken up and a seeding material is deposited in a simple manner in one step. The seeding material on a substrate is transferred to the aluminium surface by means of energy-rich radiation, whereby the oxide layer is previously broken up by the energy beam and particles of the seeding material are excited by the said beam. Using a reflecting device for the energy beam relative to the non-solderable surface, any desired metallization layer structure can be quickly and precisely applied using seeding material. In order to obtain a subsequent selective metalli zation of the seeded surface areas, no-flow, low-cost mass processes in baths can be preferably used...|$|R
50|$|Glucono delta-lactone (GDL), {{also known}} as gluconolactone, is a food {{additive}} with the E number E575 used as a sequestrant, an acidifier, or a curing, <b>pickling,</b> or leavening <b>agent.</b> It is a lactone of D-gluconic acid. Pure GDL is a white odorless crystalline powder.|$|R
25|$|In metalworking, {{hydrofluoric}} acid {{is used as}} a <b>pickling</b> <b>agent</b> to remove oxides and other impurities from stainless and carbon steels because of its limited ability to dissolve steel. It is used in the semiconductor industry as a major component of Wright Etch and buffered oxide etch, which are used to clean silicon wafers. In a similar manner it is also used to etch glass by reacting with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. It {{can also be used to}} polish and frost glass.|$|E

50|$|In Hungary {{the main}} meal (lunch) usually goes {{with some kind}} of pickles (savanyúság) but they are {{commonly}} consumed at other times of the day too. The most commonly consumed pickles are sauerkraut (savanyú káposzta), the different kinds of pickled cucumbers and peppers and csalamádé but tomatoes, carrots, beetroot, baby corn, onions, garlic, certain squashes and melons and a few fruits like plums and apples are used to make pickles too. Stuffed pickles are specialties usually made of peppers or melons pickled after being stuffed with a cabbage filling. Pickled plum stuffed with garlic is a unique Hungarian type of pickle just like csalamádé and leavened cucumber (kovászos uborka). Csalamádé a type of mixed pickle made of cabbage, cucumber, paprika, onion, carrot, tomatoes and bay leaf mixed up with vinegar as the fermenting agent. Leavened cucumber, unlike other types of pickled cucumbers that are around all year long, is rather a seasonal pickle produced in the summer. Cucumbers, spices, herbs and slices of bread are put in a glass jar with salt water and kept in direct sunlight for a few days. The yeast from the bread, along with other <b>pickling</b> <b>agents</b> and spices fermented under the hot sun, give the cucumbers a unique flavor, texture and slight carbonation. Its juice {{can be used to make}} a special type of spritzer ('Újházy fröccs') instead of carbonated water.It is common for Hungarian households to produce their own pickles. Different regions or towns have their special recipes unique to them. Among them all the Vecsési Sauerkraut (Vecsési savanyú káposzta) is the most famous.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to get deliming agents having function s bleaching <b>agent</b> in <b>pickle</b> process, but it also keeps {{the quality of the}} pickles and waste water remaining good. Deliming process is conducted on the preparation of <b>pickles.</b> Five deliming <b>agents</b> were used on the experiment, they were ZA 2 % (I), NH 4 Cl 2 % (II), NaHSO 32 % (III), a combination of ZA 1 % and NH 4 Cl 0, 5 % (IV), and a combination of ZA 1 % and NH 4 Cl 1 % (V). The quality of the pickles were then evaluated on the shade and the acceptance of panelists. In order to ascertain wheter or not the process be related as environmentally friendly one, the waste water quality were also evaluated. The results showed that NH 4 Cl 2 % was the best deliming agent as well as a bleaching agent...|$|R

50|$|In {{chemical}} pickling, {{the food}} is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the <b>pickling</b> <b>agent.</b> Common chemically pickled foods include cucumbers, peppers, corned beef, herring, and eggs, as well as mixed vegetables such as piccalilli.|$|E

50|$|An {{offshoot}} {{that took}} root in Anglo-Indian cuisine {{is usually a}} tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar {{was added to the}} recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or else to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a <b>pickling</b> <b>agent,</b> but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product that in western cuisine is usually eaten with a Cheddar-type cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.|$|E
5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of acid pickled steel strip primarily because acid pickling imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not. This penalty {{is a result of}} chemical reactions that occur after acid pickling and serve as a catalyst for oxidation. The primary <b>pickling</b> <b>agent</b> is hydrochloric acid (HCl). Although the steel strip is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some residual amount of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen. This mechanism makes acid-pickled steel more prone to picking up oxygen, whereas there is no comparable mechanism at work with EPS mechanical pickling.|$|E
