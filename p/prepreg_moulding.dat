40|$|AbstractAutoclave <b>prepreg</b> <b>moulding</b> {{technique}} {{has been the}} traditionally used process for the manufacture of primary aircraft composite structures. Alternate processing technologies, which are cost effective and less energy intensive, are being explored by the industry. Techniques like liquid composite moulding, especially variants of {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} moulding (VARTM) processes have been successfully applied to realise large sized components albeit with minimum degree of cocuring. CSIR-NAL has developed a proprietary infusion process called ‘Vacuum Enhanced Resin Infusion Technology’ (VERITy) which can be used for large scale cocuring. The objective was to realise a co-infused and cocured wing test box consisting of bottom skin, spars, ribs, gussets and stringers. The challenge lies in the usage of appropriate tooling philosophy to suit the infusion process and control of flow characteristics in a complex preform with proper infusion strategy. A ‘Rigid–Flexible’ tooling concept was adopted so that the applied pressure is faithfully transferred by tools to the preform underneath for proper consolidation, without compromising on dimensional requirements. Infusion of resin into well compacted network of reinforcement with varying thickness is tricky and difficult because of the complex flow characteristics. Infusion strategy was worked out based on the experimental data as the flow simulation at such a level is equally challenging. Both parallel and series infusions were adopted for co-infusing the wing test box. Ultrasonic scan results show that the part was defect free vindicating tooling concepts and infusion strategies adopted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prepreg</b> {{compression}} <b>moulding</b> (PCM) potentially fulfils {{the requirements}} for high-volume applications of structural thermoset composites. Preforming of thermoset prepregs {{is a first step}} in PCM followed by consolidation and curing. High volume manufacturing necessitates automation of the preforming stage in order to achieve the required production rate and repeatability. The present work investigates the processing of thermoset prepregs based on in-plane shear characterisation tests along with preforming experiments using classical hemispherical dome tests. The second part of this work proposes a simplified numerical scheme for prepreg preforming analysis using superimposed finite elements. The elements share common nodes. One of the sets of elements is assigned with the bi-directional material data of fibrous reinforcement. The second set of elements is allocated to resin behaviour. The scheme has the advantages of defining controlled fibre-to-resin ratio and predicting the stress field within individual constituents in the subsequent structural analysis. Although the deformation behaviour of structural prepregs is largely driven by fibrous reinforcement, however, it has been observed here that the resin contributes to alter the shear rigidity of the material which eventually affects the shaping behaviour of the deformed prepreg. It has also been shown that the proposed numerical approach is capable of predicting the deformation behaviour of the prepreg. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} aircraft {{led to the}} development of innovative lightweight constructions and the use of lightweight materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics. In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry. However, current processes for producing lightweight composites with an excellent mechanical performance cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison with approved metal processes. Furthermore the used raw materials, such as carbon fibres and resin, are very expensive. In contrast to these technologies Sheet Moulding Compound is characterised by a very high productivity, excellent part reproducibility, cost efficiency and the possibility to realise parts with complex geometries and integrated functions, e. g. inserts or colouring. The biggest disadvantage of Sheet Moulding Compound parts is a low level of stiffness and strength because of a low fibre-volume fraction, a short fibre length and isotropic fibre distribution. In this context the combination of Sheet <b>Moulding</b> Compound and <b>Prepreg</b> compression <b>moulding</b> in an one-shot compression moulding and curing process merges the advantages of both materials to create load-bearing and autoclave-quality parts without an autoclave. In the following article, this new technology and its potential will be presented. This paper will also deal with the resulting material characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Excellent {{specific}} stiffness, good {{thermal stability}} and diversiform designability are obvious characteristics of carbon fiber composite(CFRP), which {{make it a}} new ideal material for the lightweight reflectors, especially for large diameter and high resolution space reflectors. The present situation of the research of optical mirrors in our country and on abroad was briefly introduced. Then according to the characteristics of mirrors, selection requirements of carbon fiber composite for mirror and foreign prepreg system commonly used were introduced. Manufacturing method of carbon fiber composite optical mirror {{is different from that}} of the traditional optical materials. Usually, the high efficiency, fast and low cost replication process is used for carbon fiber composite mirror. The optical replication of carbon fiber composite mirrors, and factors affecting the accuracy of replicated mirror were emphatically introduced, and the factors including the <b>mould,</b> <b>prepreg</b> layup, deformation of mirror, fiber print-through, dimensional stability and size of mirror, etc. And the corresponding control measures to reduce the influence degree were put forward for the former five factors. Causes and solutions of mirror fiber print-through, and the key to control dimensional stability of mirror were focused. © 2017, Chinese Society for Composite Materials.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in aerospace structures mainly due to their high specific strength and stiffness, coupled with increased durability and lower maintenance costs. Most primary composite aero structures use <b>prepreg</b> based autoclave <b>moulded</b> Carbon epoxy composites. Advanced Composites Division of CSIR-NAL has developed and patented a resin infusion technique called Vacuum Enhanced Resin Infusion Technology (VERITy) {{for the development of}} co-cured wing for the SARAS-PT 3 aircraft using Carbon fabric and Epoxy resin. Carbon based laminated composites, are generally known to be vulnerable to impact damages such as tool drop. Damage due to low velocity impact on laminated composites can be dangerous since they can lead to significant reduction in strength even when it is barely visible to naked eye. Post-impact tests such as compression-after-impact or tension-after-impact have been used to study the degradation in strength and quantify the effect of impact damage. This report presents the damage characteristics and residual compression strength of Carbon epoxy laminates processed using VERITy and subjected to low velocity impact under room temperature ambient (RTA) condition. Carbon UD Fabric G 0827 BB 1040 HP 03 1 F manufactured by Ms. Hexcel Composites is used as the reinforcement. The resin system is Epolam 2063 supplied by M/s. Axson. Dent depth, damage area and post-impact residual compression strength are measured for laminates of various thicknesses and impact energies...|$|R
