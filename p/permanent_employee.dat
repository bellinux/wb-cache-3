25|$|Employment {{rights for}} women include {{non-discriminatory}} access {{of women to}} jobs and equal pay. The rights {{of women and men}} to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from <b>permanent</b> <b>employee</b> to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975. In addition, marriage bars, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{received}} his primary education at Centenary Tabernacle Day School before entering United Methodist Collegiate School in 1911. There, he engaged in numerous leadership activities. On one such occasion, he led his classmates in {{a protest against}} unreasonable punishment by school authorities. He also edited the school's newspaper, Wall Paper. He dropped out two years later to support his family. He was first employed as a temporary outdoor officer at the customs department. Soon, he became a <b>permanent</b> <b>employee</b> of the department. He became involved in a labour strike for increased pay and better working conditions. It is widely believed that Wallace-Johnson led the strike, but this fact remains uncertain. All employees involved in the strike were dismissed, but reinstituted to their jobs a year later after the Secretary of State for the Colonies assessed the case. During the one-year break, he held jobs as a surveyor, farmer, fisher and a clerk in a law office. He was very popular as a lay preacher among rural villagers. He was interested in joining the ministry, but he lacked the proper education needed to enter the occupation. All during this time, he wrote articles in the Aurora, a newspaper edited by H. C. Bankole-Bright. Wallace-Johnson considered Bankole-Bright {{to be the most}} influential person in his life at the time. Following a 1938 feud, Bankole-Bright would become Wallace-Johnson's political nemesis.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis investigates how {{temporary}} employees’ motivation changes when {{a company}} starts to hire more <b>permanent</b> <b>employees.</b> It is imperative to know how changes in the work situation affects the motivation of the employees, because motivation can {{be the difference between}} a successful or a non-successful organisation. I used costumer service surveys as an indicator of performance, and looked at performance as a continuation of motivation. The increase in <b>permanent</b> <b>employees</b> took place {{in the first week of}} 2016, which made it possible for me to do a difference in differences analysis before and after the increase in <b>permanent</b> <b>employees.</b> In addition, I also performed an event study.

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study is}} {{an examination of}} <b>permanent</b> <b>employees</b> and external consultants and the factors that affect their knowledge sharing behavior. It aims at answering the research question: What factors enhance knowledge-sharing behavior of external consultants, in comparison with <b>permanent</b> <b>employees?</b> A quantitative method is used to collect and analyze the empirical data, collected from {{the oil and gas}} industry in Norway, an industry with growing use of external consultants. Past research on knowledge sharing has been conducted mainly on standard work relations. Thus, the theoretical framework and hypotheses are developed on this basis. Due to the nature of external consultancy work, the main hypothesis of this research is that external consultants are more reluctant to share knowledge. As employment contract is expected to influence an individual‘s attitudes and behavior, this study compares <b>permanent</b> <b>employees</b> and external consultants along several factors that may affect knowledge sharing behavior, namely: organizational support, integration, organizational commitment, trust, individual motivation, and job autonomy. The results of this research found no significant difference in knowledge sharing behavior of <b>permanent</b> <b>employees</b> and external consultants, while organizational support, trust, and intrinsic motivation were found to be important factors enhancing knowledge sharing between employees. Results also show that external consultants are more extrinsically motivated and have a lower perception of job autonomy than <b>permanent</b> <b>employees,</b> which may have implications for individual initiative and accountability...|$|R
