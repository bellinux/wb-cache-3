2500|$|If the <b>prime</b> <b>swarm</b> has {{a virgin}} queen {{and the old}} queen, the old queen will usually be allowed to live. [...] The old queen {{continues}} laying.

2500|$|When a young virgin queen {{emerges from}} a queen cell, she will {{generally}} seek out virgin queen rivals and attempt to kill them. Virgin queens will quickly find and kill (by stinging) any other emerged virgin queen (or be dispatched themselves), {{as well as any}} unemerged queens. [...] Queen cells that are opened on the side indicate that a virgin queen was likely killed by a rival virgin queen. [...] When a colony remains in swarm mode after the <b>prime</b> <b>swarm</b> has left, the workers may prevent virgins from fighting and one or several virgins may go with after-swarms. [...] Other virgins may stay behind with the remnant of the hive. Some virgins have been seen to escape the hive to avoid being killed and seek out another without a queen, such as in the eusocial bee Melipona scutellaris. As many as 21 virgin queens have been counted in a single large swarm. When the after-swarm settles into a new home, the virgins will then resume normal behavior and fight to the death until only one remains.|$|E
40|$|Caulobacter crescentus divides asymmetrically into a swarmer {{cell and}} a stalked cell, {{a process that}} is governed by the {{imbalance}} in phosphorylated levels of the DivK cell fate determinant in the two cellular compartments. The asymmetric polar localization of the DivJ kinase results in its specific inheritance in the stalked daughter cell where it phosphorylates DivK. The mechanism for the polar positioning of DivJ is poorly understood. SpmX, an uncharacterized lysozyme homolog, is shown here to control DivJ localization and activation. In the absence of SpmX, DivJ is delocalized and dysfunctional, resulting in developmental defects caused by an insufficiency in phospho-DivK. While SpmX stimulates DivK phosphorylation in the stalked cell, unphosphorylated DivK in the swarmer cell activates an intricate transcriptional cascade that leads to the production of the spmX message. This event <b>primes</b> the <b>swarmer</b> cell for the impending transition into a stalked cell, a transition that is sparked by the abrupt accumulation and localization of SpmX to the future stalked cell pole. Localized SpmX then recruits and stimulates DivJ, and the resulting phospho-DivK implements the stalked cell fate. The dynamic interplay between SpmX and DivK {{is at the heart of}} the molecular circuitry that sustains the Caulobacter developmental cycle...|$|R

5000|$|Back at the {{original}} hive, the first virgin queen to emerge from her cell immediately seeks to kill all her rival queens still waiting to emerge. Usually, however, the bees deliberately prevent her from doing this, in which case, she too leads a second swarm from the hive. Successive swarms are called [...] "after-swarms" [...] or [...] "casts" [...] and can be very small, often with just a thousand or so bees—as opposed to a <b>prime</b> <b>swarm,</b> which may contain as many as ten to twenty-thousand bees.|$|E

50|$|Swarming is {{the process}} by which a new honey bee colony is formed when the queen bee leaves the colony with a large group of worker bees. In the <b>prime</b> <b>swarm,</b> about 60% of the worker bees leave the {{original}} hive location with the old queen. This swarm can contain thousands {{to tens of thousands of}} bees. Swarming is mainly a spring phenomenon, usually within a two- or three-week period depending on the locale, but occasional swarms can happen throughout the producing season.Secondary afterswarms may happen but are rare. Afterswarms are usually smaller and are accompanied by one or more virgin queens. Sometimes a beehive will swarm in succession until it is almost totally depleted of workers.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{a colony of}} bees does not swarm until they have completed all of their brood combs, i.e., filled all available space with eggs, larvae, and brood. Th{{is generally}} occurs in late spring {{at a time when}} the other areas of the hive are rapidly filling with honey stores. One key trigger of the swarming instinct is when the queen has no more room to lay eggs and the hive population is becoming very congested. Under these conditions, a <b>prime</b> <b>swarm</b> may issue with the queen, resulting in a halving of the population within the hive, leaving the old colony with a large number of hatching bees. The queen who leaves finds herself in a new hive with no eggs and no larvae but lots of energetic young bees who create a new set of brood combs from scratch in a very short time.|$|E
5000|$|A colony {{will have}} {{anywhere}} from 7 to 15 queens per colony. Virgin queens {{that emerge from}} the queen cells of A. nigrocincta will be accepted by other species, but A. nigrocincta will not accept alien queens when queens {{of the same species}} are present, although {{there is no evidence that}} alien queens mate with A. nigrocincta drones. When a mother queen leaves the nest in a <b>prime</b> <b>swarm,</b> the first emerged queen will start “piping” by pressing her thorax on the surface of the comb and vibrating, causing a piping sound. Her fully developed sisters will also vibrate their thoraxes, creating a “tooting” sound. As long as these sounds continue, the younger queens will remain in their cells. Only after the next swarm will the next queen emerge and start the cycle of “piping” and “tooting.” If there are not enough workers to form a swarm, young queens will fight to the death until there is only one queen left.|$|E
40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) {{reproduce}} by swarming {{wherein the}} mother queen leaves the nest with approximately {{two thirds of}} her workers (the <b>prime</b> <b>swarm).</b> Several daughter queens are raised in the original nest, and these start to emerge shortly after the first swarm departs. One or several of these daughter queens may then leave the original colony sequentially with smaller afterswarms. Here we study the change in acceptance of former nestmates after colony reproduction using free-flying honey bee colonies. We used {{a total of four}} colonies each of which we divided to make four new colonies: two artificial swarms (the offspring colonies) and two colonies that mimic established ('old') colonies after swarming. The way the original (mother) colonies were divided allowed us to determine the relative importance of wax comb on cue divergence. Half of the divisions contained the original wax combs from the mother colony whereas the other divisions were not provided with comb requiring them to construct their own. We then tested the acceptance of former nestmates by introducing foragers at the hive entrances and observing the behaviour of guard bees. Our results did not show a consistent change in acceptance of former nestmates after swarming. In two out of four replicates, workers originating from the colonies that contained the original wax combs were rejected by guards from the initially comb-less colonies. This suggests that comb wax {{plays an important role in}} nestmate recognition. However, the remaining two replicates did not show a response; all former nesmates were still accepted two weeks after artificial swarming...|$|E
