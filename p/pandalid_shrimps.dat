40|$|The diet of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in {{the area}} of Pavlof Bay, Alaska, was studied in the early 1980 s by Albers and Anderson (1985). They found that the {{dominant}} prey species were forage species like <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> capelin (Mallotus villosus), and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). The shrimp fishery in Pavlof Bay began in 1968 and closed in 1980 because of low shrimp abundance (Ruccio and Worton 1). Survey data indicate that, during the period between 1972 and 1997, the abundance of forage species such as <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp</b> and capelin declined and higher trophic-level groundfish such as Pacific cod increased. There is a general recognition that a long-term ocean climate shift in the Gulf of Alaska has been partially responsible for the observed reorganization of the community structure (Anderson and Piatt, 1999). ...|$|R

Comparisons of condition, size, and diet for capelin from the northern Grand Banks, northeastern Scotian Shelf and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence demonstrated that a lack of large zooplankton (euphausiids) in the Grand Banks capelin diet, following the cold period of the early 1990 s, resulted in reduced growth (i. e. stunting) and condition. Examination of diet and stable isotope signatures of capelin and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) revealed no evidence of significant overlap in prey consumption. Thus, the increase in the abundance and distribution of <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps</b> during the 1990 s likely did not contribute to the changes in capelin biology and feeding.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1983 Vertical {{migration}} and food habits of <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps</b> in Aialik Bay, a tidewater-glacier fjord, {{were related to}} suspended sediment load and available food resources. Suspended sediments from subglacial streams resulted in Secchi depths of 0. 4 - 1. 0 m near the glacier, increasing with distance from the glacier to 1. 0 - 5. 0 m near the sill. A {{large proportion of the}} Pandalus borealis and P. goniurus populations responded to reduced light in the upper bay by remaining in midwater throughout the day and night. Shrimp food resources, represented by zooplankton and benthos, were reduced in abundance and diversity near the glacier as compared to the region near the sill. Shrimps fed more intensively near or at the bottom than in midwater. The most common items in stomachs of P. borealis were unidentifiable organic matter (84. 5 %), sediment (83. 1 %), crustacean fragments (60. 9 %), identified crustaceans (16. 9 %), mollusks (16. 3 %), foraminiferans (15. 1 %), and plant material (10. 0 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of deepwater ecosystems along the Pacific of Central America is extremely limited. We analyzed the diet composition of 200 adult specimens of Lophiodes spilurus {{ranging in size}} from 7. 8 to 17. 8 cm total length (TL). Samples were obtained from deep bottom trawls (depth: 105 - 238 m) along the central Pacific of Costa Rica. We calculated the percentage of number (% N), weight (% W), and occurrence (% O) of each food item encountered in the stomachs; based on this information, the Index of Relative Importance (IR) was calculated. Moreover, we estimated diet overlap for three different size classes (15. 1 cm TL). The results revealed exclusively two groups of benthic prey items: crustaceans (30 %) and teleost fish (70 %) in their diet. The most frequent preys were <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps</b> Plesionika trispinus (% O = 17) and the fathom mora Physiculus rastrelliger (% O = 12). The greatest diversity and frequency of abundance of food items was observed in intermediate-sized individuals (10. 1 - 15. 0 cm TL). Small-sized L. spilurus (15. 0 cm TL) preyed on large-sized stomatopods and teleost fish. There was a clear diet overlap between small and intermediate-sized L. spilurus (p 0. 05). Our results suggest that L. spilurus feeds exclusively on crustaceans (Decapoda and Stomatopoda) and benthic teleost fish along the Pacific of Costa Rica. While small and large-sized individuals showed a more pronounced selectivity for certain prey items, the high diversity of benthic prey items observed in intermediatesized specimens suggest a more opportunistic foraging behavior...|$|E
40|$|Six bottom-trawl cruises, {{undertaken}} in spring 1994 to 1999 along the Spanish Mediterranean coastline, sampled <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps</b> from 30 to 800 m depth. Data analysis yielded {{a description of}} the distribution patterns of the 4 most common species (Plesionika heterocarpus, P. martia, P. gigliolii, P. edwardsi) over an area of 45331 km 2. We analysed abundance of juveniles and adults by partial correspondence analysis (pCCA) {{in order to determine the}} effect on distribution of depth (as an overall estimate of temperature, salinity, turbidity and other variables), time (among-survey variability) and space (geographical location). The main null hypothesis we explicitly evaluated is that species composition remains constant along the Spanish Mediterranean coastline after controlling for depth and time. A significant (8. 2 %) effect of geographical location was found. Hauls located in the central zone of the sampling cruises (Valencia: Ibiza Channel) showed an intermediate relative abundance of all species. By contrast, the samples from northern and southern zones showed a large relative abundance of P. martia and P. heterocarpus, respectively. This pattern may be related to environmental specificity of the hydrodynamic conditions in the Ibiza Channel, dynamic topography characteristics linked to the canyons in the North Catalan zone, and surface production inputs, as found in the North Alborán zone (southern zone), where the main species (P. heterocarpus) exhibited the shallowest bathymetric distribution. Although discrimination between depth preferences of juveniles and adults (with adults being located deeper) is already known on a local scale, our results extend this pattern to the entire Spanish Mediterranean coastline and across all the species studiedPublicado...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the high}} number of species and {{ecological}} diversity of <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> there has been no previous attempt to resolve evolutionary relationships of several genera using molecular tools. Although mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) is widely used in barcoding studies to delimit species boundaries, additional insights into phylogenetic affinities can be obtained, especially when used in combination with data from additional genes. The knowledge of molecular diversity is essential to understand phylogenetic relationships and will help systematic clarifications. Based on partial fragments of the 16 S and COI genes, we have focused specifically on addressing the systematic relationships of the economically and ecologically important shrimp genus Plesionika within a framework of five genera from within the Pandalidae. Our results showed that species within Plesionika are substantially divergent when compared with other genera, exhibiting the highest average nucleotide divergence, with 0. 1123 and 0. 0846 in COI and 16 S genes, respectively. In addition, sequence divergence was found to vary greatly within the genus Plesionika (COI/ 16 S) : 0. 0247 / 0. 0016 between Plesionika antigai and Plesionika heterocarpus and 0. 1616 / 0. 098 between Plesionika heterocarpus and Plesionika edwardsii. We did not find amino acid sequence divergence between P. heterocarpus and P. antigai compared with P. heterocarpus and P. edwardsii (8. 10 %, K 2 P distance). Three species of Plesionika (P. antigai, P. heterocarpus and Plesionika scopifera) appear well separated from other Plesionika species in both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The present study confirms the utility of COI over 16 S as a genetic marker to resolve relationships between different species of Plesionika from the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, in addition to species delimitation. The findings highlight the need to further review paraphyly within Plesionika in an attempt to recognize a concordance in the evolutionary history of Plesionika with major ecological and geological events...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of predatory decapod crustaceans in sedimentary communities depends on the spatial variability in their abundance and composition. At the scale of a fjord, such spatial patterns {{could be related to}} sill-mediated larval supply. This study examines larval and adult distributions of abundant predatory decapods at six representative sites in a sub-arctic Newfoundland fjord during three consecutive summers. Adult snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and toad crab (Hyas coarctatus, H. araneus) characterized outer areas of the fjord, whereas <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus montagui) dominated inner areas, and rock crab (Cancer irroratus) showed only minor spatial differences. Multivariate analysis and nonparametric comparisons of larval abundance and composition suggest that the sill separating inner and outer areas of the fjord results in differences in larval supply that correspond to adult abundances for {{at least two of the}} species analyzed here: snow crab and <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Although larval abundance was not related to adult distribution when all zoeal stages were considered, correspondence between larval and adult patterns emerged when only late stages (zoeae >= II) were included in the multivariate analyses. Nonparametric comparisons supported these results, indicating significant differences in larval abundance inside and outside the sill for corresponding species and stages. Our results suggest that larval supply may play a critical role in establishing adult spatial patterns at the scale of the entire fjord for some species, but a less relevant role at the finer scale represented by the sites and habitats located at each side of the sill...|$|R
40|$|In Kagoshima Bay, {{southern}} Japan, the <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Plesionika semilaevis (Decapoda, Caridea) is {{a principle}} by-catch of small-scale bottom seine fishery.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of the PROACTIVA 1 - 2 (2009 - 2012) and MARPROF-CV (2010 - 2014) projects, in the {{framework}} of the Canary Islands Government and UE PCT MAC 2007 - 2013 programmes respectively. Research has mainly focused on the stock assessment of the striped soldier shrimp, Plesionika edwardsii (Brandt, 1851), because it has shown moderate to high levels of fishing yield and abundances compatible with {{the development of a new}} sustainable fishery in the Cape Verde Islands. Cruises took place on board the R/V Prof. Ignacio Lozano. Four 15 -day surveys have been conducted to date: Cabo Verde 2010 - 04 (April 2010), Camar˜ao- 1 (November 2011), Camar˜ao- 2 (Mars 2012) and Camar ˜ao- 3 (July 2012). An innovative fishing gear so-called multiple semi-floating shrimp trap (MSFST) was used. Each fishing line was composed by 40 - 65 traps operating around 2. 4 m above the seafloor, using Decapterus macarellus (Carangidae) as unique bait of the traps. Fishing depth was 66 - 458 m, and efective fishing time was 16 - 18 h. Each trap was attached to the main bottom line every 15 m, and the maximum attraction of this bait was established to be 100 or 150 m, according to the experience gained from the local fishery for deep-sea lobsters. So density by area was calculated assuming two different areas of attraction of the fishing gear. Initial biomass was estimated from depletion experiments at different abundance stations by applying the Leslie & Davis (1939) method, modified by Ricker (1975). Each fishing operation was classified according to its yield (CPUE in g/trap/night). The potential fishing planar area was estimated between the isobathymetric lines between 90 and 220 m. Total biomasses (Bt) were calculated from areas (km 2) and mean minimum/maximum densities (kg/km 2). Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated from Bt using the Beddington and Cooke (1983) model by entering natural mortality (0. 6), growth rate (0. 53 year� 1) and recruitment age (1. 32 year), which are the parameters for this target species published for the Canaries. These parameters estimate a biological exploitation rate () of 0. 262. Interpolations were applied to estimate MSY for insular stocks representing lesser than 5 % of the total fishing grounds for this species in the archipelago. The MSY estimated by depletion were 30. 5 tons/year for the stock of S˜ao Vicente, Santa Luzia, Ilheus and S˜ao Nicolau, 10 tons/year for the stock of Santiago, 138. 8 tons/year for the stock of Boa Vista and Maio, and 5. 6 tons/year for the stock of Sal. The small stocks estimated by interpolation were: 4. 5 tons/year for the stock of Santo Ant˜ao, 1. 3 tons/year for the stock of Fogo, and 1. 8 tons/year for the stock of Brava and Ilheus. In total, 192. 5 tons per year was the total MSY for the striped soldier shrimp around the islands of the Cape Verde archipelago, occupying a total area of 1, 918 km 2 of new fishing grounds at between 90 and 220 m of depth. In comparison with the traditional bottom trap used in the Canary Islands, the innovative fishing gear MSFST were proved to be more selective for <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> minimizing the gear impact on the seafloor as well as the by-catch by reducing the discards. Depletion methods are based on the assumption of a closed system, that is with minimum or zero immigration between neighbouring areas. The straight forward decline of CPUEs obtained during the depletion experiments seems to confirm that P. edwardsii is a low mobility species, making this assumption valid at least during short-time periods. Because of the bathymetry profile of these islands,the depth range is from very close (few nautical miles in Santiago) to far away (10 - 12 n. m. in Boa Vista) to the coastline. Fishing effort should be controlled on the basis of quotas, number of fishing vessels and a precautionary approach in order to ensure that catching is commensurate with sustainable levels of exploitation. MSY estimates suggest that this new Capeverdean fishery should be carried out by specialized medium-sized fishing vessels. During the last decades a combination of shrimp trawling and industrial trapping activity has threatened over-exploitation in the Mediterranean fisheries targeting on P. edwardsii; currently the shrimp collapse has conducted to the decline of these fisheries. Can the Cape Verde regulatory bodies and all the stakeholders involved learn the lessons this teaches us about this resource management...|$|E

One of the dominant species in these catches is a <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp</b> previously reported as “Parapandalus (or Plesionika) spinipes” (e. g., Suseelan & Mohamed, 1968; Suseelan, 1974; Rajan et al., 2001; Kurup et al., 2008; Rajool Shanis et al., 2012; with the genus Parapandalus Borradaile, 1899 now generally synonymized with Plesionika Bate, 1888 (see Chace, 1985; De Grave & Fransen, 2011). Rajool Shanis et al.

40|$|Austropandalus grayi is one {{of three}} <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp</b> species {{reported}} from Chilean waters. Here we describe fecundity, reproductive output, and chemical composition of the incubated embryos of A. grayi, providing the first account of such information for a pandalid species inhabiting the southern hemisphere. Ovigerous females (n = 96) were collected during October - November 1994 with an Agassiz trawl in waters off Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, South America. Both egg production (between 50 and 1858 embryos) and early egg volume (x- = 0. 069 mm 3) of A. grayi were low when compared to values reported from other pandalids. Clutch size increased with maternal size, however, the size of recently-spawned eggs was not linked to female size. Although the egg mass volume remained almost stable during the incubation period, females lost on average 51. 1 % of their initially-laid embryos; however, this loss was more than compensated by an 88. 4 % increase of the egg volume during embryogenesis. Mean reproductive output was relatively low (0. 133) and not related to maternal size. The RO-data of A. grayi and other pandalids seem to indicate an increasing energy allocation for reproduction towards higher latitudes, a trend which would be contrary to the results of studies with other crustaceans. Water was the predominant constituent of the chemical composition of developing embryos and increased from 62. 2 % to 70. 2 % during the incubation period. At the same time, organic matter declined and mineral content augmented. Generally, our results are in agreement with previous findings with regard to the chemical composition of developing decapod embryos...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of the cod fishery in Newfoundland has coincided with marked increases in abundances of snow crab, <b>pandalid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and other crustaceans that prey on sedimentary infauna. A 3 -year sampling program in Bonne Bay, Newfoundland indicates differences in composition and number of these predators in the two main arms of the fjord that coincide with strong differences in benthic community structure. To test whether predation pressure contributes to the observed patterns in sedimentary fauna, exclusion field experiments with full and partial cages were deployed in both arms at 30 -m depth and sampled along with ambient sediments at 0 -, 4 -, and 8 -week periods. Predation significantly influenced species composition, abundance and, in some cases, diversity. The most striking changes included increases in the polychaetes Pholoe tecta and Ophelina cylindricaudata in exclusions relative to controls, and concurrent declines in the polychaete Paradoneis lyra and the cumacean Lamphros fuscata. In laboratory experiments, fresh non-disturbed sediment cores from each experimental area were either protected or exposed to snow crab, the most abundant predator in the bay. A snow crab inclusion experiment was also {{carried out in the}} field, using cages similar to those used for exclusions. Despite differences in sedimentary faunas in the two arms, both types of experiments detected a predator effect that was very similar to that documented in exclusion experiments. Thus, despite differences in the scales associated with each type of manipulation, our results suggest that crab predation is a significant structuring force in Newfoundland sedimentary communities. Given the historical changes that have occurred in predator composition as a result of cod over-fishing, we hypothesize that broad-scale community changes may be taking place in North Atlantic benthic ecosystems...|$|R
