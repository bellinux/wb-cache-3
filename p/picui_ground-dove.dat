40|$|Thirty-two {{specimens}} of Columbina picui (<b>picui</b> <b>ground-dove)</b> were examined, {{and a collection}} of arthropods was made by washing the external surface of the body and the nasal cavity. The species in the order Phthiraptera found and their respective prevalences, mean abundance and mean intensity were: Columbicola passerinae (84. 4 %; 10. 3; 12. 2), Hohorstiella passerinae (21. 9 %; 0. 7; 3. 1) and Physconelloides eurysema (3. 1 %; 0. 1; 2). The gamasid mites found in the birds and their respective prevalences, mean abundance and mean intensity were: Pellonyssus marui (31. 3 %; 1. 2; 3. 9), Ornithonyssus bursa (15. 6 %; 0. 2.; 1. 2) and Mesonyssus sp. (6. 3 %; 0. 1; 1). Columbicola passerinae, H. passerinae, P. eurysema, O. bursa, P. marui and Mesonyssus sp. were recorded {{for the first time in}}fecting C. picui in Brazil. Except for O. bursa, the other species are reported for the first time in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus (SLEV) (Flavivirus) is a reemerging arbovirus in {{the southern}} cone of South America. In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence {{in a variety of}} ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argentina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV and WNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds increased 11 -fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion (99. 3 %) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However, the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV {{and to a lesser extent}} WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared Dove, <b>Picui</b> <b>Ground-Dove</b> and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread abundance. For the same reasons, Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed to confirm these relationships...|$|E
