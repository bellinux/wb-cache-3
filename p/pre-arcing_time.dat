40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{earthing switch}} (HSES) of a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) performs a secondary role {{in protecting the}} power system {{in the event of}} an accident. After being interrupted by a circuit breaker (CB), the short-circuit current remaining in the network should be earthed by the HSES. However, as the contacts of the HSES may have been damaged by a pre-arc during the closing operation, the HSES may fail to ground the short-circuit current. To successfully ground the short-circuit current, the contacts of the HSES must be protected from damage by the pre-arc. Thus, minimizing the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> is required to step up the making performance. This paper analyzes the making performance of the HSES by predicting the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> within the short-circuit current making test. To estimate the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time,</b> we compared the results of analytical calculations based on streamer discharge theory and the numerical simulations of the electric field strength. By conducting a short-circuit current making test for a 420 kV 63 kA HSES in a high-power laboratory, the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> calculation results were verified. A comparison of the results showed that the proposed prediction method was useful for verifying the performance of the HSES...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} between calculations and measurements of pre-arcing times in High Breaking Capacity fuses under typical fault current conditions. This paper also describes the temperature evolution and the Joule energy dissipated in a fuse element during the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time.</b> By varying typical electrical parameters, namely the closing angle and the power factor, we show that various prospective currents such as those observed in industrial case can be fairly simulated. The <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> and then the clearing of the fault current are shown to be deeply dependent on these electrical characteristics. We exhibit simulated results of prospective current and supply voltage waves for given closing angles under two typical power factors which are compared with the experimental ones. A comparison between simulated pre-arcing times with experimental ones shows some discrepancies and a discussion on the numerical assumptions is made...|$|E

40|$|Switching-in of {{short-circuit}} current leads to pre-arcing in the switching device. Pre-arcing affects {{the ability of}} switchgear to close and latch. In three-phase systems, making is associated with transient voltage phenomena that may {{have a significant impact}} on the duration of the pre-arcing period. An analysis is presented of these transients. It was found that <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>times</b> in three-phase systems can be considerably prolonged with respect to a single phase situation. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the three-phase interaction has a moderating influence on the peak value of asymmetrical current. A test-circuit is described, able to perform three-phase synthetic make tests up to 245 kV at current up to 63 kA, representing all transient phenomena. Specific tests are described requiring the maximum available laboratory power: one with a circuit breaker subjected to direct test and one with a high-speed grounding switch subjected to synthetic tests...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> {{in the case of}} High Breaking Capacity fuses submitted to high fault currents. The fuse elements studied consist of silver fuse strips with reduced sections in their centre. During the fuse working the fuse element is fused partly and hence vaporized. The time necessary to obtain an electric arc is called the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time.</b> This latter is defined by the duration from the appearance of the fault current to the splitting of the fuse element due to the vaporization of the reduced sections. The mathematic model is based on the solution of the heat transfer equation, using an enthalpy formulation {{to take into account the}} phase transitions, supplemented by an energy source due to the heat produced by ohmic losses. In order to determine the current density evolution in the fuse element, the Laplace equation governing the electric potential and the Ohm's law are used. Two typical fuse elements close to industrial ones are chosen for the simulations. The calculated pre-arcing times are given together with the main electrical properties, and compared with the experimental values. The resistive case with cos phi ~ 0. 9 is discussed for a 2. 5 mm and 7. 5 mm-width elements respectively with one and three reduced sections...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} study the short <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> in HBC fuses, we use a {{mathematical}} model including phase change of the fuse-element heating coupled with the Laplace equation for the potential and the Ohm's law. The thermal model {{is based on the}} enthalpy formulation of the heat equation with a source term representing the Joule heating. For the time range considered (up to 10 ms), we assume no heat transfer between the fuse-element and the surrounding sand. To solve numerically the governing equations, we employ a semi-implicit scheme for time integration and a finite element method for space discretization. Using electrical and thermal properties of the silver fuse-element, we present pre-arcing characteristics (temperature, current density, potential) for a fuse-element used in industrial protection circuits...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a model and a {{numerical}} method of the fuse element heating including solid - liquid - vapour phase transitions in order to evaluate the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> in HBC fuses. The mathematical model {{is based on the}} enthalpy formulation of the heat equation with a source term representing the Joule effect coupled with the Laplace equation for the potential and the Ohm's law. We obtain an approximation of the governing equations using a specific numerical scheme for time discretization and unstructured triangle or tetrahedral element grids are employed in spatial discretization using a standard piecewise linear finite element method. Numerical simulations of two fuse elements, used in industrial applications, are carried out and compared with experimental measurements obtained using a 100 kVA power station...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePre-arcing {{stage is}} the first working step in High Breaking Capacity (HBC) fuse {{operation}} and affects the following step, namely the arcing step. We have performed realistic HBC fuse tests for short (10 ms) pre-arcing times by varying the phase angle of the electrical fault (defined as the phase angle of the fault current once the supplied voltage {{is applied to the}} fuse) in the range from 0 to 160 deg., for two values of the power factor cos phi ~ 0. 9 and cos phi ~ 0. 1. Experimental values of the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> and the arcing timeare given for tprearc/tarc â‰² 1 to ~ 4. 2, and discussed from the energetic point of view by taking into account the inductive source term. The adiabatic assumption classically used in the modelling is also examined. The influence of the pre-arcing step on the arcing step is analysed by means of the Joule integral, the energy dissipated in the fuse, and the mass and length of the fulgurite...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring the HBC fuse working, {{the fault}} current implies the {{initiation}} of an electric arc which is composed of metallic species vapours mainly, generally silver. This defines {{the end of the}} <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time.</b> This electric arc interacts quickly with the surrounding silica sand grains or quartz sand. Thus a silver plasma is formed around the reduced sections of the fuse element. This silver plasma interacts with the silica sand grains and this interaction gives rise to the ignition of a plasma composed of vapours resulting from the dissociation of the SiO 2 molecules. The radiation escaped from the SiO 2 plasma can be used to assess experimentally the temperature (T) and the electron density (ne), two fundamental parameters for modelling purposes. T and ne are difficult to interpret because of the strong gradients in pressure, temperature, and material densities from the centre to the surroundings where the measurement is done. We propose a first formulation to calculate this radiation in order to increase the understanding of the radiation measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} a {{specific}} test device especially designed to perform tests on HBC fuse {{on a scale of}} a non industrial laboratory. In fact it is not possible for most of academic laboratories to build up a device supplying the same current and voltage ranges as in an industrial test station. Moreover the capacitor bank discharges are often used in academic laboratories to test electric fuses. But the main drawback of the capacitor bank is to supply a non 50 Hz-sinusoidal current waveform for one half period only. We present the first measurements performed on experimental HBC fuses using a 100 kVA station built up from a single phase transformer. These first measurements are performed using various fuse elements with the same geometries as in industrial fuses of the middle voltage range. The filling material is silica sand or quartz sand and it is chosen with the same properties as in industrial fuses. The fuse working is studied experimentally on the whole duration of the fuse working which depends on the values chosen for the power factor and the closing angle. The results are given for the <b>pre-arcing</b> <b>time</b> and the fulgurite length. The power factor put in the tests is equal to cos phi = 0. 9 and cos phi = 0. 1, and the closing angle is increased from 0 Â° to 180 Â°. The results are discussed by taking into account the influence of the energy to dissipate, namely the Joule energy and the inductive energy...|$|E
