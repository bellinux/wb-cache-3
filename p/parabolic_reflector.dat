5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector,</b> which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E

25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little beam spread. It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector,</b> which reduces spill. The result is an intense shaft of light that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector no longer is used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the engineering, {{performance}} and regulatory-compliance aspects of headlamps, {{there is the}} consideration of the various ways they are designed and arranged on a motor vehicle.

25|$|A {{theoretical}} {{idea for}} enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship {{by creating an}} artificial black hole and using a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole {{to act as a}} power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.|$|E
25|$|Spherical concave and convex mirrors do {{not focus}} {{parallel}} rays {{to a single}} point due to spherical aberration. However, the ideal of focusing to a point is a commonly used approximation. <b>Parabolic</b> <b>reflectors</b> resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) to be focused to a small spot; almost an ideal point. <b>Parabolic</b> <b>reflectors</b> are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.|$|R

25|$|Since a shiny metal <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> {{can also}} focus the sun's rays, and most dishes could {{concentrate}} enough solar energy on the feed structure to severely overheat {{it if they}} happened to be pointed at the sun, solid reflectors are always given a coat of flat paint.|$|E
25|$|Applied {{similarly}} to the <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector,</b> the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant.

25|$|Shaped reflectors– The <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> can {{be given}} a noncircular shape, and/or {{different}} curvatures in the horizontal and vertical directions, to alter {{the shape of the}} beam. This is often used in radar antennas. As a general principle, the wider the antenna is in a given transverse direction, the narrower the radiation pattern will be in that direction.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} with spherical reflectors, which {{suffer from a}} spherical aberration that becomes stronger as {{the ratio of the}} beam diameter to the focal distance becomes larger, <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflectors</b> can be made to accommodate beams of any width. However, if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis (or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus), <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflectors</b> suffer from an aberration called coma. This is primarily of interest in telescopes because most other applications do not require sharp resolution off the axis of the parabola.|$|R
25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector,</b> a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began in}} mid-1960, with the {{official}} opening on November 1, 1963. As the primary dish is spherical, its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as {{would be the case}} for a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector.</b> As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow frequency band: 2–5% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Satellite {{television}} {{is a system}} of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna usually {{referred to as a}} satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.|$|E

25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> {{to collect}} and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{tradition}} {{of moving the}} Olympic Flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began with the Berlin Games in 1936. Months before the Games are held, the Olympic Flame is lit on a torch, with the rays of the Sun concentrated by a <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector,</b> {{at the site of}} the Ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece. The torch is then taken out of Greece, most often to be taken around the country or continent where the Games are held. The Olympic torch is carried by athletes, leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people alike, and at times in unusual conditions, such as being electronically transmitted via satellite for Montreal 1976, submerged underwater without being extinguished for Sydney 2000, or in space and at the North Pole for Sochi 2014. On the final day of the torch relay, the day of the Opening Ceremony, the Flame reaches the main stadium and is used to light a cauldron situated in a prominent part of the venue to signify the beginning of the Games.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} came in 1946 when Ryle and Vonberg (Ryle and Vonberg 1946) located {{a number of}} new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the Michelson interferometer. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg's telescope used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first aperture synthesis imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the mathematical methods to perform aperture synthesis Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the aperture synthesis technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{reflector}} {{affects the}} quality and directionality of the light output. A reflector is located behind or around the light source {{in such a way}} as to direct more light towards the lens or opening. Each unit has a characteristic reflector, used in conjunction with the lens (or lack thereof) to create the desired effect. An ellipsoidal reflector has a lamp set at one focus point of an ellipsoid-shaped reflector that bounces the light and focuses it at the second focus point of the ellipse. This focuses the beam of light into a tight beam. Ellipsoidal reflectors often are used for tight, focusable spots, although they can be used for floodlights, such as in scoops (see below). A <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> has a lamp set at the focus point of a parabola-shaped reflector that bounces the light in parallel beams away from the reflector. There is no point at which the light converges, so the light is unfocusable. Parabolic reflectors are used for lights intended to provide an unfocused wash, such as PAR cans.|$|E
25|$|As chance {{would have}} it, in July 1940 Hodgkin had been {{introduced}} to A.W. Whitaker of Nash and Thompson, best known for their work on powered gun turrets. They {{began to talk about}} the scanning problem, and Hodgkin described their current solution of moving the dipole {{at the center of the}} parabola up and down while moving the parabola itself right and left. Hodgkin was not convinced this was a good solution and was proven correct when Whitaker built their first version of such a system in November. They found that the two motions combined to cause enormous vibrations in the entire system. Lovell and Hodgkin considered the problem and came up with the idea of causing the <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> to rotate around the axis extending from the nose of the aircraft, tracing out circles. By smoothly increasing the angle of the reflector compared to the forward axis while the circular motion continued, the net effect was a spiral scanning pattern. Whitaker was able to rapidly build such a system, scanning out a cone-shaped area 45degrees on either side of the nose.|$|E
