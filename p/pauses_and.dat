5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

40|$|During {{cellular}} differentiation, genes {{important for}} differentiation {{are expected to}} be silent in stem/progenitor cells yet can be readily activated. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> bivalent chromatin marks are two paradigms suited for establishing such a poised state of gene expression; however, their specific contributions in development are not well understood. Here we characterized Pol II <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> H 3 K 4 me 3 /H 3 K 27 me 3 marks in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their daughter neurons purified from the developing mouse cortex. We show that genes paused in NPCs or neurons are characteristic of respective cellular functions important for each cell type, although <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> <b>pause</b> release were not correlated with gene activation. Bivalent chromatin marks poised the marked genes in NPCs for activation in neurons. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between H 3 K 27 me 3 <b>and</b> <b>paused</b> Pol II. This study thus reveals cell type-specific Pol II <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> gene activation-associated bivalency during mammalian neuronal differentiation...|$|R

25|$|That said, {{the score}} does allow the {{interpreter}} {{to make choices}} on how to perform a historical work. For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), {{it is not known}} exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part (only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).|$|E
25|$|Most of the game's dialog and {{script was}} written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw, {{who at the time}} was a {{columnist}} for the website Old Man Murray. After establishing the game's main characters, Schafer undertook his own exercise to write out how the characters would see themselves and the other characters' on a social media site similar to Friendster, which Schafer was a fan of at the time and from where he met his wife-to-be. This helped him to solidify the characters in his own head prior to writing the game's dialog, as well as providing a means of introducing the characters {{to the rest of the}} development team. To help flesh out character dialog outside of cut scenes, Schafer developed an approach that used dozens of spoken lines by a character that could be stitched together in a random manner by the game as to reduce apparent repetition; such stitching included elements like vocal <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> coughs that made the dialog sound more natural. Schafer used the camp and woods setting as a natural place that children would want to wander and explore.|$|E

500|$|Patsy Morita, a {{music critic}} for Allmusic, {{wrote that the}} second half of Johnston's score becomes as [...] "unremarkable" [...] as [...] "so many other {{dramatic}} film scores of the early twenty-first century." [...] She continued, [...] "It fulfills its purpose of underscoring the emotion of the story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically, and by using many pregnant <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> minimalist-leaning repetitive figures." [...] Morita added that [...] "there is nothing in it to draw attention away from the film." [...] The score later received a nomination for Best Original Film Score at the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards. The film soundtrack was released on 31 July 2007. A track listing for the album is as follows: ...|$|E

500|$|Armstrong's {{analysis}} influenced {{a report}} by the Somalists Bogumił Andrzejewski and Musa Haji Ismail Galal, which in turn influenced Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed's successful proposal for the Somali Latin alphabet. In particular, Andrzejewski gave credit to her for the practice of doubled vowels to represent long vowels in Somali. However, Andrzejweski did mention some disadvantages of Armstrong's orthography proposal with respect to vowels, writing that [...] "Armstrong's system is too narrow to deal with the fluctuations in the extents of Vowel Harmony and so rigid that its symbols often imply pauses (or absence of <b>pauses)</b> <b>and</b> a particular speed and style of pronunciation". He also claimed that Armstrong's orthographic proposal for Somali vowels would be [...] "too difficult for the general public (both Somali and non-Somali) to handle".|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Ah, how fleeting, ah how insignificant), is a chorale fantasia. The {{instruments}} play concertante music, {{to which}} the soprano sings the cantus firmus line by line. The lower voices act as a [...] "self-contained group", mostly in homophony, and [...] "declaim the individual lines of text in unison {{at the end of}} each choral passage, using a melodic formula derived from the beginning of the hymn." [...] Bach illustrates the imagery of the text, [...] "fleetingness and insubstantiality" [...] in motifs such as [...] "abrupt chords separated by <b>pauses</b> <b>and...</b> hurrying scale figures". Gardiner comments: [...] The Musicologist Julian Mincham compares the instrumental music to [...] "mist and fog, images which imply movements of wind and air" [...] and hears the lower voices as [...] "evincing a feeling of primeval power and solidarity".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{subsequent}} songs {{focus on}} separation, with lyrics written in past tense. [...] "Unfold" [...] comprises individual notes and <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> incorporates tension in its off-beat composition, while its percussion increases in tempo before the accompanying instrumentation follows suit. It features deep house beats, resounding guitar harmonics, rhythmic hi-hat, and a dominant breakbeat. Croft describes [...] "Unfold" [...] as a [...] "gentle reverie" [...] and [...] "quite an emotional one." [...] On [...] "Swept Away", she and Sim express fragile declarations of love. They originally wrote the song as a ballad before Smith reworked {{it with a}} Roland TR-909 drum machine. [...] "Our Song" [...] features a rewinding guitar sample, looped feedback, and pulsating percussion buildup. It is about the love shared in a friendship; Croft and Sim wrote it to address {{each other and the}} band itself: [...] "We've never done that before; we're always addressing the songs outward. It's about the function of love and the love of friends. It's important." ...|$|E

500|$|After Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, {{particularly}} in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as [...] "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical". In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: [...] "was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?" [...] (1.7.35–38); [...] "...pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air..." [...] (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.|$|E
500|$|Going beyond {{specific}} characters, or even specific {{interactions among}} them, Hazlitt delineates {{what he calls}} the [...] "logic of passion", the rhythm of emotions in the drama, and its effect on the mind of the reader or viewer. [...] "We see {{the ebb and flow of}} the feeling, its <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> feverish starts, its impatience of opposition, its accumulating force when it has had time to recollect itself, the manner in which it avails itself of every passing word or gesture, its haste to repel insinuation, the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul, and all 'the dazzling fence of controversy' in this mortal combat with poisoned weapons, aimed at the heart, where each wound is fatal." [...] He observes, too, in explaining an instance of what later came to be called comic relief, how when the reader's feelings are strained to the utmost, [...] "just as [...] the fibres of the heart [...] are growing rigid from over-strained excitement [...] he imagination is glad to take refuge in the half-comic, half-serious comments of the Fool, just as the mind under the extreme anguish of a surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit." ...|$|E
500|$|Parasite Eve is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game. Movement in the [...] "world map" [...] (which is {{a map of}} Manhattan) is limited to specific destinations." [...] Upon the player walking over a [...] "hot spot", there's a chance of a random encounter. Enemies materialize and attack players on the same screen that they move Aya around on, with no battle mode or screen being used. In battle, the game uses a pausable real-time combat system with an Active Time Bar (ATB) that sets the time that must be waited till the player can take their next action. While waiting for her turn, the player character Aya can be moved around to dodge enemy attacks. Upon each turn, the player may choose between attacking with their equipped weapon by pressing the attack button, using PE (Parasite Energy) for defense, assistance, or attack, using items, changing weapon or armor, or escaping the battle. If the player chooses to attack, the battle briefly <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> a dome/sphere symbolizing {{the range of the}} weapon appears, allowing the player to target an enemy within range. [...] Parasite Energy recharges during battle but the more players use it, the slower it refills.|$|E
