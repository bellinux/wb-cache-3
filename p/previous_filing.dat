40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how a firm’s {{learning experience}} from prior filing activities during the antidumping process in Canada affects its future filing behavior and outcomes. Previous experience may affect both filing costs and outcome probabilities. By using the normal logit regression and multinomial logit regression to analyze Canadian antidumping data from 1993 to 2003, the paper shows that firms with <b>previous</b> <b>filing</b> experience {{are more likely}} to obtain final decisions, whether affirmative or negative from antidumping authorities rather than abandoning the process in mid-stream. This may be because prior experience increases petitioners’ effectiveness in arguing their cases. However, industries with experience decrease their future filing activities. This may due to the increasing likelihood of final negative outcomes and the significant cost incurred in the long process of investigation...|$|E

Each {{user can}} receive a new file only after its <b>previous</b> <b>file</b> is finished. The file state processes for each user act as coupled Markov chains that form a generalized restless bandit system. First, an optimal algorithm is derived {{for the case}} of one user. The algorithm maximizes throughput subject to an average power constraint. Next, the one-user algorithm is extended to a low complexity heuristic for the multi-user problem. The heuristic uses a simple online index policy and its effectiveness is shown via simulation. For simple 3 -user cases where the optimal solution can be computed offline, the heuristic is shown to be near-optimal {{for a wide range}} of parameters. I...|$|R

The essential part of our interpretation includes the Cu-O chain band which would have the order parameter of the same sign as antibonding plane band. We show that in this case net Josephson currents along and perpendicular to the chains have the phase shift equal to pi.
