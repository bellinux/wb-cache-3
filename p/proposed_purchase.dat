5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the <b>proposed</b> <b>purchase,</b> but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E

25|$|In 1869, the {{government}} of Sir John A. Macdonald held accountable the HBC for the disturbances reported in the Red River Colony, {{which was part of}} the <b>proposed</b> <b>purchase</b> of the original part of Rupert's Land from the HBC. The person in charge of HBC's nominal head office in Montreal was Smith, and he was asked by the Governor-General to investigate and write a Royal Commission report. Smith travelled to (present-day) Manitoba, and negotiated at Fort Garry with Louis Riel, who had been voted the leader of the rebellion. Smith's offers, including land recognition for the Métis, led to Riel calling a Council of 40 representatives, drawn half-and-half from the Metis and the HBC settlers, for formal negotiations. Smith returned to Ottawa in early 1870, and communicated the Royal Commission on the North-West Territories, which effectively made his name in Canada and London. Smith succeeded in gaining clemency for some prisoners within the region; he was not, however, able to prevent the execution of Thomas Scott by Riel's provisional government. He was appointed that year to the office of President of the HBC's Council of the Northern Department (effectively becoming administrator of the Northwest Territories, including Manitoba).|$|E

500|$|In 1887 Baron Rothschild {{conceived}} a plan {{to purchase}} and demolish the Moroccan Quarter as [...] "a merit and honor to the Jewish People." [...] The <b>proposed</b> <b>purchase</b> was considered {{and approved by the}} Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Rauf Pasha, and by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini. Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed, the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there, only trees could be planted to beautify the area. Additionally the Jews would not have full control over the area. This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities, including the driving of mules, which would cause a disturbance to worshippers. Other reports place the scheme's failure on Jewish infighting as to whether the plan would foster a detrimental Arab reaction.|$|E

40|$|The top {{management}} of the Kverneland Group, a Norwegian MNC which develops, produces and distributes agricultural machinery, wants to improve the performance of its spare parts supply chain and considers making some adjustments of its current purchasing strategy. In the present setting, all spare parts which are needed at the central warehouse are ordered from the Kverneland factories which developed the machines to which the respective parts belong. However, {{since most of the}} spare parts are not manufactured inhouse by Kverneland factories but produced externally, the factories usually have to order the required parts from external suppliers on behalf of the warehouse. According to the <b>proposed</b> future <b>purchasing</b> strategy, the warehouse would order the parts directly from the external suppliers and they would also be delivered directly to the warehouse. Against this background, this thesis analyzes possible consequences of a change from the current to the future setting for the Kverneland Group, the Business Area After Sales and the Kverneland factories. The <b>proposed</b> <b>purchasing</b> strategy would especially affect the administrative ordering and physical order handling activities which are currently executed by the factories on behalf of the warehouse. Furthermore, the future setting would affect the total lead times of spare parts which have a high influence on the stock levels and the capital tied up in inventory at the central warehouse. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to find out if Kverneland should stay with its current setting of sourcing spare parts or if the group should implement the <b>proposed</b> <b>purchasing</b> strategy. At the end of this thesis, main conclusions and recommendations are drawn which can be used as guidelines for the implementation of the <b>proposed</b> <b>purchasing</b> strategy. Furthermore, this study discusses which compensation fees the warehouse should pay towards the factories if the future setting would be realized...|$|R

The Australian government blocked the sale on 27 March 2009, citing concerns about the location of the Prominent Hill Mine within the sensitive military area.
