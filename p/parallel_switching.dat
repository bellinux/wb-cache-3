So {{it is important}} to consider all possible improvements involving reliability and simple structures. In this study we demonstrate the improvement potentiality of a DC/DC step-up converter, connected to a HVDC bus, based on a MCB-RS model (Magnetically Coupled Boost with Recovery Stage). We suggest a new possibility of improvement of the converter by mastering its active switch allowing an easier control of the internal voltage inherent to the recovery stage. The suggested solution permits a saving of the internal energy and prevents the over heating of certain components, like recovery diode. In the MCB-RS converter, the losses are for a main part dissipated in the recovery diode, representing a non-negligible amount of power. Thus, we propose to save this energy by the insertion in the recovery circuit of an additional <b>parallel</b> <b>switch.</b> This solution offers an additional advantage by making possible the flow back of a certain amount of energy by keeping in the on state the <b>parallel</b> <b>switch.</b> Finally we compare the simulated results with a real system and validate this new performing structure...|$|R

Moreover, switches present extra latencies and jitter due to the need to interpret frame addresses and also due to different internal architectural solutions.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the power electronics lifetime for 5 MW horizontal- and vertical-axis wind turbines, based on dynamic models supplied with generated wind speed time series. Both two- and three-bladed stall-regulated H-rotor vertical-axis turbines were modelled, with several different control parameters. Vertical-axis turbines are likely to lead to a shorter power electronics lifetime as the aerodynamic torque varies with rotor azimuth, leading to a cyclic generator torque, and increased thermal cycling in the power electronics. An electro-thermal model of a low-voltage converter was created, and used to calculate the switching device temperatures based on the generator torque and speed time series from the turbine model. An empirical lifetime model and rainflow-counting algorithm were used to calculate the lifetime, and this was repeated at different average wind speeds to determine the overall lifetime. The vertical-axis turbine was found to have a lower power electronics lifetime than the horizontal-axis, or require a larger number of <b>parallel</b> <b>switching</b> devices to achieve the same lifetime, although this was lessened by running the turbine with a more relaxed speed control, allowing the rotor inertia to partially absorb the aerodynamic torque ripple...|$|E

40|$|A {{packet switch}} with <b>{{parallel}}</b> <b>switching</b> planes is a parallel packet switch (PPS). A PPS can scale-up to faster line speeds than can a single-plane switch. It {{is an open}} problem to design a PPS that is feasible to implement using existing low-cost hardware components where no component runs faster than line speed.

We investigate a new architecture for a PPS that uses virtual input queues (VIQ) in the output multiplexors to achieve packet-level load balancing. A VIQ at an output multiplexor consists of one FIFO queue for each input. For K planes and N ports, our VIQ PPS requires KN cells of buffering in the input demultiplexors and 2 NK þ 2 K cells of buffering in the output multiplexors to achieve guaranteed loss-free operation and in-order cell delivery. Using simulation models, the new VIQ PPS is shown to offer improved delay performance compared to existing PPS designs.

40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{efficient}} <b>parallel</b> <b>switching</b> archi-tecture that requires no speedup and guarantees bounded delay. Our architecture consists of input–output-queued switches with first-in-first-out queues, operating {{at the line}} speed in parallel {{under the control of}} a single scheduler, with being independent of the number of inputs and outputs. Arriving traffic is demultiplexed (spread) over the identical switches, switched to the correct output, and multiplexed (combined) before departing from the parallel switch. We show that by using an appropriate demultiplexing strategy at the inputs and by applying the same matching at each of the par-allel switches during each cell slot, our scheme guarantees a way for cells of a flow to be read in order from the output queues of the switches, thus, eliminating the need for cell resequencing. Fur-ther, by allowing the scheduler to examine the state of only the first of the parallel switches, our scheme also reduces considerably the amount of state information required by the scheduler. The switching algorithms that we develop are based on existing prac-tical switching algorithms for input-queued switches, and have an additional communication complexity that is optimal up to a con-stant factor.

Compared to other MEMS optical switches, which typically use relatively large mirrors or long end-coupled waveguides, our device uses a <b>parallel</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism. The device utilizes evanescent coupling between two closely-spaced waveguides fabricated side by side. Coupling {{is controlled by}} changing the gap and the coupling length between the two waveguides via electrostatic pull-in. This enables both optical switching and variable optical coupling at voltages below 10 V. Channel isolation as high as 47 dB and coupling efficiencies of up to 66 % were obtained with switching losses of less than 0. 5 dB. We also demonstrate voltage-controlled variable optical coupling over a 17. 4 dB dynamic range. The devices are compact with P � P � core cross section and active area as small as SHH � S �.

40|$|This work employs an {{approximate}} Markov chain to analyze that a <b>parallel</b> packet <b>switch</b> (PPS) can emulate a first-come first-served (FCFS) output-queued (OQ) packet switch only operating {{slower than the}} external line rate. The PPS comprises multiple packet switches operating independently and in parallel. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of <b>parallel</b> center-stage <b>switches</b> with memory buffers running slower than the external line rate. Each lower speed packet switch operates {{at a fraction of}} the external line rate R. For example, each packet switch can operate at internal line rate R/K, where K is the number of center-stage switches. This work presents a proposed novel Markov chain model successfully exhibits these performance characteristics for throughput, cell delay and cell drop rate. This novel Markov chain model extends from our previous paper [Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Performance analysis of the sliding-window <b>parallel</b> packet <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 40 th International Conference on Communications 2005, ICC 2005, May 16 - 20, 2005; Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Evaluation and analysis of the sliding-window <b>parallel</b> packet <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 19 th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, vol. 2, 2005, pp. 355 - 358]. Simulation comparison demonstrates that the chains are accurate for practical network loads. With the proposed model, major finding are that: (1) it is theoretically possible for the throughput and cell drop rates of a PPS to emulate those of a FCFS-OQ packet switch when each lower speed packet switch operates at a rate of approximately R/K, and, (2) this work also demonstrates that it is theoretically possible for the cell delay of a PPS to emulate that of FCFS-OQ packet switch when each lower speed packet switch operates at a rate of approximately (3 R/cell delay of FCFS-OQ switch). Additionally, this work develops and investigates a novel PIAO PPS which distributes cells or variable-length packets to center-stage switches and uses multiplexers with push-in arbitrary-out (PIAO) queues.
