5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recoverable}} edible fungi are the agaric [...] ("virno"), {{the field}} mushroom ("petranùgliu"), the craterellus ("scardarella"), chanterelle ("gaglinella"), the honey mushroom ("chiuìttu"), the cauliflower mushroom ("retélla"), the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom,</b> the Caesar's mushroom, the penny bun or boletus edulis and others not {{picked up by}} the inhabitants.|$|E
5000|$|Macrolepiota procera (<b>Parasol</b> <b>Mushroom).</b> Globally, it is {{widespread}} in temperate regions ...|$|E
5000|$|Whilst it {{is unknown}} for sure whether Lepiota cristata is {{poisonous}} to humans or not, mycologists at least regard it as suspect [...] − this suspicion {{comes from the fact}} that many other small species of Lepiota are poisonous. It has been said that L. cristata causes gastrointestinal symptoms. Up until recently, there was a potentially injurious confusion pertaining to the toxicity of L. cristata, as in Great Britain dapperlings were commonly referred to as <b>parasols.</b> A <b>parasol</b> <b>mushrooms</b> is one from the parasol family (Macrolepiota, or sometimes used specifically to refer to Macrolepiota procera) and these are, unlike L. cristata, edible. This frequent misidentification may have added to the incidence of poisoning.|$|R
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as the slender parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related <b>parasol</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are edible and some are very sought after.|$|R
50|$|The <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> may not {{be eaten}} raw, because it is {{slightly}} toxic.|$|E
50|$|White and {{immature}} {{species of}} Amanita {{are also a}} potential hazard. To be sure, one must only pick parasol mushrooms past their button stage. A general rule of thumb with the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> as compared to amanita species is that the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> has darker flakes on a lighter surface, whereas amanita species have the opposite, lighter flakes (if there are any) on a darker surface, such as the Panther cap.|$|E
50|$|Differences {{from the}} <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> include its smaller dimensions, pungent (fruity) and {{reddening}} flesh when cut, lack of patterns on its stipe, and very shaggy cap surface.|$|E
5000|$|Birnbaumins are {{a pair of}} {{alkaloids}} {{and toxic}} yellow pigment compounds first isolated from the flowerpot <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom.</b> [...] These toxins can cause gastric ulcers if consumed.|$|E
50|$|Macrolepiota is a genus {{of white}} spored, gilled {{mushrooms}} {{of the family}} Agaricaceae. The best-known member is the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> (M. procera). The widespread genus contains about 40 species.|$|E
5000|$|Macrolepiota procera, the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom,</b> is a {{well-known}} and highly esteemed edible species in much of Europe.Macrolepiota albuminosa is eaten in Chinese cuisine, where it is called jīzōng ( [...] ; literally [...] "chicken fir tree").|$|E
50|$|The <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> is {{difficult}} to mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike Chlorophyllum molybdites does not occur. Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times.|$|E
50|$|Some, {{such as the}} <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom,</b> have {{distinct}} bosses or umbos and {{are described}} as umbonate. An umbo is a knobby protrusion {{at the center of}} the cap. Some fungi, such as chanterelles have a funnel- or trumpet-shaped appearance. In these cases the pileus is termed infundibuliform.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Macrolepiota procera or Lepiota procera) is a {{basidiomycete}} fungus with a large, prominent fruiting body {{resembling a}} parasol. It {{is a fairly}} common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and fairy rings in pastures and occasionally in woodland. Globally, it is widespread in temperate regions.|$|E
50|$|The young mushrooms, {{before the}} gills start to turn black, are edible. The taste is mild; cooking {{produces}} a large quantity of liquid. It {{can sometimes be}} used in mushroom soup with <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Large quantities of microwaved-then-frozen shaggy manes {{can be used as}} the liquid component of risotto, replacing the usual chicken stock.|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyllum molybdites, {{a species}} that causes {{the largest number of}} annual {{mushroom}} poisonings in North America due to its close similarity. Faintly green gills and a pale green spore print give it away. Furthermore, this mushroom lacks the aforementioned snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Its range is reportedly expanding into Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{shaggy parasol}} {{is similar in}} {{appearance}} to the similarly edible <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom,</b> Macrolepiota procera. The latter grows considerably larger however, and {{is more likely to}} be found in the open than C. rhacodes which prefers more shade and dislikes open pastures and fields. Another distinguishing feature is that C. rhacodes lacks the brown bands that are on the stem of M. procera.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pileus (cap) up to 40 cm in diameter, hemispherical {{and with a}} flattened top. The cap is whitish in colour with coarse brownish scales. The gills are free and white, usually turning dark and green with maturity. Spore print is green. The tall stipe may be up to 25 cm tall and bears a ring. This mushroom lacks the snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyllum molybdites, {{which has}} the common names of false parasol, green-spored parasol and vomiter, is a {{widespread}} mushroom. Highly poisonous and producing severe gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, it is commonly confused with the shaggy parasol or shaggy mane, and is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in North America. Its large imposing appearance and similarity to the edible <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom,</b> {{as well as its}} habit of growing in areas near human habitation, are reasons cited for this. The nature of the poisoning is predominantly gastrointestinal.|$|E

50|$|Chlorophyllum is a genus {{of large}} agarics similar in {{appearance}} {{to the true}} <b>parasol</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Chlorophyllum was originally coined in 1898, a time when spore color was the deciding factor for differentiating genera. It was termed in order to describe the poisonous green-spored C. molybdites which shared many characteristics of the mushrooms within the genus Lepiota but lacked the all important white spores. The name comes from Greek Chloro meaning green and phyll meaning leaves or gills. It remained as a genus of one lonely member until recently when modern DNA analyses concluded {{that many of the}} mushrooms contained in the genus Macrolepiota actually had more in common genetically with the Chlorophyllum molybdites than with {{the other members of the}} Macrolepiota. The genus has a widespread distribution, with many species found in tropical regions. The best known members are the edible shaggy parasol, a name applied to three very similar species Chlorophyllum rhacodes, C. olivieri and C. brunneum, and the poisonous C. molybdites, which is widespread in subtropical regions around the world.|$|E
40|$|Caps and stipes of 141 fruiting {{bodies of}} <b>Parasol</b> <b>Mushroom</b> (Macrolepiota procera) and surface layer of soils {{collected}} from 11 spatially distant and background (pristine) areas in Northern Poland were analyzed for Ag, Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, and Zn by {{inductively coupled plasma}} optical emission spectroscopy and cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. In terms of bioconcentration and bioexclusion concept, K, Ag, Cu, Rb, and P were highly bioconcentrated in caps, and their bioconcentration factor values varied for the 11 sites between 120 and 500 — 67 – 420, 70 – 220, 10 – 170, and 45 – 100, respectively. Cd, Zn, Mg, and Na showed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) between 3. 3 and 36, 3. 7 – 15, 0. 92 – 6. 3, and 1. 4 – 44 while Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Sr were excluded (BCF[*]<[*] 1). The <b>Parasol</b> <b>Mushroom</b> is a species harvested in the wild, and its caps are of unique taste and can contain a spectrum of essential and hazardous mineral compounds accumulated at elevated concentrations, even if collected at the background (pristine) areas. These elevated mineral concentrations of the caps are due to the efficient bioconcentration potential of the species (K, Ag, Cu, Rb, P, Cd, Zn, Mg, and Na) and abundance in the soil substrates (Al, Ca, Fe, Mn). The estimated intake rates of Cd, Hg, and Pb contained in Parasol Mushroom’s caps show {{a cause for concern}} associated with these metals resulting from the consumption of between 300 - and 500 -g caps daily, on a frequent basis in the mushrooming season...|$|E
