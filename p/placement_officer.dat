30|$|Having {{sufficient}} {{and qualified}} {{personnel in the}} employment agencies and job centres is a prerequisite to successfully implementing {{active labour market policy}} tools. This is confirmed by comprehensive empirical evidence (see Rosholm 2014). In Germany, job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> in public employment services had to deal with up to 800 unemployed in the nineties. Empirical studies with comparison groups using Propensity Score Matching to solve the fundamental evaluation problem showed that a relationship of 1 : 60 allows job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> to do a better job: It turned out that the job placement probability of the treated was 15.31 percentage points higher (see Jerger et al. 2001). These results induced policymakers to invest in job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> {{as a part of the}} Hartz reforms.|$|R
30|$|Minimising the {{inflow rate}} {{has been a}} policy focus of the Hartz reforms. Job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> may use all {{available}} {{active labour market policy}} instruments conditional on budget constraints. Performance-related pay of job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> might be an additional route to follow (see Hasnain et al. 2012). However, the heart of the solution most likely lies in professional competency diagnostics by regional employment agency staff. Job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> face the challenge of making the short-term unemployed person’s strength more suitable and stronger for the labour market and to match these strengths with corresponding job offers in a timely manner. Lastly, job placement strategies must be continuously optimised in order to minimise the inflow rate from short-term unemployment (see van den Berg et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|As a {{first group}} of outcomes, we {{consider}} different aspects of job search behaviour.

First of all, we find that a One-Euro-Job announcement increases the probability of active job search by 4.7 percentage points from a base level of 54 %. More specifically, we find an increased likelihood of between four and six percentage points for job search via newspapers and family and friends, but no increased probability of using employment agency resources (via internet or <b>placement</b> <b>officers)</b> for job search due to a One-Euro-Job announcement. The number of different job search channels used increases by about one-fifth (0.19).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} first {{results from}} the model project 'profiling' which was conducted from 1. 12. 1999 until 30. 6. 2001 in three employment offices with financial support from the EU Commission. Two objectives of equal importance were pursued in the project: the development and testing of a profiling instrument for the early identification of unemployed individuals with {{an increased risk of}} becoming long-term unemployed, and the testing of a possible method of preventing long-term unemployment by means of early case management. The project was structured {{in such a way that}} the accuracy of the profiling instrument and the effect of the case management could be evaluated by means of a randomly selected control group. The profiling instrument developed in the project consists of a list of statistical characteristics of the newly registered unemployed persons, and a checklist for a classification to be made by the <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> as regards integration difficulties in connection with qualifications, mobility willingness, motivation and behaviour. In addition the <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> gave an assessment regarding the risk of possible long-term unemployment. The profiling instrument facilitated a certain prognostic separation into a group of unemployed persons with no recognisable risk and one with an increased risk of long-term unemployment. The average duration of unemployment, the rate of transition into long-term unemployment and the frequency of return to employment differ between the two groups. According to findings so far, the case management in the model project did not lead to a better prevention of long-term unemployment in the short term. It has not (yet) been possible, however, to obtain information as to the quality and stability of the integration.

40|$|Der Berufspsychologische Service (BPS) der Bundesagentur f Arbeit hat vier neue Dienstleistungen zur Kompetenzfeststellung (K-DL) entwickelt, die den Vermittlungs- und Integrationsfachkr 4 ften der Agenturen f Arbeit und Jobcentern in Form der gemeinsamen Einrichtungen (gE) zur Identifizierung von Kompetenzen der Kundinnen und Kunden dienen sollen. Durch die genaue Kenntnis der Ressourcen und St 4 rken der Kundinnen und Kunden soll eine passgenaue Vermittlung und gezielte F 6 rderung erm 6 glicht werden. Die vier K-DL unterscheiden sich in den durch sie erfassten Kompetenzen und in der Art ihrer Durchf: Bei K 1 handelt es sich um einen computergest Fragebogen zur Selbsteinsch 4 tzung von Verhalten im Berufsleben; K 2 ist ein Test zur Erfassung der Auffassungsgabe, K 3 ein diagnostisches Gespr 4 ch zur Begutachtung der Leistungsorientierung und K 4 ein Assessmentcenter zur Erfassung sozial-kommunikativer Kompetenzen. Nachdem die K-DL im Jahr 2012 fl 4 chendeckend eingef worden waren, erfolgte im Jahr 2013 eine breit angelegte Evaluation. Das hier vorgestellte {{qualitative}} Forschungsvorhaben ist Bestandteil dieser Evaluation. Die Untersuchung sollte vor allem die Frage beantworten, welche erw und unerw Effekte die K-DL auf den weiteren Integrations- und Vermittlungsprozess entfalten. Weitere, damit zusammenh 4 ngende Untersuchungsgegenst 4 nde waren der Anlass f die Nutzung einer K-DL, die Kommunikation zwischen Fachkr 4 ften und Kundinnen und Kunden bei der Einschaltung der K-DL sowie die Diskussion und Nutzung der Ergebnisse. Kernst des Projektes waren qualitative Interviews mit Vermittlungs- und Integrationsfachkr 4 ften sowie Kundinnen und Kunden an sechs Standorten, wobei jeweils eine Agentur f Arbeit und eine gemeinsame Einrichtung ber wurden. The Vocational and Career Psychology Service (BPS) of the German National Employment Agency {{has developed}} four new services for competence assessment. They {{can be used}} by job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> and case workers to better identify soft skills of their customers and use the results for job search and targeted integration measures. The four services differ in the competencies they assess and in their mode of operation. After nationwide implementation of the services had been completed in 2012, a large evaluation project was commissioned in 2013. The qualitative evaluation project whose results are presented in this report {{is an integral part of}} this evaluation. The main research question focuses on the effects that these new services have on the further processes of integration and job search. Other, related research questions focus on the constellations, in which the services are used, the communication about their use between job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> or case workers and customers and the use of the results of competence assessment for decision making and further support of customers. Central to this project have been qualitative interviews with job <b>placement</b> <b>officers,</b> case workers and customers in six regions or cities. In each region or city, job <b>placement</b> <b>officers</b> and case workers as well as customers of both jurisdictions of the social code (SGB II and SGB III) have been interviewed. The most important result is that the competence assessment services can have a positive effect on the further job search and integration processes, if they are embedded in a generally strength-oriented approach. Positive effects are strongest if the communication process between job placement officers/case workers and customers was already constructive and solution-oriented, and if the reasons for using a competence assessment are made transparent to the customer. Even if these conditions are met, however, the services are considered to be helpful only in specific constellations. In most cases, the positive effect consists in better knowledge of the soft skills of customers, which helps making better decisions about the aims in the job search and integration process, choosing appropriate qualification measures and analysing various other problems arising in the integration process. However, it could also be shown that the services cannot implement strength-orientation in job search and integration processes on their own. If the whole process is not oriented towards supporting and using interdisciplinary competences, the services are rarely used and/or their results are often not used productively...|$|R
