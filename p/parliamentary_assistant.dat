5|$|While Baird {{had been}} {{associated}} with red tories such as Timbrell and Beatty, he became associated with the conservative ideology of the Mike Harris-led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics. He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1995, defeating Liberal incumbent Hans Daigeler in the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean. The youngest member of the legislature, Baird was appointed <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> to the Minister of Labour on July 13, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders {{left the}} church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel and the greater Middle East as a young adult helped form his {{political}} views.

25|$|On 25 January 2017, the satirical weekly Le Canard enchaîné {{alleged that}} François Fillon {{employed}} his wife Penelope as his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> from 1998 and 2002 and {{for six months}} in 2012, with no evidence that she completed any substantial work. She collected a monthly salary of €3,900 to €4,600. After her husband's appointment as Minister of Social Affairs in 2002 and during his later tenure as Minister of National Education, {{she went on to}} serve until 2007 as a parliamentary aide to Marc Joulaud, Fillon's substitute, earning an increased salary upwards of €7,900 and with still no evidence of substantial work. The article claimed that she received a total of over €500,000 as a parliamentary aide, as well as €100,000 as a literary adviser to the Revue des deux Mondes. Its owner, billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, is a close friend of François Fillon. While deputies in the National Assembly can employ family members, those are still required to complete legitimate work, evidence of which the paper was unable to find. Based on that information and on the same day, the PNF (parquet national financier, or national financial prosecutor's office) initiated a preliminary investigation into possible embezzlement and misuse of public funds.|$|E

500|$|Living in Utrecht, Wilders {{initially}} {{worked in}} the health insurance industry.

During this time Geert Wilders travelled extensively, visiting countries all across the Middle East, including Iran, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Israel. Bolkestein was the first Dutch politician to address the consequences of mass immigration for Dutch society, including a sharp criticism of Muslim immigrants. He set an example for Wilders not only in his ideas but also in his confrontational speaking style.

2500|$|Le Canard enchaîné {{continued}} its run of stories on Fillon in its issue of 8 February, revealing that Penelope Fillon collected severance payments totaling €45,000, with €16,000 in August 2002 {{for the period}} 1998–2002 and €29,000 in 2013 for seventeen months of employment for which she earned €65,839.

Although aides are eligible to collect severance payments, the law does not permit such a high level for parliamentary assistants. An article in the same issue reported that Marie Fillon was simultaneously employed as a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> while training to become a lawyer, taking the first post in October 2005 and entering the [...] in January 2006. Fillon responded to the claims in a press release by saying that Le Canard enchaîné conflated the amount his wife collected in November 2013 with reported earnings in August 2007 after the conclusion of her work with Joulaud, and denounced the paper's allegations as [...] "lies".|$|E

2500|$|Duflot was {{considered}} the early favorite, though she initially opposed holding a primary, aware of the risk that she might lose it; and highlighted her experience in government. Her main proposal was to incorporate the fight against climate change into the Constitution. Jadot was perceived as her main challenger; elected as an MEP in 2009, he worked with Greenpeace France from 2002 to 2008, specializing in transatlantic trade and climate issues. With Thomas Piketty and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, he sought a [...] "primary of all the left", which failed to materialize. He rejected the [...] "candidacy awaited by the political-media world" [...] – that of Duflot, among others – and represented an anti-Duflot force from the party's right wing. Rivasi only barely managed {{to qualify for the}} primary, earlier lacking the necessary sponsorships. Like Jadot, she represented the radical wing of the party – albeit on its left flank – and served as deputy for Drôme from 1997 to 2002 and led Greenpeace France from 2003 to 2004. Delli, the daughter of Algerian immigrants, first became involved in politics as part of collective movements, and sought to become an MEP in 2009 after a stint as <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> to Marie-Christine Blandin. Also of the party's left-wing, she declared that she would defend a [...] "popular ecology".|$|E
2500|$|On 1 February, a {{week after}} its initial report, Le Canard enchaîné {{published}} revelations that the total sum received by Penelope Fillon in fictitious jobs apparently totaled more than €930,000; {{with the addition of}} the period from 1988 to 1990, her income as a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> now totaled €831,440. In addition, the satirical weekly also revealed that the payments to two of Fillon's children reached nearly €84,000, with €57,084 net for Marie Fillon and €26,651 for Charles Fillon. Video excerpts of a May 2007 Sunday Telegraph interview with Penelope Fillon surfaced on 2 February, in which she claimed that she had [...] "never been his assistant", referring to her husband; The footage aired on Envoyé spécial on France 2 that evening. The PNF expanded investigation into the fictitious employment affair to include Fillon's two eldest children the same day to verify the veracity of their work, after Le Canard enchaîné reported that neither Marie nor Charles Fillon were lawyers at the time their father served in the Senate. In a video on 3 February, François Fillon insisted that he would maintain his candidacy and called on his supporters to [...] "hold the line", seeking to assuage worries from within his own camp about the maintenance of his candidacy.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 February, Fillon {{seemingly}} {{withdrew his}} earlier promise {{that he would}} terminate his candidacy if placed under formal investigation, saying [...] "even if I am put under investigation, nothing will stop me" [...] in private. In an interview with Le Figaro published on 17 February, he insisted on continuing his campaign, declaring [...] "I am the candidate and I will continue until victory" [...] and that the closer to the election it was, the [...] "more scandalous {{it would be to}} deprive the right and centre of a candidate". On 24 February the PNF finally opened a judicial investigation into the [...] "embezzlement of public funds, [...] influence-peddling and failure to comply with transparency obligations of the HATVP" [...] against François Fillon, his wife, two of his children, and Marc Joulaud (who were left unnamed, presumably, to allow for expanding the investigation to other suspects, if necessary). The OCLCIFF, which failed to unearth any tangible proof of work by Fillon's wife as a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> to her husband from 1988 to 1990, 1998 to 2000, and 2012 to 2013 or to Marc Joulaud from 2002 to 2007, and was unconvinced by the two reviews in the Revue des deux Mondes attributed to Penelope Fillon, tasked three investigative judges to continue pursuing the affair. These three judges were identified on 27 February as Serge Tournaire, Stéphanie Tacheau, and Aude Buresi.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Fillon was placed under formal {{investigation}} for misuse of public funds, embezzlement, and failure to comply with HATVP disclosure requirements. On 16 March the investigation into Fillon was extended to [...] "aggravated fraud, forgery, and falsification of records". In particular, the probe sought to determine whether documents seized during {{a search of the}} National Assembly in March were forged in order to corroborate the veracity of Penelope Fillon's work as a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant.</b> The investigation was also expanded into possible influence-peddling related to Fillon's consulting firm 2F Conseil, which was previously hired by billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, owner of the Revue des deux Mondes, which employed Penelope Fillon. In 2013 de Lacharrière also provided a €50,000 loan to François Fillon, who failed to declare it as legally required. On L'Émission politique on 23 March, Fillon said that Bienvenue Place Beauvau, a book co-authored by Didier Hassoux of Le Canard enchaîné, suggested President Hollande ran a shadow cabinet to spread rumours about his opponents, a claim Hassoux subsequently denied. On 24 March, Marc Joulaud, Fillon's former substitute, was formally placed under investigation for embezzlement of public funds. Penelope Fillon was placed under formal investigation for complicity in and concealment of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, as well as aggravated fraud, on 28 March.|$|E
2500|$|The various {{investigations}} of the fictitious employment of 29 parliamentary assistants to 23 National Front (FN) MEPs, implicating the entourage of Marine Le Pen, continued through 2017. These fictitious jobs would constitute €7.5 million in losses for European taxpayers from the period 2010 to 2016. The European Anti-fraud Office (...) pursued the case, establishing that one of Le Pen's parliamentary assistants, Catherine Griset, never secured a lease in Brussels during the five years she was employed and only rarely appeared in the European Parliament, while another, Thierry Légier, worked as a bodyguard at the same time. Though the European Parliament demanded that Le Pen return €298,392 by 31 January 2018, representing the salary [...] "unduly paid" [...] to Griset, she refused to do so, and the European Parliament began to reduce her salary to reclaim the money. On 20 February, investigators raided the FN's headquarters in Nanterre {{for a second time}} in connection to the case; though Le Pen was summoned to appear before judges on 22 February in the Griset case, she refused to do so until after the June legislative elections, invoking the parliamentary immunity granted to her as a MEP. On 3 March, summoned to appear before judges to potentially be charged for breach of confidence, Le Pen was absent, again affirming that she would not respond to the case {{before the end of the}} campaign. On 6 March, Charles Hourcade, who served as <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistant</b> to FN MEP Marie-Christine Boutonnet, faced charges of [...] "concealment of breach of confidence" [...] in a separate case; like Le Pen, who described the investigations into the FN's fictitious employment of parliamentary assistants as a [...] "political operation", Boutonnet declined to appear before judges.|$|E

Regardless of the voter popularity, Tiura was not chosen in the ministerial negotiations between the coalition members of the incoming government to receive a ministerial portfolio, on the grounds that despite popular public support she is considered a political lightweight who is unable to work with others, pointing, for instance, to her high turnover of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>assistants.</b>|$|R
