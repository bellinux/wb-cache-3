40|$|During {{a period}} of two years, organic and {{inorganic}} suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and phytoplankton biomass was frequently measured in Lake Erken, a moderately deep, eutrophic lake in south-eastern Sweden. Regression analyses of these data were used to differentiate and quantify newly produced planktonic <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (zooplankton + phytoplankton + bacteria) and different types of resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (organic, inorganic). Resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> was frequently dominant in the water column (yearly mean 59 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter),</b> and resuspended <b>particulate</b> organic <b>matter</b> ranged from 11 to 99 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> organic <b>matter</b> (yearly mean: 40 %). The high amount of resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> originates from erosion/transportation bottoms which are located at water depths above 16 m and which cover 93 % of the lake area.

Mineral <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading is an important process contributing to mineral <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions accurately under weak wind conditions. At low <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, the models overestimated, and at high <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, the models underestimated emission factors. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to evaluate the <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emission factors for the mineral loading process. A new approach based on the mathematical form of a logistical function was developed and tested. It provided a realistic depiction of the <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions during the mineral loading process, accounting for fractions of fine mineral particles, dropping height, and wind velocity.

50|$|In July 2005, Wayne Nastri, Regional Administrator for Region 9 of the EPA, {{initially}} {{proposed the}} idea of a Diesel Emissions Reduction in the 109th Congress, 1st session.

He concludes that diesel fuel, when burned, emits both nitrogen oxides and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters.</b> Nitrogen oxides contribute to smog, while the particle matter contributes to illness in humans. Nastri even states that diesel exhaust is a likely carcinogen. Nastri concludes his address by stating that even through the current efforts of the Clean Diesel Emissions Campaign, it will take a staggering amount of money that the EPA does not have. He acknowledges this however, and states he looks forward to working with the members of the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change & Nuclear Safety of the Committee on Environment & Public Works to reduce the health effects of diesel exhaust.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to assess Behavior PM 10 data in different seasons and Determination effects on human health in Ahvaz city during 2013. Materials & Methods: Data <b>Particulate</b> <b>matters</b> less than 10 microns were taken from Ahvaz Department of Environment and Meteorological Organization. Sampling was performed for 24 hours in 4 stations. Method of sampling and analysis were performed according to EPA guideline. Processing data include the instruction set correction of averaging, coding and filtering. Finally, health-effects of <b>Particulate</b> <b>matters</b> less than 10 exposures were calculated with impact of meteorological parameters and converted as input file to the Air Q model. Results: PM 10 concentration in winter season was maximum amount in the year 2013. According to the research findings, highest and the lowest <b>Particulate</b> <b>matters</b> less than 10 microns concentrations during 2013 had the Bureau of Meteorology “Havashenasi” and Head office of ADoE “Mohitzist”.

This article presents {{a study on the}} effects of using different ventilation setups on the concentration level of gases and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> inside a passenger compartment of a university’s shuttle bus. The goal is to find a suitable layout of the air supply diffusers and air return grilles that would lower the concentration level of contaminants inside the passenger compartment. Field measurements were carried out to quantify the concentration of gases (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde) and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> (PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10). The measurements were done at the front section of the bus compartment, close to the front door. The data were acquired in the morning, afternoon and evening hours during a clear and sunny day. The bus travelled along an in-campus road with no passengers. A simplified three-dimensional model of the bus compartment was developed using computational fluid dynamics software. Flow analyses were carried out to predict distribution of gases and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> concentration. The concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> obtained from the field measurements were used as boundary conditions and for validating the computational model. A parametric study was carried out to identify a suitable layout of air supply diffusers and air return grilles that would lower the concentration level of the air contaminants.
