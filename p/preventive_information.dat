40|$|French law {{on major}} risk <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> for {{population}} setup the objective {{to make the}} citizen able to act for his own safety and to participate through his behaviour to the civil security. To reach this objective, the policymakers developed 4 regulatory tools {{that have to be}} implemented by the local authorities. These 4 tools do not meet the success factors of risk communication measures aiming at inducing behavioural adaptation to face risks. This, added to the fact that people who die in the last floods events in France lost their lives due to either a lack of knowledge of the risk or to a risk taking behaviour, led us to question the impact of the <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> regulatory tools. For the needs of our study we developed a risk perception and behaviour scale, helping us to classify the people of our sample. Our evaluation in Orléans shows that very few people know the regulatory tools and that their impact is quite low, far from the policymakers’ expectations. This highlight the real necessity to innovate in the field of flood risk communication...|$|E

Struck-by-falling-object accidents are not given adequate attention even though they are of great importance on construction sites. The objective of this paper is to analyze the proactively <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> requirement of struck-by-falling-object accidents and propose an integrated information management model using a ZigBee RFID sensor network to fulfill these requirements. First, the frequency of particular type of objects is analyzed based on vast historical accident cases. Next, this paper analyzes the proactively <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> requirement of struck-by-falling-object accidents and brought forth an integrated information management model. Furthermore, considering the crucial and controllable objects, an integrated information management model is proposed. This study would provide a possible approach for tracking struck-by-falling-object accidents based on real-time information for proactive prevention and could serve as a foundation for further study. © 2012 Elsevier B.

30|$|The {{literature}} abounds {{in studies}} questioning {{the representation of}} population exposed to natural hazard (Grothmann and Reusswig 2006; Joffe 2003; Paton et al., 2000; Perry and Lindell 2008; Renn 2004; Sjöberg 2000; Slovic et al. 2004; Slovic and Peters 2006; Wachinger et al. 2013; November and Leanza 2016). This literature also assumes that <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> campaigns impacts on the individuals’ behaviours exposed to hazards, whether they are natural or technological (Brilly and Polic 2005; Lowrey et al. 2007; Weinstein 1989). These studies conclude that informing {{the population of the}} risk they are exposed to should contribute to increase adoption of protection measures, to reduce the potential damages of disasters and should help to make the risks more acceptable for the society. In the case of natural hazards, the literature highlights that a link exists between <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> and the behaviour of individuals during a crisis, even if the nature of this relation is constantly questioned (Brilly and Polic 2005; Cutter et al., 2003; Lindell and Barnes 1989). This study pursues an in-depth reflection on this issue, by focusing on the part of risk representation and the legitimacy of its management in individuals’ behaviours.|$|E
40|$|Social {{vulnerability}} {{has been}} studied for years with sociological, psychological and economical approaches. Our proposition focuses on perception and cognitive representations of risks by city dwellers living in a medium size urban area, namely Mulhouse (France). Perception, {{being part of the}} social vulnerability and resilience of the society to disasters, influences the potential damage; for example it leads to adequate or inadequate behaviour {{in the case of an}} emergency. As geographers, we assume that the spatial relationship to danger or hazard can be an important factor of vulnerability and we feel that the spatial dimension is a challenging question either for better knowledge or for operational reasons (e. g. management of <b>preventive</b> <b>information).</b> We interviewed 491 people, inhabitants and workers, regularly distributed within the urban area to get to know their opinion on hazards and security measures better. We designed and mapped a vulnerability index on the basis of their answers. The results show that the social vulnerability depends on the type of hazard, and that the distance to the source of danger influences the vulnerability, especially for hazards with a precise location (industrial for example). Moreover, the effectiveness of the information campaigns is doubtful, as the people living close to hazardous industries (target of specific <b>preventive</b> <b>information)</b> are surprisingly more vulnerable and less aware of industrial risk...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{sociology}} of deviance {{can be used to}} improve our understanding of some difficulties and unintended effects of health-promotion interventions designed to change risk behaviours, especially drug-taking. Firstly, many people engaged in 'risk behaviours' tend to deny the 'risky' label just as delinquents neutralise the 'deviant' label, and <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> itself may be used by individuals in shaping risk denial. Secondly, deliberate risk-taking may be an 'innovative deviance',which is related to difficulties of conforming to the dominant 'risk culture'. Health promotion is likely to be quite ineffective if it remains wedded to the dominant risk culture and de facto contributes to the spread of it.

40|$|Patients receive differing {{amounts of}} {{preventive}} dental health information from their dentist. What factors affect {{the amount of}} <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> a patient receives? Many possible reasons which have been advanced for this difference are discussed in this paper. Using the clues presented in the literature, and results of a presurvey, some factors thought to influence the amount of preventive dental health information the patient receives were investigated. Specifically, the research problem was, "What {{is the relationship between}} the amount of preventive dental health information a patient receives from the dentist in his private office and the following factors: patient’s appearance, interest-responsiveness, nervousness, need for dental care, request for service, orientation to dentistry, and dentist’s liking for the patient? " The hypothesized relationships of amount of preventive dental information delivered to dentist’s perception of patient’s characteristics were not upheld The paper tentatively concludes that the characteristics of the dentist and his dental practice affect the <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> delivered more significantly than patient characteristics. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DENTIST AND PATIENT In an ideal situation, one would expect the greatest amounts of preventive dental health information (henceforth called PDHI) to go to the patient with the greatest need, and the least amount of information to the patient with least need (need is defined as need for dental health information based on mouth conditions that would respond to preventive dental behavior by patients). But this ideal does not happen in reality. In the studies discussed below, it becomes clear that people are likely to get differing amounts of information based on many things other than need...|$|E

The present survey has been conducted in the framework of an interdisciplinary work realized with experimentalist economists (Bchir and Willinger 2013; Heitz et al., 2012). The purpose is to link declarative data collected though questionnaires, to revealed measurements obtained thanks to the experimental protocols. The use of these two methods would allow reducing biases due to the subjectivity of the answers collected with the questionnaires, by an inspection based on individuals’ behaviours during experimental phases.|$|E

Basically, customers call their service provider’s health experts at reduced call rates. While this may provide convenient access to health information, there are several limitations. First, these services are limited in access to customers of respective service providers. Even among customers of such telephone network providers, not all may be aware of these services. Also, the health information may generally be provided in English. Further, the content of the information may be developed without much consideration of the unique health information needs of ethnocultural and migrant groups resident in different areas of the country. In effect, there exist a huge public health challenge of poor access to pertinent health information, particularly <b>preventive</b> <b>information,</b> among migrants, linguistically minority groups, and ethnocultural groups residing in Ghana.|$|E

30|$|Over the years, various {{technological}} {{methods have}} been developed to meet the demand for innovative approaches to the problem of language barriers in access to healthcare information. The Integrated Healthcare Communicator (Cheong 2014) is one such approach. It {{is believed to be the}} first smartphone app to support voice translation of healthcare instructions from English into a local dialect (Cantonese). Real-time over-the-phone interpretation services have also been adopted in certain countries like Canada to support patient-provider communication in hospitals (Dowbor et al. 2015). Overall, a review of published literature and unpublished data on the use of language interpretation approaches indicate that technological advances are feasible in improving healthcare communication as well as quality of care for linguistically minority populations (Masland et al. 2010). Unfortunately, the typical internet and smartphone-dependent nature of many of these methods make them less applicable to developing countries like Ghana. In Ghana, majority of residents in the rural areas typically have limited access to internet and smartphones. Besides, similar to medical interpreters, most of these technological approaches can be used only within healthcare settings, limiting their use in promoting access to <b>preventive</b> healthcare <b>information</b> among Ghana’s general population.|$|R
40|$|Epidemics seldom {{occur as}} {{isolated}} phenomena. Typically, {{two or more}} viral agents spread within the same host population and may interact dynamically with each other.

Exploiting a correspondence between the propagation dynamics and a dynamical process performing progressive network generation, we develop an analytic approach that accurately captures the dynamical interaction between epidemics on overlay networks. The formalism allows for overlay networks with arbitrary joint degree distribution and overlap. To illustrate the versatility of our approach, we consider a hypothetical delayed intervention scenario in which an immunizing agent is disseminated in a host population to hinder the propagation of an undesirable agent (e. g. the spread of <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> {{in the context of an}} emerging infectious disease).

40|$|All {{articles}} in Swiss newspapers with suicide or attempted suicide {{as the main}} topic were collected over a time span of 8 months. The aim was the investigation of a potential imitation effect {{and the extent of}} preventive messages given. A rating scheme for an assumed imitation effect based on different items for heading, text and picture was developed. The results show that approximately two-fifttis of all 151 articles were inappropriate in some aspects and were considered as bearing a high potential for imitation effect. The rating was significantly more unfavourable for the main Swiss tabloid paper than the other newspapers.

30|$|Overall, it is {{expected}} that this intervention would help to foster multiculturalism in Ghana in a number of ways. First, successful implementation of this multilingual health information service may promote a sense of belonging to the wider Ghanaian society among culturally diverse groups, while indicating acceptance of the unique cultural and linguistic identities of these groups. Evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention (from the evaluation stage) may also encourage establishment of programmes to bridge language barriers in other aspects of Ghana’s economy. This may in turn, facilitate equitable participation of diverse cultural groups in the respective aspects of the country’s economy. Furthermore, resources that may have been used to manage health complications that may arise from poor access to <b>preventive</b> health <b>information</b> (due to language barriers), may be channeled into developing and improving multicultural programmes and practices. Additionally, the intervention may not only promote equitable access to pertinent health information, but also, improve the actual physical and mental health of ethnocultural groups in the country. This is fundamental to multiculturalism, as without health, there may be substandard and unequal participation by all culturally diverse groups in the country’s activities with its associated impaired intercultural relationship building.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{language}} barriers may compromise {{the health of}} multicultural societies through poor access to pertinent <b>preventive</b> health <b>information</b> and its related poor access to quality healthcare services. Thus, all efforts to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed language-bridging strategy, particularly in plural societies that lack multicultural health policies and programmes, are worth considering. It is imperative that longitudinal study designs are adopted to ascertain the long term impact of the proposed intervention {{on the health of}} migrant and ethnocultural groups, as well as the feasibility of the MHIM in guiding development and implementation of the intervention. Also, research that examines the impact of an extended version of the intervention, where the intervention content can be accessed as automated voice messages by dialing short codes on mobile phones, may support special groups such as the visually impaired and those incapable of reading, to access key health information. Finally, future research that considers the benefits of “global integration” as associated with the concept of omniculturalism, compared to the sociocultural integration of multiculturalism needs to be championed and any necessary revisions to the proposed intervention, duly effected.|$|R

30|$|While {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} medical interpreters to improve access to and utilization of health information, it remains the case that these trained personnel are woefully scarce in most developing countries like Ghana. This {{may be due to}} the huge cost generally involved in training and hiring interpreters across healthcare settings (Dowbor et al. 2015). Even in countries with multiculturalism polices that foster bilingual competencies (e.g. Canada) and other developed countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, reports indicate a lack of professional interpreters (Dowbor et al. 2015; Lee 2003). These reports further suggest that linguistically minority groups in these countries may still face vital challenges to meeting their health information needs due to language barriers. In Ghana, where trained interpreters may be available, they may be fluent only in the languages of neighboring regions or countries. Furthermore, they may be primarily based in physical healthcare and urban settings and almost absent in mental healthcare and rural settings. Also, being typically based in hospitals, medical interpreters may not support easy access to <b>preventive</b> <b>information</b> among general populations faced with language barriers. Thus, for countries like Ghana, where the lack of healthcare resources necessitates primary prevention approaches to promoting public health, innovative solutions independent of real-time medical interpreters are worth considering.|$|E
