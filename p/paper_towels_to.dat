40|$|Abstract In {{contrast}} to many crickets and katydids, adult male camel crickets (Orthoptera: Raphidophoridae) do not stridulate {{and do not}} produce audible air-borne calling songs to attract females for mating.

In the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn, we test (1) the role of chemical cues in conspecific attraction, and (2) {{the role of the}} abdominal tubercles of adult males in producing those cues. We show (1) that virgin adult females are attracted <b>to</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> previously exposed <b>to</b> adult males, and (2) that <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> previously exposed <b>to</b> adult males with exposed tubercles are more attractive than <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> previously exposed <b>to</b> adult males with exper-imentally closed tubercles.

5000|$|The {{crime was}} {{observed}} by two eyewitnesses. The first, Kevan Baker, had stopped for gas at the Shamrock gas station. As {{he approached the}} office to ask the attendant to activate the pumps, he saw an unshaven man in a flannel shirt inside the gas station struggling with Lopez and trying to drag her by her hair {{to the back of}} the station. [...] The man apparently saw Baker, as he released Lopez and headed out of the station, coming face-to-face with Baker. Sergeant Steve Fowler reported that Baker said the man told him, [...] "I got a gun. Get back," [...] but Baker testified in court the man simply said, [...] "Don't mess with me." [...] Baker then reported the man ran away from the store, the exact direction in which he ran being a source of debate given conflicting wording from various reports. In his police report, Sergeant Fowler reported that Baker told him the attacker [...] "ran east from the store." [...] Baker testified at the trial that the attacker [...] "ran in an easterly direction." [...] On the other hand, Sergeant Olivia Escobedo's report indicated Baker had said the man [...] "fled off behind the station." [...] The original police radio alert from the scene (from Sergeant Bruno Mejia) reported the suspect was [...] "northbound on foot, to the rear" [...] of the store. Police also reported several other bystanders saying they'd seen a man [...] "running to the rear of the store." [...] Baker then saw Lopez staggering out of the station saying [...] "help me, help me" [...] before she slumped to the ground.

40|$|Vitelline {{membrane}} strength {{plays a role}} {{in preventing}} contamination of albumen by yolk during separation and is important to food safety. Two experiments were conducted to determine if a relationship exists between vitelline membrane protein banding patterns, interior egg quality, and vitelline membrane rupture strength. Eggs were gathered from commercial egg producers from pre-molt (26 wk or 72 wk) and post-molted (74 wk or 82 wk) hens. In each of two trials twenty-one eggs were gathered and stored (4 ?C) per experiment. Three eggs were evaluated on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from pre-molted hens; and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from molted hens for changes in SDS-PAGE protein banding patterns. The yolk from each egg was isolated and rolled on a wet <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> remove adhering albumen. The yolk was emptied and washed. The whole membrane was placed into double deionized water and divided into two sections. The first section was the whole membrane sample and the other was separated by forceps into inner and outer membrane samples. The three sections were dissolved separately in 1 % SDS/ 70 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6. 8. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method and proteins separated on 4 - 20 % gradient gel by SDS-PAGE. Protein banding patterns were analyzed using the Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst Densitometer. Reductions of VMO I and GP II occurred along with reductions in the protein bands between 60 to 100 kDa. In each of two trials, an additional one hundred forty eggs were gathered at the same time from the same flock and stored at 4 ?C. Twenty eggs were evaluated for quality on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from pre-molted hens; and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from molted hens. Yolk index, albumen height, albumen pH, and yolk pH were determined. Vitelline membrane strength was determined using a compression anvil. Two different treatments were used on the yolk when evaluating rupture strength: 10 egg yolks with inner thin albumen layer, and 10 egg yolks rolled on wet <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>to</b> remove inner thin albumen layer.

40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the handwashing behaviors of intensive care nurses based on personal statements, and to identify the microorganisms represented in the hand flora preshift and postshift. MethodsThis prospective study was performed with 60 intensive care nurses between January and December 2008, at a training and research hospital at a university in Turkey. Samples were taken from the hands of the nurses for bacteriological culture, using the bag-broth method, at the beginning and end of the shift. The samples were cultured aerobically and the colonies that grew were counted and identified. The nurses completed a self-report questionnaire, and their answers were evaluated. ResultsThe frequency of handwashing by participants during each shift was 32. 8 Â± 13. 9. Overall, 65 % of the nurses preferred alcohol-based antiseptic solutions for handwashing, 95 % used <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> dry their hands, and 98. 3 â€“ 100 % of the nurses washed their hands after performing care procedures. The Escherichia coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus species were found to be at significantly higher levels in the postshift hand culture samples when compared to the preshift hand culture sample values. Enterobacter cloacae was the only species found in the postshift hand culture samples of the nurses. ConclusionsThe number of colonies of the microorganisms in the hand flora of the nurses increased postshift.

The objective of this in vitro study was to introduce antibacterial properties <b>to</b> standard <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> surfaces by coating them with selenium nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy {{was used to measure}} the size and distribution of the selenium coatings on the <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> Atomic force microscopy was used to measure the surface roughness of <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> before and after they were coated with selenium nanoparticles.
