5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.

5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E
5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484.

By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> the Baltic states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of a week, British forces {{evacuated}} approximately 500 entitled <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> Sierra Leone—almost 300 of whom left in the first two days of the operation.

The use of the Lebanese Identity Card and PIN in claiming goods and monies sent from abroad {{has been designed to}} prevent unauthorized <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> claiming what is due to the Lebanese Identity Card holder.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from the embassy, {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 <b>persons</b> <b>from</b> the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy.|$|E
