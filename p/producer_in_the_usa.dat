40|$|The Farm Bill {{adopted in}} 1996 was widely {{seen to be}} the {{beginning}} of the end of agricultural market policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA.</b> Transfer payments to agricultural producers, entirely decoupled from production, replaced the earlier system of subsidies depending on market conditions. The underlying idea was that political forces should progressively withdraw from agricultural markets. As already foreseen <b>in</b> 1996, <b>the</b> act was replaced by new legislation adopted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early summer of 2002. The orientation of the new act differs fundamentally from that of its predecessor: changes already initiated were made undone, programmes about to expire were relaunched, funding for existing programmes was increased, and new programmes were introduced. However, a closer look at the 1996 - 2002 period also shows that the new Farm Bill is designed to replace the ad-hoc arrangements that used to be characteristic of US agricultural policy in recent years by longer-term support measures. The economic environment, including the strong US dollar and <b>the</b> crisis <b>in</b> South Asia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 1990 s, clearly led to a deterioration of conditions for agricultural <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA.</b> <b>The</b> situation was aggravated by severe natural disasters. As a result, there have been frequent references to a new "farm crisis" in recent years. US agricultural policy reacted to these events with substantial transfer payments to the agricultural sector, and subsidies are expected to stabilise at a high level under the new Farm Bill. The new programmes may even make it difficult or impossible for <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> to meet its current foreign-trade obligations. Moreover, under the impact of the new act, negotiations on a further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products within the framework of the new WTO Round will, most probably, not lead to the profound reforms envisaged a year ago.

40|$|International audienceAbstractNo-till {{practices}} are restoring and protecting soil health and are considered critical for achieving sustainability of global agriculture. Organic <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> {{would like to}} no-till, but are concerned about managing weeds without tillage. In conventional agriculture, no-till improves weed management in diverse rotations when crops are arranged in 2 -year intervals of cool season and warm season crops. A similar approach with organic rotations may enable producers to also accrue the weed management benefit of no-till in organic farming along with restoring soil health. Here, we review the benefits gained for weed management when a complex rotation is integrated with continuous no-till. The complex rotation included 3  years of a perennial legume and 6  years of annual crops arranged in 2 -year intervals of warm season or cool season crops. The no-till, complex rotation can (1) reduce weed emergence 3 - to 4 -fold in some annual crops; (2) delay weed emergence 2 to 4  weeks; (3) reduce yield loss due to weed interference; (4) suppress invasion of dandelion into cropland; and (5) enhance soil restoration, improve nutrient cycling, and increase soil porosity. Furthermore, perennial red clover {{can be converted to}} no-till cropland with fall mowing; thus, organic producers can include a perennial legume in a no-till rotation. The complex rotation increases the impact of no-till on weed seed decay in soil and provides numerous opportunities for cover crops to replace tillage for controlling weeds. These benefits suppress weed growth and interference such that organic producers may be able to continuously no-till in their farming systems, thus accruing restoration of soil health and long-term sustainability gained with no-till...|$|R

Growing cotton in monoculture with no tillage could lead to a small loss, no change, or a small increase in SOC, depending upon major land resource area, slope, and soil texture. The SCI predicted larger changes in SOC whenever no-tillage management was combined with cover cropping and cotton was rotated with high-residue-producing crops. Cotton <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> eligible watersheds of the Conservation Security Program could expect to receive an average of $ 3. 36 /acre, with payments up to $ 8 /acre, depending on practices employed and soil conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Integrating {{livestock}} {{with cotton}} (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) rotations offers profitable alternatives for <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern <b>USA,</b> but {{could result in}} excessive soil compaction, which can severely limit yields. A 2 year field study was conducted at two locations (both Plinthic Paleudults) in south Alabama to develop a conservation tillage system for integrating cotton and peanut production with winter annual grazing of stocker cattle under dryland conditions. Winter pasture and tillage were evaluated in a strip plot design with four replications. Winter pastures (main plots) were oat (Avena sativa L.) and ryegrass (Lolium mutiflorum L.). Tillage systems (subplots) included: 1) mouldboard plough + disking, 2) in-row subsoiling with a KMC subsoiler + disking, 3) no-till with KMCTM subsoiling, 4) paratill + disking, 5) no-till with paratilling 6) strict no-till, 7) disking, and 8) chisel plough + disking. We evaluated soil strength, seed cotton, and peanut yield. Soil compaction was increased by grazing to the 10 - 15 -cm depth but conventional tillage or conservation tillage with non-inversion deep tillage alleviated this problem. Forage species did not affect cotton yields. However, peanut yields were 13 % greater with oat than with ryegrass. Strict no-tillage resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowest yields (2. 22 and 2. 82 Mg ha- 1 for cotton and peanut, respectively; 20 % and 37 % less than the mean for cotton and peanut yield, respectively) and non-inversion deep tillag...|$|R

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record: 10026. 1 / 1153 on 01. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) An {{investigation into}} the possibilities for developing earth block walling as a contemporary, low impact and cost-effective construction method <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. Abstract Earth block walling has the lowest environmental impacts of any masonry material. Its embodied carbon dioxide can be one tenth that of fired bricks or autoclaved blocks. It can be recycled and locally made with limited technology thus reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} transport. Earth blocks can be made from waste earth produced as a by-product of other construction activities. The particular advantage of earth block walling over other earth construction methods, lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prefabrication of the masonry units. The production process is less weather dependent and the blocks are fully shrunk so that dimensional changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> completed walls are less severe. Blocks can be pre-tested for strength and durability prior to their inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building. This gives greater certainty in design. Earth block walling has the potential to replace conventional masonry in a significant proportion of UK dwellings. This thesis examines earth block walling from a practitioner's point of view. From design through to block production and site construction, it considers the obstacles to its wider use. It emphasises the cost penalties of earth block walling, believed to be the principal reason for its decline and its limited revival. It examines options for earth block production through case studies of earth block <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> France, <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> and <b>the</b> UK and assesses their potential for reducing production costs Earth mortars are also assessed and tested for strength. The cost savings of earth slurry mortars are considered both <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> speed of construction and the possibilities for reducing the thickness of walls by utilising the higher flexural bond strengtiis available with slurry mortars. Earth slurry mortars are tested for flexural bond strength. The results indicate that slurry mortars can offer considerable improvements in flexural bond strength particularly where the mortar is reinforced. Through these improvements in flexural strength comes the possibility of reducing the overall wall thickness which could offer significant cost savings over thick joint techniques using earth lime and cement mortars. Earthen codes current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> and France are reviewed and compared with UK Building Regulations and masonry design codes to identify the additional costs associated with earth design <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. It concludes that the absence of a specific earthen code <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK is a major obstacle to the revival of earth as a contemporary construction material. This thesis wresties with the dilemma of whether earth blocks should be produced on a local, small scale, using limited technology, thereby maximising the enviroimiental benefits; or whether the commercial benefits of mass production can offer economic viability without compromising the environmental advantages. It finds that the argument turns on the question of transportation and the distance between the production facility and the site of use. This thesis identifies the principal obstacles to the wider use of earth block walling. It emphasises the high cost of earth block constraction and the limited scope for reducing these costs down to that of conventional masonry. It identifies a need for greater fiscal and regulatory mtervention to tip <b>the</b> economic balance <b>in</b> favour of natural, low carbon materials such as earth block. It quantifies the environmental benefits of earth block wallmg and sets these against the additional costs involved...|$|R
