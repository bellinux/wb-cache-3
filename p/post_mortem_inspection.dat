40|$|Acute phase {{proteins}} (APP) such as haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and a, acid glycoprotein are blood proteins which {{increase in}} concentration from 10 - 1000 fold following infection and inflammation. Measurement of APP concentration in serum or plasma can provide useful quantitative diagnostic {{information on the}} presence of disease and can be used to monitor responses to therapy. Their use in experimental models of disease has been recognised and can provide a means of studying pathophysiology of disease as well as efficacy of treatment. Elevated concentrations of the APP have been detected in many infectious diseases including mastitis and pneumonia, but they are also raised in metabolic diseases related to the periparturient period in dairy cows.

40|$|Subcutaneous abscesses are lesions {{frequently}} reported in commercial rabbits. Both at farm and slaughterhouse level, these lesions {{are responsible for}} economic losses and a potential decrease in meat quality. The present study was devised to identify the main causes of meat condemnation in slaughtered commercial rabbits and assess the importance of abscess lesions in this domain. For these purposes,  281423 rabbits were evaluated during meat inspection at the slaughterhouse. The results achieved showed that subcutaneous abscesses were the major cause of condemnation, being responsible for the rejection of 1355 (0. 48 %) rabbit carcasses. The main affected area was the hind limbs (31. 37 %), followed by the cervical area (23. 10 %). Microbiological analyses of 27 abscess samples indicated Pasteurella spp. as the bacteria mostly isolated (59. 3 %), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (25. 9 %). These results enable us to advise the industry on the significance of abscesses as an important cause of economic losses, due to meat condemnation during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection,</b> and highlight the importance of implementing monitoring plans {{as a way to}} control this pathological problem. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the animal welfare measures for safe and wholesome meat production as well to understand different roles performed by delegated institutions in ensuring quality meat production. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured interview schedule was administered to 40 butchers and 40 veterinary officers of state department of animal husbandry, Himachal Pradesh. Result: It was found that open slaughtering was common (87. 50 %), animals did not have sufficient water provisions and often the lairage premises were devoid of adequate light thereby making ante-mortem and <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> difficult. Off feeding, offering potable water to animals before slaughtering was also less followed practice. Therefore, many a times the welfare of animals was not taken into consideration. Regular meat inspection was performed as an additional duty, by few (22. 50 %) veterinarians only. It was found that veterinarian's role was restricted to meat inspection only. The issue of license for slaughtering activities was the responsibility of district administration/municipal bodies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} oxidative stress in equine joints with degenerative processes, we analyzed synovial fluid (SF) antioxidant capacity and the concentration of oxidative damage biomarkers in healthy and chronically damaged metacarpophalangeal joints. SF samples were collected from joints of thirty 2 – 5 year-old crossbreed male equine, macroscopically classified at <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> and later histologically confirmed. The antioxidant capacity was determined measuring uric acid and the concentration of sulfhydryl groups and the total radical trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP). The oxidative damage was determined by assessing malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl protein concentration. TRAP was significantly higher (p 0. 05). Although carbonyl concentration did not show significant difference between groups, it was slightly higher in the group with CD (p= 0. 05009).

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{longitudinal study}} of diseases of lambs born in December and January and housed through to slaughter was carried out on three flocks (A, B and C) between 1989 and 1991. In {{the first year of}} the investigation (1989 - 90) three cohorts of approximately 80 lambs were examined in detail on a regular (weekly or fortnightly) basis. This involved over 2000 examinations and at least one clinical abnormality was observed in each lamb. In the second year (1990 - 1) the farmers were asked to present sick lambs for treatment on the farm. Farmers from flocks A and B participated in this part of the study; a total of 97 / 1295 lambs that were slaughtered received at least one treatment. The carcases and visceral organs of lambs from each flock were observed after slaughter. There was no association between the abnormalities observed during routine examination of the cohort lambs (year 1) and those observed at <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> meat <b>inspection.</b> However, in year 2, in lambs from flock A, there was a significant association between lambs treated for arthritis or pneumonia on the farm and the presence of arthritic or pleuritic lesions, respectively, <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> In both years of the study lambs which were older when slaughtered were significantly more likely to have pleuritic, pneumonic or arthritic lesions at meat inspection. It was concluded that routine examination of groups of lambs is an inefficient and possibly ineffective method to identify lambs with lesions at slaughter.

40|$|Strains of many {{infectious}} agents {{differ in}} fundamental epidemiological parameters including transmissibility, virulence and pathology. We investigated whether genotypes of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, bTB) differ significantly in transmissibility and virulence, combining {{data from a}} nine-year survey of the genetic structure of the M. bovis population in Northern Ireland with detailed records of the cattle population during the same period. We used the size of herd breakdowns as a proxy measure of transmissibility {{and the proportion of}} skin test positive animals (reactors) that were visibly lesioned as a measure of virulence. Average breakdown size increased with herd size and varied depending on the manner of detection (routine herd testing or tracing of infectious contacts) but we found no significant variation among M. bovis genotypes in breakdown size once these factors had been accounted for. However breakdowns due to some genotypes had a greater proportion of lesioned reactors than others, indicating that there may be variation in virulence among genotypes. These findings indicate that the current bTB control programme may be detecting infected herds sufficiently quickly so that differences in virulence are not manifested in terms of outbreak sizes. We also investigated whether pathology of infected cattle varied according to M. bovis genotype, analysing the distribution of lesions recorded at <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection.</b> We concentrated on the proportion of cases lesioned in the lower respiratory tract, which can indicate the relative importance of the respiratory and alimentary routes of infection.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLawsonia intracellularis causes porcine proliferative enteropathy {{and is one}} of {{the most}} {{economically}} important diseases in modern pig production worldwide. The Enterisol® Ileitis vaccine have been shown to reduce clinical disease and to increase weight gain, however, while the natural infection with L. intracellularis can provide complete protection against re-infection, this has not been achieved by this vaccine. We therefore undertook a detailed characterization of immune responses to L. intracellularis infection in vaccinated pigs (VAC) compared to previously infected pigs (RE) in order to pinpoint immunological determinants of protection. ResultsThe VAC pigs shed L. intracellularis to the same extent as non-vaccinated pigs after challenge, however less L. intracellularis in ileum and lymph nodes was seen post mortem. In the RE group, challenge did not lead to L. intracellularis shedding and no challenge bacteria were found post mortem. In both VAC and RE the acute phase haptoglobin response was diminished and L. intracellularis specific IgG responses were delayed and reduced compared to non-vaccinated pigs. On the other hand L. intracellularis specific IFN-γ responses tended to develop faster in the VAC group compared to controls. ConclusionAlthough vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs shed L. intracellularis at similar levels after challenge, a lower number of intestinal L. intracellularis was observed in the vaccinated pigs at <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection.</b> This might be due to the observed faster CMI responses upon challenge in vaccinated pigs. Complete protection against infection without L. intracellularis shedding, however, was only seen after a previous infection resulting in IFN-γ production predominantly by CD 8 + and CD 4 + CD 8 + cells. Improved protective vaccines against L. intracellularis should therefore target stimulation of these T cell subsets...|$|E
40|$|Ascaris suum is a {{zoonotic}} parasite. The worldwide {{importance of}} Ascaris suum in swine production is known, {{not only because}} of its impact on swine health but also on slaughterhouse condemnations. To the knowledge of the authors, there are no studies in Portugal about Ascaris suum impact at slaughterhouse level. For that reason, the aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the economic impact of hepatic rejections during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> caused by this parasite. For this purpose, the slaughter of swine (piglets and finishing pigs) from 32 farms (centre/south of Portugal) was attended. The average weight of the livers was estimated through the average of the livers’ weights from five random farms: 0. 3548 kg (piglets) and 1. 218 kg (finishing pigs). Taking into consideration that the price per kg of liver was 2. 23 euros (piglets) and 2. 02 euros (finishing pigs), price per liver was estimated: 0. 79 euros (piglets) and 2. 46 euros (finishing pigs). During the slaughter of 14812 piglets and 6094 finishing pigs were rejected, respectively, 5507 and 1951 livers, 44. 1 % and 60. 3 % of these, by parasitic hepatitis caused by migrations of Ascaris suum larvae. From the 32 farms, only pigs from three didn´t present lesions, ranging the percentage of rejections/farms between 1. 0 % and 100. 0 %. Regarding the economic impact related exclusively to hepatic rejections by Ascaris suum, the total billing has been estimated in 7. 362, 15 euros in piglets (with a loss of 20. 7 %, 1. 921, 04 euros), and 10. 193, 27 euros in finishing pigs (with a loss of 28. 4 %, 2. 898, 30 euros). This parasite has multisystemic consequences that were not evaluated in this study, so the economic impact should be higher and not neglected.

This fact has created a need to modernize the meat inspection system traditionally applied, driving the focus to risks that really threaten food safety nowadays. This modernization is a trend in meat producer countries and European Union is ahead in this process. In this way, Brazil is assessing the new systems and building an own proposal which has been conducted under a national project linked by many coordinated actions. The first step of this work is {{to analyze the data}} of current inspection system.

The analyzed database encompasses the reports of 114 slaughterhouses recorded from 2012 to 2014 into SIGSIF platform. The results were summarized by descriptive statistics on tables and figures using the SAS software. It was possible to show that the major “post mortem” causes of carcass/viscera trimming or condemnation were resulted from production diseases, as adherences (3. 72 %), pleurisy (0. 85 %), abscess (0. 58 %) and pneumonia (0. 20 %). Likewise for industrial process problems, as carcass contamination by evisceration leaking (1. 8 %) and traumatic lesions (1. 57 %). Zoonosis injuries condemnations were reported in very low frequency in a few slaughterhouses, usually once.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between tail lesions, cold carcass weight and viscera condemnations in an Irish abattoir. The following data were collected at the evisceration point from every 3 rd pig slaughtered over 7 days: farm identification, sex, tail lesion score, viscera inspection outcome and cold carcass weight. Tail lesions were scored according to a 5 point scale. Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the veterinary inspector. Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. Veterinary inspector shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms.

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} (MI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely implemented and longest running systems of surveillance. It was primarily introduced to identify meat of animals that is not fit for human consumption. Additionally, MI was progressively recognised as a suitable source of data collection and for monitoring a broad spectrum of diseases and conditions concerning animal health and welfare. For Europe, MI tasks are regulated at the European rather than country level and include a set of activities before and after stunning (ante and <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection)</b> involving visual inspection, palpation and incisions. Over the last decade, the current MI protocol has been challenged because of its low sensitivity for important public health hazards. We aimed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of current MI protocols with primary focus on its utility in the context of animal health – including both notifiable and production diseases – and welfare, i. e. its capacity to detect cases with an aim to quantify the frequency of animal disease and welfare cases. The consequences of an alternative inspection protocol using visual-only inspection were also explored. As a first step, a review of grey and published literature was conducted for a selected number of diseases and welfare conditions in seven species or species groups: swine, poultry, bovines, small ruminants, solipeds and farmed game, represented by red deer, wild boar, rabbits and ostriches. This review highlighted a substantial lack of suitable and accessible published data on the frequency of occurrence of many diseases and conditions affecting food animals in Europe. Additionally, there were very limited data on the detection performance of MI, particularly in relation to specific degrees of severity of clinical signs. Due to the data gaps, a large proportion of input data used in this work was based on expert opinion and general biologic manifestations of the conditions investigated. The probability of case detection was quantified using a scenario tree modelling approach, taking into account the frequency of case presentation and inspection coverage. In general, the performance of MI was highly correlated with the presence of clinical and/or pathological signs in affected animals. Early or subclinical cases were likely to be “non-detectable” at slaughter. Regarding detectable cases, the impact of moving to visual-only inspection was negligible for most notifiable diseases and conditions considered with a few exceptions, primarily detectable cases of tuberculosis. Current MI activities were found to be effective to detect the majority of animal welfare conditions considered by species, predominantly by ante mortem inspection. The effectiveness of MI was also considered for endemic diseases that are not currently subject to systematic control efforts. These included respiratory diseases and parasite infections. It was shown that MI could provide an efficient means of identifying producers in need of animal health advice, provided that information is collected and fed back to veterinarians and livestock farmers. Within an integrated information system, MI could substantially contribute to the control of a considerable range of animal health and welfare issues. Data already collected need to be made available for on-farm decision making. It was also noted that if the slaughter population is strongly affected by international trade, i. e. where a large proportion of animals originate from one country and are slaughtered in another, the usefulness of MI for endemic disease surveillance will be affected by either reduced coverage or bias or both. In conclusion, our results indicate that while ante mortem inspection remains essential for the detection of animal welfare conditions, a move to visual-only <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> has - for the diseases and conditions considered - negligible negative impact on disease control. However in countries or regions that are not free of TB, special relevance of palpation and cutting of lymph nodes will have to be considered. MI information has considerable potential to inform disease control efforts, but only few countries use it systematically limiting the actual benefit that is achieved by these data. Finally, MI can also provide “back-up” surveillance in a situation where other means of detection fail and may represent the sole means of case detection for certain infections (e. g. liver fluke or cestodes) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background When {{a severe}} {{peritonitis}} outbreak in semi-domesticated reindeer was noticed in 2003 in Finland, the concerned industry urged immediate preventive actions {{in order to}} avoid detrimental effects of S. tundra and further economical losses. A research programme was swiftly initiated to study S. tundra {{and its impact on the}} health and wellbeing of reindeer. Methods The ultimate aim of this study was to test the efficacy of different treatment regimes against S. tundra and associated peritonitis in reindeer. The timing of the trials was planned to be compatible with the annual rhythm of the reindeer management; (1) the treatment of calves in midsummer, during routine calf ear marking, with ivermectin injection prophylaxis and deltamethrin pour-on solution as a repellent against insect vectors, (2) the treatment of infected calves in early autumn with ivermectin injection, and (3) ivermectin treatment of breeding reindeer in winter. The results were assessed using the <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> data and S. tundra detection. Finally, to evaluate on the population level the influence of the annual (late autumn-winter) ivermectin treatment of breeding reindeer on the transmission dynamics of S. tundra, a questionnaire survey was conducted. Results In autumn, ivermectin treatment was efficient against peritonitis and in midsummer had a slight negative impact on the degree of peritonitis and positive on the fat layer, but deltamethrin had none. Ivermectin was efficient against adult S. tundra and its smf. All the reindeer herding cooperatives answered the questionnaire and it appeared that antiparasitic treatment of reindeer population was intense during the study period, when 64 – 90 % of the animals were treated. In the southern part of the Finnish reindeer husbandry area, oral administration of ivermectin was commonly used. Conclusion Autumn, and to a lesser degree summer, treatment of reindeer calves with injectable ivermectin resulted in decreased severity of peritonitis and perihepatitis in reindeer calves due to setariosis. In the case of necessity for animal welfare reasons, treatment during early autumn round ups should be considered. On the population level, massive and routinely applied antiparasitic treatments can improve the health of breeding reindeer and decrease the mortality and the number of carriers but during the outbreak could not prevent its movement and expansion to the North. </p...|$|E

METHODS [...] A nationwide survey of Royal College of Pathologists' district tutors (n = 216) was done by postal questionnaire. These were completed by the district tutors or passed on to their histopathologist colleagues. The results were collated after three months. After one follow up letter, an 86 % response rate, which is a significant sample, was achieved. RESULTS [...] Twenty eight per cent of respondents were performing HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. Of {{those who were not}} performing them (30 %), the lack of clinical or coroner requests was the most common explanation. All regions provide facilities for HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations, as judged by the responses. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings are of singular importance as it is the first United Kingdom survey investigating the distribution of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations on HIV infected cadavers. Studying <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> material using a systemic, coordinated collection of brain tissue is essential to increase knowledge of a new disease of pandemic proportions...|$|R

40|$|Huntington {{disease is}} {{associated}} with elongation of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene that results in a mutant huntingtin protein. Several studies have implicated N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in Huntington disease pathogenesis. Ideally, these fragments are studied in human brain tissue. However, the use of human brain tissue comes with certain unavoidable variables such as <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay, artefacts from freeze-thaw cycles and subject-to-subject variation. Knowledge on how these variables might affect N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> human brain is important for a proper interpretation of study results. The effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on protein in human brain is known to {{vary depending on the}} protein of interest. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments using western blot. We mimicked <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay in one individual control case and one individual Huntington disease case with low initial <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay. The influence of subject-to-subject variation on N-terminal huntingtin fragments was assessed in human cortex and human striatum using two cohorts of control and Huntington disease subjects. Our results show that effects of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments are minor in our individual subjects. Additionally, one freeze-thaw cycle decreases the huntingtin western blot signal intensity in the cortex control subject, but does not introduce additional N-terminal huntingtin fragments. Our results suggest that subject-to-subject variation contributes more to variability in N-terminal huntingtin fragments than <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay...|$|R

Suckling lambs carcasses {{were assigned to}} three different <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> treatments: conventional (2 C for 24 h), ultra-rapid (20 C for 3. 5 h then 2 C until 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem)</b> and slow (12 C for 7 h then 2 C until 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem).</b> Carcass pH and temperature were measured at 0, 3. 5, 7 and 24 h post slaughter. Lamb carcasses were sampled for total aerobic viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts just after dressing and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> A significant effect (p< 0. 05) of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> treatment on carcasses temperature and pH was found corres-ponding the faster pH fall to slowly chilled muscles. However, {{no differences were found}} at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> among treatments in both parameters. Regarding microbiological results, carcasses of ultra-rapid treatment had the lowest total aerobic viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts and those belonging to conventional treatment had the highest total aerobic viable counts. From 0 to 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem,</b> an increase of total aerobic viable was observed in conventional and slow treatments whilst Enterobacteriaceae counts remained con-stant in all cases. From a microbiological point of view, the ultra-rapid treatment was the only one allowed to maintain the hygienic carcasses quality.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the incidence of hand injury and hand contamination during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. A prospective study of injury and glove puncture rate was conducted during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations performed in 1990 on adults in Northwick Park Hospital mortuary. Four pathologists and two assistants performed a total of 44 <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations on adults. All participants completed a questionnaire after each examination, recording the total number of gloves used and the number of hand injuries and glove perforations sustained. Just over 8. 3 % of gloves were punctured; 31. 8 % of these punctures went unnoticed. Evisceration was the procedure most likely to result in hand contamination. The study highlights a significant risk which could be reduced by more care, frequent glove changes, and hand washing during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. In particular, gloves should be changed and hand washed when evisceration has been completed...|$|R
