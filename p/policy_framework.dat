40|$|Purpose – Disaster risk {{reduction}} is {{prominent in the}} international policy agenda and the year 2015 brought together three international <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> which contribute to disaster {{risk reduction}} (i. e. the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction, the sustainable development goals, and Paris climate change agreement – COP 21). However, there is a dearth of effort at identifying and aligning the specific educational needs of built environment professionalswith the three <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This is needed to facilitate the incorporation {{of the contents of}} the <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> into built environment professionals’ training. Therefore, this study maps the educational needs of built environment professionals with the core areas of the three international <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Design/methodology/approach – This study utilised CADRE (Collaborative Action towards Disaster Resilience Education) research project outcomes alongside the earlier mentioned three international <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> A comprehensive desk review was done to map the educational needs identified in the CADRE project with the core priority areas of the three <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Findings –The study revealed the educational needs that are significant towards an effective implementation of the core priority areas of the three international <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Practical implications – This study would be beneficial to the built environmentprofessionals involved in disaster risk reduction. They will be aware of the specific knowledge areas that would aid the successful implementation of the aforementioned three international <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Originality/value – The outcomes of the study would be beneficial to higher education providers in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development.

Most notably, {{a series of}} eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the indigenous and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Development. The role of the {{treaties and}} the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, such as health care, and exemption from taxation. The legal and <b>policy</b> <b>framework</b> within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.|$|E

30|$|The early {{childhood}} years in Australia are generally understood {{to cover the}} period of life from birth to age eight. During this period, children may experience a range of care and education services from their birth through to five years, after which compulsory full-time schooling commences. In this article we focus mainly on the provision of services and <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> for children from birth to five years, and give less attention to <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> covering {{the first years of}} school. This {{is due to the fact}} that full-time schooling is covered by state government Education Acts which often operate quite separately from legislative and <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> that cover the years prior to school. This separation between prior to school and school policies and legislation has created an additional factor to be negotiated if reforms in {{early childhood}} education and care are to be successfully implemented, as will be discussed later.|$|R
