40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of quantifiable probability and quantification uncertainty of water pollution from local pollutant sources at and below the land surface, through the groundwater system, to downstream surface water recipients. Methodologically, the study shows how the risk and uncertainty of surface water pollution within a catchment may be assessed by a combined methodology of a Lagrangian stochastic advective-reactive modelling approach, which accounts for the quantifiable pollutant transport randomness, and a scenario analysis approach, which accounts for different quantification uncertainties. The results show that, in general, unambiguous risk assessment requires at least a reliable order-of-magnitude quantification of the prevailing relation between the average rate of <b>physical</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport from source to recipient and the average rate of pollutant attenuation. If this average relation can be reliably estimated to fall within two identified, relatively wide open value ranges, the assessment of pollution risk to surface waters from localised sources at or below the soil surface may be unambiguous even under otherwise large quantification uncertainty. For a relatively narrow, closed value range of this average rate relation, however, risk assessment must either rely on conservative assumptions, or else {{be based on a}} more detailed and resource demanding quantification of pollutant transport...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Traditionally, fear of {{contamination}} research in OCD has involved physical contamination, where {{the sense of}} dirt arises from contact with clear and tangible contaminants (e. g., germs, dirt and harmful substances). More recently, however, it has been postulated that feelings of dirtiness and contamination can also arise {{in the absence of}} contact with a <b>physical</b> <b>pollutant</b> (termed mental contamination). However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that examined the relationship between mental contamination, disgust propensity and fear {{of contamination}}. The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the presence of mental contamination in a sample of OCD patients; 2) to explore the association between mental contamination, disgust propensity and fear of contamination in a sample of OCD patients, controlling for anxiety and depression; 3) to analyze the role of mental contamination as a mediator in the relationship between disgust propensity and contamination-related symptoms. Method: 83 OCD patients completed a series of self-report questionnaires that included mental contamination (VOCI-MC), disgust propensity (DPQ), OCD symptoms (DOCS), anxiety (BAI) and depression (BDI-II). Results: Significant correlations were found between disgust propensity, mental contamination and fear of contamination, controlling for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis indicated that mental contamination played a role as mediator in the relationship between disgust propensity and fear of contamination. Conclusions: Our study provided preliminary evidence that disgust propensity play a role in arising mental contamination feelings, which is strongly related to fear of contamination.

40|$|Carbon-based {{nanoparticles}} (CBNs) {{are largely}} distributed worldwide due to fossil fuel combustion and {{their presence in}} many consumer products. In addition to their proven toxicological effects in several biological models, attention {{in recent years has}} focussed on the role played by CBNs as Trojan-horse carriers for adsorbed environmental pollutants. This role has not been conclusively determined to date because CBNs can decrease the bioavailability of contaminants or represent an additional source of intake. Herein, we evaluated the intake, transport and distribution of one of the carbon-based powders, the so-called carbon nanopowder (CNPW), and benzo(α) pyrene, when administered alone and in co-exposure to Danio rerio embryos. Data obtained by means of advanced microscopic techniques illustrated that the “particle-specific” effect induced a modification in the accumulation of benzo(α) pyrene, which is forced to follow the distribution of the <b>physical</b> <b>pollutant</b> instead of its natural bioaccumulation. The combined results from functional proteomics and gene transcription analysis highlighted the different biochemical pathways involved in the action of the two different contaminants administered alone and when bound together. In particular, we observed a clear change in several proteins involved in the homeostatic response to hypoxia only after exposure to the CNPW or co-exposure to the mixture, whereas exposure to benzo(α) pyrene alone mainly modified structural proteins. The entire dataset suggested a Trojan-horse mechanism involved in the biological impacts on Danio rerio embryos especially due to different bioaccumulation pathways and cellular targets...|$|E

40|$|Gravel {{filters are}} {{potentially}} a low cost, low maintenance water treatment solution. They require no mechanical or electrical parts and can operate without {{the addition of}} chemicals or the need for close supervision. As such, they are an appropriate technology for treating road runoff {{as a component of}} Sustainable urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) and as an initial stage of drinking water treatment in rural areas. However, the processes by which pollutant particles are removed in gravel filters are poorly understood and practical experience shows that many filters fail long before their expected design life is reached. For this reason gravel filters are little used for drinking water treatment and, when they are incorporated into SuDS, their removal efficiency and maintenance requirements are unpredictable. The aim of this thesis was to better understand particle removal processes and the implications for gravel filter design. This was achieved through a combination of lab-based experiments and numerical modelling. • The change in conservative tracer transport characteristics with pollutant particle accumulation was assessed through column experiments. • The spatial heterogeneity of particle accumulation was measured by collecting 3 D data with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple scans of filters allowed the temporal evolution of particle accumulation to be assessed. A method for processing the raw MRI data to yield the change in 3 D pore geometry was developed, assessed and applied. • A simple method for extracting and comparing pore network characteristics at different stages of particle accumulation was applied to the MRI derived geometry. • Direct modelling of the 3 D MRI pore geometry with the open source software OpenFOAM allowed correlation of flow velocities with particle accumulation at each point in the pore network. Lagrangian particle tracking was used to simulate the transport of a conservative tracer through the filter. Key findings were that spatial heterogeneity in particle accumulation was influenced by both initial pore geometry and the temporal evolution of the pore network with accumulation. This was attributed to the formation of high velocity preferential flow paths that were evident in both the 3 D MRI data and the numerical model of that data. Pore networks exhibited a decrease in connectivity with accumulation and this was mirrored by a decrease in the volume of the filter that was accessible to a conservative tracer. Conclusions of this thesis are that MRI is a useful tool for non-invasively assessing the spatial variability of clogging in gravel filters and, when combined with numerical modelling of the pore geometry, for establishing the link between pore velocity and particle removal. The formation of preferential flow paths is detrimental to the pollutant removal efficiency of a filter and could explain why many filters fail to produce good quality effluent well before their <b>physical</b> <b>pollutant</b> storage capacity is reached. ...|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential effect of climate changes on the quality of stormwater runoff and on the treatment efficiency of a stormwater retention pond in Denmark by applying an integrated stormwater quality model for long term simulations with a realistic climate change scenario as input. The analysis focused on total suspended solids (TSS), and copper (total and dissolved Cu) loads and concentrations in runoff from a catchment as well as in the outlet of a stormwater retention pond. These were selected among a wider range of stormwater priority pollutants as indicators of <b>physical</b> <b>pollutants</b> and micropollutants (MP) that can potentially be removed via settling. TSS is closely associated with immediate as well as accumulated aesthetic and environmental effects. Cu is ubiquitous in stormwater runoff and available in both dissolved and particulate phases, where especially the dissolved phase causes acute toxicity to aquatic life (Eriksson et al. 2007; Ingvertsen et al. 2011) and therefore is regulated (European Commission 2000, 2008). The stormwater pollutant fluxes were estimated by using the integrated dynamic stormwater quality model presented by Vezzaro et al. (2012 a). The potential effect of climate changes on the rainfall pattern and consequently on the stormwater runoff quality and treatment efficiency of stormwater retention ponds was evaluated by applying two 100 -year synthetic rain series, where one represented the current climate conditions and the other represented the climatic conditions expected 100  years into the future.|$|R

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between change in liver tissue glutathione (anti- oxidant) and malondialdehyde (one metabolite of lipid oxidation) levels that occur in rabbits which were exposed to continuous loud noise. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 12 white Newzeland male rabbits in Tarbiat Modarres University in 2004. The rabbits were assigned to the following two groups: control, and exposed to continuous loud noise for 96 hours (8 h/day for 12 days, SPL= 110 dBA and 250 Hz to 20 KHz). The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) in liver tissue samples were measured in rabbits after exposure to noise. Thiobarbituric acid reacting substance, Ellman's reagent and spectrophotometry techniques were used for this measurement. The data were statically analyzed by SPSS software and 2 groups were compared by t-test. Differences at the level of P< 0. 05 were considered statistically significant.

In this study, the validity of these assumptions is theoretically investigated. An analytical model using the conventional convection approach and a numerical conjugate mass transfer model are developed. The conjugate mass transfer models consider unsteady two-dimensional laminar forced convection over a flat plate coupled with unsteady one-dimensional diffusion and sorption within the porous solid through the concentration and the flux continuities at the material–air interface.

Specific objectives of the journal, among others, are the presentation of: • original monitoring data, experimental data, theoretical investigations and mathematical modeling of processes in environmental systems; • processes related to the interactions of the water, air-atmosphere, and soil-sediment environments with the humans and the biosphere; • environmental flow processes, hydrodynamics and hydrology; • <b>pollutant</b> <b>physical,</b> chemical and biological processes, including pollutant sources an...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC) are major indoor air <b>pollutants.</b> <b>Physical</b> models {{that have been}} developed to predict VOC source (emission) and sink behavior (sorption) of building materials, commonly adopt the conventional convection approach using third-kind boundary condition assuming quasi-steady convective mass transfer in fluid (air). In this study, conjugate mass transfer models were developed to investigate the validity and application limit of the assumption. The conjugate mass transfer models consider either quasi-steady or unsteady two-dimensional laminar forced convection over a flat plate coupled with unsteady one-dimensional diffusion and sorption within the porous solid through the concentration and the flux continuities at the solid-air interface. The simulation results indicated that the quasi-steady assumption in convection mass transfer may result in significant overestimation of wall concentration or underestimation of Sherwood number in the early transfer phase; however, the errors caused by the quasi-steady assumption become less than 5 % after about 2. 5 times of convection characteristic time, i. e., the time taken by a particle moving with a constant velocity to travel along the plate...|$|R
40|$|The skin {{consists}} of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis. The dermis is superficial to the subcutaneous fat tissue and is reachable by blood capillaries. Dermal fibroblasts synthesize a complex extracellular matrix containing collagenous and elastic fibers. The epidermis contains mostly keratinocytes that rise to the skin surface as they differentiate progressively to form the non-nucleated corneocytes that {{consists of}} the superficial part of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC). The SC comprises a unique two-compartment system of structural, nonnuclated cells (corneocytes) embedded in a lipid-enriched intercellular matrix, forming stacks of bilayers that are rich in ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids. SC functions as a physiochemical barrier to protect and prevent water loss from the epidermis, maintaining its integrity, and to provide protection from the environment by producing antioxidant molecules which interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) or their by-products to either eliminate or to minimize their deleterious effects. The SC supports the absorption of liposoluble compounds and promotes the penetration of lipophilic molecules. There are several ways how molecules can penetrate in the SC such as: intercellular (penetration between the corneocytes), transcellular (penetration through the keratinized corneocytes), intrafollicular (penetration through hair follicles), and/or polar (penetration between polar pores) (Pouillot, et al., 2008). Physiochemical factors which regulate penetration include molecular mass, concentration, solubility, partition coefficient, pH variations, co-solvents, temperature, and enhancers. Because of its critical location, the SC is a major interface between {{the body and the}} environment and provides a biological barrier against an array of chemical and <b>physical</b> environmental <b>pollutants.</b> Due to the constant exposure to oxidants including ultraviolet (UV) radiation and other environmental pollutants such as diesel fuel exhaust, cigarette smoke (CS), halogenated hydrocarbons, heavy metals and O 3 (one of the most toxic of these compounds, the SC can be defined as our first defense against the outdoor environment...|$|R
