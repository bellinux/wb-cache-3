40|$|Background Exacerbations {{of heart}} failure appear {{frequently}} associated with <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> {{not directly related to}} the evolution of cardiac disease. There still a paucity of data on the proportional distribution of <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> specifically in elderly patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine prospectively the <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> leading to hospitalization in elderly patients with heart failure in our community hospital. Methods We evaluate elderly patients who need admissions for decompensate heart failure. All patients were reviewed daily by the study investigators at the first 24 h and closely followed-up. Decompensation was defined as the worsening in clinical NYHA class associated with the need for an increase in medical treatment (at minimum intravenously diuretics). Results We included 102 patients (mean age 79 ± 12 years). <b>Precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> were identified in 88. 5 %. The decompensation was sudden in 35 % of the cases. Noncompliance with diet was identified in 52 % of the patients, lack of adherence to the prescribed medications amounted to 30 %. Others <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> were infections (29 %), arrhythmias (25 %), acute coronary ischemia (22 %), and uncontrolled hypertension (15 %), miscellaneous causes were detected in 18 % of the cases (progression of renal disease 60 %, anemia 30 % and iatrogenic factors 10 %). Concomitant cause was not recognizable in 11. 5 %. Conclusions Large proportion heart failure hospitalizations are associated with preventable <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors.</b> Knowledge of potential <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> may help to optimize treatment and provide guidance for patients with heart failure. The presence of potential <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> should be routinely evaluated in patients presenting chronic heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus) and its {{unpredictable}} flares have {{lowering the}} patients’ {{quality of life}} significantly. Precipitating factors’ exposures need to be reduced by doing preventive behaviors to reduce the frequency of lupus flare. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> and preventive behavior in lupus patients. Method: This is a cros-sectional study. Population was all lupus patients doing regular check-up in Rheumatology Unit of Dr. Soetomo Public Hospital, Surabaya. Sample was lupus patients who did regular check-up {{in the period of}} October-December 2014 and matched to sample’s criteria. Sample size was 36 enrolled by means of total sampling. Independent variabel: <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> of lupus flare; dependent variable: knowledge of lupus, attitude (self-efficacy) and preventive action towards exposures. Instruments used were questionnaire of lupus <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> and ODAPUS-HEBI (part 1, 2, 3). Data analysis used Spearman Rho correlation with α< 0. 05. Result: Most respondents are late adulthood, get married, high school graduates and actively working. The majority had lupus for 1 - 2 years. <b>Precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> were mostly physical stres (66. 7 %). Symptom of lupus that most often relapse was joint pain. Knowledge of lupus in all respondents was high, as for attitude mostly were high and most respondents doing optimal preventive action. There was no correlation between the <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> of lupus flare with lupus knowledge (p= 0. 342) and attitude (p= 0. 651). There was a weak but significant correlation between the <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> with preventive action (r = 0. 360; p= 0. 031). Discussion: <b>Precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> of lupus flare vary among patients so that preventive actions taken adjust to the type of exposure. The preventive action taken optimally could minimize the recurrence of lupus flare. Conclusion: There is a correlation between the <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> of flare with preventive action in lupus patients.   Keywords: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> of lupus flare, preventive behavio...|$|R

40|$|Relapse of {{congestive}} heart failure (CHF) frequently occurs and has serious consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. Many studies have investigated the aetiological and prognostic factors of CHF, but there are only limited data on the role of <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> that trigger relapse of CHF. Knowledge of potential <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> may help to optimise treatment and provide guidance for patients with CHF. The literature was reviewed to identify factors that may influence haemodynamic homeostasis in CHF. <b>Precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> that may offer opportunities for preventing relapse of CHF were selected. Potential <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> are discussed in relation to the pathophysiology of CHF: alcohol, smoking, psychological stress, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, poor treatment compliance, and inappropriate medical treatment. Poor treatment compliance in particular is frequently encountered in patients with CHF. Furthermore, studies of medical treatment under everyday circumstances indicate that some aspects of the management of CHF can be improved. In conclusion, the identification of <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> for relapse of CHF may strongly contribute to optimal treatment. Improvement of treatment compliance and optimalisation of medical treatment may offer important possibilities to clinicians {{to reduce the number of}} relapses in patients with CHF.    Keywords: {{congestive heart}} failure;  precipitating factors;  preventio...|$|R

The characteristics and prognostic impact of <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> have not been studied in patients with HFPEF. AimsTo study the characteristics and impact on long-term outcome of HF <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> in patients surviving a first hospitalization for HFPEF. MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational study (11 healthcare establishments, Somme, France) and included consecutive patients discharged alive after a first hospitalization for HFPEF. <b>Precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> were collected on admission (acute coronary syndromes [ACS], uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, worsening of renal function [WRF], non-adherence to therapy, and pneumonia). Mortality analyses used Cox models. Patients were followed for 5 years. ResultsThe cohort comprised 358 patients (76 ± 10 years, 53 % women). Mean EF was 63 ± 8 %. One ore more <b>precipitating</b> <b>factors</b> were identified in 274 patients (76 %). The most common were arrhythmia (37 %), pneumonia (16 %), ACS (12 %), and WRF (12 %). Uncontrolled hypertension and non-adherence to therapy were identified in 9 % and 10 % of cases, respectively. Arrhythmia (HR 1. 35 [1. 02 - 1. 80];p= 0. 03) and pneumonia (HR 1. 44 [1. 01 - 2. 07];p= 0. 05) were independently related to increased 5 -year mortality.
