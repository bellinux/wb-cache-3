40|$|The {{increase}} in urbanisation {{is making the}} management of city resources a difficult task. Data collected through observations of the city surroundings {{can be used to}} improve decision-making in terms of manage city resources. However, the data collected must be of quality {{in order to ensure that}} effective and efficient decisions are made. This study is focused on improving emergency and non-emergency services (city resources) by using Participatory Crowdsourcing as a data collection method (collect <b>public</b> safety <b>data)</b> utilising voice technology in the form of an advanced IVR system known as the Spoken Web. The study illustrates how Participatory Crowdsourcing can be used as a Smart City initiative by illustrating what is required to contribute to the Smart City, and developing a roadmap in the form of a model to assist decision-making when selecting the optimal Crowdsourcing initiative. A <b>Public</b> Safety <b>Data</b> Quality criteria was also developed to assess and identify the problems affecting Data Quality. This study is guided by the Design Science methodology and utilises two driving theories: the characteristics of a Smart City, and Wang and Strong’s (1996) Data Quality Framework. Five Critical Success Factors were developed to ensure high quality <b>public</b> safety <b>data</b> is collected through Participatory Crowdsourcing utilising voice technologies. These Critical Success Factors include: Relevant <b>Public</b> Safety <b>Data,</b> <b>Public</b> Safety Reporting Instructions, <b>Public</b> Safety <b>Data</b> Interpretation and Presentation Format, <b>Public</b> Safety <b>Data</b> Integrity and Security, and Simple Participatory Crowdsourcing System Setup...|$|R

25|$|In June 1995, the Virginia Board of Education adopted Governor Allen’s Commission on Champion Schools {{recommendation}} for statewide standardized tests for academic accountability. The Board of Education {{voted in favor}} of implementing the Standards of Learning (SOLs) which measures student achievements and ensures accountability for schools in the core subjects of English, mathematics, history, economics, and science. The commission also recommended the creation of an annual ‘report card’ to grade each public school's performance stating that: “If Virginia’s youngsters can’t make the grade, then neither should their schools” (2)(9). Experts suggested that in order {{to improve the quality of}} learning, a school should emphasize academic goals and effective leadership. By using measurement through tests, the state, teachers, and parents can monitor the effectiveness of schools teaching the basic fundamental subjects (1). Allen’s legislation used <b>public</b> <b>data</b> of SOLs test scores along with school attendance and drop-out rates to ensure that unsatisfactory schools are accountable by the threat of state takeover through court action.|$|E
500|$|Several tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to integrate metadata and sequence data, allowing downstream comparative analyses of different datasets using a number of ecological indices. In 2007, Folker Meyer and Robert Edwards and a team at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago released the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server (MG-RAST) a community resource for metagenome data set analysis. As of June 2012 over 14.8 terabases (14x1012 bases) [...] of DNA have been analyzed, with more than 10,000 <b>public</b> <b>data</b> sets freely available for comparison within MG-RAST. Over 8,000 users now have submitted a total of 50,000 metagenomes to MG-RAST. The Integrated Microbial Genomes/Metagenomes (IMG/M) system also provides a collection of tools for functional analysis of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence, based upon reference isolate genomes included from the [...] (IMG) system and the [...] project.|$|E

30|$|Above {{suggests}} {{the applicability of}} YHyM/BTOPMC to Gin river basin in simulating the major hydrological characteristics, utilizing the global <b>public</b> domain <b>data</b> sets as well the local detailed data sets. Although the global <b>public</b> domain <b>data</b> sets are easily available through electronic data archives on the internet, these data sets are hardly used for integrated water resources management in river basins {{since most of the}} water resource managers are not aware of the existence of such data. The emerging trends in geographical information systems and their applications coupled with hydrological modelling should be oriented towards raising awareness and thus maximizing usage of global <b>public</b> domain <b>data.</b> Key limitations of using <b>public</b> domain <b>data</b> could be summarized as coarse spatial and temporal resolution and missing data during cloudy conditions. Accuracy of future data sets can be improved by incorporating more ground-truthing as well as better interpolation techniques during cloudy conditions.|$|R
