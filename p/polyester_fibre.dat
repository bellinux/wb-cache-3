The use of various 4 -aminonaphthalimide derivatives as diazo components and β-naphthol as the coupling component gave a series of bright red dyeings on <b>polyester</b> <b>fibres.</b> The use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluidine as a coupling component together with the same diazo components gave bright bluish-red dyeings on <b>polyester</b> <b>fibres.</b> Using N-propyl- 4 -aminonaphthalimide as an azo component and p-amino acetophenone as a coupling component gave a yellowish-cream dyed <b>polyester</b> <b>fibres.</b> Spectrophotometric studies on <b>polyester</b> <b>fibres,</b> showed that the attained dyeings had good tinctorial strength and high colour build up on <b>polyester</b> <b>fibres.</b> The dyeings also gave perfect wash fast-nesses, very good to excellent sublimation fastnesses and very good light fasstnesses...|$|R
