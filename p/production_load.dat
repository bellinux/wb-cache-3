40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} aggregate production planning (APP) for a multinational lingerie company in Hong Kong.

It {{is not uncommon}} for management to often encounter uncertainty and noisy data, in which the variables or parameters are stochastic.

The empirical results from different regression analysis with data from 2010 and 2011 show that most price determinants increase and decrease intraday prices as expected. Nevertheless, only a minor share of power plant outages and solar power forecast errors are traded on the electronic intraday trading platform, thus influencing prices not as strongly as expected. Furthermore the price determinants influence intraday prices differently {{over the course of}} the day which may be explained by an alternating liquidity provision...|$|E

40|$|Global {{supply chain}} {{management}} presents some special challenges and issues for manufacturing companies in planning production: these challenges {{are different from those}} discussed in domestic <b>production</b> plans. Globally <b>loading</b> <b>production</b> among different plants usually involves substantial uncertainty and great risk because of uncertain market demand, fluctuating quota costs incurred in the global manufacturing process, and shortening lead times. This study proposes a dual-response <b>production</b> <b>loading</b> strategy for two types of plants—company-owned and contracted—to hedge against the short lead time and uncertainty, and to be as responsive and flexible as possible to cope with the uncertainty and risk involved. Three types of robust optimization models are presented: the robust optimization model with solution robustness, the robust optimization model with model robustness, and the robust optimization model with the trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. A series of experiments are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimization models. Compared with the results of the two-stage stochastic recourse programming model, the robust optimization models provide a more responsive and flexible system with less risk, which is particularly important in the current context of global competitiveness...|$|R
30|$|The {{day-ahead}} agreements {{come out}} of the balance because of wind power forecast errors or unavailability of generating units. The power balance can be restored by trading on an intra-day balancing power market. For example, based on updated forecasts, the Danish TSO uses the Nordic operational information system (NOIS) list and generates an hour-ahead plan for the intra-hour balance with 5 min resolution, through simulations with a dedicated power balancing program, called the SimBa [7, 14]. SimBa can model the power system in detail, taking the current grid regulations and the energy market rules into account. It uses the inputs from unit commitment models including hourly values for energy <b>production,</b> <b>load</b> and the power exchange between interconnected areas. These inputs to the SimBa program are provided by a WILMAR model, while Correlated Wind power fluctuations (CorWind) model provides the day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts of wind power, and the available wind power.|$|E

For instance, the teachers who underwent the CSRA training must be given a crop <b>production</b> <b>load</b> so they can integrate the learnings from the training. However, this is something that does not always happen. In past training programs under the Infomediary Campaign, some teachers were not given a crop production teaching load in the succeeding academic year, making it impossible for them to integrate the lessons from the training (Manalo et al. 2015 a). Another case relates to some petty issues, which was noted in one of the three schools in this study. The teacher had difficulty engaging more students to participate, as the school head was not fully supportive.|$|E
