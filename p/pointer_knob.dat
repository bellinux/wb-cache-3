5000|$|The L6-S Custom {{is noted}} for its six way rotary {{selector}} switch, complete with [...] "chicken head" [...] <b>pointer</b> <b>knob.</b> Starting with switch position #1, in the most counter-clockwise position, the available pickup switching options are as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{physical}} {{appearance of the}} Hot Rod series {{is based on the}} mid-to-late '50's [...] "narrow panel" [...] tweed amplifiers with accouterments such as a top mounted, chrome plated chassis and black [...] "chicken head" [...] <b>pointer</b> <b>knobs,</b> but with textured black tolex found on Fender amps from the 1960s onward rather than the tweed covering.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Prosonics were shipped with the standard black tolex covering, some of the initial Custom Shop run were finished in red and seafoam green pebbled tolex, called [...] "lizard-skin" [...] by Fender. Approximately 300 were made in red and 500 were made in seafoam green. The look of the amplifier borrows simultaneously from several eras of vintage Fender design: black [...] "chicken-head" [...] <b>pointer</b> <b>knobs</b> (as used on circa 1950s [...] "tweed" [...] amps), and the silver grill cloth, jewel lamp, and black control plate as used during the 'black face' period (mid-1960s). (Both models came with green jewel lamps).|$|R
50|$|The use of knobs is an {{important}} aspect of the design of user interfaces in these devices. Particular attention needs to be paid to the feedback to the operator from the adjustments being made. The use of a <b>pointer</b> on the <b>knob</b> in conjunction with a scale assists in producing repeatable settings; in other cases there may be a dial or other indicator which is either mechanically linked the knob's rotation (as in many older radio tuners) or which reports the behavior being controlled.|$|R
