A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the President {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet. In 2010, the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine.

40|$|The term {{bioeconomy}} {{has been}} generated {{as a new}} discourse in the environmental policy arena. This paper raises three questions: (i) are environmental concerns integrated in the <b>political</b> <b>discourses</b> of bioeconomy and, if so, to what extent?, (ii) in which way is the environment framed in the <b>political</b> <b>discourses</b> of bioeconomy?, and (iii) are environmental concerns considered in the <b>political</b> <b>discourses</b> on forest-based bioeconomy? The theoretical framework of this paper builds on the cognitive approach of policy integration and on frame analysis. The empirical research design is a comparative qualitative analysis of five different <b>political</b> bioeconomy <b>discourses</b> in the EU and four different EU member states – Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands – in general and in the forestry sector specifically. Results show a weak and mainly rhetorical integration of environmental concerns in <b>political</b> bioeconomy <b>discourses.</b> Three major environmental frames are identified: (i) The dominant frame of 'Environment benefitting from economic growth', (ii) the 'Environment as a challenge' and (iii) the less visible 'Environment as a standard' frame. In general, these frames address the environment mainly as a challenge or {{something that needs to}} be safeguarded with the help of the bioeconomy. With the exception of Finland, amongst the countries studied, forests plays only a minor role in bioeconomy discourses while environmental concerns in this strand of discussion are mainly focused on sustainability arguments in general...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to relate}} the modern Swedish curriculum development to the <b>political</b> <b>discourses</b> liberalization and European integration through a critical discourse analysis of the Swedish curriculum Gy 2011.

The term cultural context includes {{the environment in which}} the text has been created as well as its intertextuality – in this case its relations to earlier curricula. The analysis of Gy 2011 exhumes scientific research done in the field of curriculum studies, which enables future research. The Gy 2011 analysis shows that the <b>political</b> <b>discourses</b> liberalization and European integration stands out within the texts cultural context, and have done so for more than 70 years, a fact that is illustrated by an overview of Swedish curricula history. This research also illuminates how the liberalization discourse accelerated during the 1980 ’s, by both social democrats and the political right, and that the European integration process has gained momentum in recent years...|$|R
