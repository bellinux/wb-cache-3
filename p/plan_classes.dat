It {{was part of the}} Lowry Bill which also created a sister school in Bowling Green, Ohio – now known as Bowling Green State University. It was initially known under the working name of the Ohio State Normal College At Kent, but was named Kent State Normal School in 1911 in honor of William S. Kent (son of Kent, Ohio, namesake Marvin Kent), who donated the [...] used for the original campus. As such, it is the only public university in Ohio named for an individual. The first president was John Edward McGilvrey, who served from 1912 to 1926. McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect George F. Hammond, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master <b>plan.</b> <b>Classes</b> began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent. These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall. The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College due to the addition of four-year degrees. By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction. Kent State's enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms. In 1924, the school's registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States. In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to Kent State College as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.|$|E

40|$|By {{integrating}} a dominance prover {{into the}} plan search process, the traditional constraint-posting planning paradigm can be generalised to permit partially satisfiable goals. In this approach, {{the view of}} planning as theorem proving is retained, although {{the emphasis is on}} proving theorems about dominance relations on classes of candidate plans. <b>Plan</b> <b>classes</b> are generated by posting constraints at various levels of abstraction, then classified within a plan lattice that manages inheritance of properties and dominance characteristics. An analysis of TWEAK demonstrates how to recast existing planning ideas in this framework, providing insight into the planner's capabilities with a dominance-proving interpretation. The plan lattice representation highlights the role of plan subsumption in optimizing search. I...|$|E

To complete the curriculums of education course for nutrition teacher, some students evaluated their volunteer activities by themselves {{and on the other}} hand we tried qualitative research by focus group inter-view. A questionnaire survey was carried out to investigate the opinions of elemenary school teachers and employees of its catering company. Some students planned school lunnch menus and worked at the kitchen of the school lunch service. In the kindergarten and elementary school, they gave food and nutrition education by school lunch service and assisted nutrition teacher in collaborative classes of home economics on the fifth grade. Volunteer activities in the kindergarten, elementary school and kitchen of the school lunch service promoted food and nutrition education and gave students incentives. As for the elementary school teachers and kitchen workers, we hope improvement of educational efficacy and labor incentive. We have to <b>plan</b> <b>classes</b> and guidance at the junior college in advance. By making good use of time and increasing opportunity of volunteer activities in connection with teaching practice, it will be possible for us to make the better curriculum of education course.

40|$|Actions {{aimed at}} the {{generality}} of elementary education {{in the course of}} the period days of the industrialization and cultural revolution in the USSR is under discussion in the proposed paper. On the basis of the archived documents, organization of construction of school buildings in Moscow in the 20 ies and 30 ies of the 20 th century is analyzed. It is noteworthy that industrialization in the periods of the first, second and third five-year plans reshaped the country and Moscow as its capital. Former suburbs turned into large industrial areas that had giant factories and housing built around them to accommodate workers. Thus, the population of Moscow grew in numbers. The need for competent staff facilitated construction of new schools. Peculiarities of school construction in Moscow within the first five-year plan are considered in article on the basis of a school building in Likhobory in 1932. The school building design, work progress, assembly and interior, deadlines and problems of construction are specified. It is noteworthy that, despite any difficulties, 19 new school buildings were completed in Moscow in the years of the first five-year <b>plan.</b> <b>Classes</b> were organized according to the principle of two shifts to implement the general education programme in 1932.

40|$|AUTOMATIC STATISTICAL AREA DEFINITION IN ALGÉS PARISH. Portugal, {{along with}} many other countries, conducts a {{population}} census every 10 years. This way of counting the population offers a detailed photography of the country where many socio-economic variables are captured. In this study, it is assumed that census will be the way of population data collection and therefore the discussion deals with the issue of geographical aggregation of individuals and households enumerated. In this context, a methodological proposal for an automatic census area creation in the parish of Algés is described. The minimum geographic unit for completing the aggregations is the building since it was the smallest and stable unit for this purpose. The building layer was obtained in the municipal GIS of Oeiras and is based on large scale cartography (1 : 1000). Mainly, because the building layer is not contiguous, the study starts with the construction of a Thiessen polygon layer. This layer is drawn with the buildings layer centroids and having the master <b>plan</b> <b>classes</b> as barriers. The Thiessen polygon layer associated with the building attributes assumed a key role in this process and considering the range of possible data aggregation alternatives the zone boundaries are drawn concerning with some principles of consistence and homogeneity. To achieve a measurement of homogeneity for the statistical areas the variables used were the number of households, floors and type of building (residential, commercial, both). The automatic statistical area definition deals with the aggregation of the basic geographic units (Thiessen polygon layer), seeking for new optimized areas, considering the characteristics of the building and having a reference number of households around 100. To demonstrate the methodology used for the automatic statistical area definition, three simulation results are presented in this article...|$|E

40|$|In 1996 {{we set out}} to {{show that}} primary {{teachers}} could teach the new physical science curriculum with no further training if they had the right books. We searched the literature for didactics which had been shown to positively impact learning so that we could incorporate those features into any books we would make. We conducted a pilot project for which we wrote and printed 30 workbooks for one activity. Next, we sent out a book survey to find what books were available for the subject in New Zealand at that time. Simultaneously, we scoured Europe, Asia and North America for good lesson material. We found material which incorporated the didactic criteria from our literature search and adapted some of it for our study, producing about 12, 000 guided workbooks for each of the last four pre-secondary years, 3000 for each age nine to twelve. The books were made available to all New Zealand schools. Two groups of about 12 teachers each formally trialled the books. One group answered questionnaires and the other kept action research journals. Both groups confirmed the principal research premise- teaching hours increased with no further training. Once good books were in hand other problems became apparent. A nationwide resources survey revealed a lack of equipment and other problems such as poor classroom design, awkward grouping of children of different ages and abilities, lack of time, dysfunctional open <b>plan</b> <b>classes</b> of 100 pupils, two-year teaching cycles, competition from free resource packs, and lack of support material such as videos. From this study it can be concluded that the books made a positive impact for teaching physical science. The books gave teachers an international standard of lessons to work from. It was shown by this study that a teacher with no background in physics or chemistry can teach primary physical science at an international standard once good books are in hand as long as poor equipment, space and facilities are not too serious a set of impediments...|$|E
