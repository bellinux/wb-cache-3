40|$|A {{model for}} {{deuteron}} stnpping or <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>reaction</b> is proposed which treats the contn-butions of deuteron break up in a straightforward way. The {{model has been}} applied for (p, d) reaction on 208 Pb and 40 Ca for 22 MeV and 30. 5 ::e V incident proton energy, respectively and (d, p) reactwn on "Fe for 23 MeV incident deuteron energy. VVe find that the adiabatic potential of Johnson et al. and chmce of the energy for relative motion of the neutron and the proton of the 'broken deuteron', {{the same as that}} in its bound state are poor approximations in our theory. The radial integrals w 1 th the wavefunctions of the elastically scattered deuteron and the corresponding ones with the 'broken deuteron ' are opposite in sign for low partial waves leading to a new p 1 cture of reaction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} three {{different}} 2 n transfer reactions on a 12 C target, the 2 p <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>reaction</b> on 16 O and the 5 He transfer in the reaction 9 Be 7 Li,d 14 C. Combined with a systematic search through experimental results for transfer reactions, inelastic excitations and other data, we have established an almost complete spectroscopy for 14 C up to 18 MeV excitation. We identify states with single particle structure that have oblate shapes and states corresponding to proton excitations that {{are connected to}} oblate triangular cluster states. Further we list states of prolate shape which have no simple structure related to the low lying oblate states of 12 C. These are proposed to have strong clustering and to form rotational bands as a parity inversion doublet, with high moment of inertia. With these results {{it is possible for}} the first time to identify chain states expected in the isotope 14...|$|E
40|$|The two proton <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>reaction</b> 12 C 12 C, 14 O 10 Be {{has been}} {{measured}} at 211. 4 MeV incident energy {{to study the}} structure of 10 Be states. This reaction populates most strongly 0 and 2 two proton hole configurations in the 1 p shell, but also odd parity states. A two step mechanism is needed {{in the latter case}} with particle hole excitations of the type 1 p 1 2 s 1 d 1 in inelastic excitation including neutron excitations in the one step, and the pick up of a pair of protons from 12 C in the other step. For all observed states the oscillatory structure of the angular distributions is characteristic of their spins, as can be verified for states with known spins. In this way we can make the firm spin assignments of 4 and 3 for the states at 11. 8 MeV and 10. 55 MeV, respectively. From the reaction mechanism, which offers optimum conditions to populate the 4 configuration in the 1 p shell, and from the J J 1 rule for excitation energies within a rotational band we conclude, that the assigned 4 state is most probably a member of the ground state band of 10 B...|$|E

40|$|The 12 C 12 C, 14 O two proton <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>reaction</b> {{has been}} {{measured}} at 211. 4 MeV incident energy {{to study the}} structure of states of 10 Be up to excitation energies of 12 MeV. The measured partial angular distributions show pronounced oscillatory shapes, which were described by coupled reaction channels calculations. Spin parity assignments could be derived from these characteristic shapes and two definite assignments have been made. The state at 11. 8 MeV {{has been identified as}} the 4 member of the ground state band, and the state at 10. 55 MeV is assigned J pi 3. At 5. 96 MeV only the 1 1 member of the known 2 2 1 1 doublet is populated. The angular distribution of the peak at 9. 50 MeV, which consists of several unresolved states, has been unfolded using contributions from known states at 9. 56 MeV, 2, and 9. 27 MeV, 4. The inclusion of a state at 9. 4 MeV reported by Daito it et al. from the 10 B t, 3 He 10 Be reaction and tentatively assigned 3 improved the fit considerably. A K 2 band is formed with the 2 2 state as the band head and the 3 state as the second member. The structures of the K pi 0 1, 2 2, and 1 1 bands are discusse...|$|E
