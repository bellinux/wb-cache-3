40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a concise but {{comprehensive}} information on the occurrence of carcinogenic or mutagenic agents in Polish enterprises and the number of workers exposed to those agents reported to the central register by employers. Objectives and responsibilities of the register, as well as the range and methods of data gathering are discussed. Material and Methods: Data concerning carcinogenic or mutagenic chemical substances and technological processes reported to central register in 2008 - 2010 were analyzed. Results: In 2008 - 2010 more than 300 carcinogenic or mutagenic chemical substances were reported to the register. Approximately 2500 plants reported above 150 000 per-person-exposures annually. Among all technological processes regarded as occupational carcinogens, hardwood dusts exposure (about 660 companies; 11 000 - 13 000 exposed workers each year) and exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in coal products (117 - 125 plantsl 3000 exposed per year) were reported. Conclusions: The most widespread carcinogenic/mutagenic substances were: benzene, chromium(VI) compounds: <b>potassium</b> dichromate and <b>chromate,</b> chromium(VI) trioxide and other chromium compounds, ethylene oxide, asbestos, benzo[a]pyrene and gasoline. The highest number of men was exposed to particular PAHs and benzene, and the majority of women was exposed to benzene, <b>potassium</b> dichromate and <b>chromate,</b> acrylamide, ethylene oxide and gasoline. The lack of clear-cut definitione of occupational exposure to carcinogen creates a problem faced by employers in defining the accurate number of exposed workers. Med Pr 2013; 64 (2) : 181 – 19...|$|R
40|$|Six {{transition}} metal ion complexes {{have been examined}} for their effects on the cell survival {{as well as their}} effectiveness in inducing the broadening of the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of nitroxide spin probes. These paramagnetic species are Ni(EDTA), Ni(DTPA), <b>potassium</b> tris(oxalato) <b>chromate</b> (chromium oxalate), K 3 Fe(CN) 6, Cu(DTPA), and NiCl 2. At 100 mM concentration, the typical concentration used in cell studies to broaden the extracellular nitroxide ESR signal, only Ni(EDTA) and Ni(DTPA) are found to be non-toxic to Chinese hamster ovary cells. The relative cytotoxicities of the six metal ion complexes are Cu(DTPA) greater than K 3 Fe(CN) 6 greater than NiCl 2 greater than chromium oxalate greater than Ni(DTPA) greater than Ni(EDTA). Thus, potassium ferricyanide and NiCl 2, two most commonly used paramagnetic broadening agents, are relatively toxic to the cell. In contrast, among the six paramagnetic species tested here, chromium oxalate appears to be the most effective agent at non-toxic concentrations in inducing the broadening of the ESR spectra of both cationic and neutral nitroxide spin probes. By considering both their cytotoxicity and their effectiveness in causing line broadening of the nitroxide ESR spectra, chromium oxalate is a good paramagnetic broadening agent for spin probe studies of intact mammalian cells...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{concerning}} {{the sensitivity of}} aged rats to xenobiotics inducing kidney damage. To increase this knowledge, the age-dependent response of the kidney to hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene (HCBD) or <b>potassium</b> dichromate (<b>chromate)</b> has been investigated. Rats have been treated at different ages with a single dose of segment-specific nephrotoxicants of the proximal tubule, chosen {{on the basis of}} their specificity for S 3 and for S 1 -S 2 segments, respectively. The toxicological impact of these xenobiotics has been evaluated through biochemical and genomic markers, and histopathological investigation of kidney samples. HCBD treatment induced tubular necrosis of the S 3 segment of the proximal tubule associated with changes of toxicological markers unrelated to the age. On the contrary, chromate treatment induced an increased kidney damage related to the rat age. In fact, histopathological investigation revealed that at 1 month of age tubular vacuolar degeneration was seen affecting S 1 -S 2 segments of the proximal tubule, whereas at 3 months of age tubular necrosis occurred in the same segments associated with tubular dilation of the distal portions. Consistently, biochemical analysis confirms a direct correlation among genomic and biochemical marker variability and animal age. Altogether, the results show that during aging there is an increased sensitivity of kidney to chromate but not to HCBD-induced damage and evidence differential age-related selectivity of rats for nephrotoxic compounds. Significance for human risk assessment is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} thiol {{compounds}} (L-cysteine ethyl ester, 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid, or 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propanesulfonic acid) on the toxicity induced by <b>chromate</b> (<b>potassium</b> dichromate) were investigated in HeLa cells and mice. Chromate-induced cytotoxicity evaluated by inhibition of cell growth and chromium {{content of the}} cells was diminished {{by all of the}} thiol compounds tested when the cells were incubated in the medium with both chromate and one of the thiol compounds. In mice injected ip with a thiol compound immediately after injection of chromate, mortality, ornithine carbamyl transferase activity in the serum, and chromium content in the liver were diminished remarkably compared with mice injected with chromate alone. These thiol compounds also caused an increase of urinary chromium excretion. These results suggest that the thiol compounds tested are useful for treating chromate-induced toxicity when they are given immediately after intake of the metal. - Environ Health Perspect 102 (Suppl 3) : 247 - 250 (1994) ...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expression}} of regucalcin (Rgn), a calcium-binding protein, {{was investigated in}} kidney of male Wistar rats treated with proximal tubule segment-specific nephrotoxicants, namely hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene (HCBD), specific for S 3 segment (pars recta) and <b>potassium</b> dichromate (<b>chromate)</b> specific for S 1 -S 2 segments (pars convoluta), according to age of animals and dose of chemicals. In the age-dependent study, male Wistar rats were treated with a single injection of HCBD (100 mg/kg b. w. i. p.) or chromate (25 mg/kg b. w. s. c.) at 5 weeks or 12 weeks of age; in dose-response study, rats were treated with a single injection of three doses of HCBD (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b. w. i. p.) or chromate (8, 12. 5, and 25 mg/kg b. w. s. c.) at 8 weeks of age. Forty-eight hours after treatment, Rgn and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in kidney cortex, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine were measured; light microscopy was performed also. The results show that young rats are less susceptible to chromate (severe necrosis is evident only in adult rats), whereas age does not influence HCBD nephrotoxicity. Rgn is down regulated by HCBD at both age points, but not by chromate at 5 weeks of age. In addition, HCBD causes down-regulation of Rgn from the low dose in 8 -week-old rats, whereas chromate causes the same effect at the high dose only. GS activity in kidney cortex shows a similar behaviour, even if sensitive to low doses of chromate also, whereas BUN and creatinine increase after the high dose of both chemicals only. Accordingly, light microscopy shows a segment-specific, dose-dependent increase of severity of damage caused by the chemicals. Rgn gene expression appears a sensitive genomic marker to evaluate the renal impairment caused by chemicals and its down-regulation seems {{to be related to}} damage, early or already established, to S 3 segment of the proximal tubule...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of waste}} (or recycled) wood as a fuel in heat and power {{stations}} is becoming more widespread in Sweden (and Europe), because it is CO 2 neutral with a lower cost than forest fuel. However, it is a heterogeneous fuel with a high amount of chlorine, alkali and heavy metals which causes more corrosion than fossil fuels or forest fuel. A part of the boiler which is subjected to a high corrosion risk is the furnace wall (or waterwall) which is formed of tubes welded together. Waterwalls are made of ferritic low-alloyed steels, due to their low price, low stress corrosion cracking risk, high heat transfer properties and low thermal expansion. However, ferritic low alloy steels corrode quickly when burning waste wood in a low NOx environment (i. e. an environment with low oxygen levels to limit the formation of NOx). Apart from pure oxidation two important forms of corrosion mechanisms are thought to occur in waste environments: chlorine corrosion and alkali corrosion. Although {{there is a great}} interest from plant owners to reduce the costs associated with furnace wall corrosion very little has been reported on wall corrosion in biomass boilers. Also corrosion mechanisms on furnace walls are usually investigated in laboratories, where interpretation of the results is easier. In power plants the interpretation is more complicated. Difficulties in the study of corrosion mechanisms are caused by several factors such as deposit composition, flue gas flow, boiler design, combustion characteristics and flue gas composition. Therefore, the corrosion varies from plant to plant and the laboratory experiments should be complemented with field tests. The present project may thus contribute to fill the power plant corrosion research gap. In this work, different kinds of samples (wall deposits, test panel tubes and corrosion probes) from Vattenfall’s Heat and Power plant in Nyköping were analysed. Coated and uncoated samples with different alloys and different times of exposure were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and light optical microscopy (LOM). The corrosive environment was also simulated by Thermo-Calc software. The results showed that a nickel alloy coating can dramatically reduce the corrosion rate. The corrosion rate of the low alloy steel tubes, steel 16 Mo 3, was linear and the oxide scale non-protective, but the corrosion rate of the nickel-based alloy was probably parabolic and the oxide much more protective. The nickel alloy and stainless steels showed good corrosion protection behavior in the boiler. This indicates that stainless steels could be a good (and less expensive) alternative to nickel-based alloys for protecting furnace walls. The nickel alloy coated tubes (and probe samples) were attacked by a potassium-lead combination leading to the formation of non-protective <b>potassium</b> lead <b>chromate.</b> The low alloy steel tubes corroded by chloride attack. Stainless steels were attacked by a combination of chlorides and potassium-lead. The Thermo-Calc modelling showed chlorine gas exists at extremely low levels (less than 0. 1 ppm) at the tube surface; instead the hydrated form is thermodynamically favoured, i. e. gaseous hydrogen chloride. Consequently chlorine can attack low alloy steels by gaseous hydrogen chloride rather than chlorine gas as previously proposed. This is a smaller molecule than chlorine which could easily diffuse through a defect oxide of the type formed on the steel. QC 20130423 </p...|$|R
