5|$|Institute <b>Professors</b> <b>are</b> {{initially}} {{nominated by}} leaders representing either a department or school. The {{chair of the}} faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council {{and approved by the}} Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Hiring is {{done through}} a civil service examination, {{including}} a written test, a teaching examination, academic history analysis and other additional criteria. The same process {{is required for}} professors changing tiers: an associate professor pursuing a tenure position must {{go through the same}} examination process compete with other external candidates for the position. The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} title that can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute <b>Professors</b> <b>are</b> granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} reasons as well. Some <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> {{reluctant}} to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh.|$|E
25|$|Professors of the {{university}} sign a statement of faith annually. This policy has caused some controversy within academic circles, and was most recently covered in Maclean's. Professors come from varying faith backgrounds. As {{in line with the}} students, a mixture of Christian traditions are represented.

25|$|For {{professors and}} researchers, {{plagiarism}} is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, {{along with the}} loss of credibility and perceived integrity. Charges of plagiarism against students and <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> typically heard by internal disciplinary committees, by which students and professors have agreed to be bound. Plagiarism is a common reason for academic research papers to be retracted.|$|E

25|$|However, 81% of Israeli <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> men. In addition, {{fields such}} as engineering, electricity, physics, mathematics, {{computer}} science, and natural sciences are overwhelmingly male-dominated, though there are {{a large number of}} women in certain fields of engineering, such as biomedical, industrial, and environmental engineering. Women tend to study more in human and social sciences, such as education and occupational therapy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} decade of Ruiz's appointment, the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia (UBCHEA) in New York, an interdenominational group, assumed {{responsibility}} for channeling all church aid to Silliman. The United Board {{is an international}} organization supported by ten Protestant mission boards. Long after Ruiz's appointment, however, Americans and other nationals still constituted a considerable portion of the faculty. Up to the present, American and foreign visiting <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> still regularly assigned in specialized areas.|$|E
25|$|Occupations {{which require}} high {{educational}} attainment are well compensated and {{are held in}} high public esteem. Physicians, lawyers, engineers, scientists and <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> largely considered to be upper middle class. The very well educated are seen as trendsetters; the anti-smoking, pro-fitness, and organic food movements, as well as environmentalism, are largely indigenous to this socio-economic grouping. Education serves as {{perhaps the most important}} value and also the most dominant entry barrier of the upper middle class.|$|E

25|$|A {{generally}} applicable strategic planning approach. This third method {{does not require}} students to analyze hundreds of cases. A strategic planning model is provided and students are instructed to apply {{the steps of the}} model to six – and up to a dozen cases – during a semester. This is sufficient to develop their ability to analyze a complex situation, generate a variety of possible strategies and to select the best ones. In effect, students learn a {{generally applicable}} approach to analyze cases studies and real situations. This approach does not make any extraordinary demands on the artistic and dramatic talents of the teacher. Consequently, most <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> capable of supervising application of this method.|$|E
25|$|At present, Leiden has a firmly {{established}} international position {{among the top}} research institutes in many fields, including the natural sciences, medicine, social and behavioural sciences, law, arts and letters. Of the eighty-five Spinozapremie (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), twenty-one were granted to professors of the Universiteit Leiden. Literary historian Frits van Oostrom was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award {{for his work on}} developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre.
