25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in {{the right amount of}} powder, then <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant {{the difference between life and}} death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} an eRace in Las Vegas was {{proposed}} to the Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag by Luis Pachon, {{the founder of}} the Madrid-based start-up company Cloud Sport, who understood Pachon's intention quickly and began work soon after. iRacing was reportedly an early contender for an association with Formula E, but the costs of laser scanning the track, and the lack of wider benefit of <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effort of constructing the tracks was not cost effective. In June 2016, Agag revealed these plans publicly to Reuters, {{and that it would be}} held as part of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Prior to the announcement, Formula E had (and currently) hold eRaces at all championship rounds in which spectators compete against professional racing drivers in the eVillage of the hosting race track. The event was confirmed during the 2016 London ePrix race meeting in July 2016. It was held as part of Sport Business Innovation Summit that took place in the 2017 CES at The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino on January 7, 2017. Formula E entered into an partnership with ELEAGUE for this event.|$|E

500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it felt almost as though I was sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|E
500|$|Buono chose {{black and}} red for the rink's new color palette. Red was used for its {{intensity}} and energy, and black was utilized because the rink would appear larger. Additionally, usage of black would contrast more boldly with the red colors. The ceiling above the rink was removed for lighting purposes. The rink floor was also refinished with darker colors to provide better light reflection. Rigging for the lights became an artistic challenge for Buono. Working with the art department, the rigging electrics and the rigging grips, he designed a wagon wheel effect that moved with {{the motion of the}} skating and allowed the lights to be programmed, aesthetically lighting both ends of the rink and capturing the action of the skating sequences. The skate rental section, arcade and snack bar were redesigned at the rink as well, so that the areas besides the skating floor wouldn't feel monotonous. “We did every inch of that rink,” said Buono. “The carpet on the walls, painting the ceiling, <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lights, painting the snack bar, changing the color of the tables. We used a lot of neon and bold bright colors.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Forward {{planning}} for the CTrain played an important role. [...] Although the light rail system was not chosen until 1976, the city planners had proactively reserved transit corridors for some form of high capacity transport during the 1960s, and the right-of-ways for the system were reserved when Calgary's population was less than 500,000, whereas today it is well over twice that number. Bus rapid transit lines {{were put in place}} along future routes to increase commuter numbers prior to constructing proposed future LRT lines. Rather than demolishing buildings, the city reached an agreement with CP Rail to build most of the south line in available space inside an existing CPR right-of-way. Large parts of the other lines were built in the medians and along the edges of freeways and other major roads. Automobile driver objections were muted by adding extra lanes to roads for cars {{at the same time as}} <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LRT tracks, which reduced costs for both, and by adding grade-separating intersections which reduced both driver and train delays. [...] The lines and stations were placed to serve large outlying suburbs and the central and other business districts, and to serve existing and predicted travel patterns.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the eight}} players who had refused the {{contracts}} {{offered by the}} board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,"It's a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. We met with these players as we promised we would, we listened to their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run {{until the end of}} the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute.

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where anything can be placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The supposed author most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries, and they have it written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E
