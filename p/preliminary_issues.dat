500|$|The case, {{brought by}} Jackson {{and two other}} members of the Countryside Alliance, {{challenged}} the use of the Parliament Acts to enact the Hunting Act 2004. The appellants claimed that the Parliament Act 1911 could not be used to pass the Parliament Act 1949 which amended the 1911 Act; the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the modified as opposed to the original requirements of the Parliament Acts procedure, was therefore invalid. The Divisional Court and Court of Appeal both rejected this claim, although the Court of Appeal held that Parliament Acts procedure could not be used to effect [...] "fundamental constitutional changes". The case was appealed again to the House of Lords. In relation to <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues,</b> the court held that it had jurisdiction to examine the validity of the Hunting Act as a question of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act could be used to enact the 1949 Act); standing was not challenged. On the substantive issue, the court ruled there were no limits to the type of legislation that could be passed using the Parliament Acts except for the express limitations contained in the legislation. The Parliament Act 1949 had therefore been validly passed using the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act was consequently also held to be an Act of Parliament. In obiter comments made in the judgment, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope and Baroness Hale suggested that there might be limits to parliamentary sovereignty (although Lord Bingham and Lord Carswell impliedly supported the orthodox view that there are no limits to parliamentary sovereignty).|$|E

50|$|Although a defence {{argument}} that protesters {{could have been}} justified in harassing employees of the company to stop a war crime being committed, {{was rejected by the}} high court in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues</b> trial of November 2005 on the grounds that such crimes could not be prevented over a long term, only in immediate actions to stop imminent and specific crimes, the court accepted that a further defense argument should be open. This was that if the protesters could show they were acting reasonably in the circumstances on the basis of an objective evidential test, then there was a defense that any harassment, if it had taken place, could be lawful.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Hodge {{was part}} of the {{controversy}} relating to the greenhouse project at Paraquita Bay. The Auditor General issued a damning report, which indicated that there was no comprehensive budget for the project, which led to requests for supplementary and over-expenditure on approved amounts. The report also noted that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Labour signed a binding contract with a Florida-based company for the greenhouse construction before even <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues</b> had been assessed. The Auditor General grimly noted that not a single crop had been reaped from the greenhouses even though US$6 million had been spent. The report concluded that the project [...] "failed to meet any of the stipulated objectives".|$|E

5000|$|In March 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions {{abandoned}} {{the case and}} Jonathan Rees and his former brothers-in-law were acquitted, because the prosecution were unable to guarantee the defendants' right to a fair trial. Charges against Fillery and another had already been dropped. The case had not reached the stage of considering whether the defendants had murdered Daniel Morgan but was still dealing with <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues.</b> The judge, Mr Justice Maddison, noted the case's vastness and complexity, involving some of the longest legal argument submitted in a trial in the English criminal courts. While he considered that the prosecution had been [...] "principled" [...] and [...] "right" [...] to drop the case, the judge observed {{that the police had}} had [...] "ample grounds to justify the arrest and prosecution of the defendants".|$|E
50|$|The second modus operandus of {{the court}} are the <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues.</b> If a {{question}} comes up in a particular tribunal about the correspondence of laws, decrees and ordinances with the rules laying down the division of powers between the State, the communities and the regions or with Articles 8 to 32, 170, 172 or 191 of the Constitution, that tribunal must address a preliminary question to the Constitutional Court as the Court has the exclusive competence of interpreting the Constitution and the competence dividing rules. When the Court finds a breach of these articles, it will pronounce its decision inter partes, meaning the ruling has effect only between the parties of the specific case. Such a judgement, however, has great moral value and will force the parliament which made the targeted law, decree or ordinance in question to amend it.|$|E
50|$|The {{respondent}} alternatively {{requested that}} the adjudicator exercise their discretion and make a monetary award against the applicant, as he alleged that withdrawing the application constituted an abuse of the Tribunal's process. The adjudicator found that this was merely another way to frame the request for costs and that, regardless, the applicant had {{not in any way}} abused the process. On the basis of the respondent's own evidence, the respondent did delay in accepting Ms. MacDonald's application for a gym membership and in his view would have been justified in refusing it outright. The application therefore raised important and novel questions about the scope of the Code and its application to transgender individuals. Further, {{it was found that the}} respondents may have caused unnecessary legal costs by raising spurious <b>preliminary</b> <b>issues,</b> including Constitutional arguments which they later abandoned and extensive production of the applicant's entire medical history, some of which was completely irrelevant to the issues in the application.|$|E
50|$|The last <b>preliminary</b> <b>issue</b> {{was what}} {{standard}} {{should be used}} to interpret the claims. The PTAB used the “broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI)” standard, which is “generally used in USPTO office actions.” Versata challenged that and argued for a narrower interpretation of the claim language. The court agreed with the USPTO, stating that the Federal Circuit had already decided that issue in the Cuozzo case. The court affirmed the PTAB’s claim construction.|$|R
