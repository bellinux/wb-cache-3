Peirce’s position on intrinsic value shows consistency with the ground assumptions of all well known theories concerning the same issue. After a <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussion</b> concerning a definition {{of the concept of}} intrinsic value, the aim of the paper consists in presenting Peirce’s position as characterized by some peculiar properties differentiating it from the other intrinsic value theories (i. e. that attention is turned towards “conducts” instead of single actions and a pluralistic view of values).

40|$|In the Toyota Production System, {{the seven}} wastes {{presented}} by Ohno have provided understanding on {{the foundations of}} production management and guidance for action {{for more than half}} a century. This list has been widely used also when the Toyota Production System and its derivatives, like lean production, have been adapted and diffused into other industries, such as construction. However, the seven wastes originate from a mass production context and do not cover, for example, the design stage of a productive endeavour, as it is commonly found in construction. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of waste in construction as well as to explore the potential of creating a list of wastes particularly for this type of production. Such a list would be instrumental in creating awareness on the major waste types occurring in construction, as well as mobilizing action towards stemming, reducing and eliminating them. The discussion is structured by analyzing the sufficiency of the classical seven wastes from a construction viewpoint and by exploring alternative wastes in cases where the classical list is not found adequate. It is anticipated that this <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussion</b> will propel the next stage of research towards producing a list of wastes specifically for construction...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A {{treatment}} pathway model {{was developed to}} examine {{the costs and benefits}} of the current bowel cancer service in England and to evaluate potential alternatives in service provision. To use the pathway model, various parameters and probability distributions had to be specified. They could not all be determined from empirical evidence and, instead, expert opinion was elicited in the form of statistical quantities that gave the required information. The purpose of this study is to describe the procedures used to quantify expert opinion and note examples of good practice contained in the case study. Methods: The required information was identified and <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussion</b> with four experts refined the questions they would be asked. In individual elicitation sessions they quantified their opinions, mainly in the form of point and interval estimates for specified variables. New methods have been developed for quantifying expert opinion and these were implemented in specialized software that uses interactive graphics. This software was used to elicit opinion about quantities related to measurable covariates. Results: Assessments for thirty-four quantities were elicited and available checks supported their validity. Eight points of good practice in eliciting and using expert judgment were evident. Parameters and probability distributions needed for the pathway model were determined from the elicited assessments. Simulation results from the pathway model were used to inform policy on bowel cancer service provision. Conclusions: The study illustrates that quantifying and using expert judgment can be acceptable in real problems of practical importance. For full benefit to be gained from expert knowledge, elicitation must be conducted carefully and should be reported in detail...|$|E

The {{intersection}} of all unit balls B(v, 1) centered at v, where v ranges over V, henceforth denoted by B(V) is the ball polytope associated with V. Note that B(V) is non-empty iff the circumradius of V is <= 1. After some <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussion</b> on spherical convexity and spindle convexity, the paper focuses on two central themes. [a] Define the boundary complex of B(V) (assuming it is non-empty, of course), i. e., define its vertices, edges and facets in dimension 3 (in dimension 2 this complex is just a circuit), and investigate its basic properties. [b] Apply results of this investigation to characterize finite sets of diameter 1 in (Euclidean) 3 -space for which the diameter is attained a maximal number of times as a segment (of length 1) with both endpoints in V. A basic result for such a characterization goes back to Grunbaum, Heppes and Straszewicz, who proved independently that the diameter of V is attained at most 2 |V|- 2 times, thus affirming a conjecture of Vazsonyi from circa 1935. Call V extremal if its diameter is attained this maximal number (2 |V|- 2) of times. We extend the aforementioned basic result by showing that V is extremal iff V coincides with the set of vertices of its ball polytope B(V) and show {{that in this case}} the boundary complex of B(V) is self-dual in some strong sense.

40|$|This is a {{snapshot}} of the GMOD Tools for Evolutionary Biology Hackathon wiki taken in June 2015. The wiki was originally live at [URL] GMOD held a hackathon November 8 - 12, 2010, at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in Durham, North Carolina. This hackathon focused on improving GMOD's support for evolutionary biology. The Open Call for Participation went out on August 1, 2010, and remained open until August 25. Participants were selected based on their applications. Post-Hackathon Updates: Robert Buels gave a poster on the hackathon at the Plant & Animal Genome XVIII conference (PAG) in January 2011. Synopsis This hackathon aimed to fill critical gaps in the capabilities of the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) toolbox that currently limit its utility for evolutionary research. Specifically, we focused on tools for 1) viewing comparative genomics data; 2) visualizing phylogenomic data; and 3) supporting population diversity data and phenotype annotation. The event brought together a group of about 30 software developers, end-user representatives, and documentation experts who would otherwise not meet. The participants included key developers of GMOD components that currently lack features critical for emerging evolutionary biology research, developers of informatics tools in evolutionary research that lack GMOD integration, and informatics-savvy biologists who can represent end-user requirements. This hackathon provided a unique opportunity to infuse the community of GMOD developers with a heightened awareness of unmet needs in evolutionary biology that GMOD components have the potential to fill, and for tool developers in evolutionary biology to better understand how best to extend or integrate with already existing GMOD components. Background The GMOD project is a confederation of intercompatible open-source projects developing software tools for storing, managing, curating, and publishing biological data. Although the GMOD project originated from the goal of developing a generic tool set for common needs among model organism databases, GMOD tools are meanwhile used by many large and small, collaborative and single-investigator biological database projects for the dissemination of experimental results and curated knowledge. GMOD's software tools provide a powerful and feature-rich basis for working with biological, in particular genomic and other molecular data. However, due to GMOD's historical emphasis on single-genome projects many GMOD tools still lack features that are critical to effectively support the comparative, phylogenetic, and natural diversity-oriented questions frequently asked in evolutionary research. Recent developments have given rise to a window of opportunity for forging collaborations towards filling this gap. In particular, the cost of collecting comparative molecular data on a large or even genomic scale has recently dropped dramatically, primarily thanks to next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies. This has enabled evolutionary researchers to bring genome-scale molecular data to bear on key evolutionary questions. It has also allowed single organism-focused molecular biology labs, who represent GMOD's traditional user base, to broaden out to multi-organism comparative approaches. Bringing these two communities with increasingly shared interests and complementary scientific and technical expertise together offers an opportunity to start filling GMOD's gaps in these areas while building on its existing strengths. In addition, such direct interaction will heighten future awareness of needs of evolutionary researchers among GMOD developers who have so far mostly supported its traditional user base, and can in the long term increase the ranks of GMOD contributors from a field it was not originally designed to serve. The hackathon format is ideally suited to realize this opportunity. Its strengths lie in facilitating face-to-face interaction among people with complementary expertise, and collaborative work on tangible products that can form the basis of continued partnerships long beyond the end of the meeting. Specific Objectives Organizers have identified the following broad themes for focusing work at the event. Before and at the hackathon, the participants will refine and distill these and other options into concrete implementation targets. 	Viewing tools for comparative genomics data 	Visualization of phylogenetic data and trees 	Population Diversity and Phenotype support Hackathon Structure Before the Event Discussion of ideas and sometimes even design actually starts well before the hackathon, on mailing lists, wiki pages, and conference calls set up among accepted attendees. This advance work lays the foundation for participants to be productive from the very first day. This also means that participants should be willing to contribute some time in advance of the hackathon itself to participate in this <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussion.</b> During the Event Typically, hackathon participants use the morning of {{the first day of the}} event to organize themselves into working groups of between 3 and 6 people, each with a focused implementation objective. Ideas and objectives are discussed, and attendees coalesce around the projects in which they have the most experience or interest. Deliverables / Event Results The meeting’s attendance, working groups, and outcomes will be fully logged and documented on this wiki. Relevant content will be copied to the GMOD wiki after the event. Each working group during the event will typically have its own wiki page, where it documents its minutes and design notes, and provides links to the code and documentation it produces. Also, since GMOD and NESCent are both committed to open source principles, all code and documentation produced by participants during the hackathon must be published under an OSI-approved open source license. As contributions to existing GMOD tools, all hackathon products will most likely satisfy this requirement automatically. Sponsorship This event is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) through its Informatics Whitepapers program. NESCent promotes the synthesis of information, concepts and knowledge to address significant, emerging, or novel questions in evolutionary science and its applications. NESCent achieves this by supporting research and education across disciplinary, institutional, geographic, and demographic boundaries...|$|E

Evidence examined include the stability of the Cyprus pound vis-a-vis the euro within a credible exchange rate policy framework, robust growth, low levels of unemployment, high Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) coverage of the current account deficit as well as low and stable inflation.

40|$|From the introduction]. This chapter {{does not}} pretend {{to offer a}} single {{definitive}} account {{of the field of}} EU politics, but it does investigate the various formal and informal accounts that exist in terms of the above observations. It begins with two short <b>preparatory</b> <b>discussions.</b> The first identifies six issues that intercept any attempt to write disciplinary history in this area, while the second supplies a rough ‘anatomy’ of the field of EU studies/EU politics in an effort to adjudicate some fundamental issues surrounding the substance of this area of study. In so doing, it perhaps justifies this chapter’s focus on what appears to be an Anglophone academic mainstream. It then moves to describing and offering critical engagement with standard accounts of the field with a view to showing how, overwhelmingly, extant stories about the evolution of EU studies are bound up with particular claims about the organisation of knowledge in the present. Indeed the argument here suggests that disciplinary history is used to adjudicate disputes about the proper scope and substance of the study of EU politics, which in turn connect to some quite fundamental struggles for the soul of political science. Thus the chapter is also attentive to sociology of knowledge questions. These remind us that our knowledge about the world is produced amidst broad scientific and more specific disciplinary structures, norms, practices and institutions – what Jørgensen (2000) neatly calls the ‘cultural-institutional context’ of academic work. It follows that the evolution of a field is (at the very least) partly a function of developments within the field. These in turn might reflect much broader path dependent pathologies, which take us back to the intellectual and socio-political conditions of disciplinary foundation (Mancias, 1987). This ‘internalist’ take on disciplinary history might not necessarily provide a full explanation of why scholars of EU politics address particular puzzles at particular moment, but it does offer a framework for understanding why particular theories and approaches dominate at particular times (Schmidt, 1998; Wæver, 2003). At the same time, many would prefer to argue for an ‘externalist’ understanding of disciplinary evolution, where the main academic innovations are largely construed as responses to the changing anatomy of the field’s primary object of study (the EU/the politics of European integration) ...|$|R

At the end of 2004, the consortium made its first preparations for technical feasibility studies.

No single organization had the knowledge of both surface and underground installations. So, this required the expertise of specialized technical consultants, {{as well as the}} involvement of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO. Studies showed that the targeted geological layer did not contain sufficient water of 90  °C, and the consortium chose an alternative approach: using the heat of a deeper layer (at approximately 60  °C) for heating newly built houses. This choice raised the estimated project costs from 6 to 10 million Euros to 45 – 50 million Euros, but the project still seemed promising.

The remaining part of the freight shed will not receive a new operating track, so it will lose its technical and historical function.

Both structured group discussions and a self completion questionnaire were used in this investigation. As well as drawing on previous research on attitudes, a participative approach was taken to the development of the questions to be used, to reduce ethnocentricity in the design. Participants in the study were professionals working in the health sector in Georgia, Tajikistan, Uganda and UK, and professionals in other countries assisted in the study design and group <b>discussions.</b> <b>Preparatory</b> work for rolling out the research has also been carried out in other countries. As well as highlighting cross country differences, the results identified some significant issues in relation to the attitudes of health sector professionals towards information systems developments, common to all countries. The investigation has also led to the development of approaches, suitable for use in a cross cultural setting, that facilitate the identification of the attitudes of users towards information systems. These approaches can help to address the real-world problems faced when implementing health information systems by assisting in understanding the views of stakeholders to the systems, and how these views vary between different groups of staff or different countries.

40|$|The United States {{prides itself}} as a country that respects free speech, the right of all persons to criticize the {{government}} even in times of war. However, {{it was not always}} so. The events related to World War I brought the first cases raising free speech issues to the U. S. Supreme Court. While several justices, in particular, Oliver Wendell Holmes, praised free speech, the Court upheld all the Government prosecutions of dissidents. It has taken nearly a century since those cases for the Supreme Court to come full circle and now protect those who criticize the Government in time of war. When the Court changed its views to create the modern protections, it relied on philosophical justifications for free speech that go {{all the way back to}} the ancient Greeks, 2, 400 years ago. The modern justification for free speech relies on these philosophers from ancient Greece. There is little new under the sun. While governments typically believe that, for the public good, they must censor speech and squelch dissenters in time of war, the Greeks believed that their free speech made them stronger, not weaker. There are those who argue it is more difficult for a democracy to go to war because it cannot conduct the war successfully if the people oppose it and dissenters remain free to criticize. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. In modern times, no democracy has warred against another.

40|$|Information {{should be}} dissiminated with the {{end-user}} In mind. Ease {{of access to}} scientific and technical information (STI), {{is one of the}} main concerns of those working in development today. In order to bridge the gap between research and fieldwork all possible means of communication must be utilised, including the existing media and any additional media which need to be created, so that information reaches the recipients who need it in a form that is directly usable and useful. It is in this spirit that CTA organized a week-long seminar at Montpellier, France, in December 1984. The aim was to establish some new information networks which would be easily accessible to ACP countries. 'Spore' is one of the results of this seminar and other concrete activities emanating from the meeting are currently being carried out by CTA. Details of these will be published in forthcoming issues of 'Spore'. The Montpellier seminar stressed the big North-South divide as regards STI, and pointed out the difficulty in obtaining information in ACP countries, both in terms of the state of knowledge and in terms of recent research and experience gained through development projects on the ground. Publication of such information should therefore be encouraged, as should the ACP countries' participation in international data systems on agriculture such as AGRIS and CARIS. Assistance should be provided to enable ACP countries to obtain literature relevant to their interests, be it current or retrospective. It would be desirable for contracts signed by governments and research institutions to stipulate explicitly that copies of final reports and studies should be sent to national libraries and made available to national documentation centres. There is a considerable amount of data and expertise which does not exist in a readily communicable form, which is classified as restricted or even confidental. So much for the supply side. Rural radio provides an excellent means of contact. As for demand, requests for information should be expressed clearly and precisely, which means a reasonable understanding of the problem is required. There is also a need to inform those who do not already know what data is available, so that new requests can be made. Various different means of transmitting information should be used. A symposium is an ideal opportunity for professional people to update their knowledge. Data can also be communicated via the written word, but written texts should be edited and disseminated with the end-user in mind. Decision-makers are usually able to understand these issues, but they lack the time to read. Information aimed at them must be concise. Rural radio Agricultural producers need practical information in a language, possibly a local language, that they can understand. In countries with a low literacy rate, priority should be given in natural transmission. It is for this reason that rural radio is a key medium. It reaches a very wide audience and can play a unique role in forming public opinion on day-to-day issues (such as sanitation, nutrition and energy savings), as well as in disseminating news and practical information. Radio should be complemented by the publication of periodicals on agriculture targeted at development workers and literate peasant farmers. The press also has a role to play. It can forge a link between the reader and his newspaper, as papers come out on a regular basis and can thus be used as a permanent source of reference. The language barrier {{is one of the main}} constraints in information exchange. Translation of textbooks manuals and reference books in particular can alleviate the problem, provided the text is also adapted. As for secondary documents, such as abstracts, automatic translation by computer is already available for several major languages. The token system STI is expensive. Science books have limited print-runs, postage costs are high, and a considerable amount of surface mail goes astray. Photocopying can cost two to five times as much in ACP countries as in Europe. In addition, information has to be paid for in hard currency. There are solutions to this problem. One could duplicate the UNESCO 'tokens' arrangement, whereby someone in an ACP country wishing to order books buys a token from his government. These tokens form part of the UNDP local currency counterpart expenses. Then the bookseller exchanges the token for currency at a UNESCO office. Another solution is to use microfiches. The size and weight of each microfiche is the same as that of a postcard, and each can contain 90 pages of text. A microfiche costs about $ US 10 to produce, but each subsequent copy costs only two per cent of this. Postage costs are obviously lower than for books. However, the recipient a documentation centre, for example must be equipped with a reader and possibly even a microfiche copier. Lastly, the seminar felt that an important way to reduce costs is to improve the management of documentation centres as well as their coordination at national level. This raises such issues as the need to identify the most effective means of training documentalists and the most satisfactory way of providing library equipment and books, periodicals and works of reference. The proceedings of this seminar, including the <b>preparatory</b> papers, <b>discussions</b> and recommendations, have been published in two volumes. A synopsis has been published in English and French. These documents are available on request from CTA. Information should be dissiminated with the end-user In mind.
