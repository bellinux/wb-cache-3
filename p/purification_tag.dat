This tag could be histidine (His) tag, other marker peptides, or a fusion partners such as glutathione S-transferase or maltose-binding protein.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{removal of}} a N- or C-terminal <b>purification</b> <b>tag</b> from a fusion protein is necessary to obtain a protein in a pure and active form, ready for use in human or animal medicine. Current techniques based on enzymatic cleavage are expensive and result {{in the presence of}} additional amino acids {{at either end of the}} proteins, as well as contaminating proteases in the preparation. Here we evaluate an alternative method to the one-step affinity/protease purification process for large-scale purification. It is based upon the cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage at a single methionine placed in between a histidine tag and a Plasmodium falciparum antigen. The C-terminal segment of the circumsporozoite polypeptide was expressed as a fusion protein with a histidine tag in Escherichia coli purified by Ni-NAT agarose column chromatography and subsequently cleaved by CNBr to obtain a polypeptide without any extraneous amino acids derived from the cleavage site or from the affinity <b>purification</b> <b>tag.</b> Thus, a recombinant protein is produced without the need for further purification, demonstrating that CNBr cleavage is a precise, efficient, and low-cost alternative to enzymatic digestion, and can be applied to large-scale preparations of recombinant proteins...|$|E

In particular, development of efficient methods of heterologous production of membrane proteins is essential. Here, {{we describe the}} heterologous overproduction of 24 membrane proteins from the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila in Escherichia coli. Protein production was performed in 0. 5 ml cultures in standard 24 -well plates, allowing increased throughput with minimal effort. The effect of {{the location of a}} histidine <b>purification</b> <b>tag</b> was analyzed, and the effect of decreasing the length of the N- and C-terminal extensions introduced by the Gateway cloning strategy is presented. We observed that the location and length of the <b>purification</b> <b>tag</b> significantly affected protein production levels. In addition, an auto-induction protocol for membrane protein expression was designed to enhance the overproduction efficiency such that, regardless of the construct used, much higher expression was achieved when compared with standard induction approaches such as isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). All 24 targets were produced at levels exceeding 2 mg/l, with 18 targets producing at levels of 5 mg/l or higher. In summary, we have designed a fast and efficient process for the production of medically relevant membrane proteins with a minimum number of screening parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} genomic era {{has resulted}} in a great demand for efficient production and purification of proteins. The main objective of the work described in this thesis was to develop methods to facilitate recovery of target proteins after recombinant production in Escherichia coli. A positively charged <b>purification</b> <b>tag,</b> Zbasic, has previously been constructed by protein design of a compact three-helix bundle domain, Z. The charged domain was investigated for general use as a fusion partner. All target proteins investigated could be selectively captured by ion-exchange chromatography under conditions excluding adsorption of the majority of Escherichia coli host proteins. A single cation-exchange chromatography step at physiological pH was sufficient to provide Zbasic fusion proteins of high purity close to homogeneity. Moreover, efficient isolation directly from unclarified Escherichia coli homogenates could also be accomplished using an expanded bed mode. Since the intended use of a recombinant protein sometimes requires removal of the <b>purification</b> <b>tag,</b> a strategy for efficient release of the Zbasic moiety using an immobilised protease was developed. The protease columns were reusable without any measurable decrease in activity. Moreover, subsequent removal of the released tag, Zbasic, was effected by adsorption to a second cation-exchanger. Using a similar strategy, a <b>purification</b> <b>tag</b> with a negatively charged surface, denoted Zacid, was constructed and thoroughly characterised. Contrary to Zbasic, the negatively charged Zacid was highly unstructured in a low conductivity environment. Despite this, all Zacid fusion proteins investigated could be efficiently purified from whole cell lysates using anion-exchange chromatography Synthesis of polypeptides occurs readily in Escherichia coli providing large amounts of protein in cells of this type, albeit often one finds the recombinant proteins sequestered in inclusion bodies. Therefore, a high throughput method for screening of protein expression was developed. Levels of both soluble and precipitated protein could simultaneously be assessed in vivo by the use of a flow cytometer. The positively charged domain, Zbasic, was shown also to be selective under denaturing conditions, providing the possibility to purify proteins solubilised from inclusion bodies. Finally, a flexible process for solid-phase refolding was developed, using Zbasic as a reversible linker to the cation-exchanger resin. QC 2010102...|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death worldwide. It is of great {{importance}} to use reliable diagnostic methods before determining treatment methods. Molecular imaging is a non-invasive approach of visualising tumours in vivo. This method requires imaging agents that are detectable and binds specifically to the tumour. The aim of this degree project was to produce and characterise a protein-based imaging agent, called ADAPT, that has been engineered to bind the breast cancer associated receptor HER 2. This protein has previously been labelled with radionuclides in the N-terminal and tested in vivo with promising results. However, due to the fact that the position of the radiolabel can affect the biodistribution of the imaging agent, a comparison to C-terminal radiolabelled variants is of high interest. Radiolabelling can be performed by first attaching a chelator to the protein and later bind the radionuclide through the chelator. The chelator used in this project binds to a thiol group and therefore a unique cysteine was added to the C-termini. The N-termini were altered to both generate variants with and without <b>purification</b> <b>tag.</b> Proteins with altered N-termini and C-termini were produced and later characterised by circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance. None of the non-tagged variants could be produced to a sufficient amount and was discarded for further studies.

All cases of Melnick-Needles syndrome can {{be accounted for by}} mutations in repeat 10. Using a yeast- 2 hybrid assay Professor S.

CFM 2 was found to interact with itself in a yeast- 2 -hybrid screen, suggesting homo-dimerisation properties in addition to Filamin A repeats 10 and 21 binding affinity. If CFM 2 dimerises and binds to repeat 10 and 21 it is possible that Filamin A’s function will alter, thus altering the properties of the cytoskeleton. To investigate the interaction between Filamin A repeat 10 and CFM 2, each was subcloned into an E. coli plasmid vector fused to a <b>purification</b> <b>tag.</b> Purification of CFM 2 failed due to misfolding, this upholds later work that claims CFM 2 cannot fold correctly without the presence of vertebrate Filamin.

Conclusions By using fed batch E. coli fermentation at high cell density, ELP-intein-tagged proteins can be expressed and purified at high yield with low cost. Further, the impact of media components and fermentation design can significantly impact the overall process cost, particularly at large scale.
