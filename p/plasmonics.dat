40|$|Graphene is a {{monolayer}} {{of carbon}} atoms constructing a two-dimensional honeycomb structure, {{and it has}} an excellent carrier mobility and a very high thermal conductivity. Remarkably, it has been experimentally demonstrated that a monolayer graphene exhibits an exotic optical properties. To be specific, the <b>plasmonic</b> dispersion relation of a transverse magnetic graphene plasmon is electronically tunable by adjusting carrier density in graphene with external gate bias, and graphene <b>plasmonic</b> nano cavities have been utilized to modulate mid-infrared light. In this thesis, we present how to efficiently modulate mid-infrared light by combining graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons with noble metal <b>plasmonic</b> structures. First, we propose and demonstrate electronically tunable resonant perfect absorption in graphene <b>plasmonic</b> metasurface enhanced by noble metal <b>plasmonic</b> effect, which results in modulating reflecting light. In this device, we improve coupling efficiency of free-space photons into graphene plasmons by reducing wavevector mismatching with a low permittivity substrate. In addition, the graphene <b>plasmonic</b> resonance is significantly enhanced by <b>plasmonic</b> light focusing effect of the coupled subwavelength metallic slit structure, which results in strongly fortifying resonance absorption in the graphene <b>plasmonic</b> metasurface. In the proposed device, theoretical calculation expects that perfect absorption in the graphene <b>plasmonic</b> metasurface is achievable with low graphene carrier mobility. We also present an analytical model based on surface admittance in order to fully understand how this enhancement occurs. In the second device, we propose and demonstrate a transmission type light modulator by combining graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons with subwavelength metal slit arrays. In this device, extraordinary optical transmission resonance is coupled to graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons to create electrostatic modulation of mid-infrared light. Absorption in graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons situated inside metallic slits can efficiently block the coupling channel for resonant transmission, leading to a suppression of transmission. This phenomenon is also interpreted by anti-crossing between the graphene <b>plasmonic</b> resonance in the ribbons and the noble metal <b>plasmonic</b> resonance in the subwavelength metal slit arrays. Finally, we devise a platform to demonstrate graphene <b>plasmonic</b> resonance energy transport along graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons. In this device, two metal-insulator-metal waveguides are connected by a subwavelength metal slit, and graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons are located inside this slit. Due to the large impedance mismatch at the junction, light coupling efficiency across the junction is poor. If the graphene <b>plasmonic</b> ribbons are tuned to support strong graphene <b>plasmonic</b> resonances, the light energy can be transferred via graphene plasmons along the ribbons, and it leads to significant improvement in the light coupling efficiency across the junction. In addition to enhanced light coupling efficiency, we also present how to totally suppress the transmission by inducing a Fano resonance between a non-resonant propagation mode across the junction and a resonant graphene <b>plasmonic</b> transport mode, which can be utilized to efficiently modulate light in a noble metal <b>plasmonic</b> waveguide with the graphene plasmon resonance energy transfer. </p...|$|R
