5|$|In {{countries}} where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw materials {{can be purchased}} from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques. The resulting product can be marketed at extremely high markup, so end-user <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> {{be as high as}} 300 times the bulk cost of raw ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

30|$|Dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>can</b> reduce {{electricity}} demand {{by increasing the}} electricity rate when the {{electricity demand}} is strong. Electricity rates decrease when electricity demand weakens. The concept of dynamic pricing is based on economic incentives. Many previous studies (for example, Joskow 1975; Chao and Pecks 1996) analyze {{how to make the}} effective dynamic pricing rule maximize total welfare. Based on a theoretical analysis, several researchers have implemented field experiments to evaluate the performance of dynamic pricing rules. The empirical results of such field experiments show that dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>can</b> contribute to decreasing peak-time electricity demand (Matsukawa et al. 2000; Faruqui and George 2005; Herter 2007). In addition, Allcott (2011) indicates that dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>can</b> contribute to increasing the consumer surplus.|$|R
25|$|The Bolshoi Theatre is world-famous and attracts {{large numbers}} of tourists. As a result, <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> be much higher than in other Russian theatres. This is {{especially}} the case for ballet, where prices are comparable to those for performances in the West. For local citizens, concerts and operas are still relatively affordable, with prices ranging from 100 rubles (for students, for balcony seats for matinée performances) to 15,000 rubles (for seats in the orchestra or stalls).|$|E
25|$|Bond <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> become {{volatile}} {{depending on}} the credit rating of the issuer – for instance if the credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk {{does not affect the}} bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.|$|E
25|$|Formally, {{the joint}} {{hypothesis}} problem {{says that it}} is never possible to test (sufficiently, to prove or disprove) market efficiency. A test of market efficiency must include some model for how prices may be set efficiently. Then actual <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> be examined to see whether this holds true. Usually this fails and then this supports the case that markets are not efficient. The joint hypothesis problem says that, when this happens, it shows that the model is not complete. There are some factors that are not accounted for.|$|E

25|$|Discounting {{began in}} the 1970s and was {{dramatically}} expanded in the 1990s, according to one report. Discrepancy between sticker and average net <b>prices</b> <b>can</b> vary substantially. Estimates vary, but show a consistent pattern of sticker prices being much greater than real costs, sometimes more than double, sometimes only {{one and a half}} times as high. Estimates are that 88% or 67% get some form of discount. One estimate in 2015 was that at private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average first-year student pays 48% less than the sticker price. Generally, the sticker-to-net price discrepancy is greater at private colleges than public universities. For example, in 2011–2012, the average sticker price for tuition, fees and living expenses at private colleges, was $38,590 while the average actual cost was $23,060; at public colleges, the average sticker price was $17,130 and the average actual cost was $11,380. Another estimate was that the average full-time undergraduate gets $6,500 in grant aid along with $1,000 in tax-based aid to offset tuition and fees. There is widespread consensus that the most cost-effective college option is community colleges, which charge on average only $3,000 for full-time tuition.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{separate}} issues {{which are often}} confused and mixed up with each other. High <b>price</b> <b>can</b> {{be due to a}} bubble but that need not be the only reason. High <b>price</b> <b>can</b> also be due to 'Permit Raj'. A brief explanation is as follows. Often the real estate sector is subject to considerable controls and regulations that are over and above those that are warranted to take care of congestion, orderly development, and minimising negative externalities. Such controls lead to a restricted supply and so the <b>price</b> <b>can</b> be high. Such a high <b>price</b> <b>can</b> be stable and persistent over a long period; this is typically not the case when there is a high price due to a bubble. It is widely believed that the Permit Raj has been abolished with the economic reforms in early 1990s in India. However, this is only partially true. The Permit Raj was abolished (or reduced) in the manufacturing sector but not in all sectors. One important sector where it was not abolished is the real estate sector in India. So, the supply is restricted and the price is high. For more, see Singh, Gurbachan, 2016, Land Price, Bubbles, and Permit Raj, Review of Market Integration, volume 2, issue1 and 2, p. 1-33.|$|R
