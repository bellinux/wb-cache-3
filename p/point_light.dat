5|$|The land {{upon which}} Avery <b>Point</b> <b>Light</b> was {{constructed}} {{was owned by}} Morton F. Plant's estate; his Branford Manor is located several hundred feet away. Twenty four years after Plant's death the estate was sold {{to the state of}} Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard's new training facility. The Avery <b>Point</b> <b>Light</b> was named for Captain James Avery of New London, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Avery <b>Point</b> <b>Light</b> or Avery Point Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} in Groton, Connecticut, United States, on the Avery Point Campus of the University of Connecticut. Although construction {{was completed in}} March 1943, the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion. Its original light consisted of eight 200-watt bulbs that were later replaced by a flashing green light in 1960. It was deactivated on June 25, 1967, when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to Governors Island. It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state; the only other claimant is the replica Mystic Seaport Light.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field <b>Point</b> <b>Light</b> and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
5|$|The Avery <b>Point</b> <b>Light</b> was {{designed}} by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12m) octagonal tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, {{it was discovered that}} six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery deck is constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the watchroom level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut has {{fourteen}} active lighthouses in the state, {{two of which}} are maintained as private aids; six are standing but inactive. Another was destroyed after its deactivation. The earliest lighthouse in the state was erected in 1760, but that tower, the first New London Harbor Light, was replaced in 1801, and its successor is the oldest surviving light in Connecticut, as well as the tallest. The last officially recognized lighthouse in the state, the Avery <b>Point</b> <b>Light,</b> was constructed in 1943, but was not lit until the following year. The Mystic Seaport Light, constructed in 1966, is a functioning replica housed with a historic Fresnel lens; it is classified as an unofficial and non-navigational aid.|$|E
5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic <b>point</b> <b>light</b> source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

40|$|We present pixelcuts, a {{scalable}} algorithm {{to compute}} approximate low-frequency illumination from many <b>point</b> <b>lights.</b> Its running time is Õ(n + mk) where n {{is the number}} of pixels, m {{is the number of}} <b>point</b> <b>lights,</b> and k is a constant the user specifies. Our algorithm was inspired by the lightcuts approach, which runs in Õ(nk + m) [15]. Lightcuts builds a tree of <b>point</b> <b>lights</b> and, for each pixel, gathers contribution from O(k) light groups. On the contrary, pixelcuts builds several trees of pixels, and, for each light, scatters its contribution to O(k) pixel groups. We demonstrate that pixelcuts outperforms lightcuts when there are many more pixels than lights. Nevertheless, pixelcuts is limited to low-frequency illumination. It is also prone to structured noise if too few trees are used or if the pixels are divided into too few clusters...|$|R

40|$|Lightcuts is a {{scalable}} {{framework for}} computing realistic illumination. It handles arbitrary geometry, non-diffuse materials, and illumination {{from a wide}} variety of sources including <b>point</b> <b>lights,</b> area lights, HDR environment maps, sun/sky models, and indirect illumination. At its core is a new algorithm for accurately approximating illumination from many <b>point</b> <b>lights</b> with a strongly sublinear cost. We show how a group of lights can be cheaply approximated while bounding the maximum approximation error. A binary light tree and perceptual metric are then used to adaptively partition the lights into groups to control the error vs. cost tradeoff. We also introduce reconstruction cuts that exploit spatial coherence to accelerate the generation of anti-aliased images with complex illumination. Results are demonstrated for five complex scenes and show that lightcuts can accurately approximate hundreds of thousands of <b>point</b> <b>lights</b> using only a few hundred shadow rays. Reconstruction cuts can reduce the number of shadow rays to tens...|$|R
