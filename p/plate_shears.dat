50|$|Since the {{earliest}} {{surveys of the}} area, theories about {{the movement of the}} JF Microplate have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF Microplate driving this clockwise rotational movement. The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez MicroPlate. This spreading ridge supplies magma {{to the west of the}} plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the microplate, the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled shear section to the south of the microplate and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the microplate. Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF Microplate began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the microplate. Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca <b>Plate</b> <b>shears</b> to the east while the Antarctica <b>Plate</b> <b>shears</b> relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the microplate clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center.|$|E

40|$|A steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> wall (SPW) is a lateral-loadresisting system {{consisting}} of vertical steel plate infills {{connected to the}} surrounding beams and columns and installed {{in one or more}} bays along the full height of the structure to form a cantilevered wall. SPSW subjected to cyclic inelastic deformations exhibit high initial stiffness, behave in a very ductile manner, and dissipate significant amounts of energy. These characteristics make them suitable to resist seismic loading. The emergence of steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> walls, both as a topic of research and in actual construction, began in the early 1970 's. Most of the structures constmcted during this period that employed steel shear walls were built in Japan and the United States, and they were generally a substitute for conventional reinforced concrete shear walls. As a result, the earliest research came from Japan and the United States, the Japanese being the first to study the overall behaviour of steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> walls [Takahashi et al., 19731. Prior to key research performed in the 1980 s, the design approach used by the Japanese and Americans concentrated on preventing the steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> panels from buckling prior to the attainment of shear yield. In Japan, this was achieved by reinforcing the thin panels with a relatively large number of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners and in the United States, this was achieved by using the thick steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> walls. Both the solution had economic implications with respect to material cost and erection. However, several experimental and analytical studies using both quasistatic and dynamic loading showed that the postbuckling strength and ductility of thin unstiffened SPSW can be substantial and that is why The unstiffened steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> wall is included as a “Basic Seismic Force Resisting System” in ASCE 7 and AISC 341...|$|R

Nonlinear finite element analysis models with dynamic formulation were developed to analyse test specimens. The results were validated with available published test results from other researchers. After validation, the model was used for estimating the maximum load required for testing of specimens. The efficiency of the method was finally proved by comparing the pushover and hysteresis analysis results with tests carried out in Kingston University's lab.

A composite steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> wall system {{consists of a}} steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> wall with reinforced concrete panels attached to one side or {{both sides of the}} steel infill plates by bolts or shear studs. Research on composite <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> walls is still in the initial stage and a significant amount of research is needed before it can be adopted by the Canadian steel design code, CAN/CSA S 16 - 09. This study evaluates performances of one 6 -storey and one 4 -storey C-PSW under spectrum compatible seismic records for Vancouver. A nonlinear finite element model which includes both material and geometric nonlinearities is used for this study. The model is first validated using the results from a quasi-static test. The study describes details of the validation of the finite element model by comparing the results from quasi-static experimental program with finite element analysis results. Excellent correlation between the test results and the finite element analysis results is observed. With the validated finite element model, the performance of 4 -storey and 6 -storey C-PSWs were studied under spectrum-compatible seismic records. Nonlinear seismic analysis shows that C-PSWs, in high seismic region, behave in a stable and ductile manner. Dynamic analysis showed that major portion of the shear is taken by the steel infill plate, which confirms the intended design philosophy of C-PSWs. A series of C-PSWs with different geometry were designed and analysed to estimate the fundamental periods. It is observed that the current code formula predicts periods that are generally shorter than the periods obtained from finite element analysis. In addition, the effectiveness of a simple shear flexure cantilever formulation for determining fundamental periods of C-PSWs was studied. Shear studs spacing and concrete panel thickness are two important parameters that influence the performance of the composite <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> wall. Currently there are no guidelines on what would be the minimum or maximum spacing of the shear studs. A rational method based on classical buckling theory of stiffened <b>plate</b> for determining <b>shear</b> stud spacing and thickness for the reinforced concrete panel is presented in this research. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Steel <b>plate</b> <b>shear</b> walls (SPSWs) in {{buildings}} {{are known to}} be an effective means for resisting lateral forces. By using un-stiffened walls and allowing them to buckle, their energy absorption capacity will increase significantly due to the postbuckling capacity. The post-buckling tension field action of SPSWs can provide substantial strength, stiffness and ductility. This paper presents the Finite Element Analysis of low yield point (LYP) steel shear walls. In this shear wall system, the LYP steel plate is used for the steel panel and conventional structural steel is used for boundary frames. A series of nonlinear cyclic analyses were carried out to obtain the stiffness, strength, deformation capacity, and energy dissipation capacity of the LYP steel shear wall. The effect of widthto-thickness ratio of steel plate on buckling behavior, and energy dissipation capacities were studied.

Simulated edge geometry and microhardness were found to be in reasonable agreement with published experimental results for the steel plate considered although the model was unable to simulate double cutting at 0. 8 per cent clearance. Results also suggest that edge hardness is independent of the starting ductility in the plate and that increasing the edge radii does not eVectively simulate edge wear.
