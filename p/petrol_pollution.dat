To solve soil remediation problems, an inter-disciplinary approach is required. Responsibilities during the soil remediation process, however, are increasingly decentralised, which results in dispersed knowledge. The aim of this model is to optimise knowledge transfer among the various parties involved in contaminated site management. Structured Knowledge Engineering (SKE) {{has been used as}} a framework for model development. The model was applied to <b>petrol</b> <b>pollution</b> underneath a fuel station and to a complex PAH and CN pollution at a former gasworks site. The structured approach requires scrutinising all relevant data in order to answer the questions related to an ex situ soil remediation operation. Moreover, it clarifies the roles of the different disciplines involved in the process...|$|E

Car scarcity was the major problem that impeded car use two decades ago which has transformed into road scarcity since then. Road capacity is limited in the Hungarian capital, only the public transport can help to satisfy medium run travel demand of residents. As motorisation and car use grow congestion related time loss, <b>petrol</b> and <b>pollution</b> costs put a heavy burden on Budapest. International experience shows that restrictions on cars can mitigate congestion. In many large cities introduction of road pricing in central areas {{has become one of the}} most successful traffic management solutions. Experience in London and Stockholm confirms that citizens support car use restrictions even if they are placed on car use...|$|R

Muffler silencer {{is one of the}} factors being able to enhance petrol engine performance. Racing muffler silencer is equipped with glasswoll in order to decrease sound levels and controll air flow emitted by the engine. Zeolites can be used to substitute glasswool. Beside decrease sound levels and controll air flow, zeolites can be utilized to decrease emission levels emitted by the engine. The experiments were performed in a four-stroke petrol motorcycle. The results showed that smallest particle size of zeolites could reduce highest level of CO emission, as well as motorcycle’s fuel consumption. The highest reduction of CO occurred at the highest amount of zeolites volume (240 ml) as big as 22. 31...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} {{deriving}} property-based representations of concepts from text {{have focused on}} either extracting only a subset of possible relation types, such as hyponymy/hyperny-my (e. g., car is-a vehicle) or meronymy/metonymy (e. g., car has wheels), or unspecified relations (e. g., car—petrol). We propose a system for the challenging task of automatic, large-scale acqui-sition of unconstrained, human-like property norms from large text corpora, and discuss the theo-retical implications of such a system. We employ syntactic, semantic, and encyclopedic information to guide our extraction, yielding concept-relation-feature triples (e. g., car be fast, car require <b>petrol,</b> car cause <b>pollution),</b> which approximate property-based conceptual representa-tions. Our novel method extracts candidate triples from parsed corpora (Wikipedia and the British National Corpus) using syntactically and grammatically motivated rules, then reweights triples with a linear combination of their frequency and four statistical metrics. We assess our system output in three ways: lexical comparison with norms derived from human-generated property norm data, direct evaluation by four human judges, and a semantic distance comparison with both WordNet similarity data and human-judged concept similarity ratings. Our system offers a viable and performant method of plausible triple extraction: Our lexical comparison shows comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art, while subsequent evaluations exhibit the human-like character of our generated properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} focused on {{production}} and isolation of microbial surfactants with interesting properties for application in agriculture, <b>petrol</b> industry, <b>pollution</b> remediation and pharmaceutical fields. The biosurfactant production was performed by free and immobilized aerobic cells of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332. This strain produces lipopeptides of the surfactin and fengycin families. The colonizing behavior of Bacillus subtilis strain was evaluated under several experimental and cultural conditions at different sterile solid materials with modified surface properties. After preliminary screening tests with five polymer materials, polypropylene foamed with powder activated carbon (PPch) was selected for cells immobilization and production of lipopeptides. The aims of work are {{to develop a new}} technology using the specificity of a biofilm reactor as well as a perspective continuous separation based on a liquid membrane technique (known also as pertraction). Using the classical aerated reactor the lipopeptides generate extensive foaming that imposes difficulties on plant-scale process realization. In order to avoid this drawback, while using the new type reactor conditions, the air was injected over the surface of cultural medium. With this configuration, the biofilm on the solid support and the culture medium are alimented in oxygen directly from the interfaces. The obtained results showed that the production of both lipopeptides and especially of the fengycin was greatly enhanced by the immobilization. The longer time of preliminary cells colonization enhanced highly the production of surfactin, especially at the beginning of fermentation process (the first 24 h). This effect was less evident after 48 h fermentation. To confirm the applicability of the liquid membrane process to lipopeptides recovery from aqueous media, including fermentation broth, extraction behavior of the lipopeptides into organic solvents was studied. For both lipopeptides the degree of extraction into the alkanes n-heptane and dodecane was found to vary with the aqueous solution acidity: it was relatively high at slightly acid (pH = 5. 5 - 6. 0) or slightly basic conditions (pH = 8. 0 - 9. 0), whereas the extraction was very limited at neutral zone of pH. The degree of surfactin extraction was found to be higher than the fengycin one at the same conditions and the n-heptane was a more efficient solvent for both lipopeptides. Kinetics of surfactin recovery from fermentation broth applying batch pertraction in a rotating discs contactor was studied. Lipopeptide was successfully extracted using n-heptane as liquid membrane and a 0. 2 mol. l- 1 phosphate buffer solution (pH ~ 7. 3) as a receiving phase. However, the stripping of the organic liquid and surfactin accumulation into the receiving phase were less efficient...|$|R
40|$|Modern trams, "light rail vehicles" (LRV), {{have become}} more and more popular since the 1980 ies. To give a {{definition}} of "light rail" is not easy. Since all tram systems are different depending on the city they are in. Light rail is usually tram systems that can go on both tram tracks and train tracks. During {{the first half of the}} 20 th century trams where common in European cities but disappeared during the 1960 ’ies. Motor traffic took over and tram tracks were replaced by road. Later, when cities got environmental and congestion problems, several cities choose to reintroduced trams. This thesis work is an information gathering about modern trams, not only about "light rail". Which also was one of the most important criteria’s when choosing case study cities. Saarbrucken and Karlsruhe have typical LR systems, Mannheim has an upgraded tram system, and Strasbourg has a completely new trams system, finally Zurich who has a more old fashion tram system. The fact that all cities have tram systems so unlike the other ones means that most possible information could be gathered. Saarbrucken has had trams since 1890 but they were removed on behalf to motor traffic. In the early 1990 ies a decision were made to build a new tram system with a LR system. Some lines are still under construction. Mannheim has had trams since the end of 19 th century and has modernised the system with time. They have recently bought new trams and have also rebuilt the tram stops. Zurich has an old but huge tram system and will soon have to exchange their vehicle fleet. In Zurich trams and motor vehicles use the same space have therefore developed an efficient traffic system. This has increased the travel speed for trams. Strasbourg built a completely new tram system in the 1980 ies. The city used a lot of resources to make the tram a human friendly transport by special trams, stops and lots of threes along tram routes. Karlsruhe was the first city in the world that introduced LR. They have since the start extended their LR system not only within the city but also to the whole region. Karlsruhe had an old tram system in the city, which were used together with train tracks. (In Saarbrucken they had to build tracks in the city.) One of the most important reasons to why many cities have reintroduced trams is the environmental advantage. In a city there is a huge demand of transportation, if everyone would travel with cars congestion and pollution would be an extensive problem. With buses and trams you will get both lower congestion and pollution. The energy it takes to run trams is much less per personal kilometres compared with a car, which makes it a more environmental friendly alternative. The energy used by a tram comes from electricity which better than <b>petrol</b> and reduces <b>pollution.</b> Trams are a very space efficient transportation mode, which is important since land often is in shortage in cities. An environmental problem that is common in cities is noise pollutions. Tram produce less noise than cars and the noise level becomes even lower if grass is planted between the tracks. Modern trams have proven to be a safe transportation mode in the city, with low accident rates both for passages and other traffic groups. The accident types that is most common for trams are collision between trams and cars. These are especially common in cities where cars and trams share the same space. On the other hand these collisions are rare in cities with separated space like in Saarbrucken. On the place where most accidents occur are around the tram stops. There are different designs of tram stops and they are more or less safe. Trams are generally safe and only few accidents result in lethal outcome. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
