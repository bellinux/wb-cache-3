25|$|Wilson {{teamed with}} CIA manager Gust Avrakotos {{and formed a}} team of a few dozen {{insiders}} who greatly enhanced the support for the Mujahideen, funneling it through Zia ul-Haq's ISI. Avrakotos and Wilson charmed leaders from various anti-Soviet countries including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and China to increase support for the rebels. Avrakotos hired Michael G. Vickers, a young Paramilitary Officer, to enhance the guerilla's odds by revamping the tactics, weapons, logistics, and training used by the Mujahideen. Michael Pillsbury, a <b>Pentagon</b> <b>official,</b> and Vincent Cannistraro pushed the CIA to supply the Stinger missile to the rebels.

The paper also reported that, in addition, the Pentagon may buy some shorter, lighter MRAPs in their final batch. A senior <b>Pentagon</b> <b>official</b> told them that [...] "the roads are caving in" [...] under the weight of MRAPs and [...] "We want it to weigh less than it weighs now".|$|E

2500|$|Following [...] "pay-for-play" [...] scandals at California, USC, UCLA, and Washington, the PCC disbanded in June 1959. Ten {{months earlier}} in [...] August 1958, these four schools agreed {{to form a}} new conference that would take effect the {{following}} summer. When the four schools and Stanford began discussions for a new conference in 1959, retired Admiral Thomas J. Hamilton interceded and suggested the schools consider creating a national [...] "power conference" [...] (Hamilton had been a key player, head coach, and athletic director at Navy, and was the current athletic director at Pittsburgh). Nicknamed the [...] "Airplane Conference," [...] the five former PCC schools would have played with other major academically-oriented schools, including Army, Navy, Air Force, Notre Dame, Penn, Penn State, Duke, and Georgia Tech among others.

The discovery was based on 8000 pages of secret information that had been revealed to The New York Times through a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.

2500|$|As {{part of this}} effort, Charlie befriends {{maverick}} CIA operative Gust Avrakotos and his understaffed Afghanistan {{group to}} find a better strategy, especially including a means to counter the Soviets' formidable Mi-24 helicopter gunship. This group was composed in part of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division, including a young paramilitary officer named Michael Vickers. As a result, Charlie's deft political bargaining for the necessary funding and Avrakotos' careful planning using those resources, such as supplying the guerrillas with FIM-92 Stinger missile launchers, turns the Soviet occupation into a deadly quagmire with their heavy fighting vehicles being destroyed at a crippling rate. Charlie enlists the support of Israel and Egypt for Soviet weapons and consumables, and Pakistan for distribution of arms. [...] The CIA's anti-communism budget evolves from $5 million to over $500 million (with the same amount matched by Saudi Arabia), startling several congressmen. This effort by Charlie ultimately evolves into a major portion of the U.S. foreign policy known as the Reagan Doctrine, under which the U.S. expanded assistance beyond just the mujahideen and began also supporting other anti-communist resistance movements around the world. Charlie states that senior <b>Pentagon</b> <b>official</b> Michael Pillsbury persuaded President Ronald Reagan to provide the Stingers to the Afghans.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 August 2008, {{journalist}} [...] {{wrote that}} Russian coordination of ground, joint air and naval operations, cyberattacks on Georgian government Web sites and its best English speakers conducting public-relations campaign {{did not look}} accidental to military professionals. [...] "They seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power — military, diplomatic, information — in a very disciplined way," [...] one <b>Pentagon</b> <b>official</b> was quoted as saying. [...] "It appears this was well thought out and planned in advance, and suggests a level of coordination in the Russian government {{between the military and}} the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today." [...] A major Russian ground exercise held in July near the Georgian border, called Caucasus 2008, played out a chain of events like the one carried out in the August war. More than 1,000 American military personnel were in Georgia for an exercise in July. But that exercise prepared a Georgian brigade for duty in Iraq, a different mission from the seizing of territory or countering an aggressor. Shanker noted that Russia had reinforced its peacekeeping force in Abkhazia with advanced artillery in April, and in May it sent troops to fix a railroad line linking Abkhazia with Russia.|$|E
