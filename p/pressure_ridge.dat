5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: {{the first}} was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were off, the track forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August28 and entered into the Atlantic Ocean. Initially, the wave had moderate amounts of deep convection and was already well organized, which allowed it to quickly become a tropical cyclone. Based on ship reports, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Ten beginning at 1200UTC on August30. Located 1,000miles (1,609km) southeast of Tropical Storm Felix, the depression tracked westward as a high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> formed between the two storms. Satellite imagery showed the depression developing a good outflow pattern. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August31. It was noted that by as early as 1200UTC later that day, Gabrielle was already rather large and well-defined. Gabrielle continued to move westward at 17mph (27km/h), and by early on September1, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. However, the storm was not operationally upgraded to a hurricane until late on September2; Gabrielle was then located about 625miles (1006km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E

500|$|As a high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> intensified, the northwestward {{movement}} of Hiki was blocked, causing the storm to briefly turn due west on August17. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> eventually influenced the hurricane to re-curve southwestward.

After the reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on August18, residents of Kauai and Oahu were alerted of a possible cyclonic loop. However, later that day, the high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> weakened, causing Hiki to turned westward and pass south of French Frigate Shoals and Midway Island.

500|$|While moving north-northwestward, {{satellite}} and reconnaissance aircraft reports indicated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on October13.

Increasing upper-level wind shear temporarily limited further intensification. However, after a mid- to upper-level cut-off low pressure area moved southward, the upper-level outflow pattern became more favorable, causing Jerry to resume strengthening. The cut-off low then forced Jerry to re-curve north-northwestward, while stronger steering currents and a high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> increased the storm's forward motion to more than [...] While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States, deep convection began to develop near the center, and by 1800UTC on October15, Jerry strengthened into a Category1 hurricane.|$|E

INTRODUCTION Roughness in the polar ice cover [...] -like meso-scale features of <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> and rubble fields [...] -is of significant geophysical interest. <b>Pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> and rubble fields help to transfer kinetic energy from meteorological systems to the ice cover. <b>Pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> can significantly increase sea-ice drag coefficients, which subsequently affect sea-ice movement and deformation. Ridges and rubble fields are also of interest because they account for {{a large portion of the}} total ice mass. In ERS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> commonly appear as filamentary, curvilinear features of variable width.

500|$|Marty {{began moving}} north-northwestward in {{response}} to a high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> to the west, and continued to strengthen, reaching a peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h) early on September 22. Marty then moved northward at an increased speed before making landfall 10mi (15km) northeast of Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur later that day. After making landfall, Marty turned back to the north-northwest, moving parallel to the eastern coast of the peninsula, and weakening to a tropical storm on September 23. Marty then stalled over the Gulf of California after encountering a high pressure system over the U.S. state of Nevada, and further weakened to a tropical depression before making a second landfall near Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, on September 24. Marty became a remnant low pressure area on September 25, and moved erratically over the northern Gulf of California for the next two days before drifting southwestward and dissipating over the northern Baja California Peninsula on [...] September 26.|$|E

A blocking pattern over Atlantic Canada caused the storm to drift at forward speeds under [...] for four days. Wind shear also decreased, allowing Leslie to re-organize and strengthen into a hurricane at 1200UTC on September5. Six hours later, Leslie attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 80mph (130km/h). However, the slow movement of the storm caused upwelling [...] a process by which warm SSTs are replaced with colder waters. As a result, Leslie slowly began to weaken and fell to tropical storm intensity by early on September8. Despite weakening, the storm's circulation expanded to a radius of more than the wind field also expanded, with tropical storm force winds reaching about [...] in diameter from the center.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic {{from the west}} coast of Africa on August15. Six days later, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven while centered halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. The depression tracked west-northwestward around the periphery of a subtropical surface high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge.</b> After strengthening minimally, the depression struck Guadeloupe late on August23 and entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Although satellite intensity estimates indicated tropical storm status, 13reconnaissance flights conducted by the National Hurricane Center between August23 and August27 indicated winds were less than 40mph (65km/h). By August25, the depression made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Despite the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the depression did not weakened and re-emerged into the Atlantic from the northern coast of Haiti early on August26. The depression curved northwestward and did not strengthen. On August27, the depression made another landfall near Andros Town on Andros, Bahamas. Later that day, the depression passed less than [...] east of West Palm Beach, Florida. Thereafter, the depression curved north-northwestward and remained offshore of Florida.|$|E

500|$|A {{discernible}} area of {{low pressure}} formed east of Tonga on February 23. The {{area of low pressure}} moved eastward, where it strengthened into Tropical Depression 10F a day later. Since the depression {{was located in}} an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen into Tropical Storm Percy. At this point in time, Percy was located [...] east of Fongafale, Tuvalu, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 kt (16mph, 26km/h). On February 26, Percy reached Category 1 status, while located 400miles (644km) north of American Samoa. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category3 storm as it passed between Fakaofa and Swains Island. Percy then reached Category4 status north of Pago Pago as it winds reached over 135mph (115knots, 213km/h) and the barometric pressure at its center fell to 925millibars. On February 27, Cyclone Percy encountered a high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> which slowed its forward speed. Because of this, the cyclone's structure became elliptical, which caused the cyclone to weaken back to Category3 status. By February 28, Percy bypassed the Pukapuka and Nassau Islands as a Category3 cyclone as it continued to move east-southeast.|$|E
2500|$|An upper-level trough {{near the}} Greater Antilles {{continued}} to provide westerly shear that briefly stalled the development, but the system's strong convection persisted. A {{break in the}} shear on November 15 enabled the storm to briefly strengthen.

A deeplayered subtropical high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico propelled the system westward across the Caribbean at more than [...] and the storm's upper circulation was entirely separated from its deep convection and low level circulatory center.

2500|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave and}} a broad low-pressure area associated with it exited {{the west coast of}} Africa near Dakar, Senegal on August30. The low-pressure area, which had deepened to [...] by August31, moved south of Cape Verde. Although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery, the system possessed a well-defined low- to mid-level circulation. After crossing several National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoys early on September3, it was determined that the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 1200UTC on that same day, while located about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. Under the influence of strong high <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge,</b> the depression tracked almost due westward, without significant intensification. Convection remained sporadic and disorganized, with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on September6. While nearing the Leeward Islands, upper-level winds reduced to a favorable level, causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increase.|$|E

50|$|From an {{offshore}} engineering and naval perspective, {{there are three}} reasons why <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> are a subject of investigation. Firstly, because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features. Secondly, when <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> drift into shallower areas, their keel may {{come into contact with}} the seabed, thereby representing a risk for subsea pipelines (see Seabed gouging by ice) and other seabed installations. Thirdly, they {{have a significant impact on}} navigation. In the Arctic, ridged ice makes up about 40% of the overall mass of sea ice.|$|R
50|$|Inflationary caves tend to {{be small}} {{chambers}} that form when lava is pressurized and pushes exterior rock. The lava may then later drain leaving an inflationary cave.

These blisters are at times big enough to qualify as a cave. Inflated caves can be mistaken for lava tubes because they often share {{many of the same}} characteristics. An example of inflationary caves can be found in <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges.</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> are fractured lobes of hardened lava and may occasionally be hollow.|$|R

50|$|Sea ice is {{the outcome}} of {{freezing}} seawater. It is porous and mechanically weaker than glacial ice. Sea ice dynamics are highly complex. Driven by winds and currents, sea ice may ultimately develop into <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges,</b> a pile-up of ice fragments, or rubble, making up long, linear features. These are a very common source of seabed gouges. <b>Pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> are often enclosed inside expanses of drifting pack ice, such that gouging activity from sea ice ridge keels is closely related with pack ice motion. Stamukhi are also pile-ups of broken sea ice but they are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice. Stamukhi can penetrate the seabed to a considerable depth, and this also poses a risk to subsea pipelines at shore approaches.|$|R
