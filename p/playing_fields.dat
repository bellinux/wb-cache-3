5|$|Ashburton <b>Playing</b> <b>Fields</b> {{are just}} off Shirley Road, behind the school. The fields were first {{dedicated}} {{as a public}} horse racing course by James I in the early 17th century. Following {{the opening of the}} nearby Woodside railway station in 1871 large numbers of Londoners began travelling to the racecourse. Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as <b>playing</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Cricket Club {{was formed}} in the late 19thcentury and moved to Sharpham Road <b>Playing</b> <b>Fields</b> in 1964. They now play in the West of England Premier League Somerset Division.

50|$|Widford {{is home to}} Widford <b>Playing</b> <b>Field,</b> {{the leisure}} {{purposes}} of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> include a children's play area, a football pitch and also a cricket strip. The <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> has green areas as trees and hedges have been planted since its opening. The development of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> came after Askey's Field was purchased in 1979 by volunteers from the Village Hall Community who raised the money {{to allow them to}} purchase it.|$|R
5|$|A toy castle is {{also used}} as a common {{children}} attraction in <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> and fun parks, such as the castle of the Playmobil FunPark in Ħal Far, Malta.|$|E
5|$|The Crewkerne Aqua Centre also {{provides}} {{swimming pool and}} fitness gym facilities to the town, located on the grounds next to Henhayes Park, {{which used to be}} the Grammar Schools <b>Playing</b> <b>fields.</b> St. Martins School retained the use of the <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> until the junior section was closed in 2003, as regular sports days were a tradition dating back to the Grammar school era in the town. A further sports centre is situated on the Wadham School campus.

5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> at Cobdown, Ditton. It {{is possible that the}} spearhead came from a grave {{on the top of the}} knoll, destroyed during the making or widening of the cutting.|$|E
40|$|The <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is {{a concept}} often used to {{describe}} level of fairness in electoral competition. With Levitsky and Way’s definition of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> as a case in point, this paper takes a critical look at existing work on the <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> arguing that current conceptualizations suffer from lacking conceptual logic, operationalization and measurement. A new and disaggregated framework that can {{serve as the basis}} for future research on the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is then proposed. This framework is applied to an illustrative case study on the development of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> in Zambia under MMD rule, thereby demonstrating that it is able to capture both the changing nature of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> and the differing mechanisms at play to a larger degree than the framework put forth by Levitsky and Way. The 2011 elections in Zambia also clearly highlight the importance of conceptually and empirically separating the slope of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> from its impact on both the opposition and electoral outcomes...|$|R
50|$|The <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is a box seven rows {{high and}} ten columns across. Above the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> {{on the right}} is a box with five darkened lights. Below the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is the status bar. The status bar {{displays}} the current score, level, and number of shots available.|$|R
40|$|While {{frequently}} invoked, {{the level}} <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> ideal and its practical embodiment in tax legislation has received relatively little analysis. This paper examines the economic arguments surrounding the level <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> doctrine. I conclude that leveling the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> {{is an issue}} of little economic importance and that efforts to level the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> like those recently enacted are likely to create more important nonneutralities than those they eliminate. They may however contribute to the perceived fairness of the tax system. ...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Faversham Town F.C. {{were formed}} in 1884 and compete in Division One South of the Isthmian League. They have a 2000-seat stadium {{to the south}} of the town and are the only team besides the England {{national}} football team to wear the 3 lions badge. The King George V <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> are all that remain of the Mount Field, which in 1876 hosted a first-class match between Kent and Hampshire County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Kings Fitness & Leisure, {{situated}} {{on the grounds of}} The Kings of Wessex School, provides a venue for various sports and includes a 20-metre swimming pool, racket sport courts, a sports hall, dance studios and a gym.

50|$|The {{game has}} the basic {{appearance}} of a conventional pinball game, with a rolling ball propelled upward on the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> by hitting it with flippers. However, unlike a conventional pinball game, the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> extends upwards endlessly. The display follows the ball as it moves. Multiple flippers are placed throughout the <b>play</b> <b>field.</b> There is no drain; play is limited by a timer. The challenge is {{to go as far}} as possible up the <b>play</b> <b>field,</b> within the available time.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 four {{acres of}} land who bought in Shutts Lane {{for use as a}} <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> This remains part of the school <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> today.|$|R

5|$|Most of Barnet lies over London Clay, {{which is}} poor for agriculture, and open land is mainly used for {{activities}} such as horse grazing, <b>playing</b> <b>fields,</b> parks and golf courses. Features of the traditional agricultural landscape have survived, such as old hedgerows, ancient trees and areas of herb-rich grassland. Some hay meadows have a large diversity of wild flowers, and the London Ecology Unit (LEU) described them as one of Barnet's most important ecological assets.|$|E
5|$|Moston Juniors is a youth {{football}} club, {{formed in}} 1993. The club has Active Sports and Charity Club status {{and was the}} first club in Manchester to receive FA Charter Standard Community Club status. The club signed the lease for Ronald Johnson <b>Playing</b> <b>fields</b> in 2007, with work to improve the site being completed in 2009 due to a grant from Manchester City Council and the Football Foundation. The club had further plans {{with the help of a}} proposed £750,000 council grant to build a clubhouse and upgrade their pitches, however they were unable to secure sufficient additional funding to make the project happen. On announcement of the intended redevelopment of the Ronald Johnson <b>Playing</b> <b>fields</b> into a new stadium, Moston Juniors entered into a partnership with F.C. United and Manchester City Council so that they could lease the new ground facilities.|$|E

Outlying public houses include the Royal Oak at Cowlishaw, and the Park Inn at Buckstones Road.|$|E
5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and <b>playing</b> <b>fields.</b> The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
50|$|In Five Ashes, {{there is}} a large <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> where {{football}} and other games can be played and a skateboarding park. Adjoining the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> and village hall is a children's playground.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other action puzzle games such as Tetris or Puzzle League {{where the}} player {{directly}} manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> atop the fallen objects. Toad {{can pick up}} individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> and scurrying {{up the sides of}} stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> of its objects quickly enough, the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.|$|R
50|$|The Former Pupils' Club {{established}} a {{fund for the}} acquisition of a <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> and a sum was raised to help to build and equip the pavilion at the <b>Playing</b> <b>Field</b> at Hazlehead.|$|R
5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate <b>playing</b> <b>fields.</b> In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many Oxford colleges, Jesus {{provides}} sporting facilities for students, including <b>playing</b> <b>fields</b> {{at a site}} in east Oxford off the Cowley Road known as Bartlemas (for its proximity to St Bartholomew's Chapel).

The college also provides students with membership of the university's gym and swimming pool on Iffley Road.|$|E
50|$|A {{sequence}} of snakes made of colored balls fall {{down into the}} <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> The object {{of the game is}} to manipulate the direction of these snakes, by using the joystick, in order to form a line of 3 colored balls vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game ends when the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> tops out, that is, when {{there is no room for}} a new snake to enter the <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
50|$|Winklebury {{has a large}} <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> The <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> {{has been}} re-development into new {{football}} pitches and a new football stand. Part of this development houses the offices for the Headquarters of the Hampshire FA.|$|R
50|$|Each {{match is}} two minutes long. Alliances receive one point {{for each of}} their floppies that are over the <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> not {{in contact with the}} surface of the <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> and less than 8 feet above the surface of the <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> Floppies that are 8 feet or more above the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> earn 3 points for the {{alliance}} it belongs to. Any robot on the puck multiplies its alliance's score by 3. If a puck is entirely {{on one side of the}} dividing line that runs through the middle of the field, the alliance whose robot operator stations are furthest from the puck will multiply its score by 2.|$|R
