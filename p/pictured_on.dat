5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow {{brooches}} containing more than 506 diamonds. There is no record of Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The brooches are often adjusted to contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was <b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> {{more than one occasion}} with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as the drops.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (<b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (<b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (<b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
