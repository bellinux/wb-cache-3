A modified version of the SimAmazonia model, with Business-as-Usual infra-structure growth, was employed for the future scenario.

Dry forest is of very limited natural extent in the Amazon and is more susceptible to degradation by fire [...] thus a high conservation priority. Supporting only the presently established conservation areas and indigenous areas will not be sufficient for the protection of this habitat. Losses are projected to exceed 90 % of the original area in some dry climate niche slices by 2036.

This work presents clips considering deforested areas of Rondônia State, Machadinho D Oeste county and the Machadinho settlement {{during the period from}} 1997 to 2010. There were used digital databases of <b>Prodes</b> and Deter projects, county digital database of IBGE and the digital database of Incra settlements, last of them including conservation areas such as Reserva Extrativista, Floresta Nacional and Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável. There were used geometric analysis tools in order to select polygons of deforested areas inside settlements. A logical modelling of database was performed in order to define three deforestation classes by date. As a result it was obtained deforested areas of 3. 086. 760 ha (13 %) to Rondônia State, 212. 356 ha (29 %) to Machadinho DOeste county and 121. 465 ha (57 %) to the Machadinho settlement.

40|$|High deforstation {{rates in}} Amazonia have {{motivated}} considerable efforts to monitor land-cover changes based on satellite images and image porcesssing techniques. Most commonly, MODIS images {{are used to}} provide low-cost region-wide coverage at nearly monthly frequencies, but they offer offer only coarse resolution, Lsndsat TM {{has been used in}} a majority of studies for nearly two decades, but these, but these data are expensive, and provide, at best, yearly coverage because of clouds. Here, a new approach to estimate forest change is proposed based on the integration of TM and MODIS images. TM images are processed using a hybrid approach including spectral mixture, expert rules, and usupervised classification, to generate a reference forest image. Three fraction images are derived from MODIS surface reflectance data; expert rules are used to generate a refined vegetation image and regression is then develoned between the TM-derived forest and MODIS derived vegetation data to assess the fractional forest area. This approach was initially applied to 2004 MODIS and TM images from Rondônia, and the regression model was transferred to 2000 and 2006 MODIS images. A similar exercise was made in Pará state for the estimation of forest area in 2005. Compared to TM-derived reference data in Rondônia, the system error for the MODIS-derived forest areas was 1. 56 % and 4. 19 % for 2004 and 2000 images, respectively.

The lack of clean, safe drinking water is estimated to kill almost 4, 000 children per day. Many regions of the world are increasingly turning to desalination of brackish and sea water in their effort to match the increasing demand with the available natural resources. The trend is intensified by climate change, which seems to be already affecting the water cycle resulting in long periods of drought. The desalination industry has responded well to the increasing demand and is constantly evolving by reducing the costs and reliably producing water of very high quality. Most innovations focus on reducing the energy demand, since this is associated with high operating costs. However, desalination processes will always require considerable amounts of energy. If conventional energy sources are used, they contribute to climate change, which, in turn, affects the water cycle and intensifies the original problem that desalination was intending to solve. For desalination to remain a viable option in a world with a changing climate, renewable energy sources have to be used to meet at least part of its power requirements. The scientific community has been working for decades on optimising technological combinations where the desalination process is powered directly by renewable sources; thermal energy, electricity or shaft power. The industry is also recognising the potential and various companies are active in this field.

Ecosystems, 9 : 609 - 623 Sponsorship: CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Technologico) support (grant 382660 / 02 - 1) In quantifying the carbon budget of the Amazon region, temporal estimates of the extent and age of regenerating tropical forests are fundamental. However, retrieving such information from re mote-sensing data is difficult, largely because of spectral similarities between different successional stages and variations in the reflectance of forests following different pathways of regeneration. In this study, secondary-forest dynamics in Brazilian Amazonia were modeled for the 1978 - 2002 period to determine area and age on a grid basis. We modeled the area, age, and age class distribution {{of secondary}} forests using empirical relationships with the percentage of remaining primary forest, as determined from large-area remote-sensing campaigns (the Pathfinder and <b>Prodes</b> projects). The statistical models were calibrated using de tailed maps of secondary-forest age generated for seven sites in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The area-age distribution was then specified from mean age by a distribution assumption. Over the period 1978 - 2002, secondary-forest area was shown to have increased from 29, 000 to 161, 000 km 2 (that is, {{by a factor of}} 5). The mean age in creased from 4. 4 to 4. 8 years. We generated a time series of secondary-forest area fractions and suc cessional stages that provides wall-to-wall cover age of the Brazilian Amazon at a spatial resolution of 0. 1 decimal degrees (approximately 11 km). Validation against reference data yielded root mean squared errors of 8 % of the total area for estimate of secondary-forest area and 2. 4 years for mean secondary-forest age. Using this approach, we provide the first published update on the state of secondary forests in Amazonia since the early 1990 s and a time series of secondary-forest area over the 2 5 -year period.

Milan started the game pressing the holders high up the pitch and on three minutes Barcelona lost the ball just outside their own area, allowing Kevin-Prince Boateng to unleash a shot that looped into the path of Zlatan Ibrahimović. The striker headed the ball to the unmarked Robinho, who volleyed it over the bar from eight meters. Barcelona reaction came not long after, as on ten minutes Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati fumbled Lionel Messi's scuffed shot and Dani Alves <b>proded</b> wide from close range. Abbiati denied Xavi after a quick one-two with Messi, while Alessandro Nesta and Luca Antonini made crucial interventions. However, Milan could have scored on 20 minutes when Clarence Seedorf's slide-rule pass left Ibrahimović with only goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to beat, but the Swede's scuffed shot was saved. In the second half, Massimiliano Allegri brought on Stephan El Shaarawy for Robinho to inject more pace into the hosts' play. Soon, though, the visitors retook control of the match and Nesta had to foul Messi to prevent him from snaking into the area; the Argentinian forward curled the resulting free-kick over the bar.

40|$|The Soy Moratorium is an {{initiative}} to reduce deforestation {{rates in the}} Amazon biome based on the hypothesis that soybean is a deforestation driver. Farmers that planted soybean in that biome in opened areas after its declaration, July 24 th, 2006, would not have their production commercialized nor supported with any financial aid through purchases or crop financing by the associated companies to the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE) and the National Association of Cereal Exporters (ANEC). ABIOVE and ANEC represent about 90 % of the Brazilian soybean market. Brazil has a long term project to monitor the deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazon Biome using remote sensing images. Every year a map with new deforested polygons {{is available on the}} Internet (www. <b>prodes.</b> inpe. br). Therefore, it is possible to monitor the deforested polygons after the Moratorium date in order to identify annual crops in these polygons using remote sensing images. The crop detection method based on satellite images facilitate and reduce costs of the monitoring procedure to select possible soybean fields. The MODIS satellite images are not able to classify soybean crop at early growth stages with high accuracy, however, they {{play an important role in}} the pre-selection of these possible soybean fields. Therefore, crop detection method also uses Landsat like images, aerial survey and, field work. In the last crop, 3, 571 deforested polygons with more than 25 ha and deforested after the Moratorium declaration were identified nearby the soybean producing region in the Amazon Biome. Using satellite imagery analysis procedure, 293 of these deforested polygons were selected, indicating to have annual crops. Soybean was detected in 147 of 293 polygons, covering an area of 11, 698 ha. In 2011, the soybean was cultivated only in 0. 39 % of the recently deforested areas in Amazon Biome during the Moratorium period. In terms of the total soybean area cultivated in Brazil and in the Amazon Biome, 11, 698 ha represents 0. 05 % and 0. 60 %, respectively.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of Manhattan Transfer yields one very formidable conclusion: {{it is an}} extraordinarily contrived work of fiction that {{is a work of}} art. The novel is extraordinary because nothing quite like it had ever been done before in American literature; contrived, because it is a carefully wrought, deliberated piece of fiction. Thus Manhattan Transfer is an experimental novel in the best sense of the word. It is not the result of any kind of "spontaneous combustion," in which the author was the mere instrument to guide the pen while wrapt in the ecstatic warblings of the muse. Dos Passos believed that he had to find a form that would capture the hum and throb, the agony and the ecstasy of the modern metropolis. He wanted to represent its kaleidoscopic variety, its noise and confusion, and, above all, he wanted to show how modern man is responsible for projecting the monster in his own soul. The monster in Manhattan Transfer is New York City, conceived and built in the image of power and success. The city is a tribute to man's genius;it is also a tribute to his greed. In his desire to succeed at all costs, man has created a labyrinthine technology that he does not understand. Man finds himself going through revolving doors endlessly, finally {{to the point where he}} himself is fed through the huge modern machines, like a tapeworm devoid of any direction and sensibility. Moreover Manhattan Transfer is an altogether American novel, because it deals with the phenomenon of the mushrooming American technology with its focus on a huge metropolis. Furthermore, because it is such an innovative novel in terms of traditional fiction, it is clearly in the American stream of literature. It points both forward and backward. It takes as its departure Whitman's tremendous achievements in language experimentation. In his essay in The New Republic (October 14, 1916), Doe Passos <b>proded</b> future practitioners in American literature to experiment, to look back at Walt Whitman and renew his spirit of genuine individualism and gusto. He reminded American writers to look within themselves and create forms that would speak for the times that were flexible and adaptable enough to capture the American spirit. He reprimanded those writers who would follow in the European traditions of the novel without questioning their relationship to the wholly new American experience. One need not have read much Whitman to remember that he called his Leaves of Grass, in the final analysis, a "language experiment. " And one need not have read far into ManhattanTransfer to realize that it is also a language experiment. Doe Passos adores language; he is intrigued by its endless manipulatability. Manhattan Transfer is also an enviable source of important knowledge about New York City during the first two decades of the twentieth century. What was it like to live there prior to the first world war?
