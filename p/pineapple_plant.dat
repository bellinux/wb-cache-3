40|$|Pineapple {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tropical crops worldwide. The use of Temporary Immersion Bioreactors (TIB) for the first stages of pineapple propagation enables precise control of plant growth, increases the rate of plant multiplication, decreases space, energy and labor requirements for <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> in commercial micropropagation. Once the plantlets are ready to be taken from the reactors, they are carefully acclimatized to adapt to natural environmental conditions, and a facultative C 3 /CAM metabolism in the first two months of growth is characteristic of <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants,</b> depending on environmental conditions. We subjected two sets of micropropagated <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> to C 3 and CAM-inducing environmental conditions, determined by light intensity/relative humidity (respectively 40 μmol. m- 2 s- 1 / 85 % and 260 μmol. m- 2. s- 1 / 50 %). Leaves of <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> grown under CAM inducing conditions showed higher leaf thickness and more developed cuticles and hypodermic tissue. Proteomic profiles of several proteins, isoenzyme patterns and transcriptomic profiles were also measured. Five major spots were isolated and identified, two of them for the first time in Ananas comosus (OEE 1; OEE 2) and the other three corresponding to small fragments of the large subunit of Rubisco (LSU). PEPC and PEPCK were also detected by immunobloting of 2 DE at the end of both ex vitro treatments (C 3 /CAM) during the dark period.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 98 - 109) Microfiche. xi, 109 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmMealybug-wilt of pineapple {{is one of}} {{the serious}} diseases in pineapple. Severe mealybug infestation may result in large yield losses in commercial plantations. The cause of this disease has been linked to a toxin secreted by mealybugs during their feeding upon pineapple. The biological evidence supporting a viral etiology began to emerge in recent years. In this study I investigated the possible involvement of a virus with this disease by studying the association of dsRNA with infected plants, developing purification protocols for the closterovirus-like particles associated with mealybug-wilt infected pineapple, conducting detailed electron microscopic studie 6 of the virus leading to the determination of its physical properties such as length, width, and buoyant density. A polyclonal antiserum was produced to the virus isolated from pineapple and agar diffusion tests and serologically specific electron microscopic studies were conducted on this virus. The viral coat protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. That the antiserum produced was specific to the viral coat protein was shown by western blotting studies. Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were developed and were used for the detection of virus in <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants,</b> mealybugs, and other plant species found commonly near commercial pineapple plantations. cDNA probes also were used in Northern blot analysis to detect subgenomic RNAs of viral origin in plant extracts obtained from diseased <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants.</b> cDNA probes developed were sensitive and virus was detected in wilt-affected <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> as well as symptomless <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> in the commercial plantations. The presence of virus also was detected in mealybugs taken from diseased <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> and in a common grass species around pineapple plantations. The results of this study confirm the presence of a virus associated with "mealybug-wilted" <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants.</b> Based on the virion morphology and its physical properties this virus may tentatively be assigned to the closterovirus group. The role of the virus in the etiology of wilt disease has yet to be determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of endophytic Acetobacter diazotrophicus was tested for <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> (Ananas comosus [L. ] Merr.) {{grown in the}} field. Diazotrophic bacteria were isolated from the inner tissues of surface sterilized roots, stems, and leaves of <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants.</b> Phenotypic tests permitted the selection of presumptive nitrogen-fixing A. diazotrophicus isolates. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of small subunit (SSU) rDNA using total DNA digested with endonuclease SphI and with endonuclease NcoI, hybridizations of RNA with an A. diazotrophicus large subunit (LSU) rRNA specific probe, as well as patterns in denaturing protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and multilocus enzyme tests allowed the identification of A. diazotrophicus isolates. High frequen-cies of isolation were obtained from propagative buds {{that had not been}} nitrogen-fertilized, and lower frequencies from 3 -month-old plants that had been nitrogen-fertilized.

40|$|In Queensland, <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> are artificially induced {{to flower}} by {{spraying}} with chemical agents {{as a standard}} industry practice; nevertheless an important percentage of plants flower naturally with fruit maturing ahead of the normal summer harvest. This results in the need of extra harvest passes and significantly increases growing costs. In pineapple, ethylene {{is thought to be}} responsible for natural flowering due to low temperatures. ACC synthase is the key regulatory enzyme in the biosynthesis of ethylene. Our research team has isolated and characterised an ACC synthase gene induced by cold temperature treatment of <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> followed by an extended warm period. We are producing transgenic <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> carrying sense and antisense copies of the flowering-related ACC synthase gene in order to down-regulate the expression of the gene and therefore suppress natural flowering. Pineapples are not climacteric fruits but nevertheless ethylene is believed to play a significant role during ripening. Important quality traits such as skin texture and colour are linked to the production of ethylene by the fruit. To this aim we have studied pineapple fruit ripening as our model system. We have cloned and characterised several ACC synthase and ACC oxidase genes and have shown {{for the first time that}} the two key genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis are induced during pineapple fruit ripening. Transgenic plants containing sense and antisense copies of the ripening-related ACC synthase gene are being produced.

40|$|Many {{plant species}} grown under in vitro con- trolled {{conditions}} {{can be used}} as models for the study of physiological processes. Adult pineapple can display CAM physiology while in vitro it functions as a C 3 plant. Ex vitro Ananas comosus has plastic morphology and physi- ology, both easy to modify from C 3 to CAM by changing the environmental conditions. The yield of survival for a rentable propagation protocol of pineapple is closely rela- ted with the C 3 /CAM shift and the associated physiological characteristics. In the present work, ex vitro <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> were divided in two sets and subjected to C 3 and CAM-inducing environmental conditions, determined by light intensity and relative humidity, respectively, 40 lmol m- 2 s- 1 / 85 % and 260 lmol m- 2 s- 1 / 50 %. The results demonstrated that the stress imposed by the envi- ronmental conditions switched <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> from C 3 to CAM behavior. Comparing to CAM induced, C 3 -induced <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> showed substandard growth parameters and morphological leaf characteristics but a better rooting process and a higher ABA production, a phenotype closer to adult plants, which are expected to produce fruits in a normal production cycle. We conclude that the upholding of these characteristics is conditioned by low light intensity plus high relative humidity, especially during the first 8 weeks of ex vitro growth. It is expected that the better understanding of pineapple acclimatization will contribute to the design of a protocol to apply as a rentable tool in the pineapple agronomic industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{state of the}} <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> has a large effect on plant growth, on fruit production, and fruit quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the uptake, accumulation, and export of nutrients by the irrigated 'Vitória' <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> during and at the end of its development. A randomized block statistical design with four replications was used. The treatments were defined by different times of plant collection: at 270, 330, 390, 450, 510, 570, 690, 750, and 810 days after planting (DAP). The collected plants were separated into the following components: leaves, stem, roots, fruit, and slips for determination of fresh and dry matter weight at 65 ºC. After drying, the plant components were ground for characterization of the composition and content of nutrients taken up and exported by the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant.</b> The results were subjected to analysis of variance, and non-linear regression models were fitted for the significant differences identified by the F test (p N > S > Ca > Mg > P, which corresponded to 898, 452, 134, 129, 126, and 107 kg ha- 1, respectively, of total accumulation. The export of macronutrients by the pineapple fruit was in the following decreasing order: K > N > S > Ca > P > Mg, which was equivalent to 18, 17, 11, 8, 8, and 5 %, respectively, of the total accumulated by the pineapple.
