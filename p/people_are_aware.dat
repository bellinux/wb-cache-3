5|$|Agatha is {{reconnected}} to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting to}} comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E
500|$|Palmer {{felt that}} the {{characters}} of Marston and Williamson represented siblings in their former gang, while Dutch {{was more of a}} parental figure. He stated that Williamson is envious of Marston, despite Marston being his [...] "moral anchor". Palmer also felt that, after Marston left the gang, Williamson's life began to [...] "tailspin" [...] uncontrollably. [...] "s John grew into a man who conquered by achieving, Bill fell into a man who achieved simply by conquering," [...] said Palmer. The character of Edgar Ross was partly inspired by lawyer and political activist Charles Joseph Bonaparte, while the in-game Mexican Revolution of Nuevo Paraíso was somewhat based on the Plan de San Diego. When developing other characters, the team was inspired by various historical figures of the 20th century, including Frank James, Pearl Hart and Tom Horn. In terms of the random non-player character (NPC) dialogue, Houser felt that Redemption sits between Bully, in which NPCs remember the protagonist, and Grand Theft Auto, in which NPCs are unaware of the protagonist's identity. [...] "here are countryside environments and people are to some extent bored so they're looking for thing to talk about so your actions get spoken about and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of you more," [...] said Houser.|$|E

Producer Cathy Elliot said, [...] "It's a {{very sensitive}} issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing brought up.

2500|$|When {{creating}} {{sound effects}} for films, sound recordists and editors do not generally concern {{themselves with the}} verisimilitude or accuracy of the sounds they present. [...] The sound of a bullet entering a person from a close distance may sound nothing like the sound designed in the above example, but since very few <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of how such a thing actually sounds, the job of designing the effect is mainly an issue of creating a conjectural sound which feeds the audience's expectations while still suspending disbelief.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} preservation is by salting or outdoor wind-drying. The wind-drying takes around eight weeks. The salting {{is usually}} done {{by putting the}} meat and the blubber in salt, {{a little bit of}} water can be added, it should be so salty, that a potato can float in it. The meat and blubber can be eaten when needed, it can last {{for a very long time}} when lying in salt. It can not be eaten directly as it would be too salty, it must be [...] "watered out" [...] for one to 1½ day, it depends how salty people like it. After that the meat must be boiled, the blubber can be boiled or eaten as it is. Today many people also freeze the meat and the blubber, but the traditional way of storage is still practiced, particularly in the villages, and the food lasts longer that way. The Faroese <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of the fact that the pilot whales, just like many other ocean mammals, are contaminated and that they should not eat the meat and blubber so often. In some areas there are no whalings for years, and then the people there do not have any whale food unless they get some from relatives or friends from other areas who have enough and wish to share.|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the fact that they}} do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|French {{anthropologist}} Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralist anthropology {{brought together}} ideas of Boas (especially Boas's {{belief in the}} mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's Émile Durkheim's focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. [...] His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing {{members of the same}} society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware).</b> [...] He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. [...] He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. [...] The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural [...] "table of elements," [...] and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures. [...] Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.|$|E

"Unless the merciful course {{taken by}} the Nuncio is confirmed," [...] said Lord Loring, [...] "it may end in {{a revival of the}} protest of the Catholic priests in Germany against the {{prohibition}} of marriage to the clergy.

It was only checked by a papal bull issued in 1847, reiterating the final decision of the famous Council of Trent in favor of the celibacy of the priesthood. Few <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that this rule has been an institution of slow growth among the clergy of the Church of Rome.

6000|$|But the {{managers}} will {{not and should}} not be satisfied with these limits to the municipal power. If they are deprived of the protection of the Lord Chamberlain's licence, {{and at the same time}} efficiently protected against every attempt at censorship by the licensing authority, the enemies of the theatre will resort to the ordinary law, and try to get from the prejudices of a jury what they are debarred from getting from the prejudices of a County Council or City Corporation. Moral Reform Societies, [...] "Purity" [...] Societies, Vigilance Societies, exist in England and America for the purpose of enforcing the existing laws against obscenity, blasphemy, Sabbath-breaking, the debauchery of children, prostitution and so forth. The paid officials of these societies, in their anxiety to produce plenty of evidence of their activity in the annual reports which go out to the subscribers, do not always discriminate between an obscene postcard and an artistic one, or to put it more exactly, between a naked figure and an indecent one. They often combine a narrow but terribly sincere sectarian bigotry with a complete ignorance of art and history. Even when they have some culture, their livelihood is at the mercy of subscribers and committee men who have none. If these officials had any power of distinguishing between art and blackguardism, between morality and virtue, between immorality and vice, between conscientious heresy and mere baseness of mind and foulness of mouth, they might be trusted by theatrical managers not to abuse the powers of the common informer. As it is, it has been found necessary, in order to enable good music to be performed on Sunday, to take away these powers in that particular, and vest them solely in the Attorney-General. This disqualification of the common informer should be extended to the initiation of all proceedings of a censorial character against theatres. Few <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of the monstrous laws against blasphemy which still disgrace our statute book. If any serious attempt were made to carry them out, prison accommodation would have to be provided for almost every educated person in the country, beginning with the Archbishop of Canterbury. Until some government with courage and character enough to repeal them comes into power, it is not too much to ask that such infamous powers of oppression should be kept in responsible hands and not left at the disposal of every bigot ignorant enough to be unaware of the social dangers of persecution. Besides, the common informer is not always a sincere bigot, who believes he is performing an action of signal merit in silencing and ruining a heretic. He is unfortunately just as often a blackmailer, who has studied his powers as a common informer in order that he may extort money for refraining from exercising them. If the manager is to be responsible he should be made responsible to a responsible functionary. To be responsible to every fanatical ignoramus who chooses to prosecute him for exhibiting a cast of the Hermes of Praxiteles in his vestibule, or giving a performance of Measure for Measure, is mere slavery. It is made bearable at present by the protection of the Lord Chamberlain's certificate. But when that is no longer available, the common informer must be disarmed if the manager is to enjoy security.|$|E
