40|$|Abstract. Limiting the {{short-circuit}} current effectively {{is of great}} importance to keep the safe and steady running of the power system. A novel fault current limiter (FCL) {{on the basis of}} a high speed switch and a triggered vacuum switch (TVS) is presented. The high speed switch is used to break the {{short-circuit current}} of the power system. The TVS is used to discharge the precharged <b>pulse</b> <b>capacitor</b> so as to rapidly extinguish the arc in the high speed switch and to realize the active transfer of the short-circuit current. A resistor is used to limit the short-circuit current. The parameters of the FCL for the 10 kV power system are designed and a FCL apparatus is fabricated. An onsite experiment of the FCL apparatus is performed in an actual transmission line of a substation. The FCL apparatus operates normally and achieves the expected current limiting effect...|$|E

The CLIC pre-damping rings and damping rings will produce, through synchrotron radiation, ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge, {{necessary for the}} luminosity performance of the collider. To limit the beam emittance blow-up due to oscillations, the pulse generators for the damping ring kickers must provide extremely flat, high-voltage pulses.
