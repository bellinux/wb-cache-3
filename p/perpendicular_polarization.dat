The different selection rules for optical transitions in graphene nanoribobns with armchair and zigzag edges were reported. These results were supplemented by a comparative study of zigzag nanoribobns with single wall armchair carbon nanotubes by Hsu and Reichl in 2007. It was demonstrated that selection rules in zigzag ribbons {{are different from those}} in carbon nanotube and the eigenstates in zigzag ribbons can be classified as either symmetric or antisymmetric.

Optical transitions between the edge and bulk states should enrich the low-energy region ( [...] eV) of the absorption spectrum by strong absorption peaks. Analytical derivation of the numerically obtained selection rules was presented in 2011,.

The transient signal shows an opposite pump–probe excitation feature for the UV (307 nm) and the visible (615 nm) pulses at the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>polarization</b> {{in comparison with the}} signal obtained at the parallel polarization: The one-photon symmetry-forbidden process excited by the UV pulse is dominant at the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>polarization,</b> whereas the two-photon symmetry-allowed process initiated by the visible pulse prevails at the parallel polarization. At the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>polarization,</b> we found that the two C—N bonds of the molecule break in a stepwise manner, that is, the first C—N bond breaks in ≈ 70 fs followed by the second one in ≈ 100 fs, with the intermediate characterized. At the parallel polarization, the first C—N bond cleavage was found to occur in 100 fs with the intensity of the symmetry-allowed transition being one order of magnitude greater than the intensity of the symmetry-forbidden transition at the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>polarization.</b> Theoretical calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method have been carried out to characterize the potential energy surface for the ground state, the low-lying excited states, and the cationic ground state at various levels of theory. Combining the experimental and theoretical results, we identified the elementary steps in the mechanism: The initial driving force of the ultrafast bond-breaking process of trans-azomethane (at the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>polarization)</b> is due to the CNNC torsional motion initiated by the vibronic coupling through an intensity-borrowing mechanism for the symmetry-forbidden n–π^* transition. Following this torsional motion and the associated molecular symmetry breaking, an S_ 0 /S_ 1 conical intersection (CI) can be reached at a torsional angle of 93. 1 ° (predicted at the CASSCF(8, 7) /cc-pVDZ level of theory).
