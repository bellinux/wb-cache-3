The {{breakthrough}} flow of {{injected water}} and polymer caused by heterogeneous formation {{is a serious}} problem in many oil fields, and the problem has become an important restraint to oil development. The profile control and water shutoff plan is determined by experienced and subjective human judgments, the blocking agent selection and <b>plugging</b> <b>agent</b> dosage are lack of scientific basis.

40|$|Abstract: Under the {{constraints}} of high temperature and heterogeneity, the common profile control agent can not effec-tively plug the steam channeling. To address this issue, {{it is necessary to}} develop the high temperature resistance steam channeling <b>plugging</b> <b>agent</b> to improve the steam suction profile in the heavy oil reservoir. This paper used Simple Vari-able Method to optimize the content of the components of the high temperature resistant <b>plugging</b> <b>agent.</b> Static perform-ances evaluation aims to study the influence rules of the formation condition (temperature, salinity and pH value). Dy-namic evaluation is used to study its performance (plugging ratio, residual resistance factor, scouring resistance and ther-mal stability) in the sand-filled pipe to testify its applicability. The ratio of the component and the injection sequence are shown as follows: 0. 03 % coagulant + 2. 2 % cross-linking agent I + 1. 2 % cross-linking II + 6 % high efficient main agent. The evaluation experiment results show that the gel can resist at least 280 oC, the plugging ratio is above 93. 1 %. The plug-ging ratio only have a 8. 43 % reduction after scoured by 15 PV steam (280 oC). After a 10 -day thermal stability experiment (280 oC), the plugging ratio is still above 80 %.

30|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of methods}} to measure the {{temperature}} sensitivity of smart polymers. The most simple and commonly used method is to determine the light transmittances of a polymer solution at different temperatures (Feng et al. 2005; Kokufuta et al. 2012; Rwei and Nguyen 2014). When the temperature is lower than its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) value, the smart polymer is strongly hydrophilic. Its water solution is almost transparent, and the light transmittance is high. However, when the temperature is higher than its LCST value, the hydrophilicity of the smart polymer will be changed into hydrophobicity. At this time, micro-phase separation and turbidity will occur, so the light transmittance is almost zero. The curve of light transmittance as a function of temperature can be obtained after testing the light transmittances of the polymer solution at different temperatures. The temperature value corresponding to the inflection point of the curve is the LCST value of the polymer. That is the temperature corresponding to the light transmittance obviously declining. The temperature-sensitive behavior of polymer nanospheres (used as smart <b>plugging</b> <b>agents)</b> with different LCST values were acquired with an UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV- 1750, SHIMADZU International Trading Co., Ltd.).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Suizhong 361 {{offshore}} oilfield {{has applied}} polymer gel to profile control operations. With the continuous injection of the polymer gel, packers {{had not been}} put down {{in the whole of}} profile job because of the special situation of offshore oilfield. It has resulted that the polymer gel not only blocked layer segments of high permeability, but also blocked the rest lays. This situation makes the subsequent construction impossible and fails to reach the purpose of profile control. Therefore an effective blocking remover is necessary to break down reservoirs and open the low permeability layers, so that the polymer gel will be continued injecting into the reservoirs for subsequent construction. The purpose of profile will be achieved. Based on the actual blocking situation of Suizhong 361 oilfield, as well as the blockage removing mechanism of <b>plugging</b> removal <b>agent</b> and the profile control mechanism of polymer gel, a new <b>plugging</b> removal <b>agent</b> formula has been developed by screening and optimizing the type and mass concentration of blocking removal agent.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the article}} was to present an {{overview}} of the management strategies of dentin hypersensitivity (DHS) and summarize and discuss the therapeutic options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify articles dealing with dentin hypersensitivity prophylaxis and treatment. We focussed on meta-analyses of available or controlled clinical trials. RESULTS: DHS therapy should start with noninvasive individual prophylactic home-care approaches. In-office therapy follows with nerve desensitizing, precipitating, or <b>plugging</b> <b>agents.</b> If the hypersensitivity persists, depending on the hard and soft tissue components at reevaluation, i. e., presence or absence of cervical lesions and the gingival contour, adhesive restorations including sealing or mucogingival surgery may be an option.

As the placebo effect may play an important role, adequate patient management strategies and positive reinforcement may improve the management of DHS in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong maintenance under the premise of strict control of the causative factors is crucial in the management of DHS.

Therapy should not only focus on pain reduction or better elimination but also on the modification of the exposed cervical dentin area based on the defect type...|$|R

The design developed based on expert knowledge and model simulation covers all areas, including diagnosis to formation damage, acidizing formulation, acidizing technology, operation parameters, fluid discharge, yield increase ratio, and so on. The well was acidized according to the proposal; it achieved excellent performance. Prior to acidizing, the daily liquid production and oil production rates were 12.5 and 7.8  m 3 /day, respectively.

40|$|The {{problems}} of treatment in bronchopulmonary aspergillosis are discussed {{and illustrated by}} 11 case reports-four with aspergilloma, six with allergic aspergillosis, and two with probable allergic aspergillosis.

Steroidg improved ventilatory function and were effective in resolving and preventing further episodes of pulmonary eosinophilia, but not usually in clearing the fungus from the bronchial tree, probably because permanent damage had already been sustained; they also carry the theoretical risk of allowing fungal invasion.

In recent years, a number of chemical reactions and polymerization have been developed in microfluidic devices. The products in microfluidics have a better control over size, size distribution, morphology, and chemical composition. In this work, the poly (acrylamide-co-sodium acrylate) hydrogel micro-particles with enhanced properties were synthesized in the microfluidic device. We developed a simple experimental method (inverted-chip method) to synthesize the hydrogel micro-particles in the microfluidic device. The product micro-particles have a narrow size distribution; and their morphology is similar. The swelling property was controlled by varying the feed monomer composition and crosslinker concentration. As a result, the hydrogel micro-particles swell faster and larger than the bulk polymer. The volume swelling ratio depends on the crosslinker concentration and the ionic content in the polymer. A lower crosslinker concentration absorbs and retains more water than a higher crosslinker concentration. The high-ionic-content polymer micro-particles have a higher swelling ratio than do those with lower ionic content...|$|E

(1997) developed the pre-pad fluid of sulfite to preprocess the layer {{on the basis of the}} technology of in situ cross-linking polymer gel. In order to significantly improve the cross-linking time and the temperature resistance, Pu et al. (1997) introduced high temperature resistant monomer and low-grade aldehyde into the in situ cross-linking gel system. The result was that the cross-linking time was more than 20  h and the resistance temperature was more than 120  °C. Although the gel performance was improved, the amount of acrylamide monomer used in the gel system is more than 5  %. So its application was limited due to the high cost. By means of the idea of acid causing cross-linking reaction, Hou and Yue (2010) developed a <b>plugging</b> <b>agent</b> to control the gas channeling for CO 2 flooding. Its composition was 2  % acrylamide monomer and 5  % sodium silicate. Although this gel system sharply reduced the amount of acrylamide monomer, the mechanical strength was greatly reduced.

The relationship between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the biomass density within the sand was exponential, although two different exponential coefficients were needed to fit the data for biomass densities above or below 13 mg (wet weight) per cm 3, suggesting that two different clogging mechanisms may be involved in different ranges of biomass densities. The experimental results suggest that the SLI- strain was a poor clogging agent partly because of its lower yield coefficient relative to the limiting nutrient (oxygen) and partly because 60 % of the biomass produced in situ was washed out from the column, compared with only 1. 2 % in the case of Arthrobacter sp. strain AK 19...|$|E

30|$|In the {{development}} process of reservoirs with bottom water by horizontal wells, the nonuniform of water breakthrough time along horizontal wellbore is mainly caused by the wellbore pressure drop and the heterogeneity of the reservoir. As the duration of {{the development}}, once the bottom water intrudes, it is difficult to identify the breakthrough locations, which makes water plugging be one of the main obstacles of horizontal well technology. Up to now, studies on water plugging are mainly about bottom water coning mechanism (Recham et al. 2000; Wibowo et al. 2004; Erdal and Rajagopal 1989), plugging technics (Bond A et al. 1997; Zhou et al. 2011) and <b>plugging</b> <b>agent</b> (Zaitoun et al. 1999; Zhou et al. 2010). However, studies on identification of breakthrough locations are infrequent. At present, the main method of identifying the breakthrough locations is well logging, which is not only very expensive, but also difficult to operate (Li et al. 2005). Therefore, an economic and effective method of identifying the breakthrough locations is very helpful to the popularity of horizontal well technology. Water breakthrough along horizontal wellbore in reservoirs with bottom water is mainly affected by the distribution of vertical permeability. Bottom water breaks through earlier where high permeability channels exist. Therefore, the crux of water plugging is to plug the high permeability channels.|$|E
30|$|Different typical {{configurations}} of an emulsion may {{be categorized as}} O/W, W/O or a more complex dispersion. In complex dispersion phase a dispersed phase is embedded within each droplet already dispersed in a continuous phase, such as the case of oil-in-water-in-oil emulsions. In porous media, it is of great interest for petroleum engineers {{to know how the}} emulsions flow in porous media and the flow rate changes with pressure drop during flowing. Emulsions (O/W and W/O emulsions) are formed in situ under adequate conditions in porous media. A third component often present in an emulsion is an emulsifier or surfactant, which can reduce interfacial tension between liquids and can stabilize emulsions. In oil reservoirs, the added chemicals, or crude oil components such as asphaltenes, waxes, resins, and naphthenic acids act as emulsifying agents. These emulsifiers or stabilizers suppress the emulsion breakdown process (Fingas and Fieldhouse 2004). Many researchers carried out experimental investigation on injection of W/O or O/W emulsion as a selective <b>plugging</b> <b>agent</b> to improve oil recovery in water flooding (McAuliffe 1973 a, b; Thomas and Ali 1989). During alkali flooding, alkali can penetrate into heavy oil in porous media by the formation of W/O emulsions in situ. In this connection, rheological properties of emulsions {{play an important role in}} efficient oil recovery. Due to high viscosity of W/O emulsions, the resistance to water flow in high water saturation zones can be increased significantly to improve sweep efficiency and thus oil recovery. Most of the cases the power-law model is the simplest representation of the viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringUtilization of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) {{features}} {{is currently}} {{one of the}} most widely applied technologies for production of bitumen oil in Canadian oil sand fields. However, as in most oil and gas reservoirs, the bitumen oil reservoirs also differ depending on their reservoir structure; for the Surmont field case in Athabasca oil sands region, the lack of natural sealing and presence of overlying thief zones became a point of concern for a conventional application of the SAGD method. The conventional operational conditions of the SAGD process were considered to be less efficient or not applicable in the presence of the overlying thief zones and lack of natural barrier because of the potential energy losses from the steam chamber. There is also a high risk of the SAGD well pair shut-down due to influx of undesired fluids owing to pressure communication between the bitumen reservoir and the overlying gas and water zones. This work is done as a part of an ongoing research seeking to resolve the thief zone issue, and aims to (a) develop the main requirements for chemical isolation method for the Surmont field and (b) evaluate the wide range of possible isolation products in order to find the appropriate systems satisfying the established requirements. As a result of a literature review and communications with relevant technical experts, a preliminary screening was conducted by ranking the products based on their potential and possible technical restrictions for thief zone treatment. At this stage, products considered to having serious limitations for such treatment were eliminated from further evaluation. For example, cement was considered to having serious injectivity issues as result of particles size; simple inorganic salts not having enough plugging ability; and foam systems due to lack of yield strength. The few promising products (polymers, silicate, and epoxy resins) were chosen for a further experimental screening. Based on the criteria identified for an effective treatment of thief zones, relevant experimental tests assisted to narrow down the possible isolation products by eliminating the aqueous gel systems (silicates and polymers) due to their instability at high temperatures. The experimental results indicated that the epoxy system is the most effective <b>plugging</b> <b>agent.</b> The laboratory findings also showed that the initially perceived epoxy system injectivity limitations can be resolved by a proper formulation of the epoxy components and relevant solvents. 2014 - 06 - 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a basic agent calculus, {{equality}} often {{links the}} agents which {{provide the same}} external behaviour in any context. Since the universe of agents and the universe of contexts depend on the used action set, equality depends a priori on this set of actions. We show here that if we select from the universe of agents, two agents which are equal, they are also equal if we extend the universe of actions (and consequently if we extend the universe of agents and contexts). 1. Introduct ion We want to define two CCS agents as equal if they can replace each other in any context and give systems whose behaviours are externally equivalent. A good candidate for equality is the weak bisimilarity relation [Par 81, Mi 189], but it is known that, due to the summation operator, weak bisimilarity is not a congruence. Since a context {{is a kind of}} expression from the calculus, it depends on the set of actions and with such a definition we can wonder whether these agents are still equal if we <b>plug</b> the <b>agents</b> into a wider expression set. We show below that, fortunately, equality is preserved by the extension of the set of actions. To obtain this result without restr ict ions, we have extended a standard proposition which links equality to rooted bisimulation.

3000|$|At present, {{shale gas}} {{exploration}} and production has attracted much attention. Given its accumulation characteristics, extended-reach horizontal wells and cluster horizontal wells were drilled to produce shale gas. Because {{of the existence of}} micro-fissures and strong water sensitivity in shale formations, severe wellbore instability often occurs in the long horizontal sections, which seriously restricts the process of shale gas exploration and development (Cui et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013). Shale formation is mainly composed of hard brittle shale, mainly of illite and mixed layer illite/smectite. For hard brittle shales, pore pressure transmission is the primary cause of wellbore instability. Therefore, the key to maintaining wellbore stability is to prevent pore pressure transmission. The effective sealing of micropores and micro-fissures is of great significance for preventing pore pressure transmission. Traditional <b>plugging</b> <b>agents</b> are difficult to form effective mud cake to prevent liquid penetration into shale matrix which has extremely low permeability and tiny pore throats. In recent years, nanoparticles are found to effectively plug shale pore throats to prevent liquid penetration into the formation, thus maintaining wellbore stability and protecting the reservoir (Roshan and Aghighi 2012; Rafieepour et al. 2013; Wen et al. 2014). According to previous experimental results, silica nanoparticles could significantly improve the densification of mud cakes, slow down pressure transmission and reduce shale permeability, while the rheology and lubrication of water-based drilling fluid were improved (Cai et al. 2012; Hoelscher et al. 2012; Al-Baghli et al. 2015). Bai and Pu (2010) synthesized PMMA latex nanoparticles with an average size of 73  nm, which {{can be used as a}} lubricant in drilling fluids based on their “ball bearing” function to prevent pipe sticking. They can also be used as a filtration reducer based on its deformability under temperature and pressure, forming a tough filter cake and sealing the micro-fissures in the formations drilled. Qu et al. (2007) synthesized intercalated or exfoliated nanocomposite poly(styrene-b-acrylamide)/bentonite using reversible addition-fragmented chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Experiments showed that these products had high-temperature tolerance and were good filtration control agents. In the last 20  years, the investigation into nanomaterials has greatly developed in many fields. Great progress has been made in basic theory and application of nanooptical materials, nanosemiconductor materials, nanobiomedical materials, nanoenhanced materials, nanomodified surface, etc. (Lin et al. 2012; Cormick and Hunter 2014; Kearnes et al. 2014). The combination of smart polymers with environmental response behavior (temperature, pH value, electrolyte concentration, magnetic field strength, electric field strength, etc.) and nanoparticles to realize the potential of nanoparticles is the most common research (Wu et al. 2013; Gulfam and Chung 2014; Lian et al. 2015). In this study, nanomaterials technology, smart polymers, and drilling fluid technology were combined. Emulsifier-free poly(methyl methacrylate–styrene) [P(MMA–St)] nanospheres [...] with an average particle size of about 100  nm were synthesized in an isopropyl alcohol–water medium by the solvothermal method. Then, the thermo-sensitive smart polymer P(NIPAm–AA) was modified onto the surface of P(MMA–St) nanospheres and thermo-sensitive smart nanoparticles were obtained. With the change in temperature, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface would change accordingly. Moreover, we would adjust the transformation temperature of NIPAm by an introduction of hydrophilic monomer or hydrophobic monomer, getting smart nanoparticles with different transformation temperatures to adapt to shale formations with different temperatures.|$|R

However, as in most oil and gas reservoirs, the bitumen oil reservoirs also differ depending on their reservoir structure; for the Surmont field case in Athabasca oil sands region, the lack of natural sealing and presence of overlying thief zones became a point of concern for a conventional application of the SAGD method. The conventional operational conditions of the SAGD process were considered to be less efficient or not applicable in the presence of the overlying thief zones and lack of natural barrier because of the potential energy losses from the steam chamber. There is also a high risk of the SAGD well pair shut-down due to influx of undesired fluids owing to pressure communication between the bitumen reservoir and the overlying gas and water zones. This work is done as a part of an ongoing research seeking to resolve the thief zone issue, and aims to (a) develop the main requirements for chemical isolation method for the Surmont field and (b) evaluate the wide range of possible isolation products in order to find the appropriate systems satisfying the established requirements. As a result of a literature review and communications with relevant technical experts, a preliminary screening was conducted by ranking the products based on their potential and possible technical restrictions for thief zone treatment. At this stage, products considered to having serious limitations for such treatment were eliminated from further evaluation. For example, cement was considered to having serious injectivity issues as result of particles size; simple inorganic salts not having enough plugging ability; and foam systems due to lack of yield strength. The few promising products (polymers, silicate, and epoxy resins) were chosen for a further experimental screening. Based on the criteria identified for an effective treatment of thief zones, relevant experimental tests assisted to narrow down the possible isolation products by eliminating the aqueous gel systems (silicates and polymers) due to their instability at high temperatures. The experimental results indicated that the epoxy system is the most effective <b>plugging</b> <b>agent.</b> The laboratory findings also showed that the initially perceived epoxy system injectivity limitations can be resolved by a proper formulation of the epoxy components and relevant solvents...|$|E
40|$|The {{applications}} of analytical techniques to evaluate solute-ligand interactions and to analyze microbiological samples {{are discussed in}} this work. The dissertation is organized into two sections based on the natural division of studies {{done in the past}} several years. Part I includes studies involving the estimation of binding constants and partition coefficients and the modeling of pseudophase gas-liquid chromatography. The binding of solutes to pseudophases, such as micelles and cyclodextrins, is an important phenomenon in numerous areas of chemistry. Here, the ability of various native and derivatized cyclodextrins to sequester oral malodorous compounds and other volatile solutes was examined by measuring their association constants. Numerous techniques were utilized to determine the solute-cyclodextrin affinities. The results {{of this study indicate that}} cyclodextrins are capable of binding with a wide variety of oral malodorous compounds to varying degrees. The equations used in this study were then developed further and applied to the separation of several enantiomers using a methylated-cyclodextrin/polysiloxane stationary phase. These calculations allow the contributions from all three solute equilibria to retention and selectivity to be measured. This work was then extended to micellar/ionic liquid gas-liquid chromatography stationary phases, and the Abraham solvation parameter model was used in order to deconvolute the types of interactions responsible for analyte partitioning to these two phases. Part II of this dissertation focuses on the work done on the development of a rapid capillary electrophoretic sterility test. This technique coalesces all cells in a sample into a single peak and removes them from potential interferences in the sample matrix. Cationic surfactants were used in the run buffer to impart charge onto the microorganisms and sweep them out of the sample zone, while a <b>plug</b> of blocking <b>agent</b> induced cellular aggregation and negated the cells 2 ̆ 7 electrophoretic mobility. A wide variety of bacteria are compatible with this method, and analysis times are typically less than 10 minutes. Single cell detection was accomplished via laser-induced fluorescence detection and fluorescent cell staining. By coupling this capillary electrophoresis method with fluorescence in situ hybridization, a method that utilizes fluorescently tagged nucleic acid probes to selectively stain specific microorganism species or classes, identification of microbial contaminants was achieved...|$|R
