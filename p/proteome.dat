5|$|The genome size, and {{the number}} of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms. The {{smallest}} genomes occur in viruses (which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes), and viroids (which act as a single non-coding RNA gene). Conversely, plants can have extremely large genomes, with rice containing >46,000 protein-coding genes. The total number of protein-coding genes (the Earth's <b>proteome)</b> is estimated to be 5million sequences.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} to identify infectious diseases such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir <b>proteome,</b> bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} histidine-rich {{proteins}} (HRPs) {{have been found}} in microorganisms. We systematically analyzed the <b>proteomes</b> of 675 prokaryotes including 52 archaea and 623 bacteria for histidine-rich motifs (HRMs). We show that HRPs are widespread in prokaryotic <b>proteomes,</b> with the majority being involved in metal homeostasis. HRPs are frequently found in the <b>proteomes</b> of certain orders of rhizobia and pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, but are essentially absent in obligate intracellular pathogenic species. The occurrence of HRPs in the <b>proteomes</b> of prokaryotes is related to their habitats. We further revealed a class of globally histidine-rich bacterial proteins. This approach can readily be used to identify other single amino acid rich motifs (and proteins) in microbial <b>proteomes</b> to facilitate the exploration of their functions. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

5|$|Proteins are {{the chief}} actors within the cell, {{said to be}} {{carrying}} out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its <b>proteome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the <b>proteome</b> and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human <b>proteome</b> may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E

5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its <b>proteome,</b> and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is a study by Washburn, Wolters, & Yates in which they used shotgun {{proteomics}} on the <b>proteome</b> of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain grown to mid-log phase.

A full range of strategies has been proposed {{to increase the number of}} identified proteins and to characterize their post-translational modifications. The protocols are still improving to enlarge the coverage of cell wall <b>proteomes.</b> Comparisons between these <b>proteomes</b> have been done based on various working strategies or different physiological stages. In this review, two points are highlighted. The first point is related to data analysis with an overview of the cell wall <b>proteomes</b> already described. A large body of data is now available with the description of cell wall <b>proteomes</b> of seventeen plant species. CWP contents exhibit particularities in relation to the major differences in cell wall composition and structure between these plants and between plant organs. The second point is related to methodology and concerns the present limitations of the coverage of cell wall <b>proteomes.</b> Because of the variety of cell wall structures and of the diversity of protein/polysaccharide and protein/protein interactions in cell walls, some CWPs can be missing either because they are washed out during the purification of cell walls or because they are covalently linked to cell wall components...|$|R

25|$|Thanks {{to rapid}} {{advances}} in proteomics, genomics, and bioinformatics, protease {{research has been}} revolutionized. Degradomics emerged with the concept that proteolysis represents a specific mechanism for achieving cellular control over vital processes beyond control afforded by gene expression and translation and continues to produce the research necessary to understand the complex regulation of biology. Where it was thought extracellular proteases degraded extracellular matrix (ECM), these proteases are now known to target and process {{a vast array of}} substrates with diverse roles, redefining protease functions and leading to a shift in interest towards new roles previously unknown to biology.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{discovery}} of giant viruses with genome and physical size comparable to cellular organisms, remnants of protein translation machinery and virus-specific parasites (virophages) have raised intriguing {{questions about their}} origin. Evidence advocates for their inclusion into global phylogenomic studies and their consideration as a distinct and ancient form of life. Results Here we reconstruct phylogenies describing the evolution of <b>proteomes</b> and protein domain structures of cellular organisms and double-stranded DNA viruses with medium-to-very-large <b>proteomes</b> (giant viruses). Trees of <b>proteomes</b> define viruses as a ‘fourth supergroup’ along with superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Trees of domains indicate they have evolved via massive and primordial reductive evolutionary processes. The distribution of domain structures suggests giant viruses harbor {{a significant number of}} protein domains including those with no cellular representation. The genomic and structural diversity embedded in the viral <b>proteomes</b> is comparable to the cellular <b>proteomes</b> of organisms with parasitic lifestyles. Since viral domains are widespread among cellular species, we propose that viruses mediate gene transfer between cells and crucially enhance biodiversity. Conclusions Results call for a change in the way viruses are perceived. They likely represent a distinct form of life that either predated or coexisted with the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and constitute a very crucial part of our planet’s biosphere. </p...|$|R

25|$|Every genome sequenced {{plays an}} {{important}} role in identifying genes that have been gained or lost over time. Comparative genomic studies allow for comparison of eukaryotic genomes.

Our analysis reveals a significant decreasing trend of the overall b-aggregation tendency with increasing organism complexity and longevity. A comparison with randomized <b>proteomes</b> shows that natural <b>proteomes</b> have a higher degree of polarization in both low and high b-aggregation prone sequences. The former originates from the requirement of intrinsically disordered proteins, whereas the latter originates from the necessity of proteins with a stable folded structure...|$|R
40|$|Chemical probes {{have great}} {{potential}} for identifying functional residues in proteins in crude <b>proteomes.</b> Here we studied labeling sites of chemical probes based on sulfonyl fluorides (SFs) on plant and animal <b>proteomes.</b> Besides serine proteases and many other proteins, SF-based probes label Tyr residues in glutathione transferases (GSTs). The labeled GSTs represent four different GST classes that share less than 30 % sequence identity. The targeted Tyr residues are located at similar positions in the promiscuous substrate binding site and are essential for GST function. The high selectivity of SF-based probes for functional Tyr residues in GSTs illustrates how these probes {{can be used for}} functional studies of GSTs and other proteins in crude <b>proteomes...</b>|$|R

Additional low-abundance lumenal proteins can be predicted through computational methods. Of the thylakoid proteins with known functions, 42% are involved in photosynthesis. The next largest functional groups include proteins involved in protein targeting, processing and folding with 11%, oxidative stress response (9%) and translation (8%).|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{proteins}} {{which have}} hydrophobic surfaces, are relatively flexible and are expressed at relatively low levels. This creates difficulties in obtaining enough protein and then growing crystals. Hence, despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins, determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins {{is more difficult}} than globular proteins. As of January 2013 less than 0.1% of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20-30% of the total <b>proteome.</b> Due to this difficulty {{and the importance of}} this class of proteins methods of protein structure prediction based on hydropathy plots, the positive inside rule and other methods have been developed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} designed at further elucidating protease {{activity is}} Proteomic Identification of protease Cleavage Sites (PICS). Beginning with a peptide library generated from endopeptidase digestion of a <b>proteome,</b> this technique allows for screening and characterizing the prime- and non-prime specificity for proteases. After digestion, primary amines and sulfhydryl are chemically blocked before digesting the sample {{again with the}} desired protease. Now, protease generated primary amines that constitute the prime site of cleavage can be biotinylated and isolated due to their reactivity and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Non-prime sides sequences left behind must be determined using bioinformatics analysis of the extracted N-termini and full length protein sequences. These prime and non-prime sites give a full picture of protease cleavage site specificity.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{analysis}} of milk and milk fermented drink <b>proteomes</b> with the use of 2 D electrophoresis.

Our results showed that milk and milk fermented drink <b>proteomes</b> consisted of 118 and 121 spots, respectively. The computer analysis revealed the identity of 95 spots in both <b>proteomes.</b> Non-identical spots indicated the changes resulting from the action of bacterial proteinases on milk proteins during the production of milk fermented drink. Proteolytic starter cultures applied to produce the milk fermented drink led to a partial hydrolysis of milk proteins to peptides and free amino acid residues. Results obtained led to confirm the suitability of 2 D electrophoresis to observe the changes in the <b>proteomes</b> of milk products, as well as other food products after the application of technological processes.

The effective way to overcome the complexity of these <b>proteomes</b> is to combine several fractionation steps. OFFGEL fractionation, recently developed by Agilent Technologies, provides the ability to pre-fractionate peptides into discrete liquid fractions and demonstrated high efficiency and repeatability necessary {{for the analysis of}} such complex <b>proteomes.</b> Results We evaluated OFFGEL fractionator technology to separate peptides from two complex <b>proteomes,</b> human secretome and human plasma, using a 24 -wells device encompassing the pH range 3 – 10. In combination with reverse phase liquid chromatography, peptides from these two samples were separated and identified by MALDI TOF-TOF. The repartition profiles of the peptides in the different fractions were analyzed and explained by their content in charged amino acids using an algorithmic model based on the possible combinations of amino acids. We also demonstrated {{for the first time the}} compatibility of OFFGEL separation technology with the quantitative proteomic labeling technique iTRAQ allowing inclusion of this technique in complex samples comparative proteomic workflow. Conclusion The reported data showed that OFFGEL system provides a highly valuable tool to fractionate peptides from complex eukaryotic <b>proteomes</b> (plasma and secretome) and is compatible with iTRAQ labeling quantitative studies. We therefore consider peptides OFFGEL fractionation as an effective addition to our strategy and an important system for quantitative proteomics studies. </p...|$|R
