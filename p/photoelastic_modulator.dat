50|$|A <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> (PEM) is {{an optical}} device used to {{modulate}} the polarization {{of a light}} source. The photoelastic effect is used to change the birefringence of the optical element in the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PEM {{was first}} invented by J. Badoz in the 1960s and {{originally}} called a [...] "birefringence modulator." [...] It was initially developed for physical measurements including optical rotary dispersion and Faraday rotation, polarimetry of astronomical objects, strain-induced birefringence, and ellipsometry. Later developers of the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> include J.C Kemp, S.N Jasperson and S.E Schnatterly.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} of a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> {{consists}} of a piezoelectric transducer and a half wave resonant bar; the bar being a transparent material (now most commonly fused silica). The transducer is tuned to the natural frequency of the bar. This resonance modulation results in highly sensitive polarization measurements. The fundamental vibration of the optic is along its longest dimension.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} polarimetric imaging, now {{undergoing}} development, {{involves the use}} of two <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> in series, driven at equal amplitude but at different frequencies. The net effect on a beam of light is to cause (1) the direction of its polarization to rotate at the average of two excitation frequencies and (2) the amplitude of its polarization to be modulated at the beat frequency (the difference between the two excitation frequencies). The resulting modulated optical light beam is made to pass through a polarizing filter and is detected at the beat frequency, which can be chosen to equal the frame rate of an electronic camera or the rate of sampling the outputs of photodetectors in an array. The method was conceived to satisfy a need to perform highly accurate polarimetric imaging, without cross-talk between polarization channels, at frame rates of the order of tens of hertz. The use of electro-optical modulators is necessitated by a need to obtain accuracy greater than that attainable by use of static polarizing filters over separate fixed detectors. For imaging, <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> are preferable to such other electrio-optical modulators as Kerr cells and Pockels cells in that <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> operate at lower voltages, have greater angular acceptances, and are easier to use. Prior to the conception of the present method, polarimetric imaging at frame rates of tens of hertz using <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> was not possible because the resonance frequencies of <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> usually lie in the range from about 20 to about 100 kHz...|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> {{is based on}} the photoelastic effect, in which a mechanically stressed sample exhibits birefringence proportional to the resulting strain. <b>Photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> are resonant devices where the precise oscillation frequency is determined by the properties of the optical element/transducer assembly. The transducer is tuned to the resonance frequency of the optical element along its long dimension, determined by its length and the speed of sound in the material. A current is then sent through the transducer to vibrate the optical element through stretching and compressing which changes the birefringence of the transparent material. Because of this resonant character, the birefringence of the optical element can be modulated to large amplitudes, but also by the same reason, the operation of a PEM is limited to a single frequency, and most commercial devices manufactured today operate at about 50 kHz.|$|R

50|$|If {{the signal}} is either slowly varying or {{otherwise}} constant (essentially a DC signal), then 1/f noise typically overwhelms the signal. It may then {{be necessary to}} use external means to modulate the signal. For example, when detecting a small light signal against a bright background, the signal can be modulated either by a chopper wheel, acousto-optical modulator, <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> at a large enough frequency so that 1/f noise drops off significantly, and the lock-in amplifier is referenced to the operating frequency of the modulator. In {{the case of an}} atomic-force microscope, to achieve nanometer and piconewton resolution, the cantilever position is modulated at a high frequency, to which the lock-in amplifier is again referenced.|$|E
5000|$|This {{signal is}} often {{presented}} {{as a function of}} wavelength λ, temperature T or magnetic field H. MCD spectrometers can simultaneously measure absorbance and ΔA along the same light path. This eliminates error introduced through multiple measurements or different instruments that previously occurred before this advent.The MCD spectrometer example shown below begins with a light source that emits a monochromatic wave of light. This wave is passed through a Rochon prism linear polarizer, which separates the incident wave into two beams that are linearly polarized by 90 degrees. The two beams follow different paths- one beam (the extraordinary beam) traveling directly to a photomultiplier (PMT), and the other beam (the ordinary beam) passing through a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> (PEM) oriented at 45 degrees to the direction of the ordinary ray polarization. The PMT for the extraordinary beam detects the light intensity of the input beam. The PEM is adjusted to cause an alternating plus and minus 1/4 wavelength shift of one of the two orthogonal components of the ordinary beam. This modulation converts the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light at the peaks of the modulation cycle. Linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circular components with intensity represented as ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{calibration}} method for a <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> is proposed. The calibration includes a coarse calibration {{and a fine}} calibration. In the coarse calibration, the peak retardation of the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> is set near 1. 841 rad. In the fine calibration, {{the value of the}} zeroth Bessel function is obtained. The zeroth Bessel function is approximated as a linear equation to directly calculate the peak retardation. In experiments, the usefulness of the {{calibration method}} is verified and the calibration error is less than 0. 014 rad.

These experiments showed calibration graphs that are linear bit do not pass through the graph origin. A second ''multiple pass'' experiment with laser light of a single wavelength, performed on the calcium fluoride PEM, demonstrates the linearity of the PEM electronics. This implies that the calibration behavior results from intrinsic physical properties of the PEM optical element material.

Under NASA's Instrument Incubator Program, we are developing an electro-optic imaging approach that will enable adding high-accuracy polarimetry to such observations. To achieve a degree of linear polarization (DOLP) uncertainty of 0. 5 %, our approach temporally modulates the linear-polarization component of incoming light at a rapid rate, enabling each detector within a focal-plane array, combined with polarization analyzers, to measure the relative proportions of the linear Stokes components Q or U to the total intensity.

In this paper, we envision a new generation of spaceborne imager that integrates the unique strengths of multispectral, multiangle, and polarimetric approaches, thereby achieving better accuracies in aerosol optical depth and particle properties than can be achieved using any one method by itself. Design goals include spectral coverage from the near-UV to the shortwave infrared; global coverage within a few days; intensity and polarimetric imaging simultaneously at multiple view angles; kilometer to sub-kilometer spatial resolution; and measurement of the degree of linear polarization for a subset of the spectral complement with an uncertainty of 0. 5 % or less. The latter requirement is technically the most challenging. In particular, an approach for dealing with inter-detector gain variations is essential to avoid false polarization signals. We propose using rapid modulation of the input polarization state to overcome this problem, using a high-speed variable retarder in the camera design.

40|$|JPL is {{currently}} developing the multi-angle spectro-polarimetric imager (MSPI), targeted for the Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) mission, {{as defined in}} the National Academies 2007 Decadal Survey. In preparation for the space instrument, the MSPI team has built two incremental camera systems (Ground- and Air-MSPI) to improve understanding of the proposed architecture. Ground-MSPI is a gimballed instrument used primarily for stationary observation and characterization of the imager and optics. The ER- 2 based Air-MSPI operates in a step-and-stare mode, providing multi-angle imaging of a static target. This mode-of-operation simulates the observation scenario of the space instrument. Physically, MSPI is a pushbroom camera with a specialized frontend. Before imaging, light entering the camera passes through a pair of <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> {{and a set of}} pattern polarizers.

Calculating polarimetric parameters from the imager's data stream requires a real-time least-squares computation that produces coefficients of a truncated time-series expansion of the image. As reported in, the data processing algorithm can operate in real-time on a Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA. Moving beyond verification with an onboard data source, the algorithm has been validated on a commercial development board interfaced with the ground camera.

Low Verdet constant glass is used for all optical elements near the DIII-D vessel to minimize the effects of Faraday rotation caused by stray magnetic fields. Before entering the fiber optics, the light passes through two crossed (45 degrees) <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> (PEM) and a linear polarizer, which convert the various polarization states into an intensity modulated signal at the fundamental and 2 nd harmonic of the PEM frequencies.

The instrument consists of two polarizer-photoelastic modulator pairs, one operating as the polarization state generator and the other as the polarization state detector. Each <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> operates at a different remnant frequency (such as 50 kHz and 60 kHz), {{making it possible to}} measure eight elements of the reduced sample Mueller matrix simultaneously. In certain configurations, light reflection from non-depolarizing anisotropic samples can be completely characterized by a single measurement, and the entire reduced Jones matrix can be determined, including the cross polarization coefficients. The calibration of the instrument involves the measurement of the azimuthal angle of the polarizer with respect to the modulator, the modulation amplitude, and the modulator strain for each polarizer <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulator</b> pair, where the last two are functions of wavelengths. In addition, it is essential to calibrate the azimuthal angles of the polarization state generator and the polarization state detector with respect to the plane of incidence in the ellipsometry configuration that is used in the measurements.

The {{light in the}} optical system is subjected to a complex modulation designed to make the overall system robust against many instrumental artifacts that have plagued such measurements in the past. This scheme involves two <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> that are beating in a carefully selected pattern against each other. In order to properly sample this modulation pattern, each of the proposed nine cameras in the system needs to read out its imager array about 1, 000 times per second. The onboard processing required to compress this data involves least-squares fits (LSFs) of Bessel functions to data from every pixel in realtime, thus requiring an onboard computing system with advanced data processing capabilities in excess of those commonly available for space flight.

The scheme of setup {{was described in}} detail in [34]. The MPS technique is based on modulation of polarization state of electromagnetic radiation, when the orthogonal components of linearly polarized waves (perpendicular (s) and parallel (p)) polarizations are alternately transformed at a constant intensity, frequency, phase, and wave vector. A diffraction monochromator MDR- 4 (with a halogen tube KGM- 150 at the input and Franck-Ritter polarizer at the output) served {{as a source of}} spectral radiation within the wavelength range λ[*]=[*] 400 – 1000  nm. A <b>photoelastic</b> polarization <b>modulator</b> (PEPM) acted as a dynamic phase plate. Alternating phase incursion was caused by compression/expansion of the quartz plate. A quarter-wave mode was selected by a proper supplying voltage. As a result, linear polarization was transformed into alternating right-to-left circular polarization. A stationary quarter-wave phase plate (PP) was placed after the PEPM. By rotating PP around the optical axis, a position of PP was selected at which polarization azimuths of radiation after PP alternated between parallel and perpendicular positions relative to the incident plane (p- and s-polarization, respectively). The output radiation was directed at a photodetector PD (silicon photodiode). Reflected light was a measure of the difference of orthogonally polarized intensities, which was transformed by a PD into alternating signal.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} measure polarization {{changes at the}} part-per-million (ppm) level enables {{a wide variety of}} astronomical and defense-related programs, as light reflected by any medium tends to impart polarization. For instance, multi-wavelength, optical studies of Jupiter-sized planets around other stars may probe their atmospheres and eventually surfaces, even though the measurements are contaminated by 100, 000 times as many stellar photons as planetary ones. Additionally, our pilot study of resident space objects suggests that potentially game-changing results may occur if polarization is calibrated to a high degree. We have developed the POLISH 2 aperture-integrated, ground-based optical polarimeter at the Lick Observatory Shane 3 -m telescope using two <b>photoelastic</b> <b>modulators</b> instead of conventional, rotating waveplates. This instrument measures AC-coupled intensity variations from 10 - 100 kHz due to the resonant modulators. Measurements of both strongly (0. 1 %- 1 %, or 1, 000 - 10, 000 ppm) and weakly polarized calibrator stars (0. 0001 %- 0. 001 %, or 1 - 10 ppm) are necessary to calibrate for instrumental orientation and telescope-induced polarization, respectively. Since stellar polarization is due to scattering of starlight by intervening dust particles, stellar distance is linearly proportional to stellar polarization. While strongly polarized stars abound in astronomical stellar catalogs, such catalogs are incomplete below 0. 01 %- 0. 1 % polarization. This is because 1) conventional polarimeters are limited to ~ 0. 01 % accuracy due to linear to circular polarization conversion in waveplates, and 2) unpolarized stars, necessarily bright, tend to saturate on conventional waveplate / CCD instruments. POLISH 2, being designed to observe Venus and the Crab Pulsar (apparent visual magnitude ranges between - 4 and 16, or a factor of 108 in dynamic range) with photon-limited sensitivity, is uniquely suited to measure stellar polarization to the ppm level. We have used the Lick Observatory 1 -m telescope to perform a survey of bright stars to identify nearly unpolarized calibrator stars. Laboratory calibration of POLISH 2 is quite difficult, as the linear (LP) and circular polarization (CP) of even a bare, incandescent bulb with no reimaging optics is found to be LP = 0. 67520 % +/- 0. 00054 % and CP = - 0. 08643 +/- 0. 00028 %. Propagating the bulb through two collimating and focusing lenses, we measure LP = 3. 0319 +/- 0. 0032 % and CP = - 0. 36029 +/- 0. 00033 %. Thus, propagation of light through lenses introduces both linear and circular polarization due to static stress frozen into the lens via the annealing process. Even linear film polarizers are found to be non-ideal, as they appear to introduce circular polarization with 2 - 3 % amplitude depending on the rotational orientation of the linear polarizer. We find that integrating spheres reduce bulb polarization to LP = 0. 02 %- 0. 05 % (200 - 500 ppm) and CP = 0. 001 %- 0. 002 % (10 - 20 ppm), with larger spheres producing weaker polarization. Finally, cavity blackbodies are found to present the weakest linear polarization, with LP ~ 0. 01 % and |CP| ~ 0. 01 % (100 ppm) for two separate blackbodies. These measurements show that the best sources for ultra-high accuracy polarimetric calibration are stars themselves...|$|R
