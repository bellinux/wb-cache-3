40|$|This paper {{deals with}} micro-teaching as a {{possibility}} for combining theory and practice during the studies of future teachers of German. One of the key elements for combining theory and practice is pedagogical <b>practicums</b> in primary and secondary schools. From students’ reflections on their <b>practicums,</b> {{we have seen that}} it is very difficult for students to put their theoretical knowledge into practice. In order to alleviate initial difficulties and the anxiety future teachers face, we have implemented a specific micro-teaching model at the Department of German, Dutch and Swedish; students in the second year of the MA-level pedagogical stream participated in the model. The students’ self-evaluation on the effects of micro-learning showed it to be a useful model for obtaining their first pedagogical experience because it allows students, through reflection and feedback from their didactics teachers and from their fellow students, to become aware of the didactic and methodological principles of modern foreign language teaching and thus to be better prepared for their teaching <b>practicums...</b>|$|R

All other courses in the 2L year are electives and commonly include corporate law and tax law as well as many other classes and seminars. Since establishing the practice-based curriculum, W incorporated its experiential curricular offerings, such as <b>practicum</b> courses, into the second-year in addition to casebook-oriented electives.|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot study}} investigates how some pre-service teachers’ and their {{university}} supervisors and school-based teacher mentors - view pre-service teachers’ school-based training (<b>practicums)</b> in Turkey and England. In the liminal social spaces of <b>practicums,</b> pre-service teachers begin their transformation into serving teachers (Shields, 2003, 12 – 13) in particular policy and socio-cultural contexts. <b>Practicums</b> allow pre-service teachers to observe established teachers at work, prepare instructional materials {{adapted to the}} learning needs of particular students, teach groups of students, and {{begin to understand the}} complexities of working in schools. However, as their social knowledge of practice, power and culture in schools lacks sophistication (Pierce, 2007) this is challenging even with the help of school-based teacher mentors who are often reported as being crucial (Wilkins and Lall, 2010). School-based teacher mentors complement university-based tutors in helping pre-service teachers understand the practice of being a teacher in part by helping them to reflect on their experiences (Lucas, 1999 in Myles et al., 2006). Teacher educators need to understand how pre-service teachers experience the formal and informal processes of <b>practicums</b> to prepare them for that and how these can be ameliorated by the actions of their critical friends(Golby and Appleby, 1996). We are grateful to the College of Social Sciences, University of Leicester, for making available to us a small amount of funding during the year 2010 - 2011 without which this pilot project would not have possible.

25|$|In the United States, art {{therapists}} {{may become}} Registered (ATR) or Board Certified (ATR-BC) (Source: http://www.atcb.org/Public/AboutTheCredentials).
