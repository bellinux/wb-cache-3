50|$|<b>Film</b> <b>embossing</b> is a {{mechanical}} {{process in which}} a flat film is transformed into an embossed product. During the process, thermal and stress fields are applied to the polymer, causing changes in the microstructure and physical dimensions of the material. The engineering analysis of the process requires the study of various aspects relating to the characterization of the microstructure before and after embossing, A variety of techniques were employed to characterize the properties and microstructure of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film</b> in relation to crystallinity, orientation, mechanical properties, and dimensions of the <b>embossed</b> <b>films.</b> The thermal treatment of the polymer film was shown {{to be the most}} significant factor in the process. By controlling the thermal treatment of the film, it is possible to manipulate the properties and dimensions of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b> The important aspects: influencing thermal treatment include the radiation heater temperature, preheat roll temperature, line velocity, and film thickness. The initial <b>film</b> orientation and <b>embossing</b> pressure have a minor effect on the final properties of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b> The main effect of the embossing pressure is on the bulk thickness of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b>|$|R

When several <b>embossed</b> <b>films</b> are stacked to form a compound film (C) they are arranged so that the steps of successive films (A,B) are not aligned with one another, for facilitating cutting of compound film into individual elements. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a compound film is also included. USE - The <b>embossed</b> <b>film</b> is used in a compound film for an electrochemical or electrochromic element, e. g. a film-based battery.

40|$|Abstract: Embossed TiO 2 {{thin films}} with high surface areas are {{achieved}} using soft-templates composed of monolayer polystyrene beads. The form of {{links between the}} beads in the templates is controlled by varying the O 2 plasma etching time on the templates, resulting in various templates with close-linked, nano-linked, and isolated beads. Room-temperature deposition of TiO 2 on the plasma-treated templates and calcination at 550 ℃ result in <b>embossed</b> <b>films</b> with tailored links between anatase TiO 2 hollow hemispheres. Although all the <b>embossed</b> <b>films</b> have similar surface areas, the sensitivity of films with nano-linked TiO 2 hollow hemispheres to 500 ppm CO and ethanol gases are much {{higher than that of}} films with close-linked and isolated hollow hemispheres, and the detection limits of them are as low as 0. 6 ppm for CO and 0. 1 ppm for ethanol. The strong correlation of sensitivity with the form of links between hollow hemispheres reveals the critical role of potential barriers formed at the links. The facile, large-scale, and on-chip fabrication of <b>embossed</b> TiO 2 <b>films</b> with nano-linked hollow hemispheres on Si substrate and the high sensitivity without the aid of additives give us a sustainable competitiv...|$|R
