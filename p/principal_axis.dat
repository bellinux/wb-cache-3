25|$|The singular-value {{decomposition}} {{was originally}} developed by differential geometers, {{who wished to}} determine whether a real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on. Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the bilinear forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular-value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix A. The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the polar decomposition. The first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> transformation for Hermitian matrices.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{generally}} {{observed that the}} stress state induced through traffic loads inside the substructure of pavements cannot be exactly reproduced in laboratory element tests. Moreover, there are not sufficient studies that examine the behavior of granular material under unsaturated conditions, although such conditions are very prevalent in pavement structures. In this research, an attempt is made to determine the cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of unsaturated granular base course material, and to {{examine the effect of}} the rotation of the <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> (experienced by pavement elements under traffic loads) on the mechanical behavior of unsaturated granular base course material by applying various loading methods. A series of laboratory element tests using a multi-ring shear apparatus, which can take into account the rotation of the <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis,</b> were carried out on granular base course material under different moisture contents. The experimental results show that the moisture content has an obvious effect on both the shear behavior and the cyclic plastic deformation of granular base course material. However, the moisture content for the maximum deformation of granular base course material varies according to the loading method. It is also explained that cyclic plastic deformation considerably increases due to the rotation of the <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> under repeated axial and shear loading tests. Therefore, the <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> rotation has a significant influence on the cyclic plastic deformation of unsaturated granular base course material...|$|R

It has been speculated that had they made a sustained pursuit of the defeated British Army at Falkirk that the castle at Stirling might have surrendered anyway being isolated and without any possible hope of relief. Instead on 19 January 1746 Prince Charles left Lord George Murray with the clan regiments in Falkirk and brought the Lowland Jacobites back to Stirling to reinforce the siege of the castle. The castle would certainly have been a major prize for the Jacobites, being at the narrowest point of the British mainland, whether for offensive or defensive purposes, and was at the intersection of the <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> of Scottish communications from north to south and east to west.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the city}} gates and triumphal arches built during the Neoclassical period, {{the most famous}} and monumental is {{certainly}} the Arco della Pace. It was built during the Kingdom of Italy period {{at the end of}} the Corso Sempione road, the <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> connecting the city to France under whose dependency the Kingdom came. Designed by Luigi Cagnola, construction began in 1805 only to be suspended a few years later. It was completed in 1816 at the instigation of Francis I of Austria. He called it the arch for European peace which had been achieved the previous year at the Congress of Vienna. The arch consists of three fornices with four giant order Corinthian columns. The entablature depicts allegories of the main rivers of the region, the Po, Ticino, Adige and Tagliamento, sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi. On top is a group of bronze sculptures from designs by Luigi Cagnola. The Chariot of Peace (Sestiga della Pace), representing Napoleon's victories, was originally designed to face the Corso Sempione but was later repositioned to overlook the city. Similarly, the arch's bas-reliefs were intended to depict Napoleon's exploits but when work began, under the influence of the Austrians, some of the scenes were changed to represent episodes from the Restoration and the Congress of Vienna while others depicting Napoleon were replaced with heads resembling Francis I. The customs offices on either side of the Arco della Pace date from 1838.|$|E

40|$|Precise {{assessment}} of cyclic plastic deformation of rail track subgrade {{is essential in}} designing cost effective rail tracks. Plastic deformation of rail tracks is often underestimated due to the omission of effects of <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> rotation and water content on subgrade deformation. Moisture content of rail track subgrade is influenced by infiltration, seasonal ground water table variation and climate changes. To understand the influence of <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> rotation and moisture content on the plastic deformation of soil, a series of cyclic moving wheel loading tests and cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed on unsaturated Toyoura sand, using a modified multi-ring shear apparatus. Results show {{that the presence of}} water in sand affects the cyclic plastic deformation of subgrade of rail tracks, significantly. The subgrade water content variation combined with the <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> rotation further increases the accumulation of the cyclic plastic deformation of subgrade under moving wheel loads. Experimental results further conclude that the conventional experimental methods are unable to accurately assess the rail track deterioration process introduced by water content of rail track subgrade under repeated moving wheel load and highlight the requirements of realistic test methods such as the cyclic moving load multi-ring shear test, the cyclic hollow cylindrical test, or the model test in predicting rail track deterioration process of unsaturated subgrade under moving wheel loads...|$|R

To {{understand}} the complex structural geology {{of the southern}} flank of the western Jabal Akhdar anticline (Oman Mountains), this thesis presents a multi-scale analysis on structural elements like faults, fractures and veins of two study areas. Therefore observations from vein analysis, mapping and remote sensing are combined. The outcome is compared to recent models of the regional structural history. The study areas underwent a multiphase evolution. The earliest phase identified is represented by bedding parallel veins, which are interpreted to developed at supra-hydrostatic fluid pressures and a maximum <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> oblique to the bedding. This phase was likely related to the regional obduction of ophiolites. Vertical N-S oriented veins represent the next evolutionary phase with a horizontal minimum <b>principal</b> stress <b>axis</b> in E-W orientation.
