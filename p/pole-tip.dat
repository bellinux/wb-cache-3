50|$|CLEO {{collected}} data {{for two years}} in the CLEO I.V configuration: new drift chamber, ten layer vertex detector (VD) inside the drift chamber, three layer straw tube drift chamber insert (IV) inside the VD, and a prototype CsI calorimeter replacing one of the original <b>pole-tip</b> shower detectors. The highlight of the CLEO I.V era was the observation of semi-leptonic B decays to charmless final states, submitted less than three weeks before a similar observation from ARGUS. The shutdown for the installation of DR2 allowed ARGUS to beat CLEO to the observation of B mixing, which was the most cited measurement of any of the symmetric B experiments.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{magnetic}} abrasive finishing, {{the development}} of a multiple <b>pole-tip</b> system using a partially heat-treated magnetic tool allows the finishing of multiple regions simultaneously in capillary tubes and thus improves the finishing efficiency. To further reduce the processing time required, a new high-speed machine is fabricated. This paper describes {{the development of}} the high-speed multiple <b>pole-tip</b> finishing equipment, which is capable of rotating the spindle up to 30000 min- 1, and the effects of tube rotational speed on abrasive motion during the finishing experiments. Also, the finishing mechanisms of the high-speed machine are clarified...|$|E

The cold-iron quadrupole uses coils fabricated from metal-oixide (synthetic spinel) insulated Cable-In-Conduit-Conductor (CICC). The superconductor is NbTi in a copper matrix. The quadrupole is designed to produce a <b>pole-tip</b> field of 2 T with an operating current of 7, 000 A...|$|E
40|$|A {{limit of}} the {{chromaticity}} correction for the final fo-cus system of a TeV Linear Collider (TLC) is investigated. As the result, it becomes possible to increase the aperture of the final doublet with a small increase of the horizontal,~ 9 function. The new optics design uses a final doublet of 0. 5 mm half-aperture and 1. 4 T <b>pole-tip</b> field. The length {{of the system is}} reduced from 400 m to 200 m by several optics changes. Tolerances for various machine errors with this optics are also studied. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{tribology}} at the head~to~tape interface of linear tape recording systems, OnStream ADRTM system being used as an experimental platform, Combining experimental characterisation with computer modelling, a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms involved in a tape recording system is drawn. The work is designed to isolate the mechanisms responsible for the physical spacing between head and tape with the aim of minimising spacing losses and errors and optimising signal output. Standard heads-used in ADR current products-and prototype heads- DLC and SPL coated and dummy heads built from a AI 203 -TiC and alternative single-phase ceramics intended to constitute the head tape-bearing surface-are tested in controlled environment for up to 500 hours (exceptionally 1000 hours), Evidences of wear on the standard head are mainly observable as a preferential wear of the TiC phase of the AI 203 -TiC ceramic, The TiC grains are believed to delaminate due to a fatigue wear mechanism, a hypothesis further confirmed via modelling, locating the maximum von Mises equivalent stress at a depth equivalent to the TiC recession (20 to 30 nm). Debris of TiC delaminated residues is moreover found trapped within the <b>pole-tip</b> recession, assumed therefore to provide three~body abrasive particles, thus increasing the <b>pole-tip</b> recession. Iron rich stain is found over the cycled standard head surface (preferentially over the <b>pole-tip</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} over the TiC grains) at any environment condition except high temperature/humidity, where mainly organic stain was apparent, Temperature (locally or globally) affects staining rate and aspect; stain transfer is generally promoted at high temperature. Humidity affects transfer rate and quantity; low humidity produces, thinner stains at higher rate. Stain generally targets preferentially head materials with high electrical conductivity, i. e. Permalloy and TiC. Stains are found to decrease the friction at the head-to-tape interface, delay the TiC recession hollow-out and act as a protective soft coating reducing the <b>pole-tip</b> recession. This is obviously at the expense of an additional spacing at the head-to-tape interface of the order of 20 nm. Two kinds of wear resistant coating are tested: diamond like carbon (DLC) and superprotective layer (SPL), 10 nm and 20 to 40 nm thick, respectively. DLC coating disappears within 100 hours due possibly to abrasive and fatigue wear. SPL coatings are generally more resistant, particularly at high temperature and low humidity, possibly in relation with stain transfer. 20 nm coatings are found to rely on the substrate wear behaviour whereas 40 nm coatings are found to rely on the adhesive strength at the coating/substrate interface. These observations seem to locate the wear-driving forces 40 nm below the surface, hence indicate that for coatings in the 10 nm thickness range-Â· i,e. compatible with high-density recording-the substrate resistance must be taken into account. Single-phase ceramic as candidate for wear-resistant tape-bearing surface are tested in form of full-contour dummy-heads. The absence of a second phase eliminates the preferential wear observed at the AI 203 -TiC surface; very low wear rates and no evidence of brittle fracture are observed...|$|E
40|$|A fully-automated <b>pole-tip</b> shape {{optimization}} tool, involving {{write head}} geometry construction, meshing, micromagnetic simulation and evaluation, is presented. Optimizations {{have been performed}} for three different writing schemes (centered, staggered and shingled) for an underlying bit patterned media with an areal density of 2. 12 Tdots/in$^ 2 $. Optimizations were performed for a single-phase media with 10 nm thickness and a mag spacing of 8 nm. From the computed write field and its gradient and the minimum energy barrier during writing for islands on the adjacent track, the overall write error rate is computed. The overall write errors are 0. 7, 0. 08, and 2. 8 x 10 $^{- 5 }$ for centered writing, staggered writing, and shingled writing...|$|E
40|$|From {{magnetic}} measurement {{data of the}} two 0. 8 -m prototype quadrupole magnets (P-SRQ- 1 and P-SRQ- 2) and {{the study}} of the geometries for the pole-end bevels and pole chamfers, the following conclusions have been made. Mechanical stability of the magnet poles has been achieved by modification of the weld procedures between two quadrants of the magnets. Stability of the magnet-pole positions was measured optically and was also concluded {{from the fact that the}} allowed coefficients, mainly sextupole and octupole terms, were independent of the magnet excitation currents. Unallowed multipole field coefficients for the second magnet, without correction of the magnet-pole positions, are smaller than for the first magnet. The field gradient integrals of the two magnets at 400 A differ by less than 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } for r = 2. 5 cm. This indicates that an acceptable magnet assembly procedure has been established. The 2 -D calculations and ``body`` measurements for allowed coefficients after the main field, b{sub 5 } and b{sub 9 }, agree within 1. 2 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } at r = 2. 5 cm. This implies that the 2 -D design geometry is basically correct and acceptable. As expected for a magnet with long and narrow poles, saturation effects of pole shims have been observed. In order to reduce fabrication cost for the end-plates, the geometries for the pole-end bevels and pole chamfers have been studied. By choosing a bevel angle of 61 {degree}, instead of 45 {degree}, it is possible to have acceptable allowed coefficients with dimensions of pole-chamfers up to 16. 5 mm. This allows the design of the end-plate as one piece without removable <b>pole-tip...</b>|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the things}} {{discussed}} in this report are: (1) Computation [...] NAL is now obtaining satisfactory service on NYU's 6600 computer via the telephone data link. Until {{about two weeks ago}} we were plagued by numerous breakdowns of the computer itself (one lasting about three weeks), and bugs in the NYU programs that control the transmission. Early this month a two month complete rebuilding of the NYU computer was begun. During this period Control Data Corporation is making a new computer at their Manhattan data center available to NYU and to the remote-terminal users. This computer is reasonably reliable, and the most serious bugs have apparently been removed from the transmission system. NAL now has immediate access to the computer {{for most of the day}} and turn-around time for jobs with moderate amounts of output is often less than one hour. We have always received excellent service and help from Argonne's Applied Mathematics Division, which has made its two computers, a CDC 3600 and an IBM 360 - 75, available to us. At present we have a courier service to Argonne making three trips a day, soon to be extended to five. In addition IBM is furnishing very competent personnel to help convert 6600 programs to the 360. (2) Main-Ring Lattice [...] A small adjustment has been made in the quadrupoles of the long straight sections. Since the beam cross section is greatest there, these quadrupoles have been increased in aperture. To preserve focal length and <b>pole-tip</b> field, their length was also increased at the expense of about a meter of straight section length. The lattice is quite stable against changes of v. If all the quadrupole gradients are increased or decreased proportionately to cover a range of v between 18. 5 and 22, the maximum increase in B is less than 20 %, except for the stopland at v = 21 of width {Delta}v {approx_equal} {+-} 0. 1, due to the structure resonance arising from the six -fold periodicity. (3) Injection Energy [...] A study was made of the appropriate injection energy for a 5 Hz booster to be used in connection with the accumulator ring. Both cost and performance were considered. The conclusion is that 200 MeV is still the most desirable injection energy for such a booster. (4) Main-Ring Magnet Computations [...] The design work using the computer program TRIM for the main ring bending magnet is continuing. The effort so far indicates that field shapes well within acceptable tolerance can be obtained up to at least 18 kG without crenellation for both B 1 and B 2 magnets and the degree of saturation can be made quite small (about 3. 5 % at 18 kG) and equal for both magnets. The proper coil configurations are 4 turns out of 12 placed between poles for B 1 and 4 turns out of 16 placed in between poles for B 2. With these coil configurations, the proper pole widths are approximately 8. 5 in. for B 1 and 8. 8 in. for B 2. (5) Secondary Beams [...] Studies are being made with A. L. Read of possible secondary beam layouts. One scheme is to channel a secondary beam through bending magnets and a set of three quadrupole triplets producing 3600 phase advance from source to target, with a momentum-analyzing slit at an image point 1800 downstream...|$|E
