40|$|The {{most common}} {{problem in the}} {{reliability}} theory {{is the problem of}} testing the Cox’s hypothesis. This work is devoted to solving this problem in the case of two <b>progressively</b> <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> One of the features is the use of Renyi type statistics, which allows checking the Cox model in case when tests are terminated before all products failure. For testing, there are n 1 systems of the first type, which consist of serially connected m 1 elements and n 2 systems of the second type, which has m 2 of the same elements. Considering that the systems are connected in series, the Cox’s hypothesis is tested through non-failure operation times of systems rather than elements themselves. The sample of non-failure operation times is considered as a <b>progressively</b> <b>censored</b> <b>sample</b> from non-failure operation times of elements of the appropriate type. Thus, when the systems fail, the non-failure operation times of all other elements are censored. We suggest the Renyi criterion for testing the hypothesis of proportionality. Functions of elements reliability for each of the two samples are evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. The paper shows the asymptotic convergence of the proposed distribution of statistics to the standard Renyi distribution. In view of the slow convergence to limiting distributions, a method for calculating the exact distributions of Renyi type statistics is proposed. It is designed to test the Cox’s hypothesis for two <b>progressively</b> <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> The proposed method is based on the model of a random walk on a two-dimensional array of cells, and it is described in previous papers. Tables give calculated distribution values for Renyi type statistics {{for a wide range of}} values of n 1, n 2. The paper also suggests the estimate method for Cox model parameter. As an estimate, is considered the value that minimizes the proposed test statistics. </p...|$|R

Balasooriya & Saw (1998) present reliability sampling plans for the two-parameter exponential distribution, based on <b>progressively</b> <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> However, the operating characteristic (OC) curve derived in their paper {{does not depend on}} the sample size.

3000|$|Record values {{introduced}} by Chandler (1952) arise in many real-world situations involving weather, sports, economics, life-tests and stock markets, among others. Let {X_ 1, [...] X_ 2, [...] [...]...} be {{a sequence of}} independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables (RVs) with a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a probability density function (PDF). Lower records are values in the sequence lower than all preceding ones, and the observation X_ 1 is the first record value. Indices for which lower record values occur are given by record times {L(k), [...] k> 1 }, where L(k)={j|j>L(k- 1), [...] X_j<X_L(k- 1)}, [...] k> 1, with L(1)= 1. Therefore, a sequence of lower record values is denoted by {X_L(k), k= 1, 2,...} from the original sequence {X_ 1, [...] X_ 2, [...]...}. However, because record occurrences are rare in practice, the maximum likelihood method can entail a substantial bias for inferences based on record values. Alternately, a method based on a pivotal quantity can be considered. Some authors studied estimation methods based on pivotal quantities when <b>censored</b> <b>samples</b> or record values are observed. Wang and Jones (2010) proposed an estimation method based on a pivotal quantity if <b>progressively</b> Type-II <b>censored</b> <b>samples</b> are observed from a certain family of two-parameter lifetime distributions. Yu et al. (2013) provided new estimation equations using a pivotal quantity and showed that those equations to be particularly effective for skewed distributions with small <b>sample</b> sizes and <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> Wang et al. (2015) constructed confidence and predictive intervals by using some pivotal quantities {{for a family of}} proportional reversed hazard distributions based on lower record values. Seo and Kang (2015) provided an estimation equation more efficient than the maximum likelihood equation for the half-logistic distribution (HLD) based on <b>progressively</b> Type-II <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> As another alternative, the Bayesian approach can be effective if sufficient prior information can be obtained. Madi and Raqab (2007) assumed that unknown parameters of the two-parameter exponentiated exponential distribution (EED) have independently distributed gamma priors and predicted the subsequent record values based on observed record values. Asgharzadeh et al. (2016) developed estimation methods for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) and the Bayes estimators of the unknown parameters in the logistic distribution based on the upper record values, and suggested the use of the Bayesian method if there is reliable prior information. However, because their approach is based on a subjective prior, it can lead to incorrect estimation results if there is no sufficient prior information. In this case, two alternatives can be considered: estimation based on noninformative or objective priors and that, based on a hierarchical prior obtained by mixing hyperparameters of a natural conjugate prior. In this regard, Jeffreys (1961) and Bernardo (1979) introduced the Jeffreys prior and a reference prior, respectively. Xu and Tang (2010) derived a reference prior for unknown parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Fu et al. (2012) developed an objective Bayesian analysis method to estimate unknown parameters of the Pareto distribution based on <b>progressively</b> Type-II <b>censored</b> <b>samples.</b> Kang et al. (2014) developed noninformative priors for the generalized half-normal distribution when scale and shape parameters are of interest, respectively. Seo et al. (2014) provided a hierarchical model of a two-parameter distribution with a bathtub shape based on <b>progressively</b> Type-II <b>censoring,</b> which leads to robust Bayes estimators of unknown parameters of this distribution.
