5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feature set that it did for the PlayStation 3, but later said that {{cross-platform}} play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E

25|$|In the future, DSPD {{will face}} the {{challenge}} of growing support for privatization. Voices within the state legislature have questioned the continued operation of the State Developmental Center with taxpayer funds. As it is more cost-effective to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of care in the community, the continued use of such institutions is a paradox. During recent economic hardships, the state legislature explored the possibility of privatizing the Developmental Center.|$|E
25|$|A {{multimeter}} may {{be implemented}} with a galvanometer meter movement, or less {{often with a}} bargraph or simulated pointer such as an LCD or vacuum fluorescent display. Analog multimeters are common; a quality analog instrument will cost {{about the same as}} a DMM.

It is also unclear if current and future accessories will operate correctly with counterfeit units due to the differences in internal components.|$|E

25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of light, an {{incandescent light bulb}} produces more heat (and thus consumes more power) than a fluorescent lamp. In buildings where air conditioning is used, incandescent lamps' heat output increases load on the air conditioning system.

25|$|The {{financing}} is not tied; that is, contracts can {{be awarded}} to firms from any country. The loans are for 20 years, including a 10-year grace period. Under a common terms agreement, all five financial institutions agreed to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> loan conditions to the ACP. Shortly before, credit rating agency Moody's gave the ACP an A1 investment grade rating. Mizuho Corporate Bank {{and the law}} firm Shearman & Sterling helped put the financing package together.|$|E

Astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant that stimulates the development of healthy fish nervous systems and enhances the fish's fertility and growth rate. Canthaxanthin may have negative effects on the human eye, accumulating in the retina at high levels of consumption.|$|E
