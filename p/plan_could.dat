5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton <b>plan,</b> <b>could</b> serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Operation Showdown called for simultaneous attacks on both Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge. One battalion from the 31st Infantry Regiment of the US 7th Infantry Division would take Triangle Hill from Gimhwa-eup, while one battalion from the 32nd Regiment of the Republic of Korea (ROK) 2nd Infantry Division would attack Sniper Ridge along a parallel northbound route. UN planners expected the operation to last {{no more than}} five days with 200 casualties on the UN side, {{based on the assumption that}} maximum artillery and air support would be available. Before the <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> be carried out, however, the artillery and air assets for this operation were diverted to the fighting at White Horse. Upon reviewing the situation, Colonel Lloyd R. Moses, commander of the US 31st Infantry Regiment, doubled the American strength just before the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{motorway}} was constructed, the A6 {{road through}} Preston handled north-south traffic with tailbacks and congestion a common occurrence, more so during special occasions {{such as the}} Blackpool Illuminations. The route had been planned {{as far back as}} 1937–1938, with the basic alignment still deemed feasible by the time Lancashire County Council gave approval in the mid 1940s. Chief engineer Drake was part of a delegation from Lancashire that travelled to Germany in 1938 in order that a <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> be drawn up by the council. The agreed route formed part of the County Surveyors' Society's national proposals and was protected by Lancashire County Council from any future developments. During planning, the legal powers necessary for motorway construction did not exist, until the introduction of the Special Roads Act in 1949 that made it lawful to construct roads that were to be used only by certain classes of vehicle. The by-pass was seen as an experiment for the future motorway construction, with many lessons and techniques were learned that would help towards successful future projects. When the proposals were made public, including a large-scale model to ease the explaining of the scheme, only a handful of formal objections were raised and were resolved by agreement without the need to initiate a public inquiry, cited in part because of close personal involvement of Lancashire County Council and the surveyor during consultation.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E
5|$|The main German {{attack was}} {{to be made by}} the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, a Prussian {{division}} that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the Allies at Albert and Dernancourt, and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 2nd Tyneside Pioneers. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III/230 RIR would assault the embankment. After the capture of the embankment, the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II/230 RIR was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> only succeed if the embankment was weakly held, and made representations to their brigade commander, but to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Constantinople's {{cultural}} influence {{extended from}} Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, {{was influenced by}} both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture {{and that of the}} Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, and the combination of domed-cross plan with the hall-church <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), and the Cathedral of Mren (629-40).|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season <b>plan</b> <b>could</b> mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E

30|$|As outlined, neither {{landscape}} planning nor voluntary agreements result in binding law. More effective solutions {{can be found}} in binding agricultural planning.

Besides ensuring co-existence, such <b>planning</b> <b>could</b> at the same time enhance environmental risk reduction.
