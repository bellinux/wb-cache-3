40|$|In West Africa {{there is}} an urgent need to {{increase}} the value of fish products, both to boost consumption and {{to bring in more}} cash to communities whose livelihoods depend on fishing. Meetings in Banjul and Freetown initiated by CTA have resulted in a <b>Priority</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> which will promote regional collaboration on the basis of exchanges of experiences and the pooling of resour. The prime need is to improve post-harvest processing and marketing, and thus increase consumption levels in the region. The programme is based on strengthening local know-how among the regional institutions in the sector, which are very closely involved in the application of the programme. Overall management is placed {{in the hands of a}} small, regionally based technical secretariat staffed by African management personnel with fisheries experience. The secretariat is managed by the Paris-based CEASM (Centre d'Etudes et d'Action SocialesMaritimes), and placed under the responsibility of a management committee. Participants in the programme will be countries in the region who specifically express their wish to take part. The first 18 months of the programme (July 1989 to December 1990) will allow a thorough testing of the feasibility of developing a wider-ranging programme, involving more countries and a larger number of initiatives.

40|$|Trade-offs between {{competitive}} {{priorities are}} {{often seen as}} exogenous – managers accept them as a given downside while simultaneously addressing multiple competitive priorities. However, some companies seem to face fewer trade-offs than others. The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on multiple competitive priorities simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive priorities. We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> influences the simultaneous competition on multiple competitive priorities. We show that successful competition on multiple competitive priorities does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive <b>priorities,</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes,</b> infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R
40|$|Since 2000 Coastal Area Management Programmes (CAMPs) {{supported}} by UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) and the <b>Priority</b> <b>Actions</b> <b>Programme</b> Regional Activity Centre (PAP/RAC) have been engaging local communities in {{assessment of their}} coastal sustainability. The Methods used since 2000 have been based upon an evolving methodology which is now called Imagine. In 2010 The CAMP Levante de Almeria began. “Imagine {{the future of our}} coast” is the slogan selected for this project which is intended to turn this area of southern Spain into a sustainability laboratory. The CAMP Levante de Almeria project is a test and a practical demonstration of how to implement Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) concepts in Spain in compliance with the ICZM Protocol (the seventh protocol in the framework of the Barcelona Convention). CAMP acts technically, environmentally and socially as a means to design and implement new practices, relating these to vertical and horizontal coordination between local and regional administration and public participation in decision-making processes related to the coastal zone. The fundamental objective of the project is to achieve wide scale agreement on the sustainable development of the coast. Drawing upon the history of the various CAMP projects, this paper explores progress made so far in the application of the Imagine methodology in CAMP Levante de Almeria and, by contrasting it with summary observations emerging from earlier Imagine applications in Malta, Lebanon, Algeria, Slovenia and Cyprus draws conclusions on the value of engaging coastal communities in sustainability self-assessment. ...|$|R

The project, whose title is "Demonstration Project on Strategies to Combct Desertification in Arid Lands with Direct Involvement of Local Agro-pastoral Communities in North Ajrica ". is carried out in sensitive regions in Morocco and Tunisia with the coordination of the NRD of the University of Sassari (Italy) and the partnership of the Agriculture Ministries of Morocco and Tunisia. The project involves restoration of vegetation cover with drought resistant perennial forage species (Opunti, Atriplex, Acaci, etc.) in highly degraded Rangelands, to mitigate desertification processes and to improve rangelands productivity. The areas are located in regions characterised by rural poverty, food dependency and land abandoning: here urgent measures are needed to promote optimisation of resource management in view of a sustainable development. This is a concrete demonstration project supported by the direct involvement of local communities.

40|$|Abstract   This paper {{focuses on}} whether {{individual}} development plans {{as well as}} <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed. Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R
