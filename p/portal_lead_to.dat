50|$|The {{main feature}} of the façade is the portal, {{designed}} by Giorgio da Sebenico with an ornate frame featuring twenty heads and, at the sides, two tall pilasters housing four niches with statues of saints. Above the portal is a Gothic lunette with a bas-relief of St. Francis receiving the Stigmata and, above it, a shell supporting a hexagonal baldachin. The <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a staircase which was rebuilt in the 1920s.|$|R

So {{much so that}} they are even capable of destroying an entire colony along with several other Interstellar Alliance ships with relative ease. At no point has an actual member of The Hand's race ever been seen, nor has their age or connections with any other First Ones race been revealed. It is known that a pyramid located within a city buried eight miles {{beneath the surface of the}} planet Beta Durani 7 contains a <b>portal</b> that <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> another dimension.

5000|$|In an interview, writer Simon Furman {{indicated}} that Galvatron {{made his first}} IDW Publishing appearance in The Transformers: Spotlight issue featuring Nightbeat. In the issue, Galvatron was never named or even seen in full, instead presented as a briefly glimpsed figure with his distinctive helmet design shown in shadow. Galvatron and his unnamed followers lured Nightbeat to an underground dimensional portal, which resembled a metallic sea, and captured him. They implanted him with a cerebral device and wiped his memories of the encounter, seemingly planning to use him for some unknown purpose. Several pieces of dialog suggested the <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> something called the [...] "Dead Universe", which was later confirmed in his own Spotlight issue, released in July 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} reconfigured {{in the mid}} 17th-century, {{during the reign of}} the Pope Alexander VII (1655-1667), when the bishop's palaze was razed, and this palace was {{enlarged}} and refurbished. Construction persisted for nearly a century. The loggia linking the former palace to the cathedral was built into an adjoining wing. The plans called for the entire three stories, already built on a slope, to be faced with white and black marble, as was completed for the first story (1718-1724) and for the Cathedral. The windows on the second and third floors have characteristic Gothic mullions. The facade windows do not correspond to those {{on the far side of}} the building. The <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an atrium with dual ascending staricases. The upstairs rooms have portraits of Sienese bishops and popes.|$|R

50|$|In the Middle Ages one of {{the main}} entrances to the church was the Porta Speciosa (ornate entrance). This <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the church from the cloister (quadrum or quadratura) and it was crafted also in the 13th century. In the Renaissance Pannonhalma was rather {{depopulated}} (with not more than 6 or 7 monks). Under King Matthias' rule, in 1472, today's cloister was created. The constructions were probably finished in 1486, as it is testified by the inscription on {{one of the}} cornerstones. The work was presumably conducted by craftsmen of the Visegrád Royal Workshop of Construction. The small inner garden surrounded by the cloister was also called Paradisum (Paradise) metaphorically creating an earthly imitation of Biblical Paradise. In medieval times mainly herbs were grown here so that those in need would recover the body in its wholeness and health as it was in Paradise.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground plan}} {{is created by}} a long {{rectangle}} made from five bays. The exterior of the nave is relatively stern, decorated by only ten massive load-bearing pillars. These pillars are reinforced by sandstones blocks and strapped in lower third with shaped moulding. On the tops of rests there {{is a combination of}} the counter and saddle shelters. Corner load-bearing pillars are built diagonally. Great windows of the nave provide great illumination of space of the church. Wide trough stone moulding is original. There are visible also some stonemasons' marks. There used to be a window in the western side of the church which was walled up in the 16th century and nowadays it is hidden under the plastering. The nave is ended by steep triangular gable walls in the west and the east. The western gable wall is segmented by three pointed sunken niche. Two entrance <b>portals</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the nave from the north.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the prospects for}} producing new, light, hidden states at a future e^+ e^- collider in a Higgsed dark U(1) _D model, which we call the Double Dark Portal model. The simultaneous presence of both vector and scalar portal couplings immediately modifies the Standard Model Higgsstrahlung channel, e^+ e^- → Zh, at leading order in each coupling. In addition, each <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> complementary signals which can be probed at direct and indirect detection dark matter experiments. After accounting for current constraints from LEP and LHC, we demonstrate that a future e^+ e^- Higgs factory will have unique and leading sensitivity to the two portal couplings by studying {{a host of new}} production, decay, and radiative return processes. Besides the possibility of exotic Higgs decays, we highlight the importance of direct dark vector and dark scalar production at e^+ e^- machines, whose invisible decays can be tagged from the recoil mass method.

After talking about Ponycorns with him, Orange Boy gives Sissy five jars to store Ponycorns in. Sissy goes through the portal she came through and finds herself in a mini- hubworld with five portals. In the first portal there is a turtle who is upside-down, in the second portal there is a dinosaur next to a cage with a Ponycorn in it, in the third portal there is a tiger getting ready to eat a Ponycorn, the fourth <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> back <b>to</b> Orange Boy and the fifth has an evil lemon holding a Ponycorn captive. After all the challenges have been completed Sissy will hear something from Orange Boy,going back through the fourth <b>portal</b> <b>leads</b> us <b>to</b> see that Orange Boy is actually the last Ponycorn who turned into to Orange Boy to see if Sissy was kind to Ponycorns.

40|$|In case of {{a burning}} train {{stopping}} outside the rescue stations in the Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT) the emergency ventilation system is used to provide a smoke-free environment in the opposite tube.

In this way it is not a discussion of the superior, general safety concept, but it focuses exclusively on the relevant aspects with regard to a safe escape in {{case of a}}n incident train stopping near a portal. Calculations of the air flows in the tunnel system demonstrate that jet fans placed in tunnels near the portals are an efficient means to support the emergency ventilation system. The use of jet fans near the <b>portals</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> 1. a more uniform level of flow velocity in the open cross-passages along the tunnel 2. increased air flow velocities in the open doors of cross-passages, above the value which is required to prevent smoke from penetrating into the non-incident tube 3. a quicker response of the air flows in the open doors of cross-passages to the ventilation 4. a lower sensitivity of the air flow in the open doors of cross-passages to remaining train traffic. ...|$|R
