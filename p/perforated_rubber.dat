50|$|The use of <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> {{balloons}} {{offers an}} easy and inexpensive alternative to conventional airlocks: as used primarily in homebrewing, the balloon is stretched over the orifice of the fermentation vessel and, if necessary, tightened with rubber bands. The balloon is then perforated with a needle. These punctures, while not completely airtight, sufficiently protect the vessel's contents from contamination {{and allow the}} gases produced by fermentation to evacuate from the vessel as the pressure rises and the balloon inflates.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Ahmad Rafsanjani {{described}} {{the use of}} Islamic geometric patterns from tomb towers in Iran to create auxetic materials from <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> sheets. These are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state, and can switch between the two, which might be useful for surgical stents or for spacecraft components. When a conventional material is stretched along one axis, it contracts along other axes ({{at right angles to}} the stretch). But auxetic materials expand at right angles to the pull. The internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two of the 70 Islamic patterns that Rafsanjani noted on the tomb towers.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{perforated}} interlayers on the stress wave transmission of multilayered materials was investigated both experimentally and numerically using the Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) testing. The multilayer combinations {{consisted of a}} ceramic face plate and a glass/epoxy backing plate with a laterally constrained low modulus solid or <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> and Teflon interlayer. The perforations on rubber interlayer delayed the stress rise time and reduced {{the magnitude of the}} transmitted stress wave at low strains, while the perforations allowed the passage of relatively high transmitted stresses at large strains similar to the solid rubber interlayer. It was concluded that the effect of perforations were somewhat less pronounced in Teflon interlayer configuration, arising from its relatively low Poisson's ratio. It was finally shown that SHPB testing accompanied with the numerical simulations can be used to analyze the effect of compliant interlayer insertion in the multilayered structures. © The Author(s) 2015...|$|E
5000|$|The rubber {{contained}} {{a series of}} holes, which helped break up sound waves. There were problems with this technology: the material performed differently at different depths, due to the holes being compressed by water pressure, and securing the tiles to the submarine's hull required a special adhesive and careful application. The first tests were conducted in 1940, {{but it was not}} used operationally until 1944, with U-480. According to the Naked Science television episode [...] "Stealth Submarine", U-480 had a <b>perforated</b> inner <b>rubber</b> layer covered by a smooth outer one. This formed air pockets with the right separation and size to muffle sonar waves.|$|R
40|$|In a group pen for {{pregnant}} sows {{the floor was}} covered with <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> mats in the lying and in the walking area. In a reference pen the lying area had hole-perforated concrete elements and the walking area conventional concrete slatted floor. The experiment lasted from November 2011 to June 2014 and included 6 trial runs. To detect {{the effects of the}} rubber mats, claws and joints of the sows were evaluated regularly. The sows were stabled in their second pregnancy and passed, depending on their lifespan and their entry into the trial, up to six pregnancies in the experiment. For evaluation of the recorded traits of claws, joints and lameness of the sows, data of 630 pregnancies of 199 sows could be used. The results of the evaluation of the claws showed that the claws of the sows on rubber floor were significantly longer than those of the sows on concrete floor. The traits wall horn abrasion and horn wall cracks were rated significantly worse on concrete floor. No differences were found in the evaluation of lameness...|$|E
3000|$|The decomposing {{test was}} {{performed}} on starch-based thermoplastic bio-film for mulching application, developed in the Operative National Project PON Enerbiochem. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the on-farm composting facility built within the same project, at the Long Term Experimental field site of the University of Napoli, located at Castel-Volturno (CE). The composting method is based on a static pile receiving an upward air insufflation provided by a rotative pump and distributed through a frame of <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> tubes of 10  m length. The tubes were placed on a adsorbing bed of dry corn residues of 4  ×  6  m. The composting pile were made up by a mixture (base matrix) of buffalo manure and cow dung (70  % w/w) with maize straw and poplar trimming as structuring woody part (30  % w/w). The mixed material was uniformly spread by a power shovel and manure spreader to form a ground layer that covers the air distribution system. The thermoplastic blend included in the experimental bags had 20  μ of thickness and was cut into strips of 1.5  ×  30  cm (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 b). Three experimental tests were performed by placing 9 litter bags, containing compost matrix and bio-film strips, inside the composting pile (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 a): [...]...|$|E
40|$|In April 2000, Alex Graef Associated Architects {{was engaged}} by Pitch°UK, {{exhibition}} designers to provide architectural and technical design input into an experience proposal {{to represent the}} telecommunications company Swisscom at the Expo 2002 exposition in Bienne, Switzerland. The Empire of Silence pavilion forms the architectural component of a wide ranging collaboration between writers, designers, composers and choreographers to achieve a narrative led three-dimensional experience loosely based {{on the concept of}} communication and performed on a regular basis for a duration of 6 months. Architecturally, the building reacts to a series of technical challenges: firstly, achievement of a climatically stable environment, taking into account significant visitor numbers and light and sound separation between a sequence of distinct spaces; secondly, the need to control and partially eliminate electromagnetic signals between different zones within the exhibition, necessitated by the inclusion of text messaging to visitor’s phones as part of the experience. In response, the external building fabric is separated into its functional components, enveloping a simple steel frame in a padded and <b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> membrane, protected by a stainless steel mesh rainscreen. Extensive research and testing was necessary, in particular in connection with the flat installation of the woven mesh, control of phone signals, as well as air permeability and fire properties of the externally used rubber. Of further research interest was the collaboration to develop an interactive exhibition throughout the entire building, using mobile phone technology for visitor monitoring and instant feedback. Research was disseminated via 1 million visitors, and through inclusion in the publication ‘ImagiNation; Das offizielle Buch der Expo 02 ’, Verlag Neue Zuercher Zeitung, ISBN 3 - 85823 - 947 -X, pp 54 - 57. The pavilion was voted top out of 41 pavilions in visitor polling, according to Swisscom official communication, and won the ‘Live Event of the Year’ award at the AV Awards 2002 (UK) (see [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In March 1999 {{results from}} an {{exploratory}} case-control {{study indicated that}} the most probable origin of a large epidemic of legionnaire's disease had to be directly located at or in the surroundings of the Westfriese Flora (WF) in Bovenkarspel (Province of Noord-Holland, Netherlands). The WF is a yearly exhibition of flowers, and agricultural and consumer products, which was held in 1999 from 19 to 28 February. After inspecting the premises and making an inventory of all exhibits, a list of potential sources was drawn up. The water supply system and all the still available equipment using water were sampled. A risk assessment was done for each potential source by interviewing exhibitors. In total, sixteen products were found potentially hazardous: two whirlpools, two bubblemats (<b>perforated</b> <b>rubber</b> mats meant for {{the bottom of a}} water-filled bathtub through which air can be blown at high speed), eleven fountains and a sprinkler installation. Legionella pneumophila was isolated from two whirlpools and a sprinkler installation. With the use of molecular-biological techniques (PFGE, ERIC/REP-PCR and AFLP), three different genotypes were identified. These were B- 1, B- 2 and B- 3 (B for Bovenkarspel). To enable comparison of these isolates with patient isolates, all microbiology laboratories in the Netherlands collaborated in collecting patient isolates related to the epidemic. In total 29 isolates were collected, 28 of which were genetically identical to B- 1; the other one was genetically identical to B- 2. Through the risk assessment based on the reported use and estimating the degree of contamination from the microbiological investigation of the three culture-positive products, the most probable source contributing the most to the spread of L. pneumophila was found to be the whirlpool located in hall 3 of the WF premises. It is not possible to rule out the contribution made to spreading by the whirlpool in hall 4, whereas the sprinkler's contribution to spreading is not probable. The contribution to spreading by the fountains and bubblemats is also unlikely. Although Legionella spp was not isolated from the water supply system, the organism was likely introduced into the three products from this system. These results were confirmed by the outcome of a case-control study and a cohort study, both designed to pinpoint the exact location of exposure to Legionella spp on the WF premises. They showed the whirlpool in hall 3 to be the most probable source of infection (reported separately) ...|$|E
