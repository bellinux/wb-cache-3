50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are ATP and 5'-dephospho-DNA, whereas its two {{products are}} ADP and 5'-phospho-DNA. <b>Polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> is a T7 bacteriophage (or T4 bacteriophage) enzyme that catalyzes {{the transfer of}} a gamma-phosphate from ATP to the free hydroxyl end of the 5' DNA or RNA.

This may be done using CIAP, but caution in its use is necessary as noted previously.

However, the structural basis explaining their substrate specificity and the enzymatic mechanism is elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Clp 1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (ceClp 1) {{in a number of}} nucleotide- and RNA-bound states along the reaction pathway. The combined structural and biochemical analysis of ceClp 1 elucidates the RNA specificity and lets us derive a general model for enzyme catalysis of RNA-specific <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinases.</b> We identified an RNA binding motif referred to as “clasp” as well as a conformational switch that involves the essential Walker A lysine (Lys 127) and regulates the enzymatic activity of ceClp 1. Structural comparison with other P loop proteins, such as kinases, adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), and guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), suggests that the observed conformational switch of the Walker A lysine is a broadly relevant mechanistic feature...|$|R
50|$|Nucleoside-diphosphate kinases (NDPKs, also NDP <b>kinase,</b> (<b>poly)nucleotide</b> <b>kinases</b> and {{nucleoside}} diphosphokinases) are {{enzymes that}} catalyze {{the exchange of}} terminal phosphate between different nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) and triphosphates (NTP) in a reversible manner to produce nucleotide triphosphates. Many NDP serve as acceptor while NTP are donors of phosphate group. The general reaction via ping-pong mechanism is as follows: XDP + YTP ←→ XTP + YDP (X and Y each represent different nitrogenous base). NDPK activities maintain an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates such as, for example, when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced in the citric acid (Krebs) cycle is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other activities include cell proliferation, differentiation and development, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor, endocytosis, and gene expression.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polynucleotide</b> <b>kinases</b> (PNKs) {{are crucial}} enzymes {{involved}} in DNA and RNA repair, RNA maturation, {{as well as}} in RNA degradation processes. These enzymes have a conserved PNK domain, showing structural homology to the classical fold of P-loop kinases. PNKs catalyse the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP molecule to the 5 ’-hydroxyl group of polynucleotide substrates. Depending on their in vivo function, PNKs show different substrate specificity. Interestingly, eukaryotic PNKs have recently been identified that specifically phosphorylate RNA substrates. These novel RNA-specific PNKs constitute the Clp 1 subfamily of PNKs named after their first identified member. Human Clp 1 was shown to participate in various RNA maturation pathways: (i) cleavage and polyadenylation of RNA polymerase II pre-mRNA transcripts, (ii) tRNA-splicing, and (iii) phosphorylation of synthetic siRNAs. Despite extensive studies on Clp 1, the structural elements involved in RNA-specificity and the mechanism of the phosphoryl transfer reaction have remained elusive so far. This thesis, therefore, aims for the structural and functional characterization of the RNA-specific Clp 1 PNK. During this work, the three-dimensional structure of Clp 1 from Caenorhabditis elegans was described {{for the first time at}} atomic resolution. Clp 1 is a multi-domain protein that consists of a central PNK domain sandwiched by dditional N- and C-terminal domains. Clp 1 was crystallized with various RNA substrates that differ in length and sequence. Based on these results, the structural features of Clp 1 ’s RNA-specificity were elucidated. Clp 1 uses an “RNA-sensor” that recognizes the 2 ’-hydroxyl group of the RNA at the ultimate position. Additionally, Clp 1 was also crystallized in enzymatically relevant states such as an inhibited substrate bound state, a transition state analog and a product bound state. A general model for enzyme catalysis of PNKs was derived from these structures. In contrast to other described PNKs, Clp 1 ’s ATP-binding site within the PNK domain is obstructed by the N-terminal domain. The crystal structures as well as activity assays with truncated variants of Clp 1 showed a contribution of the N-terminal domain to ATP-binding by interactions with the nucleobase. The phosphate groups of the ATP molecule are anchored in the active site tunnel, which is formed by the common P-loop motif, a divalent metal cofactor (Mg 2 +), and an α-helical LID module. Structure-guided mutational analysis identified the essential role of the Walker A lysine for enzyme catalysis. Moreover, Clp 1 crystal structures revealed a non-canonical Walker A lysine in an “arrested” conformation that acts as a molecular switch. Activation of the switch is only achieved in the transition state complex. In contrast to other nucleotide kinases, Clp 1 seems to apply a substrate-gating mechanism that prevents futile ATP hydrolysis. In this context, the classical Walker A lysine seems to have a so far underestimated regulatory function. Such a molecular switch mechanism of the Walker A lysine is not restricted to Clp 1 exclusively, since the PDB database provides a significant number of crystal structures showing a similar “arrested“ conformation of the Walker A lysine. Thus, an additional function of the Walker A lysine as a molecular switch in enzyme catalysis is suggested. In conclusion, this thesis provides the first crystal structures of Clp 1, elucidating its RNA-specificity as well as the phosphoryl transfer reaction mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The DLA is {{intended}} to quantify the full-length, parent oligonucleotide compound only, with both intact 5' and 3' ends. DLA probes are ligated at the 5' and 3' ends of the analyte by the joint action of T4 DNA ligase and T4 <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase.</b> The kinase phosphorylates the 5'-end of the analyte and the ligase will join the capture probe to the analyte to the detection probe. The capture and detection probes in the DLA can thus be termed ligation probes. As for the hybridization-ligation assay, the DLA is specific for the parent compound because the efficiency of ligation over a bulge loop is low, and thus the DLA detects the full-length analyte with both intact 5' and 3'-ends.

5000|$|As {{reviewed}} by London, XRCC1 protein has three globular domains connected by two linker segments of ~150 and 120 residues. The XRCC1 N-terminal domain binds to DNA polymerase beta, the C-terminal BRCT domain interacts with DNA ligase III alpha {{and the central}} domain contains a poly(ADP-ribose) binding motif. This central domain allows recruitment of XRCC1 to polymeric ADP-ribose that forms on PARP1 after PARP1 binds to single strand breaks. The first linker contains a nuclear localization sequence and also has a region that interacts with DNA repair protein REV1, and REV1 recruits translesion polymerases. The second linker interacts with <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> phosphatase ( [...] PNKP) (that processes DNA broken ends during base excision repair), aprataxin (active in single-strand DNA repair and non-homologous end joining) and a third protein designated aprataxin- and PNKP-like factor.|$|E
5000|$|Insertion {{into the}} nuclear genome:After the preparatory step is over, mtDNA {{is ready to}} be {{inserted}} into the nuclear genome. Based on NUMT integration site and the analyzed obtained results from baker’s yeast experiment, Blanchard and Schmidt hypothesized that mtDNA are inserted into the double-stranded break (DSB) via non-homologous end joining machinery. The hypothesis is found to be widely accepted. [...] Later analyses were consistent with the involvement of NHEJ in NUMT integration in humans. These processes occur in both somatic and germline cells. In animals and humans, however, the capability of DSB repair in germline cells depends on the oogenetic and spermatogenetic stage, nonetheless, due the low repair activity, mature sperms are incapable of DSB repair. Additionally, DSB can also be repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which is more accurate and introduces fewer errors in the process of repair, while, has not yet seen in the process of mtDNA insertion;. Apart from canonical NHEJ, DSBs are repaired via a mechanism that involves sequences containing a few homologous nucleotides at the ends of a DSB to be ligated. This mechanism is known as microhomology-mediated end joining abbreviated as MMEJ. MMEJ is the most mutagenic DSB repair mechanism due to generating deletions, insertion of various sizes, and other genome rearrangements in mammalians. As shown in figure 3, the processes of mtDNA insertion and DSB repair include few steps which are DNA segment alignment, DNA end-processing, DNA synthesis, and ligation. In each step, certain protein complexes are required to facilitate the occurrence of the indicated events. As shown in figure 3, in NHEJ, the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), for bringing DNA fragments end together, the Artemis nuclease and <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> 3' phosphatase [...] (PNKP) , for the end processing, X family DNA polymerases [...] (Pol μ and Pol λ) [...] and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [...] (TdT) , for DNA synthesis, and XLF/XRCC4/LigIV [...] complex, for completing the repair and joining the ends via a phosphodiester bond, are the protein complexes involved in DSB repair process in many higher organisms. DNA polymerases [...] (Pol μ and Pol λ) [...] and XLF/XRCC4/LigIV complex are shared between two NHEJ and MMEJ repair machinery and have the same responsibility in both repair processes. The first step of MMEJ is done by WRN , Artemis, DNA-PK , and XRCC4 protein complexes which process the ends of DSB and mtDNA fragments in addition to aligning them in order for polymerases and ligases to be able to complete NUMT insertion (figure 3).|$|E

40|$|A {{putative}} {{role for}} mammalian polynucleotide kinases that possess both 5 '-phosphotransferase and 3 '-phosphatase activity is {{the restoration of}} DNA strand breaks with 5 '-hydroxyl termini or 3 '-phosphate termini, or both, to a form that supports the subsequent action of DNA repair polymerases and DNA ligases, i. e. 5 '-phosphate and 3 '-hydroxyl termini. To further assess this possibility, we compared {{the activity of the}} 3 '-phosphatase of purified calf thymus <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> towards a variety of substrates. The rate of removal of 3 '-phosphate groups from nicked or short (1 nt) gapped sites in double-stranded DNA was observed to be similar to that of 3 '-phosphate groups from single-stranded substrates. Thus this activity of <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> {{does not appear to be}} influenced by steric accessibility of the phosphate group. We subsequently demonstrated that the concerted reactions of <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> and purified human DNA ligase I could efficiently repair DNA nicks possessing 3 '-phosphate and 5 '-hydroxyl termini, and similarly the combination of these two enzymes together with purified rat DNA polymerase beta could seal a strand break with a 1 nt gap. With a substrate containing a nick bounded by 3 '- and 5 '-OH termini, the rate of gap filling by polymerase beta was significantly enhanced in the presence of <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> and ATP, indicating the positive influence of 5 '-phosphorylation. The reaction was further enhanced by addition of DNA ligase I to the reaction mixture. This is due, at least in part, to an enhancement by DNA ligase I of the rate of 5 '-phosphorylation catalyzed by <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase...</b>|$|E

It is speculated that CNPase may be an authentic mammalian <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> recruited as a structural component of the myelin sheath, analogously to the eye lens crystallins. Significant sequence similarity was revealed also between the N-terminal regions of yeast tRNA ligase and phage T 4 RNA ligase. A tentative scheme of the domainal organizations for the three complex enzymes is proposed. According to this model, tRNA ligase contains at least three functional domains, in the order: N-ligase-kinase-phosphohydrolase-C, whereas poly-nucleotide kinase and CNPase encompass only the two C-terminal domains in the same order...|$|E

Here we incubated intact mammalian cells (polyamine auxotrophic Chinese hamster ovary cells and primary human fibroblasts) with [32 P]orthophosphate and found that, besides high molecular weight DNA, a species of low molecular weight DNA, approximately 450 bp in size, became efficiently labeled. The short DNA was labeled first, and in pulse-chase experiments the labeling was transient.

One of the cleaved CTr 5 x-specific tRNAs had an anticodon sequence of the E. coli B "major" isoleucine tRNA but otherwise little sequence homology. Both CTr 5 x-specific tRNAs were cleaved by a distinct T 4 -induced endonuclease, other than that of leucine tRNA 1, because the CTr 5 x-specific cleavages (i) were induced later in infection, (ii) persisted with a T 4 mutant deficient in leucine tRNA 1 endonuclease, and (iii) occurred in the anticodon loop. The specific manifestation of the anticodon-directed endonuclease activity in T 4 -infected E. coli CTr 5 x suggests roles for RNA ligase and <b>polynucleotide</b> <b>kinase</b> in processing of host tRNA species...|$|E
