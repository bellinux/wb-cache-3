40|$|BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers {{are a major}} {{healthcare}} {{problem and}} caused by pressure and shear-forces. Although shear-force is understood {{to be a major}} contributing factor, no preventive interventions are specifically aimed at relieving the effect of shear on skin to improve skin viability. METHODS: A physical model was used to apply a combined loading of 2. 4 kPa pressure and 14. 5 N shear-force on skin in humans. Loading was applied on the volar aspect of both forearms for 30 min in ten healthy volunteers. One arm received loading on skin with a wound dressing, the other arm (control) received loading directly on skin. The following parameters were determined before and after loading: IL- 1 ?/Total <b>Protein-ratio</b> (used as a measure of skin damage); Cutaneous blood cell flux ((CBF) measure of reactive hyperaemia); Lactate concentration (measure of tissue ischemia). Three different dressings were tested on three different days. The order of dressing application, dressing arm and start of the intervention were randomized. RESULTS: Participants mean age was 22. 5 ± 1. 6 year with a BMI of 22. 3 ± 2. 4 kg/m 2. IL- 1 ?/Total <b>Protein-ratio</b> of the skin was significantly lower after the application of pressure and shear when the Mepilex® (P< 0. 01), Allevyn (P< 0. 05) or AquacelTM dressing (P< 0. 01) was used compared with the control measurement. The Mepilex® dressing was more effective in reducing post-load IL- 1 ?/Total <b>Protein-ratio</b> compared to the Allevyn dressing (P< 0. 01). Post-load CBF was significantly lower when the Mepilex® or Aquacel dressing was used (P< 0. 001). Both dressings induced significantly less post-load CBF than the Allevyn dressing (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The concentration of lactate was not significantly increased after the application of pressure and shear and could not be used as a measure with this model. CONCLUSION: This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate that the effects of pressure in combination with shear on skin viability can be improved with foam dressings. In this study, the multi-layered dressings perform better than the single-layered dressing...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCION: Myofibrillar Myopathies (MFM) are a {{group of}} rare neuromuscular {{disorders}} with heterogeneous genetic and clinical findings. The inheritance is mainly autosomal dominant or sporadic. Hallmarks in histopathology are myofibrillar disorganization and accumulation of myofibrillar degradation-products. The {{aim of this study}} is the clinical, histopathological and genetic characterization of {{a group of}} MFM cases. METHODS AND CASES: These cases were selected by searching our clinico-pathological database. We studied the histopathological features of the myofibrillar myopathy cases or families in our neuromuscular biopsy archive (Institute of Neuropathology, RWTH University Hospital Aachen). General light microscopic techniques as well as immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used as morphological approaches. Next, we performed in these MFM patients a thorough characterization of the clinical and paraclinical phenotype: serum-CK, EMG, ENG, cardio-pulmonic findings and molecular-genetic screening (DES, MYOT, FLNC, ZASP, BAG 3, CRYAB, FHL 1). In 7 cases we performed Laser-Microdissection (LCM) and proteomic-analysis. RESULTS: We isolated 50 patients out of 15. 500 cases (0. 3 %) with clinical and histopathological findings conformable with MFM. We studied the histopathological and clinical characteristics in our group and compared them to those referred in the literature. Finally we could confirm these hallmarks in our group. MFM is also in our group a rare disorder, most mutations were found in the DES, MYOT und FLNC gen. In 36 cases we performed genetic screening; in 11 cases a mutation was found (5 DES, 3 FLNC and 3 MYOT). One case showed a polymorphism in the ZASP-gen; in 14 cases all known mutations could be excluded, in 10 cases final genetic results were still ongoing. 8 of 35 cases showed a positive family-history for neuromuscular disorders, we have ascertained detailed pedigrees in 4 families. It was possible to perform LCM and proteomic-analysis in 7 cases; we found different <b>protein-ratios</b> and increased appearing of different proteins within the aggregates. DISCUSSION: In all of our cases we could proof the hallmarks of MFM which were referred in the literature. That supports the presumption of a consistent histopathological definition of MFM, even if there are heterogeneous clinical und genetic findings. Subform-characteristic changes are: in Desmin-mutations increased granulofilamentous accumulations; in Myotilin- and ZASP-Mutations show more severe z-disc-changes. BAG 3 -Mutations are associated with changes in the nucleus. Mutations in the FilaminC-Gen lead to more severe myofibrillar changes than the other MFM-forms. In the LMD and Proteomics-Analysis we could proof, that the isolated aggregates are consist of a deviating protein-pattern, and that special proteins are increased within the aggregates. The wide range of clinical phenotypes was also present in our group. Patients with Desminopathy showed the highest rate of critical cardiac complications, patients with Filaminopathy are often suffering from pulmonic complications. Patients with Myotilinopathy showed a very heterogeneous mix of symptoms...|$|R
