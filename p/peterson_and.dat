5|$|The {{first part}} of the episode was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> Souders. Due to the {{important}} nature of the episode, Septien, Meyer, <b>Peterson,</b> <b>and</b> Souders began working on the script before Christmas, in the fall of 2010 after the writers had a general idea for the {{first part of}} the 10th season episodes. Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart palpitations due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, David Harrison {{described}} a small Miniopterus {{from the island}} of Grande Comore as a subspecies, Miniopterus minor griveaudi, of the mainland African species M.minor. The name griveaudi honors Paul Griveaud, who collected the specimens on which Harrison based his description. This classification remained {{for the next few}} decades; in 1992, for example, Javier Juste and Carlos Ibáñez recognized five subspecies, including griveaudi, within M.minor, ranging from São Tomé to Madagascar. In their 1995 review of Madagascar bats, Randolph <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> colleagues recognized the small Malagasy Miniopterus as a separate species, Miniopterus manavi, with griveaudi as a subspecies.|$|E

5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully {{bring an end to}} the series. Showrunners Brian <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E
5|$|While at Hampshire, Smith {{formed the}} band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E

5|$|After the Inhuman leader Jiaying {{refuses to}} risk {{anyone else to}} rescue Campbell, Raina {{receives}} a vision of Skye saving him, and convinces Gordon to take Skye to the Playground, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base. Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|During the 2000s, {{molecular}} {{studies have}} revealed that the widely distributed African, Eurasian, and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species-rich than previously thought. In a 1995 contribution to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats, Randolph <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros, including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros. In 2008 and 2009, however, Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M.manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus. These included M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi and M.aelleni in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar, M.brachytragos in northern and western Madagascar only, and M.mahafaliensis in southwestern Madagascar. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi {{as close to the}} mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph <b>Peterson</b> <b>and</b> colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring in different areas, but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment of the status of those forms as new material would become available.|$|E
