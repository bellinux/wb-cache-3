40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of managers’ participation in costing system design on <b>process</b> <b>improvements.</b> Drawing from the literature on business process management, participative decision making and self-determination theory, we propose that participation in costing system design fosters <b>process</b> <b>improvements</b> through managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management and their perceived usefulness of cost information. Questionnaire data obtained from 173 Belgian managers were used to test the proposed model. The results suggest that participation in costing system design increases managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management and enhances their perceived usefulness of cost information. The perceived usefulness of cost information, in turn, results in <b>process</b> <b>improvements.</b> The effect of managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management on <b>process</b> <b>improvements</b> is, however, not significant. Taken together, our findings imply that <b>process</b> <b>improvements</b> mainly emerge through cognitive mechanisms rather than motivational mechanisms triggered by the participation process...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{transaction}} costs changes {{arising from the}} introduction of the Internet in transactions between firms. We divide {{transaction costs}} into coordination costs and motivation costs. We classify coordination efficiencies into three categories: <b>process</b> <b>improvements,</b> marketplace benefits, and indirect improvements. For motivation costs, we focus on informational asymmetries. We apply this framework to internal data from an Internet-based firm to measure <b>process</b> <b>improvements,</b> marketplace benefits, and motivation costs. Our results suggest potentially large <b>process</b> <b>improvements</b> and marketplace benefits. We find little evidence that informational asymmetries are more important in the electronic marketplace than in the existing physical ones...|$|R

25|$|Re-engineering {{recognizes that}} an organization's {{business}} processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and {{tasks that are}} carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one {{is responsible for the}} overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from <b>process</b> <b>improvement</b> efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.|$|E

In 1940 he left Berkeley for a position as {{an associate professor at}} Washington University at St. Louis, where he again built a cyclotron, but he returned to Berkeley in 1942 at Lawrence's request to assist with the development of the calutron. This was a device for uranium enrichment using electromagnetic separation, as part of the Manhattan Project, the effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II.

25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary <b>process</b> <b>improvement.</b> Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E

In the 1980s, AT reduced investments in cell towers due to McKinsey's prediction that there would only be 900,000 cell phone subscribers by 2000. According to The Firm this was [...] "laughably off the mark" [...] from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive. The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for Hoogovens, the world's largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout. It also implemented a turnaround {{for the city of}} Glasgow, which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for NationsBank, when it was still a small company known as North Carolina National Bank. McKinsey was hired by General Motors to do a large-scale re-organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers.

We do this by considering the relevant cash flows that result from owning the patent. The patent value is determined by (1) licensing fees and royalty income, (2) competitive advantage resulting from the patent, (3) patent maintenance costs. We discuss a case study that presents the difficulties and challenges in finding the relevant information that is needed to estimate the cash flows.

2500|$|This {{initiative}} {{has been}} ongoing {{since the late}} 1990s. Software <b>Process</b> <b>Improvement</b> (SPI) has received much attention in recent years; however, {{it has been very}} difficult to translate benefits achieved in one organization to another organization. This initiative is focused on accumulating data from SPI efforts, analyzing it, generalizing and modeling the cost benefits one can achieve from SPI efforts. In 1999 DACS produced a State of the Art Report (SOAR) titled [...] "A Business Case for Software Process Improvement" [...] and revised this report in 2007 to provide new insights into the details necessary to demonstrate from a business perspective the benefits of improved software management using SPI techniques. This revised SOAR examines the business implications of some more recent SPI practices, including the Capability Maturity Model for Integration(CMMI), agile development, and systems engineering.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific {{management}} {{was one of}} the first attempts to systematically treat management and <b>process</b> <b>improvement</b> as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a [...] "bottom-up" [...] way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, quality assurance and quality control began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into operations management, operations research, and management cybernetics. In the 1980s total quality management became widely popular, and in the 1990s [...] "re-engineering" [...] went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's Six Sigma and lean manufacturing could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their evolutionary distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese management culture in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.|$|E
