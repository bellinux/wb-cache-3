40|$|AbstractUsing {{the main}} French health {{insurance}} company database over a 10 -year period, the preventability of catheter-related infections {{of patients who}} claimed compensation after prosecution was reviewed by a panel expert. They occurred in 71 patients with few co-morbidities or risk factors for nosocomial infection and were mainly related {{to the use of}} a <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> (42 cases) and due to Staphylococcus aureus (51 cases). Forty-two infections were considered to be preventable. Infections due to peripheral venous catheters were significantly more often preventable than those due to central ones (p < 0. 05). We conclude that catheter-related infections perceived by patients and the justice system as not related to unforeseeable medical complications are mainly peripheral catheter infections due to S. aureus and might be an appropriate target for new preventive strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> (PVC) -related {{infections are}} an {{important}} cause of device related blood stream infection and are potentially preventable. The 2009 Irish guidelines on the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infection recommend introduction of “care bundles” as {{an important component of}} an intravascular catheter related infection prevention programme. The PVC care bundle was introduced in Beaumont Hospital, a 750 -bed tertiary referral hospital in Dublin on April 2010. We assessed compliance with bundle components and reviewed its impact on the incidence of PVC-related Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infections (SABSI). Methods: Compliance with the PVC care bundle was audited by the Infection Prevention and Control Team in June and November 2010 using the national audit tool. Four components of the PVC care bundle namely, clinical requirement for a PVC, presence of extravasation or inflammation, status of PVC dressings and duration of PVC < 72 hours were assessed. In addition, documentation in the daily PVC documentation sheet was assessed. As an outcome measure, the incidence of PVC-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) was measured. Results: Overall compliance with the PVC care bundle was 66...|$|E
40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) are the “gold standard” {{for evaluating}} effectiveness of interventions, as {{they provide the}} most reliable evidence with minimal bias compared to other study designs. However, if the number and quality of RCTs are poor, studies may give inconsistent results and small effect sizes, creating difficulties in generalising the findings to a broader population. This scoping review investigated the current evidence for the insertion and management of peripheral vascular devices, including intravenous, midline, and arterial catheters. We searched Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2015. The final review included 128 RCTs (94 peripheral intravenous catheters, 2 midline catheters, and 32 arterial catheters). Catheter insertion strategies and analgesia methods have been comprehensively studied, particularly for peripheral intravenous catheters, but more RCTs are needed to address post-insertion care and maintenance, including dressings and securement, flushing practices and infection prevention strategies such as skin preparation and hub decontamination. This <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> scoping review will enable clinicians and researchers to identify the gaps in evidence and prioritise areas needing further research.

40|$|Background: <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (PVC) are {{the most}} {{frequently}} used invasive medical devices in hospitals, with 330 million sold each year in the USA alone. One in three UK inpatients at any one time has at least one PVC in situ according to the Scottish National Prevalence survey. Method: A narrative review of studies describing the infection risks associated with PVCs. Results: It is estimated that 30 – 80 % of hospitalised patients receive at least one PVC during their hospital stay. Despite their prevalence, PVCs are not benign devices, and the high number of PVCs inserted annually has resulted in serious catheter-related bloodstream infections and significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and increased healthcare system costs. To date, PVC infections have been under-evaluated. Most studies focus on central venous catheter rather than PVC-associated bloodstream infections. Risks associated with PVC infection must be addressed to reduce patient morbidity and associated costs of prolonged hospital admission and treatment. Discussion: This article discusses the sources and routes of PVC-associated infection and outlines known effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Quality improvement initiatives have been proposed to {{reduce the likelihood of}} adverse events, but a lack of understanding about factors that influence behaviours of healthcare professionals limits the efficacy of such interventions. We undertook qualitative interviews with clinical staff from a large group of hospitals in order to understand influences on PVC care behaviors and subsequent patient safety. Methods: Ten doctors, ten clinical pharmacists, 18 nurses and one midwife at a National Health Service hospital group in London (United Kingdom) were interviewed between December 2010 and July 2011 using qualitative methods. Responses were analysed using a thematic framework. Results: Four key themes emerged: 1) Fragmentation of management and care, demonstrated with a lack of general overview and insufficient knowledge about expected standards of care or responsibility of different professionals; 2) feelings of resentment and frustration as a result of tensions in the workplace, due to the ambiguity about professional responsibilities; 3) disregard for existing hospital policy due to perceptions of flaws in the evidence used to support it; and 4) low-risk perception for the impact of PVC use on patient safety.

40|$|The {{national}} mandatory {{surveillance system}} for reporting meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia in England has captured {{data on the}} source of reported bacteraemias since 2006. This study analysed episodes of MRSA bacteraemia (N = 4404) where a probable source of infection was reported between 2006 and 2009. In 2009, this information was available for one-third of reported episodes of MRSA bacteraemia. Of these, 20 % were attributed to intravascular devices and 28 % were attributed to skin and soft tissue infection. Sixty-four {{percent of the patients}} were male, and urinary tract infection was a significantly more common source of MRSA bacteraemia in males compared with females (12 % vs 3 %). Detection of bacteraemia within two days of hospital admission does not reliably discriminate between community- and hospital-associated MRSA bacteraemia as community cases are frequently associated with an invasive procedure/device. Between 2006 and 2009, there was a significant decline in the proportion of episodes of MRSA bacteraemia associated with central <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 29 – 0. 61; P < 0. 001], <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (IRR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 48 – 0. 99; P = 0. 042) and surgical site infection (IRR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 25 – 0. 72; P = 0. 001), and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of episodes of MRSA bacteraemia associated with skin and soft tissue infection (IRR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 69; P = 0. 017) and attributed to contamination of the specimen (IRR 1. 96, 95 % CI 1. 25 – 3. 06; P = 0. 003). Since data were not available for all cases, the generalizability of these trends depends on the assumption that records with source data reflect a reasonably random sample of cases in each year. These changes have occurred in the context of a general decline in the rate of MRSA bacteraemia in England since 2006...|$|R

40|$|Background—The role of {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) in cardiovascular {{regulation is}} gaining clinical and scientific interest. In the adult, in vivo {{studies have shown}} that CGRP-stimulated vasodilation in several vascular beds depends, at least in part, on nitric oxide (NO). However, whether CGRP acts as a vasodilator in the fetus in vivo and whether this effect is mediated via NO have been addressed only minimally. This study tested the hypothesis that CGRP has potent NO-dependent vasodilator actions in essential and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> beds in the fetus in late gestation. Methods and Results—Under anesthesia, 5 fetal sheep at 0. 8 gestation were instrumented with <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> and Transonic flow probes around an umbilical artery and a femoral artery. Five days later, fetuses received 2 - and 5 -g doses of exogenous CGRP intra-arterially in randomized order. Doses were repeated during NO blockade with the NO clamp. This technique permits blockade of de novo synthesis of NO while compensating for tonic production of the gas, thereby maintaining basal cardiovascular function. CGRP resulted in potent and long-lasting NO-dependent dilation in the umbilical and femoral circulations, hypotension, and a positive cardiac chronotropic effect. During NO blockade, the femoral vasodilator response to CGRP was diminished. In contrast, in the umbilical vascular bed, the dilator response was not only prevented but reversed to vasoconstriction. Conclusions—CGRP has potent NO-dependent vasodilator actions in fetal essential and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> beds. CGRP-induced NO-dependent effects in the umbilical vascular bed may provide an important mechanism in the contro...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of serious angiographic {{coronary artery disease}} ranges from 37 % to 78 % in patients undergoing operation for <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> disease. Clinical {{studies have demonstrated that}} cardiac outcome after <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification.

Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> procedure. However, <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization.

40|$|Objectives. In-hospital <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> {{complications}} of balloon angioplasty {{were compared with}} those of directional atherectomy in the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial (CAVEAT-I) to identify patients at risk and evaluate costs and outcomes. Background. The incidence, costs and outcomes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications after coronary intervention have not been fully characterized as a function of randomly assigned therapy. Methods. At 35 sites in the United States and Europe, 1, 012 patients were randomized. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications were defined as the composite of pulse loss, pseudoaneurysm, hematoma > 4 cm in diameter or groin hemorrhage necessitating blood transfusion. Logistic models were derived to 1) predict these complications from baseline and procedural characteristics, 2) test the relevance of randomization assignment, and 3) assess their impact on hospital costs and long-term outcomes. Results. Sixty-seven patients (6. 6 %) developed <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications, of whom 15 (22. 4 %) required a blood transfusion, 14 (20. 9 %) underwent vascular surgery, and 2 (3. 0 %) died. Both in-hospital deaths occurred in patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications. There was no difference in composite <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complication rates among patients randomized to angioplasty or atherectomy. Greater age, female gender, postprocedural heparin and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation were predictive of increased risk. In a representative 60 % subset, mean hospital costs increased from $ 9, 583 in patients without to $ 18, 350 in those with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications (p = 0. 0001). The unadjusted mortality rate at 1 year was 7. 5 % for patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications compared with 1. 1 % for all others (p = 0. 0001). These complications identified patients at greater risk of death, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization at 30 days and 1 year. The atherectomy group had a trend toward more frequent deaths and myocardial infarction. Conclusions. Directional atherectomy and balloon angioplasty had similar in-hospital <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complication rates.
