40|$|In {{the wake}} of Enron 2 ̆ 7 s and {{numerous}} other corporate scandals, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) to establish rules of professional conduct for attorneys who appear before it. In November 2002, the Commission released a proposal where attorneys {{would be required to}} report perceived violations of corporate governance and Commission rules up-the-ladder. Additionally, if the company failed to make an appropriate response, the attorney would be required to make a noisy withdrawal. After an onslaught of comments against the proposal, the Commission issued an alternative proposal for comment. Under the alternative rule, the issuer, rather than the attorney, would be responsible for notifying the Commission of an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s withdrawal. The alternative rule has sparked a fair amount of controversy. Many support the rule as consistent with the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s duty under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and necessary to effectuate up-the-ladder reporting. Others oppose the alternative rule because they believe the rule is in conflict with attorney-client privilege rules. The alternative rule will aid in the restoration of market integrity by granting corporate attorneys the ability to call public attention to violations of securities laws without destroying the attorney-client privilege. Because the reason for adopting rules concerning professional conduct of attorney is ultimately to protect the investing <b>public,</b> <b>placing</b> the burden of disclosure on the issuer, rather than the attorney, will result in sufficient disclosure to put the public on notice of serious problems.

40|$|Avalanche accidents, {{particularly}} those resulting in fatalities, attract substantial attention from {{policy makers and}} organizations, {{as well as from}} the media and the <b>public.</b> <b>Placing</b> fatal accidents in a wider context requires long-term and robust statistics. However, avalanche accident statistics, like most other accident statistics, often rely on relatively small sample sizes, with single multi-fatality events and random effects having a potentially large influence on summary and trend statistics. Additionally, trend interpretation is challenging because statistics are generally explored at a national level, and studies vary in both the period covered and the methods. Here, we addressed these issues by combining the avalanche fatality data from the European Alps (Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland) for three different periods between 1937 and 2015 and applying the same data analysis methodology. During the last four decades, about 100 people lost their lives each year in the Alps. Despite considerable inter-annual variation, this number has remained relatively constant in the last decades. However, exploring fatality numbers by the location of the victims at the time of the avalanche revealed two partly opposing trends. The number of fatalities in controlled terrain (settlements and transportation corridors) has decreased significantly since the 1970 s. In contrast to this development, the number of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain (mostly recreational accidents) almost doubled between the 1960 s and 1980 s and has remained relatively stable since then, despite a strong increase in the number of winter backcountry recreationists. Corresponding to these trends, the proportion of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain increased from 72 to 97  %. These long-term trends were evident in most national statistics. Further, the temporal correlation between subsets of the Alpine fatality data, and between some of the national statistics, suggests that time series covering a longer period may be used as an indicator for missing years in shorter-duration datasets. Finally, statistics from countries with very few incidents should be compared to, or analysed together with, those from neighbouring countries exhibiting similar economical and structural developments and characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the history, <b>public</b> <b>places</b> {{have been}} {{asserted}} {{as one of}} the key components of urban life for their physical, social, political, symbolic and environmental roles. However, the nature and quality of <b>public</b> <b>places</b> in recent years have raised the question how far these places remain ‘public’ in true sense. The study systematically explores how the <b>public</b> <b>places</b> of Dhaka have transformed throughout the history in different time periods. It attempts to assess the ‘publicness’ of the existing <b>public</b> <b>places</b> focusing on the changing nature of these places and the tensions arise from different perspectives. The research is descriptive and employs a case study approach. Osmany Uddan, a park situated in the prime location in the city center and the Hatirjheel, a recently developed lakeside area, have been considered as two cases. The findings from the case studies reveal that although these <b>places</b> are <b>public</b> considering the ownership, their quality and characteristics as <b>public</b> <b>place</b> are diminishing day by day. Limited physical and social accessibility have narrowed the group of users who can use the <b>public</b> <b>place</b> for a variety of purposes.

In this backdrop, it needs planning and design considerations to make <b>public</b> <b>place</b> more inclusive to diverse groups of people as such these places can perform multiple functions in balance...|$|R
