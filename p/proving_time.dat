40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} a {{deterministic}} Turing machine with one ddimensional work tape and random access to the input cannot solve satisfiability in time na for a < p(d + 2) /(d + 1). For conondeterministic machines, we obtain a similar lower bound for any a such that a 3 < 1 + a/(d + 1). The same bounds apply to almost all natural NP-complete problems known. 1 Introduction <b>Proving</b> <b>time</b> lower bounds for natural problems remains the most difficultchallenge in computational complexity. We know exponential lower bounds on severely restricted models of computation (e. g., for parity on constant depthcircuits) and polynomial lower bounds on somewhat restricted models (e. g., for palindromes on single tape Turing machines) but no nontrivial lower bounds ongeneral random-access machines. In this paper, we exploit the recent time-space lower bounds for satisfiability on general random-access machines to establishnew lower bounds of the second type, namely a time lower bound for satisfiability on Turing machines with one multidimensional work tape and random accessto the input...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of wheat}} and acorn ﬂours in the {{production}} of breads was studied, in order to develop an innovative food product with good textural and sensorial characteristics. Flours and breads were characterized considering the functional, the physical-chemical and sensorial properties, respectively. The water absorptions were similar (57. 5 %- 60. 0 %), achieving all the doughs the 500 BU, with a shorter dough development time for doughs whit acorn, and they also presented a high stability time (> 30 minutes). The energy, the resistance to extension and the extensibility of doughs increased with the addition of acorn ﬂour and with the <b>proving</b> <b>time.</b> The breads presented low moisture but a considerable water activity (0. 93 - 0. 97). The density of bread decreased with the introduction of acorn ﬂour, which was also corroborated by sensorial and alveolar analysis (higher alveolar number and total area, with large alveolus). Acorn breads were darker, dimming along the storage. Acorn ﬂours increased the hardness and decreased the cohesiveness of wheat breads, with no signiﬁcant variation in elasticity. The global sensorial appreciation of breads had similar scores. The crust and crumb colour were more intense for acorn bread, presenting a low uniformity and little alveolus, and it was scratchier than 100 % wheat breads...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{daily intake}} of dietary fibres in highly industrialized {{countries}} is {{at a low}} level and, therefore, adversely affecting human health. The objective {{of this research was}} to analyze the influence of different commercial fibres (originating from sugar beet pulp fibrex, and Jerusalem artichoke inulin HPX and GR) in yeast dough at a level of 5 %, on the rheological properties of dough and the quality of bread during frozen storage. Frozen dough characteristics were determined using a Brabender maturograph and test baking was followed according the AACC procedure. The dough was frozen at – 18 °C and stored over a period of 60 days. The results concerning the dough (<b>proving</b> <b>time</b> and stability) and bread quality (volume and crumb quality) were statistically analyzed by multivariance Manova and discriminative analysis, which indicated that {{there was a significant difference}} between dough without fibres and dough with different fibres (fibrex, inulin HPX and GR). The discrimination coefficient points that the greatest influence of fibres on the final proof and proving stability is after 30 days (6. 250) and after 0 days (6. 158), respectively, but the greatest influence of fibres on bread volume and bread crumb quality (15. 488 and 3. 638, respectively) can be expected on non frozen dough, due to above mention their adverse the effect on gluten network...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of {{additives}} produced from sugar beet is aimed at satisfying the daily intake of dietary fibre in the range of 25 – 35 g. Bakery products are usually consumed several times a day and this offers the possibility of incorporating dietary fibres from sugar beet. The addition of this additive to white flour can eliminate the negative effect of phytic acid, present in whole-grain cereal products, which inhibits the mineral intake. In the aim to decrease and eliminate adverse effects of sugar beet fibres on dough rheology and bread quality, optimal quantities of shortening and milk powder to the recipes were tested in order to counter addition of balance such effects. The influence of shortening and milk powder on characteristics of dough enriched with fibres (<b>proving</b> <b>time</b> and dough level) and parameters of bread quality (volume and crumb quality) was traced in two groups of samples: first without and second with 5 % of added gluten. Applying regression analysis on measured parameters a mathematical model was defined. Based on presented data and regression analysis concerning samples with and without gluten, it can be stated that fibres enriched bread of the best quality can be made with gluten, shortening and milk powder at the level of 5 %, 5 % and 2 %, respectively...|$|E
