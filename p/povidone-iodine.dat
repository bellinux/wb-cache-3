5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid <b>Povidone-iodine</b> (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{pre-operative}} holding area, {{the patient}} changes {{out of his}} or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details {{of his or her}} surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or <b>povidone-iodine</b> to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an [...] "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).|$|E

50|$|<b>Povidone-iodine</b> {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} antiseptic for topical application in the treatment and prevention of wound infection. It {{may be used in}} first aid for minor cuts, grazes, burns, abrasions and blisters. <b>Povidone-iodine</b> exhibits longer lasting antiseptic effects than tincture of iodine, due to its slow absorption via soft tissue, making it the choice for longer surgeries. Chlorhexidine provides similar results, but with equal toxicity concerns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone-iodine</b> and {{anti-fungal}} {{drugs like}} amphotericin B, dapsone and silver nitrate {{have been suggested}} as possible antiseptics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Povidone-iodine</b> {{came into}} {{commercial}} use in 1955. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Povidone-iodine</b> is available over the counter. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.30 to 11.40 USD per liter of 10% solution. This amount in the United Kingdom cost the NHS about 10.86 pounds. It is sold under a number of brand names including Betadine.|$|E

50|$|It {{is used in}} pleurodesis (fusion of the pleura {{because of}} incessant pleural effusions). For this purpose, <b>povidone-iodine</b> is equally {{effective}} and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost.|$|E
50|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} chlorhexidine and denatured alcohol use to clean skin prior to surgery {{is better than}} <b>povidone-iodine</b> with alcohol; however, the evidence is not strong enough as of 2015 to determine routine practice.|$|E
50|$|To prevent infection, {{stringent}} {{cleaning of}} the catheter insertion site is advised. <b>Povidone-iodine</b> solution {{is often used}} for such cleaning, but chlorhexidine appears to be twice as effective as iodine. Routine replacement of lines makes no difference in preventing infection.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{with the}} David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA from 1961 to his death, Apt {{established}} the pediatric ophthalmology division there, {{the first such}} division at a U.S. medical school. He was a co-founder of the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA. Apt and a colleague, Sherwin Isenberg, examined the practice of instilling silver nitrate or antibiotics in the eye before an eye surgery. They found that such techniques increased the risk of infection. Apt proposed the use of <b>povidone-iodine</b> to treat or prevent eye infections. A 1990s study in Kenya established the solution as effective. The low cost of <b>povidone-iodine</b> provided another advantage for its use, especially in the developing world.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of intravitreal injections, however, {{antibiotics}} are not effective. Studies have demonstrated no difference between rates of infection with and without antibiotics when intravitreal injections are performed. The only consistent method of antibioprophylaxis in this instance is a solution of <b>povidone-iodine</b> applied pre-injection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone-iodine</b> is a {{chemical}} complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine.It is completely soluble in cold and mild-warm water, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol. Its stability in solution {{is much greater}} than that of tincture of iodine or Lugol's solution.|$|E
5000|$|The scabs, crusts, dried serum {{and dirt}} {{should be removed}} very gently by using mild soap or natural mild shampoo, a mild {{chlorhexidine}} (maximum 2%) or <b>povidone-iodine</b> wash and {{a small amount of}} lukewarm water or physiological saline. Other washing methods include using a cleansing cloth or pre-moistened aloe vera wipes.|$|E
50|$|After an abscess has burst, {{it is very}} {{important}} to keep the wound clean. A diluted <b>povidone-iodine</b> solution has been used with good results to disinfect the open hole, flushing the inside with a syringe tipped catheter or with a teat cannula, followed by gentle scrubbing to keep the surrounding area clean.|$|E
50|$|An Iodophor is a {{preparation}} containing iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent, {{such as a}} surfactant or povidone (forming <b>povidone-iodine).</b> The result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution. Iodophors are prepared by mixing iodine with the solubilizing agent; heat {{can be used to}} speed up the reaction.|$|E
50|$|Treatment after {{exposure}} can prevent the disease if administered promptly, generally within 10 days of infection. Thoroughly washing the wound {{as soon as}} possible with soap and water for approximately five minutes is effective in reducing the number of viral particles. <b>Povidone-iodine</b> or alcohol is then recommended to reduce the virus further.|$|E
50|$|Mupirocin (Bactroban) 2% {{ointment}} can {{be effective}} at reducing the size of lesions. A secondary covering of clothing is preferred. As shown in an animal study with diabetic mice, the topical application of a mixture of sugar (70%) and 3% <b>povidone-iodine</b> paste is an effective agent {{for the treatment of}} diabetic ulcers with MRSA infection.|$|E
50|$|Skin {{disinfection}} may {{be accomplished}} {{with a number}} of solutions including providone-iodine, chlorhexidine, alcohol based solutions, and cetrimide. There is tentative evidence that chlorhexidine and denatured alcohol use to clean skin prior to surgery is better than <b>povidone-iodine</b> with alcohol; however, the evidence is not strong enough as of 2015 to determine routine practice.|$|E
50|$|Free iodine, slowly {{liberated from}} the <b>povidone-iodine</b> (PVP-I) complex in solution, kills {{eukaryotic}} or prokaryotic cells through iodination of lipids and oxidation of cytoplasmic and membrane compounds. This agent exhibits {{a broad range}} of microbicidal activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Slow release of iodine from the PVP-I complex in solution minimizes iodine toxicity towards mammalian cells.|$|E
50|$|Cleaning of {{the ears}} is very {{important}} for treatment of ear infections. Home remedy cleansing and antiseptic mixtures are made from isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, boric acid, acetic acid (vinegar), and many herbal extracts in various proportions. In some recipes, <b>povidone-iodine</b> (betadine) is added as well. Many commercial ear cleaners are also available in retail stores and online.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone-iodine</b> (PVP-I), {{also known}} as iodopovidone, is an {{antiseptic}} used for skin disinfection before and after surgery. It may be used both to disinfect {{the skin of the}} patient and the hands of the healthcare providers. It may also be used for minor wounds. It may be applied to the skin as a liquid or a powder.|$|E
50|$|Tincture {{of iodine}} is {{often found in}} {{emergency}} survival kits, used both to disinfect wounds and to sanitize surface water for drinking. When an alcohol solution is not desirable for this purpose, the alcohol-free Lugol's iodine, an aqueous solution of iodine in potassium iodide solution, or else <b>povidone-iodine</b> (brand names Wokadine, Betadine), a PVPI solution, can be used.|$|E
50|$|A 2005 {{study found}} that gargling {{three times a day}} with simple water or with a <b>Povidone-iodine</b> {{solution}} (although with less effectiveness) was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted. A later {{study found that}} the same procedure did not prevent influenza-like illnesses. Other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect.|$|E
