40|$|Summary. This paper {{examines}} the urban development process in post-socialist cities of Budapest, Prague and Warsaw {{in the context}} of economic globalisation and societal transform-ation. Several factors have helped to shape the post-socialist cities of central Europe {{since the end of the}} 1980 s. These include political transformation, economic change, restitution, <b>privatisation,</b> <b>price</b> liberalisation and decentralisation of local government. It is argued that local government administrative and planning structures have been ill prepared in meeting the requirements of international investment capital in a co-ordinated and effective manner. Institutional constraints has promoted an organic form of urban development primarily determined through the inter-national demand for, and supply of, commercial and retail space. 1...|$|E
40|$|Distributional {{issues may}} not have always been among the main {{concerns}} of the economic profession. Today, {{in the beginning of}} the 2000 s, the position is different. During the last quarter of a century, economic growth proved to be unsteady and rather slow on average. The situation of those at the bottom ceased to improve regularly as in the preceding fast growth and full-employment period. Europe has seen prolonged unemployment and there has been widening wage dispersion in a number of OECD countries. Rising affluence in rich countries coexists, in a number of such countries, with the persistence of poverty. As a consequence, it is difficult nowadays to think of an issue ranking high in the public economic debate without some strong explicit distributive implications. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxes, monetary or trade union, <b>privatisation,</b> <b>price</b> and competition regulation, the future of the Welfare State are all issues which are now often perceived as conflictual because of their strong redistributive content. Economists have responded quickly to the renewed general interest in distribution, and the contents of this Handbook are very different from those which would have been included had it been written ten or twenty years ago. It has now become common to have income distribution variables playing a pivotal role in economic models. The recent interest in the relationship between growth and distribution is a good example of this. The surge of political economy in the contemporary literature is also a route by which distribution is coming to re-occupy the place it deserves. Within economics itself, the development of models of imperfect information and informational asymmetries have not only provided a means of resolving the puzzle as to why identical workers get paid different amounts, but have also caused reconsideration of the efficiency of market outcomes. These models indicate that there may not necessarily be an efficiency/equity trade-off; it may be possible to make progress on both fronts. The introduction and subsequent 14 chapters of this Handbook cover in detail all these new developments, insisting at the same time on how they tie with the previous literature on income distribution. The overall perspective is intentionally broad. As with landscapes, adopting various points of view on a given issue may often be the only way of perceiving its essence or reality. Accordingly, income distribution issues in the various chapters of this volume are considered under their theoretical or their empirical side, under a normative or a positive angle, in connection with redistribution policy, in a micro or macro-economic context, in different institutional settings, at various point of space, in a historical or contemporaneous perspective. Specialized readers will go directly to the chapter dealing with the issue or using the approach they are interested in. For them, this Handbook will be a clear and sure reference. To more patient readers who will go through various chapters of this volume, this Handbook should provide the multi-faceted view that seems necessary for a deep understanding of most issues in the field of distribution...|$|E

Technical {{efficiency in}} agriculture is significantly {{positively associated with}} agricultural factor endowments, average farm size, farm specialisation, small-scale farms, and technological change. Foreign direct investments have an ambiguous effect. Reform and institutional developments, large-scale <b>privatisation</b> and <b>price</b> liberalisation, and urban- rural income gap are associated with technical efficiency in agriculture positively. An increase in technical efficiency in agriculture {{and the development of}} the rural economy are seen as a strategy to boost the level of living standards in agriculture and in rural areas. ...|$|R
40|$|In December 1990, the 12 {{regional}} electricity companies — {{responsible for}} the distribution and supply of electricity in England and Wales — were privatised. For {{the first few years}} following <b>privatisation,</b> real <b>prices,</b> profits and costs in the industry rose. Following two Price Control Reviews, prices have now fallen sharply and there have been substantial reductions in costs and more recently in profits. This paper attempts to conduct a social cost-benefit analysis of the privatisation by examining actual and predicted falls in costs over the period to 2005. We conclude that the privatisation did yield significant net benefits but that these were unevenly distributed across time and groups in society. Relative to our preferred counterfactual, consumers experience slightly lower prices and the government gains £ 5 billion in sale proceeds and net taxes. However, consumers begin to gain only from 2000. ...|$|R

Using a Hotelling framework, this paper analyses the effect of different objectives of the hospitals on quality, profits, and overall welfare in a price regulated duopoly with symmetric locations. In contrast to other studies on mixed oligopolies, this paper shows that in a duopoly with regulated <b>prices</b> <b>privatisation</b> of the public hospital may increase overall welfare depending on the difference of the hospitals' marginal costs and the weight of the additional public hospital's motive.

40|$|As the {{political}} debate around rising power prices and the carbon tax heats up, there is a renewed debate around the privatisation of electricity distribution in New South Wales. With power prices {{sure to be a}} hot topic in the next federal election, it’s worth taking a broader look at the history behind the deregulation of Australian energy. The mid-nineties saw State Government’s agree to privatise swaths of public infrastructure, including electricity, under pressure from the then Howard Government. In each state, the generation, transmission, distribution and retail supply of electricity were separated and corporatised. Barriers to interstate trade were removed and open access to electricity networks established. In preparation for <b>privatisation,</b> a <b>pricing</b> formula was set for the newly formed transmission and distribution corporations because they are “natural monopolies” and not subject to competition. Governments traditionally charged electricity rates that covered the actual costs of transmission and distribution and were accountable to the electorate for any dividends they squeezed out of the system...|$|R

Chaudhry, who was heading the bench, observed that the main objectives of the privatisation policy were poverty alleviation and debt retirement, but these were not given due weightage in the mills' privatisation deal.

40|$|The {{research}} question addressed by {{this paper is}} a simple one: are European consumers happy with the price they pay for electricity supply services {{after two decades of}} reforms? We focus on self-assessed consumers' satisfaction as reported in three waves of the Eurobarometer surveys, 2000 - 2002 - 2004, conditioning on a set of indicators of public ownership and liberalisation across the EU- 15. After controlling for individual and country characteristics, we find that consumers are happier with the prices they pay when in their country there are both public ownership and liberalisation. We discuss this finding. Consumers' satisfaction Electricity <b>prices</b> <b>Privatisation</b> Vertical disintegration Liberalisation...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} {{determinant of}} the speed and success of transition will be the efficiency of transformation {{and development of the}} infrastructure sectors. A great deal of {{attention has been paid to}} issues such as <b>privatisation,</b> restructuring, user <b>prices,</b> and terms of access in these sectors, regarding both developed and developing countries. Some issues regarding vertical restructuring are notable in the degree to which in different sectors and in different locations they raise similar questions that may have very different answers. This paper suggests a framework for answering such questions and seeks to apply it to the railroad, electricity, and telecommunications sectors in Russia, Lithuania, Romania, and Poland. vertical restructuring, competition, regulation, infrastructure, transition...|$|R
40|$|We {{partition}} post‐Soviet Union Transition Economies {{into two}} groups: European Union New Member States and countries {{belonging to the}} Commonwealth of Independent States or the South Eastern Europe area. Both groups started the 1980 s {{with low levels of}} inequality, but in the early 2000 s the latter group reached a level of inequality seven percentage points higher. We review various factors of inequality and examine whether these had differential effects in the two groups. Foreign Direct Investments and trade flows with the EU had a bigger inequality‐enhancing effect in New Member States. We interpret this as evidence of technological catching‐up and productivity improvements taking place in this region. Other specific reforms, such as <b>privatisation</b> and <b>price</b> liberalisation, had similarly strong effects in the two groups. We also find some evidence of an inequality‐decreasing effect of an indicator of Voice and Accountability in countries outside the EU, and that countries with higher government effectiveness experienced lower levels of inequality. This supports the relevance of institutional capacity in tackling inequality. Finally, we speculate over the effects of the current global crisis on future economic performance. inequality, transition economies, varieties of capitalism, D 63, F 16, O 33,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} explain {{differences}} in {{the average price of}} domestic water supply services in Spain, paying special attention to the effects of privatisation of the service on price levels. We base our empirical analysis on the application of a `treatment effects' model on a sample of 53 major urban municipalities. This model accounts for the fact that municipalities do not randomly assign themselves between a group using strictly public ownership and management and a group where {{all or part of the}} service has been delegated to a private firm. We find that, once this endogeneity is taken into account, there seems to be a positive and significant effect of <b>privatisation</b> on water <b>price</b> levels.

This study analyses the sociological significance of privatisation in Britian through {{a case study of}} the privatisiation of the water industry. It considers how consumers experienced the change, and the effects of share purchase on the political attitudes and cultural values of those who bought. (A separate survey - not included - also analyses how the change affected employees). Changes were documented between 1989 (before privatisation) and 1991 through repeat interviews with 828 members of the public. Main Topics : 1. Socio-economic characterisitics of residents (age, gender, marital status, occupation, union membership, housing tenure, size of household, income, employment sector). 2. Political attitudes (voting intention, attitudes on income distribution and role of state versus private sector,attitudes to privatisation in general and water privatisation in particular). 3. Evaluation of water delivery service (satisfaction with quality, knowledge of complaints procedures, views on metering, views on water charges, expectations/experience of how <b>privatisation</b> affects <b>prices,</b> water quality, service to the public and environmental protection). 4. Share-ownership profile (shares bought/sold before 1989, share purchases 1989 - 1991, 1989 intentions to purchase water shares, reasons for buying shares, details of water shares purchased and sold, satisfaction with performance of shares, indicators of active shareholder involvement...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses an {{international}} database on regulation, market structure {{and performance in}} the telecommunications industry to investigate the effects of entry liberalisation and <b>privatisation</b> on productivity, <b>prices</b> and quality of service in long-distance (domestic and international) and mobile cellular telephony services in 23 OECD countries over the 1991 - 1997 period. The data on regulation and market structure is analysed by means of factor analysis techniques in order to group countries according to their policy and market environments. Controlling for technology developments and differences in economic structure, panel data estimates show that prospective competition (as proxied {{by the number of}} years remaining to liberalisation) and effective competition (as proxied by the share of new entrants or by the number of competitors) both bring about productivity and quality improvements and reduce the prices of all the telecommunications services considered in the analysis. No clear evidence could be found concerning the effects on performance of the ownership structure of the industry (as proxied by both the public share in the public telecommunications operators and years remaining to privatisation). ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{two lines of}} research. The first applies the strategic decision-making theory of the firm {{to the issue of}} corporate governance. We find that preferences vary over strategy but not all interests are currently being represented, resulting in a failure to govern in the public interest. As solutions, we consider membership of the company and also more immediate ways forward, focusing on regulation and democratically controlled public agencies, but stressing the fundamental significance of active, effective citizens. Throughout, our arguments are illustrated using utility companies as our primary examples. It includes discussion of electricity privatisation in Mexico and, to demonstrate that the theory is widely applicable, we also consider governance of corporate universities. The second line of research builds upon earlier analysis by considering aspects of British electricity privatisation. We consider the role of independent power producers, finding that they have not significantly increased competition as intended but have adversely affected the future viability of the system. The affect of <b>privatisation</b> on electricity <b>prices</b> is also considered via the use of a counterfactual model for continued state ownership. Observed prices are found to have been significantly higher than those that would have been charged had the industry remained in the public sector.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to fill the}} large existing {{gap in the literature}} on the Brazilian natural rate of unemployment. It reveals not only that the correlation between inflation and unemployment has changed radically since the stabilisation of the economy but, more surprisingly, that it has become positive in the recent past. In other words, there has apparently been no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. However, this fact is due to – and highlights – the paramount importance of supply shocks in recent inflation dynamics in Brazil. The paper then shows that the exchange rate has been the major source of shocks to inflation, even though {{it is not enough to}} explain the magnitude and persistence of those shocks. Part of the answer comes from the large and wide effects produced by <b>privatisation</b> on the <b>price</b> dynamics in Brazil. The evidence presented here suggests that the Brazilian natural rate of unemployment has been constant since 1996. Despite the high degree of uncertainty involved in natural rate estimations, point estimates seem to lie somewhere between the 7. 4 %– 8. 5 % range. The paper also sheds light on why real interest rates have been so high for extended periods of time in Brazil, a feature that has puzzled many economists. Finally, it calls to attention that one important core inflation measure in Brazil has not been able to capture underlying inflation properly and, therefore, has to be used with caution. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend to {{widespread}} privatisation of crop breeding, and there are grounds for expecting this trend to continue and even to accelerate. Possible consequences for Australian grain growers and the national interest of much greater private sector involvement in plant breeding are explored. Growing privatisation and commercialisation of plant breeding will lead to increased competition between plant breeders. While this increased competition has been at least partly driven by the potential for value creation, it also is likely to enhance value creation from plant breeding {{so long as there}} is adequate continuing investment in the capacity for plant breeding, and more particularly in productivity enhancing enabling technology. In the event of monopoly provision of such enabling technology, an important policy issue will be access to what might be termed essential plant breeding infrastructure. For any access regime to essential infrastructure, the core issue is to select terms and conditions for access that promote full and efficient competition in upstream and downstream markets (e. g. plant breeding) while preserving the incentive for adequate levels of investment in the ongoing development, maintenance, and provision of such essential infrastructure. A key, perhaps pivotal issue will be pricing policy and practice. Because EPBI has the public good characteristic of being non-rival in use, price discovery by market processes {{can not be expected to}} produce the desired outcome. Moreover, even if an access regime mandated that EPBI be made available to all plant breeders at a uniform price, the imbalance in market power between the monopoly provider of EPBI and plant breeders seeking access would almost inevitably result in both under-production of EPBI, and in under-utilisation of any produced EPBI due to price rationing. Such outcomes would severely undermine the competitive position of Australian grain growers in international markets. Results from the literature on what are called excludable public goods are used to analyse the impact on the incentive for adequate investment in EPBI under an access regime mandating uniform <b>pricing.</b> <b>Privatisation,</b> plant breeding, access, enabling technologies, competition policy, excludable public goods., Crop Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|R
