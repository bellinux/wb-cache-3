5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} gun in the F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was also aware that none of his pilots were trained in the use of a gun or dogfighting. He also reasoned that the drag of the pod would both degrade the <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} quantile-based ranking and {{selection}} (R&S) procedure for comparing a finite set of stochastic systems via simulation. Our R&S procedure uses a quantile {{set of the}} simulated probability distribution of a <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic</b> of interest that best represents the most appropriate selection criterion {{as the basis for}} comparison. Since this quantile set may represent either the downside risk, upside risk, or central tendency of the <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic,</b> the proposed approach is more flexible than the traditional mean-based approach to R&S. We first present a procedure that selects the best system from among K systems, and then we modified that procedure for the case where KÂ -Â  1 systems are compared against a standard system. We present a set of experiments to highlight the flexibility of the proposed procedures. Simulation Ranking and selection Risk Quantile...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{regional}} characteristics of Indian manufacturing industry. Its {{aim is to}} assess whether geography plays any major {{role in determining the}} <b>performance</b> or <b>characteristics</b> of Indian manufacturing firms, and in order to do this, it presents the results of cross-section regressions estimated {{on the basis of a}} balanced sample of 1607 firms across the 30 Indian states. The results suggest that firm <b>performance</b> and <b>characteristics</b> are related to many of the expected industrial organization variables. However, there is also evidence of significant region-state influences on both the <b>performance</b> and <b>characteristics</b> of Indian manufacturing industry. As such, the results demonstrate that analyses which focus solely on standard non-spatial industrial organization variables will fail to explain much of the cross-sectional variation in firm <b>performance</b> and <b>characteristics.</b> In particular, while there are no systematic simple centre-periphery variations in the Indian regional economic system, there is evidence to suggest that industrial spatial concentration, regional specialization, and regional market size play a key role in determining the <b>performance</b> and <b>characteristics</b> of Indian manufacturing industry...|$|R

25|$|Energy {{provided}} for the turbine work is converted from the enthalpy and kinetic energy of the gas. The turbine housings direct the gas flow through the turbine as it spins at up to 250,000 rpm. The size and shape can dictate some <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the overall turbocharger. Often the same basic turbocharger assembly {{is available from the}} manufacturer with multiple housing choices for the turbine, and sometimes the compressor cover as well.

25|$|The {{characteristic}} of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating. Gasoline is produced in several grades of octane rating. Tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating, but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system 'cleaning,' and determine <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> under intended use. Sometimes, gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel, for economic, political or environmental reasons.|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} {{chemical}} additives {{were used to}} modify asphalt emulsion recycled mixture. These chemical additives include composite Portland cement (CPC), hydrated lime (HL), and a combination of hydrated lime and ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBF). The influence of different additives on the recycled mixture performance was investigated by volumetric and strength tests, moisture susceptibility test, rutting resistance test, and low temperature bending test. To better understand its <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic,</b> the microstructure images of the recycled mixture were observed by environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). Test results demonstrate that the performance improvement of the emulsion recycled mixture depends on the types and content of chemical additives.

30|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of mechanical dust collector (MS 1723 : 2003) involves simultaneous isokinetic measurements at the inlet and outlet {{of the dust}} collector {{in order to determine}} the actual dust collection <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the system installed. This <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic</b> as measured can be used for verifying the design specifications. After the <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic</b> has been determined, future measurements will show if any deterioration has taken place. These measurements should be part of the maintenance programme of the mill. This will assist not only in ensuring that the emission complies with the set of standards, but also in planning maintenance work on dust collector in advance. Evaluation results should be kept as records by state branches under the Department of Environment. Establishing a databank is not only for {{performance evaluation}} and monitoring purpose, but also for the identification of inefficient systems so that action can be taken to control the pollution. Setting a short-term or long-term reduction target can help to improve dust emission. For example, with reference to Table 6, by knowing the current status of the industry’s total emission of 155, 984 tonnes/year at overall efficiency of 60 % and considering the industry and its affordability in terms of profit, the most cost-effective solution available can be recommended and a target can be set at increasing the efficiency to 95 % to reduce the emission to 19, 498 tonnes/year.|$|R
