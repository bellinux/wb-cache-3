5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E

25|$|The Olympic {{flame of}} the modern-day Olympic Games is lit by {{reflection}} of sunlight in a <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> {{in front of}} the Temple of Hera and then transported by a torch to the place where the games are held.

25|$|The Flame was lit {{during a}} {{ceremony}} in Olympia, {{as has been}} tradition at all the Summer Games since those in 1936. The Flame is initiated by using a <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> that concentrates the sun's rays. However, due to some cloud cover {{on the day of}} the ceremony, there was insufficient sunlight to create the required level of heat. A backup, lit on the previous day during rehearsals, was used instead. The remainder of the ceremony could then take place.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Torch {{today is}} ignited {{several months before}} the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympic Games {{at the site of}} the ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece. Eleven women, representing the Vestal Virgins, perform a celebration at the Temple of Hera in which the torch is kindled by the light of the Sun, its rays concentrated by a <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror.</b> The torch briefly travels around Greece via short relay, and then starts its transfer to the host city after a ceremony in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> to {{concentrate}} sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|R

25|$|A linear Fresnel {{reflector}} {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.|$|E
25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} {{along the edge of}} their mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition as well as the ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reflector}} is a spherical reflector, not a parabolic reflector. To aim the device, {{the receiver}} is moved to intercept signals reflected from different directions by the spherical dish surface of [...] radius. A <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> would have varying astigmatism when the receiver {{is off the}} focal point, but the error of a spherical mirror is uniform in every direction.|$|E

2500|$|The idea {{of using}} {{parabolic}} reflectors for radio antennas was taken from optics, where {{the power of a}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> to focus light into a beam has been known since classical antiquity. [...] The designs of some specific types of parabolic antenna, such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, come from similarly named analogous types of reflecting telescope, which were invented by astronomers during the 15th century.|$|E
60|$|It {{is still}} a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently. Many think {{that in some way}} they are able to {{generate}} an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> of unknown composition, much as the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these details. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.|$|E
60|$|But {{that crowd}} of people had a far {{narrower}} escape than mine. Only {{the fact that a}} hummock of heathery sand intercepted {{the lower part of the}} Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.|$|E

An analytical model to optimize the shape and thickness of the band is presented. The validity of the concept is demonstrated using Finite Element Analysis and laboratory experiments. The concept would permit flat mirror elements to be easily fabricated and efficiently packaged and shipped to field sites and assembled into the parabolic trough concentrators with potentially substantial costs reductions compared with conventional methods...|$|R
