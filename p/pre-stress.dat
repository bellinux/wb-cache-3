This is because FRP has linear behavior till to fracture unlike RC beams with <b>pre-stressed</b> steel cables in the failure behavior is due to yielding. Failure of RC beams with <b>pre-stressed</b> CFRP occurs with concrete crushing or FRP failure with no alert. Carbon fibers have the best behavior in <b>pre-stressing</b> application rather than other types of fibers; however, the expense is considerable (El-Hacha et al. 2001; Jonsson 2011).|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} salient {{differences}} between European and Brazilian Portuguese is their prosody. European Portuguese is a stress-timed language, with reduction, devoicing or even deletion of unstressed vowels and a general tolerance of syllable-final consonants. Brazilian Portuguese, on the other hand, is of mixed characteristics, and varies according to speech rate, sex and dialect. At fast speech rates, Brazilian Portuguese is more stress-timed, while in slow speech rates, it can be more syllable-timed. The accents of rural, southern Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast (especially Bahia) are considered to sound more syllable-timed than the others, while the southeastern dialects such as the mineiro, in central Minas Gerais, the paulistano, of the northern coast and eastern regions of São Paulo, and the fluminense, along Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais as well the Federal District, are most frequently essentially stress-timed. Also, male speakers of Brazilian Portuguese speak faster than female speakers and speak in a more stress-timed manner, and with a lighter reduction of unstressed vowels, less raising of <b>pre-stress</b> vowels, less devoicing and fewer deletions.|$|E

His doctors told him not to dance anymore anytime soon, and they and show producers advised him to withdraw from the remainder of the competition.

And so, outfitted in red pants with a red and white candy-cane striped shirt (red is the unofficial color of the Republican Party), which had emblazoned on its back a large, sequined version of the GOP's elephant symbol, DeLay and his partner Burke, who wore a blue (the unofficial color of the Democratic Party) dress with white stars and a sequined version of the Dems' donkey symbol, danced the samba (video available [...] ) to the bouncy, 1975 song by the band War, [...] "Why Can't We Be Friends?" [...] All three judges (Inaba, Goodman, and Tonioli) praised DeLay tremendously for his effort, but said his injuries unfortunately compromised his performance. They awarded him a combined 15 out of 30 possible points. Once again, however, such a score placed the former congressman low on the leader board, in second-to-last place. On October 6, 2009, DeLay announced he would be leaving competition on the show following the recommendation of his doctors and after consultation with his family.

40|$|AbstractPre-stressing of masonry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} building/facility reconstruction methods. In the Czech Republic it is very successful, especially in the Moravian-Silesian Region, which is subject to a considerable amount of disturbances of buildings/facilities due to undermining. <b>Pre-stressing</b> in masonry can be achieved by means of steel wire ropes or rods. These steel elements are inserted into the pre-milled grooves, which may be in the external or internal wall face. The ends of the steel elements are clamped into steel angles or special anchors. In these reconstruction methods it is necessary to follow the pre- stressing procedures and technologies. It is important to properly select the <b>pre-stressing</b> anchoring system, appropriate layout and arrangement of <b>pre-stressing</b> wires, <b>pre-stressing</b> procedure and dimension of <b>pre-stressing</b> forces in the individual wires. This contribution deals with experimental measurements of deformations in the place exposed to local load caused by additional <b>pre-stressing.</b> The measurements are taken on a masonry corner built in the laboratory equipment. This laboratory equipment was designed at the Faculty of Civil Engineering VSB – TU Ostrava for measurement of the tri-axial stress-strain conditions in masonry.
