25|$|Stuxnet {{installs}} malware into {{memory block}} DB890 of the PLC that monitors the <b>Profibus</b> messaging bus of the system. When certain criteria are met, it periodically modifies the frequency to 1,410Hz {{and then to}} 2Hz and then to 1,064Hz, and thus affects {{the operation of the}} connected motors by changing their rotational speed. It also installs a rootkit – the first such documented case on this platform – that hides the malware on the system and masks the changes in rotational speed from monitoring systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>PROFIBUS</b> Nutzerorganisation e.V. (<b>PROFIBUS</b> User Organisation, or PNO) {{was created}} in 1989. This group was {{composed}} mainly of manufacturers and users from Europe. In 1992, the first regional <b>PROFIBUS</b> organisation was founded (<b>PROFIBUS</b> Schweiz in Switzerland). In the following years, additional Regional <b>PROFIBUS</b> & PROFINET Associations (RPAs) were added.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{variations}} of <b>PROFIBUS</b> in use today; {{the most commonly}} used <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP, and the lesser used, application specific, <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>PROFIBUS</b> PA is {{slower than}} <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP and runs at fixed speed of 31.2kbit/s via blue {{sheathed}} two core screened cable. The communication may be initiated to minimise {{the risk of}} explosion or for the systems that intrinsically need safe equipment. The message formats in <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA are identical to <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP.|$|E
50|$|Note: <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP and <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with PROFINET.|$|E
5000|$|PROFIsafe (<b>PROFIBUS</b> {{safety or}} PROFINET safety) is a safety {{communication}} technology for distributed automation. Its specification for <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP and <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA was published first in 1999. Extensions for the Ethernet based PROFINET IO followed in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>PROFIBUS</b> {{goes back to}} a {{publicly}} promoted plan for an association which started in Germany in 1986 and for which 21 companies and institutes devised a master project plan called [...] "fieldbus". The goal was to implement and spread {{the use of a}} bit-serial field bus based on the basic requirements of the field device interfaces. For this purpose, member companies agreed to support a common technical concept for production (i.e. discrete or factory automation) and process automation. First, the complex communication protocol <b>Profibus</b> FMS (Field bus Message Specification), which was tailored for demanding communication tasks, was specified. Subsequently in 1993, the specification for the simpler and thus considerably faster protocol <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP (Decentralised Peripherals) was completed. <b>Profibus</b> FMS is used for (non-deterministic) communication of data between <b>Profibus</b> Masters. <b>Profibus</b> DP is a protocol made for (deterministic) communication between <b>Profibus</b> masters and their remote I/O slaves.|$|E
5000|$|AMS Device Manager {{supports}} digital instrument {{inputs and}} outputs; FOUNDATION fieldbus, HART, [...] <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP, [...] <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA, and WirelessHART.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>PROFIBUS</b> {{profiles}} for Encoders, Laboratory instruments, Intelligent pumps, Robots and Numerically Controlled machines, for example. Profiles {{also exist}} for {{applications such as}} using HART and wireless with <b>PROFIBUS,</b> and process automation devices via <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA. Other profiles have been specified for Motion Control (PROFIdrive) and Functional Safety (PROFIsafe).|$|E
50|$|PROFIsafe runs its own {{web portal}} with {{more details on}} the {{technology}} and hints for device developers, integrators and end users.The PROFIsafe standard is maintained, updated and marketed by <b>PROFIBUS</b> International, a non-profit organisation administered from Karlsruhe in Germany. <b>PROFIBUS</b> International is also responsible {{for the development of}} <b>PROFIBUS</b> and PROFINET, an Ethernet based fieldnetwork.|$|E
50|$|In {{process control}} systems, {{the market is}} {{dominated}} by FOUNDATION fieldbus and <b>PROFIBUS</b> PA. Both technologies use the same physical layer (2-wire manchester-encoded current modulation at 31.25 kHz) but are not interchangeable. As a general guide, applications which are controlled and monitored by PLCs (programmable logic controllers) tend towards <b>PROFIBUS,</b> and applications which are controlled and monitored by a DCS (digital/distributed control system) tend towards FOUNDATION Fieldbus. <b>PROFIBUS</b> technology is made available through <b>Profibus</b> International with headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany. FOUNDATION Fieldbus technology is owned and distributed by the Fieldbus Foundation of Austin, Texas.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, all the RPAs joined {{together}} under the international umbrella association <b>PROFIBUS</b> & PROFINET International (PI). Today, <b>PROFIBUS</b> is represented by 25 RPAs around the world (including PNO) with over 1400 members, including {{most if not all}} major automation vendors and service suppliers, along with many end users.|$|E
50|$|Communications {{between the}} {{controller}} and drives is done through PROFINET, <b>PROFIBUS,</b> or Ethernet.|$|E
50|$|However {{most the}} modern {{development}} and test equipment can equally communicate WTB/MVB frames {{as well as}} <b>Profibus</b> frames on the line as the telegram structure similar to <b>Profibus.</b> The WorldFIP connectors found usage in train equipment in France and North America (by Bombardier) until a joined effort on a common UIC train bus was started (with Siemens and other industry partners) {{that led to the}} WTB/MVB standard in late 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} are {{the same}} as used by <b>Profibus</b> (with two 9-pin Sub-D sockets per {{electrical}} device).|$|E
50|$|In {{excess of}} 30 million <b>PROFIBUS</b> nodes were {{installed}} {{by the end}} of 2009. 5 million of these are in the process industries.|$|E
50|$|<b>PROFIBUS</b> {{was defined}} in 1991/1993 in DIN 19245, was then {{included}} in EN 50170 in 1996 and, since 1999, established in IEC 61158/IEC 61784.|$|E
50|$|PROFINET {{is defined}} by <b>PROFIBUS</b> and PROFINET International (PI) and backed by the INTERBUS Club and, since 2004, {{is part of the}} IEC 61158 and IEC 61784 standards.|$|E
50|$|The HART Communication Foundation, <b>PROFIBUS</b> and Fieldbus Foundation have merged their {{individual}} dialects of the DDL. The result became the Electronic Device Description Language (EDDL), an IEC standard (IEC 61804).|$|E
50|$|It is {{used for}} {{connecting}} the stations programming (PC or personal computer), operator consoles, and other devices in the SIMATIC family. This technology has inspired the development of protocol <b>Profibus.</b>|$|E
50|$|An 8th layer {{has also}} been {{referenced}} to physical (real-world) controllers containing an external hardware device which interacts with an OSI model network. An {{example of this is}} ALI in <b>Profibus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>PROFIBUS</b> DP (Decentralised Peripherals) is used {{to operate}} sensors and {{actuators}} via a centralised controller in production (factory) automation applications. The many standard diagnostic options, in particular, are focused on here.|$|E
50|$|Controls for {{the newer}} KRC2 type use the Windows XP {{operating}} system. Systems contain a CD-ROM drive and USB ports, Ethernet connection and feature optional connections for <b>Profibus,</b> Interbus, DeviceNet and Profinet.|$|E
50|$|Controls {{for the old}} KRC1 types used Windows 95 to run VxWorks-based software. Peripheral {{equipment}} {{includes a}} CD-ROM and a disk drive; Ethernet, <b>Profibus,</b> Interbus, Devicenet and ASI sockets are also available.|$|E
50|$|<b>PROFIBUS</b> DP uses two core {{screened}} cable with a violet sheath, and runs at speeds between 9.6kbit/s and 12Mbit/s. A particular speed can be chosen for a network to give {{enough time for}} communication with all the devices present in the network. If systems change slowly then lower communication speed is suitable, and if the systems change quickly then effective communication will happen through faster speed. The RS485 balanced transmission used in <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP only allows 126 devices to be connected at once; however, more devices can be connected or the network expanded {{with the use of}} hubs or repeaters.|$|E
50|$|Discrete signals {{activate}} illuminated segments at common industrial control voltages (including 12Vdc, 24Vac/dc, 115Vac, 230Vac). Some units support fieldbus networked control through popular industrial networks such as Modbus, DeviceNet, <b>Profibus,</b> CAN-Open or ASi.|$|E
50|$|By using gateways, {{existing}} networks such as CANopen, DeviceNet, or <b>Profibus,</b> can {{be integrated}} into the EtherCAT environment seamlessly. Furthermore, gateways provide a trip-free migration path from a traditional fieldbus to EtherCAT, reducing further investment costs.|$|E
50|$|Although 4-20 mA {{has been}} the main field {{signalling}} standard, modern DCS systems can also support fieldbus digital protocols, such as Foundation Fieldbus, <b>profibus,</b> HART, Modbus, PC Link etc., and other digital communication protocols such as modbus.|$|E
50|$|PLC (Programmable logic controller) {{communicate}} {{using one}} of several possible open or proprietary protocols, such as EtherNet/IP, Modbus, Sinec H1, <b>Profibus,</b> CANopen, DeviceNet or FOUNDATION Fieldbus. The idea to use standard Ethernet makes these systems more inter-operable.|$|E
50|$|The {{harmonization}} and {{enhancement of}} the EDDL is being {{undertaken in the}} EDDL Cooperation Team (ECT). The ECT consists of {{the leadership of the}} Fieldbus Foundation, <b>Profibus</b> Nutzerorganisation (PNO), Hart Communication Foundation, OPC Foundation and the FDT Group.|$|E
50|$|DCS {{systems can}} {{normally}} also support such as Foundation Fieldbus, <b>profibus,</b> HART, Modbus, PC Link and other digital communication bus that carries not only {{input and output}} signals but also advanced messages such as error diagnostics and status signals.|$|E
5000|$|With Modbus, BacNet and <b>Profibus,</b> A/B {{labeling}} refers A as {{the negative}} green wire and B as the positive red wire, {{in the definition}} of the D-sub connector and M12 circular connector, {{as can be seen in}} <b>Profibus</b> guides. As long as standard excludes logic function of the generator or receiver, it would make sense A (green, negative) is higher than B (red, positive). However this contradicts the facts that an idle mark state is a logical one and the termination polarization puts B at a higher voltage in <b>Profibus</b> guidelines. That so-called 'Pesky Polarity' problem [...] raised confusion which made authors think A is inverting within the TIA-485-A standard itself [...] and advise to swap what is A and B in drivers and line labeling as can be read in a section of an application bulletin: [...] "Design Consideration #3: Sometimes Bus Node A Isn’t Really Bus Node A". It is now a common design decision to make this inversion which involves the following polarity chain: UART/MCU idle => TTL/CMOS = +5V => Line B voltage > Line A voltage, implying A, the green wire, is indeed connected to the driver inverting signal, as seen in a whitepaper.|$|E
50|$|Both Foundation Fieldbus and <b>Profibus</b> {{technologies}} are now commonly implemented within the process control field, both for new developments and major refits. In 2006, China saw the largest FF (Foundation Fieldbus) systems installations at NanHai and SECCO, each with around 15000 fieldbus devices connected.|$|E
50|$|The {{security}} layer FDL (Field bus Data Link) {{works with}} a hybrid access method that combines token passing with a master-slave method. In a <b>PROFIBUS</b> DP network, the controllers or process control systems are the masters and the sensors and actuators are the slaves.|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} absolute encoders {{there are}} several techniques for transmission of absolute encoder data, including parallel binary, analog current, analog voltage, PWM, SSI, BiSS interface, ISI, <b>Profibus,</b> Profinet, Ethernet Powerlink, EtherNet TCP/IP, Modbus, DeviceNet, CANopen, EtherCAT, Endat and Hiperface, depending on the manufacturer of the device.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{products}} is available that enable {{the connection of}} fieldbuses (<b>Profibus</b> and CAN) or sensor/actuator buses (AS-i, SSI, IO-Link) to a Sercos network. Gateways are available to integrate analog axes. Gateways are incorporated into Sercos devices (e.g., modular I/Os) or are connected as separate components in the network.|$|E
