50|$|Butterflies {{recorded}} include common blue, small copper, ringlet {{and small}} heath. Large populations of butterflies {{are seen as}} a result of the wide range of flowers and grasses. The moth population is well documented (some 80 species or more) and includes drinker, <b>poplar</b> <b>hawk</b> moth and burnished brass.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{species such}} as the water vole, grass snake, reed bunting, brown trout, and brook lamprey {{flourish}} here, despite being in decline {{in other parts of}} the country. Crayfish are very common in parts of the river. However, most, if not all, are now the alien American signal crayfish, having escaped from crayfish farms, which has replaced the native white-clawed crayfish in most southern rivers, although a small population still survives in the River Lambourn. And not forgetting the foundation to supporting this varied wildlife food chain, there are the insects, many hundreds of species, common and rare, that can be found in and around the River Kennet. There are large hatches of mayflies, whose long-tailed, short-lived adults are a favourite food of trout; many species of water beetle and insect larvae. Caddisflies are also very numerous, especially in the late summer. Alongside the river, the reed beds, grasses and other vegetation support many other insect species, including the scarlet tiger moth, <b>poplar</b> <b>hawk</b> moths and privet hawks.|$|E
