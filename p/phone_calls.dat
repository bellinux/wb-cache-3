40|$|We studied whether pharmacists {{involved}} in dis-charge planning can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes by providing telephone follow-up after hospital discharge. We conducted a randomized trial at the General Medical Service {{of an academic}} teaching hospital. We enrolled General Medical Ser-vice patients who received pharmacy-facilitated dis-charge from the hospital to home. The intervention consisted of a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> by a pharmacist 2 days after discharge. During the <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> phar-macists asked patients about their medications, in-cluding whether they obtained and understood how to take them. Two weeks after discharge, we mailed all patients a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with hospitalization and reviewed hospital records. Of the 1, 958 patients discharged from the General Medical Service from August 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999, 221 patients consented to participate. We ran-domized 110 to the intervention group (<b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> and 111 to the control group (no <b>phone</b> <b>call).</b> Patients returned 145 (66 %) surveys. More patients in the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> than the no <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group were satis-fied with discharge medication instructions (86 % vs. 61 %, P 0. 007). The <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> allowed pharmacists to identify and resolve medication-related problems for 15 patients (19 %). Twelve patients (15 %) con-tacted by telephone reported new medical problems requiring referral to their inpatient team. Fewer pa-tients from the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group returned to the emergency department within 30 days (10 % <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> vs. 24 % no <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> P 0. 005). A follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> by a pharmacist {{involved in}} the hospital care of patients was associated with increased pa-tient satisfaction, resolution of medication-related problems, and fewer return visits to the emergenc...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study {{analyzed}} the associations between mobile <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> frequency and duration with non-specific symptoms. Methods This {{study was conducted}} with a population group including 532 non-patient adults established by the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. The pattern of <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> using a mobile phone was investigated through face-to-face interview. Structured methods applied to quantitatively assess health effects are Headache Impact Test- 6 (HIT- 6), Psychosocial Well-being Index-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory, Korean-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 12 -item Short Form Health Survey where a higher score represents a higher greater health effect. Results The average daily <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> frequency showed a significant correlation with the PSS score in female subjects. Increases in the average duration of one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> were significantly correlated with increases in the severity of headaches in both sexes. The mean (standard deviation) HIT- 6 score in the subgroup of subjects whose average duration of one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was five minutes or longer was 45. 98 (8. 15), as compared with 42. 48 (7. 20) in those whose average duration of one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was < 5 minutes. The severity of headaches was divided into three levels according to the HIT- 6 score (little or no impact/moderate impact/substantial or severe impact), and a logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between an increased <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> duration and the headache severity. When the average duration of one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was five minutes or longer, the odds ratio (ORs) and the 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the moderate impact group were 2. 22 and 1. 18 to 4. 19, respectively. The OR and 95 % CI for the substantial or severe impact group were 4. 44 and 2. 11 to 8. 90, respectively. Conclusions Mobile <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> duration was not significantly associated with stress, sleep, cognitive function, or depression, but was associated with the severity of headaches...|$|R
