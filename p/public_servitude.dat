6000|$|The car {{had been}} once a common day-coach, but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductor's hat-band slips would never have {{recognised}} it in its transformation. Paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of <b>public</b> <b>servitude.</b> The whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows. From its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of Mexico. From its rear projected the Stars and Stripes and a busy stovepipe, the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease. The beholder's eye, regarding its gorgeous sides, found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire length--a single name, the audacious privilege of royalty and genius. Doubly, then, was this arrogant nomenclature here justified; for the name was that of [...] "Alvarita, Queen of the Serpent Tribe." [...] This, her car, was back from a triumphant tour of the principal Mexican cities, and now headed for San Antonio, where, according to promissory advertisement, she would exhibit her [...] "Marvellous Dominion and Fearless Control over Deadly and Venomous Serpents, Handling them with Ease as they Coil and Hiss to the Terror of Thousands of Tongue-tied Tremblers!" ...|$|E
60|$|The modest abode {{to which}} I have alluded forms {{one of a}} {{circular}} range of pretty, moderate-sized, two-story houses, all built on nearly the same plan, and each provided with its little grass-plot, its flowers, its tufts of box trimmed into globes and other fantastic shapes, and its verdant hedges shutting the house in from the common drive and dividing it from its equally cosey neighbors. Coming out of the door, and taking a turn round the circle of sister-dwellings, {{it is difficult to}} find your way back by any distinguishing individuality of your own habitation. In the centre of the Circus is a space fenced in with iron railing, a small play-place and sylvan retreat for the children of the precinct, permeated by brief paths through the fresh English grass, and shadowed by various shrubbery; amid which, if you like, you may fancy yourself in a deep seclusion, though probably the mark of eye-shot from the windows of all the surrounding houses. But, in truth, with regard {{to the rest of the}} town and the world at large, all abode here is a genuine seclusion; for the ordinary stream of life does not run through this little, quiet pool, and few or none of the inhabitants seem to be troubled with any business or outside activities. I used to set them down as half-pay officers, dowagers of narrow income, elderly maiden ladies, and other people of respectability, but small account, such as hang on the world's skirts rather than actually belong to it. The quiet of the place was seldom disturbed, except by the grocer and butcher, who came to receive orders, or by the cabs, hackney-coaches, and Bath-chairs, in which the ladies took an infrequent airing, or the livery-steed which the retired captain sometimes bestrode for a morning ride, or by the red-coated postman who went his rounds twice a day to deliver letters, and again in the evening, ringing a hand-bell, to take letters for the mail. In merely mentioning these slight interruptions of its sluggish stillness, I seem to myself to disturb too much the atmosphere of quiet that brooded over the spot; whereas its impression upon me was, that the world had never found the way hither, or had forgotten it, and that the fortunate inhabitants were the only ones who possessed the spell-word of admittance. Nothing could have suited me better, at the time; for I had been holding a position of <b>public</b> <b>servitude,</b> which imposed upon me (among a great many lighter duties) the ponderous necessity of being universally civil and sociable.|$|E
40|$|On January 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Montana {{reversed}} and remanded {{a district}} court decision that had foreclosed the public’s {{right to access}} the Ruby River. The Court held that {{the right of way}} was a public prescriptive easement, which extended beyond the road surface itself to include such area as necessary for the county to maintain the road {{in the interest of the}} public. Furthermore, the Court concluded that once a public right-of-way is established by prescriptive use, the scope of current and future use of such an easement is not limited to those historic adversarial practices which gave rise to the easement, but rather is subject to uses that are incidental to original uses or “reasonably foreseeable. ” Finally, the Court found the adjacent landowner’s takings claim to be without merit because any compensable interest had been expressly severed by his predecessor in title and the enactment of the state’s Stream Access Law, which encumbered his deed with an inalienable <b>public</b> <b>servitude.</b> This decision clarifies potential ambiguities surrounding the public’s right to use roads and bridges for recreational access to Montana’s public lands. Ultimately, the Court protected Montana’s legacy of public access to its world famous rivers, consistent with its decisions on the issue over the past several decades...|$|E
40|$|Washington {{courts are}} free to enforce publicland use servitudes. Of the {{elements}} required for a servitude to run with the land, form, notice, and touch and concern on the burden side do not bar running. Only the touch and concern element applied on the benefit side is a potential bar. Washington conceivably could allow <b>public</b> land use <b>servitudes</b> to run with the land by following the minority position of not requiring touch and concern on the benefit side. A less stringent theory, however, is available to enforce <b>public</b> land use <b>servitudes.</b> Washington has not adopted a rule that <b>public</b> <b>servitudes</b> are always in gross when government does not directly own benefited land. Therefore, the courts {{are free to}} require touch and concern on the benefit side while recognizing that the requirement is met when the promise benefits land, regardless of ownership. Based on their past record, Washington courts probably will enforce <b>public</b> land use <b>servitudes.</b> The courts have recognized and responded {{to the need for}} land use control to manage growth and development in the state, thereby furthering both public zoning and private subdivision regulation. Accordingly, to be consistent, the courts must enforce <b>public</b> land use <b>servitudes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{criticizes the}} {{jurisprudence}} {{by the three}} highest courts holding that <b>public</b> <b>servitudes</b> should not be compensated for. The two main arguments are article 1 of the First Additional Protocol to the ECnHR and the principle of equality before the public charges. Recent changes in the jurisprudence of the Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court indicate that the aforementioned principle is behind us. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In Flanders, the Government has {{recently}} established an innovative policy framework {{to preserve the}} water storage capacity in flood-prone areas. In this context, the concept of ‘Signal Areas’ (signaalgebieden) has been created. These areas are still undeveloped areas with a hard planning destination (residential and industrial areas) located in flood-prone areas. The framework outlines in what way one needs {{to deal with the}} flood risk in these areas. The intention is to work with tailor-made solutions for each separate area. For this purpose, a comprehensive tool-box is available, such as land reparcelling, spatial destination or zoning swapping (bestemmingsruil), regulations regarding appropriate construction methods and land use in urban planning regulations or in <b>public</b> utility <b>servitudes,</b> and the application of a sharpened Water Test. The final objective is to create an efficacious, area-oriented adaptation strategy for climate-proof spatial planning. In this contribution, the author will provide an insight into the legal design of the above-mentioned concepts and instruments, how they can contribute to a stronger linkage between water management and spatial planning and therefore to a solid climate change adaptation strategy, as well as the factors of success and failure of this new policy framework...|$|R
