2500|$|Günter Schmid, ex-owner of the ATS {{company that}} competed in Formula One for eight years, bought Rial in 1987, {{ahead of the}} {{reduction}} in power of the turbo-engines in 1988, {{and set up a}} Formula One team at Rial's base in Fußgönheim. With old-ATS designer Gustav Brunner, Schmid produced the Rial ARC1, powered by a Cosworth DFZ engine, an updated model of the ubiquitous design of the pre-turbo seasons. The ARC1, nicknamed the [...] "Blue Ferrari" [...] due to the similarities with the Brunner-designed Ferrari F1/87, featured a double wishbone <b>pullrod</b> suspension, with shock absorbers innovatively placed horizontally against the chassis. Andrea de Cesaris, with Marlboro sponsorship was hired to drive the car, which proved strong in testing due to a small fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|Like most 2012-specification cars, the F2012 {{featured}} a 'stepped nose' {{to conform to}} new FIA safety regulations. The F2012 {{featured a}} <b>pullrod</b> front suspension, which had not been seen in Formula One since the 2001 Minardi PS01 and Arrows A22 cars. A <b>pullrod</b> rear suspension was also introduced. L-shaped inlets also feature on the sidepods as the Ferrari F10 did in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The F14 T was {{unveiled}} on 25 January 2014. Like all 2014 Formula One cars, the F14 T featured a lower nose, with a flatter concept {{compared to other}} 2014 cars. Ferrari retained their <b>pullrod</b> front suspension, despite reports {{that it would be}} dropped. The rear was revised to accommodate the new powerplant and rear wing rules.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 60 of 1949-50 was Ducati's {{first in}} a 19 model year run of four-stroke, OHV single {{cylinder}} motorcycles that ended with the 125 Cadet/4 of 1967. The 60 used the 60 cc <b>pullrod</b> engine of the Cucciolo T3 moped, and a frame supplied by Caproni. The 60 Sport (actually 65 cc) of 1950-52 used Ducati's own frame, making it their first complete motorcycle. [...] For 1953 the name was changed to 65 Sport. They were followed by the 65T, 65TL, 65TS series.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard <b>pullrods</b> with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|R
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by <b>pullrods.</b> Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|R

5000|$|Initial {{testing of}} the BMW M12/13 turbo engine, a {{modification}} of the four-cylinder iron block and existing Formula Two four-valve cylinder head, began in late 1980 using a modified BT49 while Brabham's chief designer, Gordon Murray, worked on the BT50. The new car was completed in mid-1981 and carried over many elements from the BT49, which Brabham had run throughout the 1980 season. The BT50 had double wishbone suspension and <b>pullrod</b> activation coil spring/damper units, which were semi-inboard, while its monocoque was an aluminium tub with carbon stiffening panels. The team continued with its Hewland/Alfa gearbox, first used in 1976 when Brabham ran a V12 Alfa Romeo, but this was found to struggle with the power and torque of the BMW turbo engine.|$|E
5000|$|The MP4-28 {{features}} significant revisions {{compared to}} the MP4-27 as the team felt that the MP4-27 had {{reached the end of}} its development cycle, and that starting over would give the MP4-28 a wider scope for development. A <b>pullrod</b> front suspension {{similar to that of the}} Ferrari F2012 was introduced, the sidepods were revised to improve airflow over the rear of the car, while the rear suspension geometry was reconfigured to be more aerodynamic whilst incorporating a wishbone system designed to manage rear tyre wear by adding camber to the rear wheels as the speed increases, and relax as the car decelerates. The car's centre of gravity was altered by reducing the weight of the rollhoop and engine cover, allowing the team to raise the car's nose. The profile of the chassis was streamlined with the addition of a [...] "vanity plate" [...] to cover the [...] "stepped" [...] design seen throughout 2012. By contrast, the Lotus E21 was launched without a vanity plate, as the team felt that it was a purely cosmetic feature that added unnecessary weight; McLaren, on the other hand, described the weight change and aerodynamic benefits as a [...] "non-issue".|$|E
