5000|$|Research into AM {{functionality}} {{has been}} on the rise since AMs are one of the first lines of a defense against invasive pathogens. One of the most prominent fields is investigating liposomes as deliverers of antibiotics for treatment of respiratory intracellular infections. Intracellular parasites, such as M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, L. pneumophila, and F. tularensis, (to name a few) are taken up by AMs via phagocytosis, but are resistant to the biocidal mechanisms of AMs and can survive intracellularly, thus inducing severe respiratory infections. [...] Pulmonary tuberculosis is caused by M. tuberculosis, and is now a major infectious disease worldwide and its incidence is increasing, especially in association with the AIDS pandemic. For sterilization of intracellular parasites in AMs, antibiotics are normally given orally or intravenously, but much of the antibiotics disperse to many different tissues, diminishing its effectiveness. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of mannosylated liposomes is a much more direct, efficient route in targeting AMs; it enhances antimicrobial effect, reduces the dosage needed, and avoids unnecessary distribution to the blood. [...] Since mannose receptors are exclusively expressed on the surface of AM, mannosylation of liposomes is an appealing approach to cell-selective targeting to AM. The efficacy of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) incorporated into mannosylated liposomes (mannosylated CPFX-lipososomes) was examined in rats, and determined to be an efficient means to target AMs.|$|E

The first medical use of liquid breathing was treatment of premature babies and adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the 1990s. Liquid breathing was used in clinical trials after the development by Alliance Pharmaceuticals of the fluorochemical perfluorooctyl bromide, or perflubron for short. Current methods of positive-pressure ventilation can {{contribute to the development of}} lung disease in pre-term neonates, leading to diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of RNA interference (RNAi), which is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism, researchers have been studying the therapeutic potential of using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to treat diseases that are characterized by excessive gene expression. Excessive gene expression can be particularly harmful if it occurs in a vulnerable organ such as the lungs as they are essential for physiological respiration. Consequently, RNAi could offer an approach to treat such lung diseases. Parenteral administration of siRNA {{has been shown to}} be difficult due to degradation by nucleases in the systemic circulation and excretion by the kidneys. To avoid these issues and to achieve local delivery and local effects, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> has been proposed as an alternative administration route. Regarding this application, various animal studies have been conducted over the past few years. Therefore, this review presents a critical analysis of publications where <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of siRNA in animals has been reported. Such an analysis is necessary to determine the feasibility of this administration route and to define directions for future research. First, we provide background information on lungs, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration,</b> and delivery vectors. Thereafter, we present and discuss relevant animal studies. Though nearly all publications reported positive outcomes, several reoccurring challenges were identified. They relate to 1) the necessity, efficacy, and safety of delivery vectors, 2) the biodistribution of siRNA in tissues other than the lungs, 3) the poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo models, and 4) the long-term effects upon (repeated) administration of siRNA. Finally, we present recommendations for future research to define the route to go: towards safer and more effective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of siRNA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Pulmonary vaccination is gaining increasing attention {{for its ability to}} induce both local mucosal and systemic immune responses without the need for invasive injections. However, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of whole inactivated influenza virus (WIV) vaccine induces a Th 2 dominant systemic immune response while a more balanced Th 1 /Th 2 vaccine response may be preferred and only induces modest nasal immunity. This study evaluated immunity elicited by pulmonary versus intramuscular (i. m.) delivery of WIV, and tested whether the immune response could be improved by co-administration of delta (δ) -inulin, a novel carbohydrate-based particulate adjuvant. After <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> both unadjuvanted and δ-inulin adjuvanted WIV induced a potent systemic immune response, inducing higher serum anti-influenza IgG titers and nasal IgA titers than i. m. administration.

Pulmonary WIV alone or with δ-inulin induced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers > 40, titers which are considered protective against influenza virus.

40|$|The lungs are an {{attractive}} route for drug delivery {{due to their}} high epithelial surface area available for absorption, a thin epithelium and extensive vasculature to name a few. Accordingly, {{a vast number of}} small molecule drugs, peptides, and proteins have been used to investigate their translocation across the lungs with many of the tested candidates showing excellent pharmacokinetics following <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration.</b> Findings from all these studies over the years have strongly established the lungs as a route for drug delivery of small molecules and proteins. Nanoparticles on the other hand have gained increasing interest in drug delivery due to the wide variety of advantages they possess that allow for temporal, spatial and targeted delivery of therapeutics that can be fine tuned for various applications. Further, the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> of polymeric nanoparticle based drug delivery systems is of great interest for both systemic and localized therapies. However, little is understood about the relationship between nanoparticle size and its effect on pulmonary absorption from a drug delivery perspective. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of nanoparticle size on their biodistribution from lungs after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> with a special emphasis on their lymph node distribution. Interesting observations were made wherein polystyrene nanoparticles demonstrated significant translocation out of the lungs into extrapulmonary organs. Nanoparticles predominantly deposited in the regional lymph nodes surrounding the lungs as compared to that in other tissues. Furthermore, lymph node deposition of nanoparticles occurred in a time dependent and size dependent manner.

40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>administration</b> {{of drugs}} {{presents}} several advantages {{in the treatment}} of many diseases. Considering local and systemic delivery, drug inhalation enables a rapid and predictable onset of action and induces fewer side effects than other routes of administration. Three main inhalation systems have been developed for the aerosolization of drugs; namely, nebulizers, pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). The latter are currently the most convenient alternative as they are breath-actuated and do not require the use of any propellants. The deposition site in the respiratory tract and the efficiency of inhaled aerosols are critically influenced by the aerodynamic diameter, size distribution, shape and density of particles. In the case of DPIs, since micronized particles are generally very cohesive and exhibit poor flow properties, drug particles are usually blended with coarse and fine carrier particles. This increases particle aerodynamic behavior and flow properties of the drugs and ensures accurate dosage of active ingredients. At present, particles with controlled properties are obtained by milling, spray drying or supercritical fluid techniques. Several excipients such as sugars, lipids, amino acids, surfactants, polymers and absorption enhancers have been tested for their efficacy in improving drug <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe various observations that have been made in the field of inhalation product development, especially for the dry powder inhalation formulation, and to review the use of various additives, their effectiveness and their potential toxicity for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>administration.</b> Journal ArticleReviewSCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
