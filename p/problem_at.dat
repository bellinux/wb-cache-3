40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} value of health and {{behavioural}} <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 weeks as predictors of behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months in a whole year birth cohort.  STUDY DESIGN—Prospective birth cohort study.  SETTING—The socially and ethnically diverse city of Coventry.  MAIN OUTCOME—Parent reported behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months.  METHOD—Parent reported infant health and behaviour data were collected, using a validated questionnaire administered by the family health visitor at 8 weeks and 8 months, on 1541 infants participating in the Coventry cohort study. Sociodemographic data were collected at the health visitor's initial visit. Unadjusted relative risks (with 95 % confidence intervals (CI)) of behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months by sociodemographic variables and health and behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 weeks were estimated. Adjustment for confounding was made by logistic regression.  RESULTS—Infants reported to have behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 weeks had a significant risk of parent reported behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months (adjusted relative risk, 3. 44; 95 % CI, 1. 95 to 6. 09) after adjustment for other health outcomes and sociodemographic factors. Of infants with behavioural problems by 8 weeks of age, 19. 1 % {{were reported to have}} behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months.  CONCLUSIONS—Infants whose parents report behaviour problems by 8 weeks of age are at higher risk of behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months. However, despite the higher risk, the proportions of infants identified by behaviour at 8 weeks were too small for the early outcomes to be useful as predictors of behaviour at 8 months in the whole infant population. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether children with varying severity of congenital heart defects (CHDs) {{have a higher}} risk of internalizing or externalizing emotional <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 36 months of age. In addition, to analyze whether a history of emotional <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 6 or 18 months of age increases the risk of emotional <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 36 months in children with CHDs. METHODS: Prospective data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, was linked with a nationwide CHD registry, and 175 children with CHDs were identified in a cohort of 44, 104 children aged 36 months. Maternal reports on child characteristics were assessed by questionnaires at child age 6, 18, and 36 months. RESULTS: Children with CHDs did not have elevated scores on internalizing or externalizing <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 36 months of age compared with controls. Not even the children with CHDs with a history of emotional <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> age 6 or 18 months showed an increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of risk of emotional <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 36 months of age in children with CHDs could be a consequence of the completion of the most extensive medical treatment...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the threat}} from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of {{the threat posed by}} the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, had drawn up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E

Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> {{this time was}} a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E

5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Augustus {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} appointment for James to the United States Military Academy, but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled so James was appointed in 1838 by a relative, Reuben Chapman, who represented the First District of Alabama (where Mary Longstreet lived). James was a poor student academically and a disciplinary <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> West Point, ranking 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842. He was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including George Henry Thomas, William S.

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{determinants}} of parent-reported behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years {{and the value of}} behaviour <b>problems</b> reported <b>at</b> 8 and 18 months as predictors of behaviour at 3 years Setting A whole year birth cohort Coventry Main outcomes Parent-reported behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years Participants A total of 2580 infants were enrolled into the Coventry Cohort Study at the birth visit by their family health visitor. Data on parent-reported behaviour at all three ages (8 months, 18 months and 3 years) were available on 775 infants. Results Living in rented accommodation [adjusted OR 2. 38 (95 % CI 1. 36, 4. 21); OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence intervals] and living in a smoking household [adjusted OR 2. 47 (95 % CI 1. 53, 3. 99) ] were independently associated with parent-reported behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years after controlling for other sociodemographic variables in logistic regression. The risk of behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years was increased in those reporting behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 months [OR 3. 77 (95 % CI 1. 73, 8. 20) ] and 18 months [OR 5. 84 (95 % CI 3. 34, 10. 23) ] after adjustment for sociodemographic variables and other health <b>problems.</b> Behaviour <b>at</b> 8 months as a predictor of behaviour at 3 years had a sensitivity of 13. 9 %, a specificity of 95. 7 %, a positive predictive value of 32. 6 %, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 3. 23 and 0. 90. For behaviour at 18 months, the sensitivity was 35. 6 %, the specificity 92. 9 %, the positive predictive value 42. 9 %, and positive and negative likelihood ratios 5. 01 and 0. 69. Conclusions Parent-reported behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 8 and 18 months are highly specific but not particularly sensitive as predictors of behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years. Assuming the availability of an effective early intervention, use of a question such as that in the Warwick Child Health and Morbidity Profile at 8 and 18 months will identify, respectively, 21 % and 36 % of children at risk of parent-reported behaviour <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> 3 years...|$|R
