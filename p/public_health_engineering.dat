The major activity, which puts maximum pressure on these organisations, is the annual event of the Ratha Yatra held during June- July.

The roadmap aimed at making the five largest utilities, called the WASAs, more professional and accountable through the appointment of new managing directors from the private sector and through the signing of performance contracts between the provincial government and the utilities.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} decades of Pakistan's modern history, in the largest cities City Development Authorities and their Water and Sanitation Authorities (WASAs) were {{responsible}} for water supply and sanitation. In towns and villages water supply facilities were built and operated by the provincial governments through their <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Engineering</b> Departments (PHEDs). This was initially done without much participation by local government and communities in decision-making. However, in 1992 the federal government launched a Social Action Plan, which emphasized user participation, hygiene promotion and the use low-cost technologies in water supply and sanitation.

2500|$|Infrastructure {{work now}} began in Marshall Heights. A city survey in 1949 found that just 30 {{percent of all}} homes in Marshall Heights had access to running water and the city sewer system. City {{engineers}} estimated in May 1950 {{that it would take}} $2 million to give the 500 homes in Marshall Heights water and sewer lines, and to grade and pave every street. But with an annual infrastructure budget of just $1 million a year for the entire city, they said improvements in Marshall Heights would take time. Nevertheless, the District agreed to spend $320,000 on water and sewer mains, and paving secondary streets, in 1950 alone. Paving of main streets, and adding sidewalks, curbs, and gutters was not planned, as this was not deemed urgent. By November, 30 homes on five blocks between E. 50th and E. 51st Streets had received water and sewer mains. Another $100,000 was spent on Marshall Heights infrastructure in 1952. By the end of 1952, 134 homes in Marshall Heights had water and sewer. But only 72 homeowners had actually hooked up to the system. City officials said the cost of a hookup, which ran from $1,000 to $1,500, and the $135 frontage fee were simply too high for most residents to afford. The city had the option of going to court to force residents to hookup and pay the frontage fee, but officials said this was useless because residents simply didn't have the income. Spending large amounts of money on Marshall Heights deeply angered some city officials. William H. Cary, Jr., director of the D.C. Bureau of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Engineering,</b> claimed, [...] "This will never be a place the District government will be proud of." [...] But work continued, and additional street grading and water and sewer lines were laid in 1957. [...] To counteract criticism that Marshall Heights residents didn't care about their neighborhood, the Marshall Heights Civic Association engaged in a two-month-long campaign to remove trash and weeds, sweep streets, improve empty lots, and generally eliminate blight from the neighborhood. The campaign won extensive media notice. The city spent a total of $700,000 on roads and water and sewer lines by the end of 1958.|$|E
