50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>malate</b> is a {{compound}} with formula K2(C2H4O(COO)2). It is the potassium salt of malic acid.|$|E
50|$|As a food additive, {{it has the}} E number E351. It is used as acidity {{regulator}} or acidifier for use in, for example, canned vegetables, soups, sauces, fruit products and soft drinks. It also acts as an antioxidant and as a food flavor. It is an important compound in the transport of nitrate from the roots of a plant to {{the leaves of the}} plant. <b>Potassium</b> <b>malate</b> is the salt that transports from the leaves to the root. At the root the potassium maleate oxidizes to potassium carbonate, then is converted to potassium nitrate by soil nitrate and transported back to the leaves.|$|E
40|$|Low-grade {{metabolic}} acidosis, consecutive {{to excessive}} catabolism of sulfur amino acids {{and a high}} dietary Na:K ratio, is a common feature of Western food habits. This metabolic alteration may exert various adverse physiological effects, especially on bone, muscle and kidneys. To assess the actual effects of various K salts, {{a model of the}} Westernised diet has been developed in rats: slight protein excess (20 % casein); cations provided as non-alkalinising salts; high Na:K ratio. This diet resulted in acidic urine (pH 5 · 5) together with a high rate of divalent cation excretion in urine, especially Mg. Compared with controls, K supplementation as KCl accentuated Ca excretion, whereas potassium bicarbonate or malate reduced Mg and Ca excretion and alkalinised urine pH (up to 8). In parallel, citraturia was strongly increased, together with 2 -ketoglutarate excretion, by potassium bicarbonate or malate in the diet. Basal sulfate excretion, in the range of 1 mmol/d, was slightly enhanced in rats fed the <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> diet. The present model of low-grade metabolic acidosis indicates that <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> may be as effective as KHCO 3 to counteract urine acidification, to limit divalent cation excretion and to ensure high citrate concentration in urine...|$|E
40|$|Kinetics and {{osmoregulation}} {{of cotton}} (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber growth (primarily extension) have been studied. Growth {{is dependent on}} turgor pressure in the fiber. It is inhibited when {{a decrease in the}} water potential of the culture medium due to an addition of Carbowax 6000, equals the turgor pressure of the fiber. <b>Potassium</b> and <b>malate</b> accumulate in the fiber and reach peak levels when the growth rate is highest. Maximum concentrations of <b>potassium</b> and <b>malate</b> reached in the fiber can account for over 50 % of the osmotic potential of the fiber. As growth slows down, levels of <b>potassium</b> and <b>malate</b> decrease and turgor pressure declines. Cotton ovules are capable of fixing H 14 CO 3 − in the dark, predominantly into malate. Fiber growth is inhibited by the absence of potassium and/or atmospheric CO 2. We suggest that <b>potassium</b> and <b>malate</b> act as osmoregulatory solutes and that malate, at least in part, arises from dark CO 2 fixation reactions...|$|R
40|$|Effects of the {{addition}} of semi-organic NLO materials <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>malate</b> monohydrate (PHMM) and sodium acid phthalate (NaAP) on the growth and various properties of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) single crystal grown by the slow cooling method have been studied. The metastable zonewidth of pure and doped ADP were determined and compared. Nucleation studies show that metastable zonewidth and growth rate of ADP are enhanced by the dopants PHMM and NaAP. The grown crystals were subjected to Powder XRD, UV-vis, TG/DSC, microhardness and dielectric studies. The grown crystal has good optical transparency in the entire visible region, which is an essential requirement for a nonlinear crystal. Dielectric measurements reveal that doped ADP crystals have low dielectric loss and higher dielectric constant than pure ADP. The relative SHG efficiency measurements revealed that the dopant has enhanced the efficiency. Presence of dopant was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|Isolated bacteroids of Bradyrhizobium japonicum {{accumulated}} exogenously supplied [(sup 35) S]methionine or [(sup 3) H]leucine {{and incorporated}} them into cytosolic proteins. The accumulation of these labeled amino acids was inhibited by azide. Only 3 to 6 % of these accumulated amino acids {{were incorporated into}} protein. Protein synthesis was not stimulated by incubation of bacteroids {{in the presence of}} <b>potassium</b> salts, <b>malate,</b> or amino acids, but azide, chloramphenicol, and acridine did inhibit the process. No prominent differences were observed in autoradiograms after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of (sup 35) S-labeled bacteroid proteins as a function of nodule age. The rates of protein synthesis and protein turnover declined during nodule development. Protein synthesis declined about 60 % between 14 and 20 days after planting, which is the period of a rapid increase in acetylene reduction activity. This correlation suggests a metabolic mechanism by which significant amounts of cellular energy are diverted to the nitrogen fixation process...|$|R
40|$|Three {{potassium}} salts of organic acids, namely malate, citrate and tartrate, have been sprayed onto flue-cured blend tobacco and subsequently tested for their performance as burn additives in cigarettes. In one experiment where <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> {{was added to}} vary the final tobacco potassium from ca. 3. 1 % to 8. 3 % (wet weight), an almost linearly reduction in puff temperature was measured. This {{was accompanied by a}} gradual increase in the cigarette's pressure drop. In another set of experiments where the final tobacco potassium contents were increased to ca. 5. 1 %, the three {{potassium salts}} showed almost equal reduction in the mainstream nicotine-free-dry-particulate-matter (NFDPM) at 32 - 35 %, nicotine at 25 - 32 % and carbon monoxide at 24 - 35 %. Puff number showed ca. 23 % increase with malate, 13 % with citrate and almost unchanged for tartrate. Evidence of melting and coating by <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> was discovered in cigarette ash by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This contributed to a noticeable change in ash morphology: small ash particles appeared to be coated and more tightly bonded together by the melt. This phenomenon was thought to be able to restrict the airflow during puffing, hence causing the measured increase in pressure drop, and the reductions in puff temperature, NFDPM, nicotine and carbon monoxide...|$|E
40|$|Methyl jasmonate (MJ) and {{a mixture}} of G 1, G 2, and G 3 (G-substances) {{inhibited}} stomatal opening in abaxial epidermis of Commelina benghalensis and complete closure occurred at 10 − 6 molar MJ, or 10 − 3 molar G-substances compared to 10 − 5 molar abscisic acid (ABA). Proline, even at 10 − 3 molar caused only a partial stomatal closure. Apart from ABA, other endogenous plant growth regulators do regulate stomata. Reduction in the stimulation by fusicoccin and complete stomatal closure, at 30 millimolar KCl or less, were affected by ABA, MJ, or G-substances, but not by proline. The action of MJ or G-substances was similar to ABA in decreasing proton efflux and the levels of <b>potassium,</b> <b>malate,</b> or reducing sugars. Proline, however, interfered with starch-sugar interconversion but {{had no effect on}} proton efflux or potassium content of epidermis...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular {{survival}} {{and development of}} the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium lophurae have been obtained in vitro in a medium consisting of an extract of duck red blood cells prepared in a special nutrient solution (1). When the erythrocyte extract was further supplemented with adenosinetriphosphate and sodium pymvate, all or nearly all the extracellular parasites continued their development during the first 2 days of cultivation. By the 3 rd day about 15 to 25 per cent of the free parasites seen in stained films appeared degenerate and by the 4 th day about 50 per cent. Out of many changes in the composition of the culture medium which have been tried, two, the addition of <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> (2) and the addition of concentrates rich in coenzyme A, have been found to improve the extracellular survival of the parasites. Methods and Materials These have been essentially identical with the methods and materials used in the previous work (1) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of the pasteurization and filtration on selected chemical compounds in beer. Specifically, the influence on elemental composition, content of organic acids, carbohydrates and phenolic substances was studied. Optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) was used for elemental analysis of beer. Analysis of organic acids was evaluated by Ion chromatography. For analysis of carbohydrates was used High performance liquid chromatography with ELSD detector (HPLC-ELSD), phenolic compounds was evaluated by HPLC with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Data from analysis of beer was performed by usage of statistical methods (analysis of variance and principal component analysis). Parameters that showed the most significant differences between individual groups of beers were obtained. Correlations between the variables and the technological beer processing operations were found. 12 parameters of total 23 were affected. The effect of filtration and pasteurization was observed in content of the iron, silicon, <b>potassium</b> and magnesium, <b>malate,</b> monosaccharides glucose and fructose and phenolic compounds...|$|R
50|$|There {{is no one}} food or {{nutrient}} {{capable of}} providing adequate bone health on its own. Instead, a balanced diet sufficient in fruits and vegetables for their vitamins, minerals, and alkalinizing substrates {{is thought to be}} most beneficial. High protein diets supply larger amounts of amino acids that could be degraded to acidic compounds. Protein consumption above the Recommended Dietary Allowance is also known to be beneficial to calcium utilization. Overall it is understood that high-protein diets have a net benefit for bone health because changes in IGF-I and PTH concentrations outweigh the negative effects of metabolic acid production. The source of protein, plant or animal, does not matter in terms of acid produced from amino acid metabolism. Any differences in Methionine and Cysteine content is not significant to affect the overall potential renal acid load (PRAL) of the food. In addition to their acid precursor protein content, plants also contain significant amounts of base precursors. Potassium bicarbonate, a basic salt, is produced via the metabolism of other organic <b>potassium</b> salts: citrate, <b>malate,</b> and gluconate, which are substantial in plants. The discrepancy observed in PRAL is accounted for by differences in base precursor content.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are natural suppliers of potassium, bicarbonate, or bicarbonate precursors such as citrate, malate and others-hence, possessing potential effects on citraturia. We aimed to compare the acute effects of a noncitrus (melon) fruit vs citric ones (orange and lime) on citraturia and other lithogenic parameters. Patients and Methods: Two-hour urine samples were collected from 30 hypocitraturic stone-forming patients after an overnight fast and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of 385 mL (13 oz) of either freshly squeezed orange juice (n = 10), freshly blended melon juice (n = 10), or freshly squeezed lime juice (n = 10). Urinary citrate, potassium, pH, and other lithogenic parameters were determined and net gastrointestinal alkali absorption (NGIA) was calculated. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and pH from juices were determined. Results: Significant and comparable increases of mean urinary citrate were observed in all groups, whereas mean urinary potassium, pH, and NGIA were significantly increased only after consumption of melon and orange juices. the pH of melon juice was higher and the PRAL value was more negative compared with orange juice, indicating a higher alkalinity. Conclusions: These findings suggested that melon, a noncitrus source of <b>potassium,</b> citrate, and <b>malate,</b> yielded an increase in urinary citrate excretion equivalent to that provided by orange, and hence represents another dietary alternative {{for the treatment of}} hypocitraturic stone-formers. Despite its low potassium content, lime also produced comparable increases in citraturia possibly because of its high citric acid content.

40|$|We {{wished to}} {{determine}} whether the capacity of the sugar uptake mechanisms of guard cells of the Argenteum mutant of pea (Pisum sativum L.) sufficed to support a concurrent stomatal opening movement. Sugar uptake by guard cell protoplasts was determined by silicone-oil-filtering centrifugation. The protoplasts took up [14 C]glucose, [14 C]fructose, and [14 C]sucrose (Suc), apparently in symport with protons. Mannose, galactose, and fructose competed with Glc for transport by a presumed hexose carrier. The uptake of Glc saturated with a Km of 0. 12 mm and a Vmax of 19 fmol cell− 1 h− 1. At external concentrations 1 mm, a non-saturating component. At apoplastic sugar concentrations below 4 mm, sugar import was estimated to be mainly in the form of hexoses and too slow to support a simultaneous stomatal opening movement. If, however, during times of high photosynthesis and transpiration, the apoplastic Suc concentration rose and entered the range of non-saturating import, absorbed Suc could replace <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> as the osmoticum for the maintenance of stomatal opening...|$|E
40|$|Recovery of L-malic acid from a {{by-product}} of alcoholic fermentation process containing mainly sugars, alcohols, minerals, malate and other organic salts was investigated {{in order to ensure}} a cost-effective valorisation. Environmental-friendly process could consist in a two-stage electrodialysis process associating concentration electrodialysis (CED) and bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). The feasibility of the CED stage has been assessed in a previous study [1]. BMED with two-compartment cell (BP/C) was investigated on a model <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> solution over the range 0. 4 - 1. 2 equiv. L- 1 giving current efficiency, L-malic acid recovery and specific energy consumption of 87 - 97 %, 93 - 97 % and 1. 15 - 1. 27 kWh kg(- 1) L-malic acid, respectively. These performances were confirmed by runs on real concentrate obtained from the previous CED stage. However, specific energy consumption was significantly increased (50 %) by the presence of anionic impurities, stressing the importance of a very efficient preliminary purification step. At last, the two-stage electrodialysis process allowed malate purity to be raised from 9 % in the initial effluent to more than 70 %. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In Vitis vinifera L. berries, {{the onset}} of {{ripening}} (known as ‘‘veraison’’) involves loss of turgor (P) in the mesocarp cells. We hypothesized that P loss was associated with an accumulation of apoplastic solutes in mesocarp tissue prior to veraison. Apoplastic sap was extracted from the mesocarp by centrifugation at the appropriate gravity to measure the apoplast solute potential (Ws A) and assay the sap composition. The Ws A was about- 0. 2 MPa early in development, decreased about 1. 0 MPa by veraison, and continued to decrease during ripening to almost- 4. 0 MPa {{by the end of}} berry development. <b>Potassium,</b> <b>malate,</b> tar-trate, proline, glucose, fructose, and sucrose were quantified in apoplastic sap. The calculated contribution of these solutes was about 50 % of the total Ws A preveraison, but increased to about 75 % as fructose and glucose accu-mulated during ripening. The contribution of the estimated matric potential to apoplast water potential decreased during development and was only 1. 5 % postveraison. We conclude that high concentrations of solutes accumulated in the mesocarp apoplast prior to veraison, and that P loss was a direct result of decreased Ws A. Because Ws A decreased before veraison, our findings suggest that apoplast solutes {{play an important role in}} the events of cellular metabolism that lead to {{the onset of}} ripening...|$|E
40|$|Potassium (K) organic anion salts, such as {{potassium}} citrate or <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> in plant foods, may counteract low-grade metabolic acidosis induced by western diets, but {{little is known}} about the effect of other minor plant anions. Effects of K salts (chloride, citrate, galacturonate or tartrate) were thus studied on the mineral balance and digestive fermentations in groups of 6 -week-old rats adapted to an acidogenic/ 5 % inulin diet. In all diet groups, substantial amounts of lactate and succinate were present in the caecum, besides SCFA. SCFA were poorly affected by K salts conditions. The KCl-supplemented diet elicited an accumulation of lactate in the caecum; whereas the lactate caecal pool was low in rats fed the potassium tartrate-supplemented (K TAR) diet. A fraction of tartrate (around 50 %) was recovered in urine of rats fed the K TAR diet. Potassium citrate and potassium galacturonate diets exerted a marked alkalinizing effect on urine pH and promoted a notable citraturia (around 0 · 5 μmol/ 24 h). All the K organic anion salts counteracted Ca and Mg hyperexcretion in urine, especially potassium tartrate as to magnesuria. The present findings indicate that K salts of unabsorbed organic anions exert alkalinizing effects when metabolizable in the large intestine, even if K and finally available anions (likely SCFA) are not simultaneously bioavailable. Whether this observation is also relevant for a fraction of SCFA arising from dietary fibre breakdown (which represents the major organic anions absorbed in the digestive tract in man) deserves further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of L-glutamate and L-glutamine by enterocyte mitochondria {{was supported}} by malate. The stimulation of the rate of oxidation of the two amino acids by small amounts of added malate was 93 % and 76 % respectively. This could not {{be accounted for by}} the oxidation of the small amounts of malate added. Amino-oxyacetate added initially inhibited malate-supported oxidation of L-glutamate by 81 % and that of L-glutamine by 38 %. The inhibition of L-glutamate oxidation was partially reversed by L-glutamine. The dicarboxylate-carrier inhibitor 2 -phenylsuccinate inhibited the malate-supported oxidation of both amino acids, but appeared to be slightly stimulatory to L-glutamine oxidation when added initially. The inhibition of L-glutamate oxidation was reversed by L-glutamine. The mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) inhibited malate-supported oxidation of L-glutamate by 78 % when added initially. The oxidation of L-glutamine was completely inhibited. However, the uncoupler stimulated the oxidation of both amino acids when added finally. Pyruvate inhibited aspartate synthesis when either of these amino acids was the main substrate, alanine being synthesized. There was no effect on O 2 uptake. Mitochondria did not swell in KCl solution, but swelled rapidly in water. Mitochondrial swelling in potassium phosphate and potassium acetate solutions was activated by valinomycin {{and to a lesser extent}} by the further addition of FCCP. With <b>potassium</b> <b>malate,</b> swelling was mainly activated by phosphate. The swelling of enterocyte mitochondria in potassium glutamate was slow. In glutamine solution, mitochondrial swelling was greater and appeared to be enhanced by the initial presence of small amounts of phosphate...|$|E
40|$|The present review {{examines}} {{the importance of}} dietary organic anions in preventive nutrition. Organic anions are chiefly supplied by plant foods, as partially neutralised K salts such as potassium citrate, <b>potassium</b> <b>malate</b> and, to a lesser extent, oxalate or tartrate salts. Animal products may also supply K anions, essentially as phosphate, but also as lactate {{as a result of}} fermentative or maturation processes, but these K salts have little alkalinising significance. Citrate and malate anions are absorbed in the upper digestive tract, while a substantial proportion is probably metabolised in the splanchnic area. Whatever their site of metabolism, these anions finally yield KHCO 3 which is used by the kidneys to neutralise fixed acidity. This acidity essentially reflects the oxidation of excess S amino acids to sulfate ions, which is mainly related to the dietary protein level. Failure to neutralise acidity leads to low-grade metabolic acidosis, with possible long-term deleterious effects on bone Ca status and on protein status. Furthermore, low-grade acidosis is liable to affect other metabolic processes, such as peroxidation of biological structures. These metabolic disturbances could be connected with the relatively high incidence of osteoporosis and muscle-protein wasting problems observed in ageing individuals in Europe and Northern America. Providing a sufficient supply of K organic anions through fruit and vegetable intake should be recommended, fostering the actual motivational campaigns (2 ̆ 7 five (or ten) per d 2 ̆ 7) already launched to promote the intake of plant foods rich in complex carbohydrates and various micronutrients...|$|E
