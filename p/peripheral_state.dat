40|$|The {{structural}} inequalities of the world-system and a neoliberal {{system of}} academic capitalism allow core states to attract students from <b>peripheral</b> <b>states,</b> thereby perpetuating their dominance over them through corresponding brain gain and drain. While international student mobility (ISM) within the global knowledge economy has remained {{largely on the}} fringes of academic debate, human capital movement from periphery to core has traditionally been viewed as a contributor to brain drain in <b>peripheral</b> <b>states.</b> Neoliberal scholars have recently countered the idea of brain drain with ‘brain circulation’ and claims of a mutually beneficial relationship between core student-receiving <b>states</b> and <b>peripheral</b> student-sending <b>states</b> (especially in terms of development). Guided by a world-systems theory approach, this paper tests such claims in the context of ISM to the United States (US), which hosts more international students than any other. It finds reasons to suggest that the idea of periphery brain circulation, while conveniently compatible with the motives of neoliberal ISM-promoters, does not reflect reality. Furthermore, it calls for the reconceptualization of the terms brain drain and brain circulation, concluding that the former refers to the effect of ISM in <b>peripheral</b> <b>states,</b> whereas the latter refers to that in core states...|$|R

Our analysis reveals that the flow of these norms has fashioned a multi-layered transnational legal order. The flow of norms involves the dynamic processes of ‘uploading’ by powerful markets and ‘downloading’ by <b>peripheral</b> <b>states.</b> Asymmetry in economic power between states drives the transnational flow of norms, which are carried by players such as financial intermediaries, professionals, international organisations and regulators. We observe that various factors may affect the outcomes of transnational flow, resulting in different degrees of convergence or divergence in <b>peripheral</b> <b>states.</b> We examine the norms governing OTC derivatives and find that the transnational flow of contractual norms (specifically the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement) results in {{a high degree of}} convergence. However, the downloading of regulatory norms depends on the economic situation, market conditions and other national interests of <b>peripheral</b> <b>states.</b> This article shows that powerful states can expect smaller markets to accept uploaded norms when the benefits involved are reciprocal and the norms do not conflict with more pressing local concerns. Under the right conditions, therefore, regulations can be globally harmonised without the need for international treaties...|$|R

This research undertaking attempts to reformulate World System theory, an antiquated theoretical perspective based on the periphery's economic dependence on core nation-states and the resultant exploitative relationship that occurs.

Such changes are attributed both to the multi-polarity of the world stage and the cultural construction of rational progress.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{questions about}} the effect of the introduction of the euro on price differentials across the Union and also on the cost of capital in its member countries, which may account for capital flows from the slow growing centre to the more buoyant <b>peripheral</b> <b>states.</b> Nominal interest rates on government securities have converged virtually completely with the announcement and introduction of the euro, indicating that risk premia resulting from uncertain exchange rates and other causes have disappeared. As these premia are generally believed to have been higher in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>states,</b> these should now be benefiting from a reallocation of capital in their favour. As a result, labour productivity and prices of goods that are not traded internationally can be expected to rise faster than would have been the case without the euro. A sizeable inflation differential among the Euro countries is a natural aspect of the real convergence process that has been brought about by European integration in general and by the euro in particular. So, while high inflation at time of booms in domestic demand may be a useful way to contain domestic imbalances, prices and wages then need to come down after the boom is over. The adoption of policies promoting wage and price flexibility is a key step in the future of the Euro area. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} studies {{has found that}} {{corruption}} has a significant impact upon FDI decisions, however to date there has been scant investigation into longer term investments made by firms and their relative proclivity to reinvest. Further, there is particularly little work on reinvestment choices made on the transitional periphery of post-state socialist countries and how these might differ from the more stable transitional economies of central and Eastern Europe. Utilising 2005 World Bank Enterprise Survey data, this study explores the relationship between corruption and MNEs’ strategic decision to reinvest profits. From an institutionalist starting point, we find variation in the impact of different dimensions of corruption upon reinvestment; pervasive corruption impacts negatively upon reinvestment, but its effects are more pronounced in the transitional periphery. Perceived robust legal institutions have a positive correlation with reinvestment, but again, the negative effects are most pronounced on the transitional <b>peripheral</b> <b>state</b> socialist states. We ascribe this disparity to greater institutional fluidity, and explore why this context has particularly adverse effects. Finally, we find that firm level attributes of larger size and greater age {{play an important role}} in positive reinvestment decisions, appearing to mitigate the worst consequences of this fluidity...|$|E

40|$|The thesis has two aims. The {{first one}} is to {{contribute}} to the field of political and historical sociology through an understanding of the processes of state formation in a Third World country. The second aim is to describe and analyze the development of the Nicaraguan state from independence to 1990. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation theories of the nation-state and state formation are discussed and criticized. The Eurocentric origin and bias of the nation-state concept is seen as a significant problem in conceptualizing and understanding state formation in the Third World. Taking into consideration the experience of state formation in Western Europe, a theoretical frame work is presented that operationalize the concept of nation-state and the process of state formation. This frame work is further elaborated by discussions of some central aspects pertaining to countries of the Third World that differentiate them from the Western European experience. Nation-state formation is thus seen as a process in the international, "national" and state arenas encompassing the strengthening and the coordination of repressive, extractive and integrative capacities of the state. A central aspect in understanding state capacities is through the conceptual pair of infrastructural and despotic power. The empirical study focuses on the development (state formative processes) of the Nicaraguan state from independence in 1823 until the Sandinista electoral defeat in 1990. The role of the colonial legacy, the world capitalist economy and the international system of states in influencing the shape of the Nicaraguan state is analyzed. Through the history of Nicaraguan state formation, phases are outlined with different state formative characteristics. State disintegrative phases are represented by the city-states of early independent Nicaragua and the protectorate years at the beginning of the 20 th century. Reproductive peripheralness is seen as dominant during the second half of the 19 th century and the Somoza dynasty. Finally projects of nation-state formation are to be found during the Zelaya regime and during the Sandinista regime. The importance of the agroexport economy, foreign interventions and a fractured social formation is seen as an important factor blocking the development of a Nicaraguan nation-state. Through the notion of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>state</b> and frameworked in the concepts of extractive, repressive and integrative capacities the author provides new theoretical insights on Third World states dynamics in creating and maintaining a national arena, squeezed between international and local forces.

Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{designated}} greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as {{a candidate}} species to receive protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2010. Several states in the western United States have developed management plans to mitigate the listing factors identified by the USFWS. However, sage-grouse populations inhabit sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems that may transcend multiple state boundaries. If sage-grouse inter-seasonal movements encompass habitats in multiple states and if state-centric wildlife management strategies differ, species conservation may be further complicated. Additionally, if these populations are located in <b>peripheral</b> <b>state</b> boundary areas, they may also receive less management focus both because of their remoteness and state agency emphasis on interior populations. The Grouse Creek sage-grouse population that inhabits extreme northwestern Utah where the state borders eastern Nevada and southern Idaho exemplifies this situation.
