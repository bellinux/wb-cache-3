25|$|In Book I Thomas {{addresses}} Froude's {{claims in}} the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations {{about the condition of}} blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.|$|E

25|$|Cooper and Brand {{manage to}} dock with the Endurance, {{but it is}} low on fuel and caught in Gargantua's pull. Cooper decides to use Gargantua as a {{gravitational}} slingshot to propel the ship toward Edmunds' planet. To shed weight and create propulsion for Brand and CASE to complete the journey, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves into the black hole. After slipping past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a tesseract resembling infinite streams of bookshelves capable of <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> Murphy's bedroom {{at different points in}} time. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created by future humans to enable him to communicate with Murphy through time. Using Morse code to embed a message into the second hand of the watch that he gave her before he left, Cooper relays the quantum data Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation.|$|E
25|$|Bob Clendenin as Tom Gazelian – Jules' widowed {{neighbor}} who expresses his attraction {{for her in}} weird ways, makes wine in his garage, and is always doing things for Jules and the gang without getting anything back {{in an attempt to}} become part of their group. He is frequently found to be <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> Jules' kitchen window, unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of in the kitchen with the others. His behaviour is often weird and creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

500|$|For the HBO {{television}} film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily {{took the lead}} role in what she felt was [...] "one of the best scripts to {{have come out of}} America". Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. [...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work. Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as [...] "one of her most brilliant performances", adding [...] "we seem to be <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> a soul as embattled as its body." [...] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers in the 1970s {{saw some}} major {{advances}} in astronomical imaging technology beginning with Antoine Labeyrie's invention of speckle interferometry, {{a process that}} significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing. It increased the optical resolution of ground-based telescopes, allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse's photosphere. With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson, Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, astrophysicists began <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant, causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection. [...] But {{it was not until}} the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and infrared imaging. Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad-hoc interferometric array. [...] The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star's photosphere. These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun, taken first from ground-based interferometers and later from higher-resolution observations of the COAST telescope. The [...] "bright patches" [...] or [...] "hotspots" [...] observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface.|$|E

Ching asked for a pledge by both sides to discontinue the use of labor spies. The union protested, claiming they had made no such use of spies. Ching summoned one of his assistants, a young man whom Ching had observed <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> records and communications {{that had nothing to}} do with his job. Ching said that he had intentionally provided misinformation to the assistant. Ching then announced that he would not fire the employee, and also that the transit company had used both spies and provocateurs against the union, but that the company would cease that practice. Encouraged by such openness, the union promptly reached an agreement with the company.|$|E
2500|$|He {{signed to}} drive the No. 36 M's-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for MB2 Motorsports. In his first year of competition, Schrader had two top 10s and {{finished}} 18th in the standings. He posted five top 10s in 2001, but dropped to 19th in the standings. While competing in the Daytona 500, {{he was involved in}} a final-lap crash where Dale Earnhardt crashed into the wall and died. The image of Schrader <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that something was wrong with the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I got the heck {{out of the way as}} soon as they got there." [...] In 2002, Schrader did not finish in the top 10 in a single race, the first time since 1984. Following that season, he departed MB2.|$|E
2500|$|In Tsvetaeva's Podruga (Girlfriend) cycle, {{she acted}} as a seer, <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> Parnok's future, {{predicting}} she was a doomed, tragic figure cursed by her passions. In her later works (poems 54 and 58 in her first book of verse, Poems), Parnok responded with calm to the dire predictions that the couple would break up. To Tsvetaeva's constant worries about {{who would be the}} conqueror of their battles, Parnok replied that they were equals. There was a mother-daughter aspect to the relationship and the poems written during it, in that Tsvetaeva entered the relationship as a novice to lesbian passion, though not to its attraction, later maturing in her relationship. On the other hand, Parnok entered their union as the less experienced poet, benefiting in her later writing from the seeds of her collaboration with Tsvetaeva. Rather than the typical stereotypical older-woman-seducer, Tsvetaeva assumed the male lover's role as pursuer in her poems, taunting Parnok with her desire to be the betrayer rather than the betrayed. Poems appeared shortly before Parnok and Tsvetaeva broke up in 1916 and displayed the mastery of her craft. The lyrics in Parnok's Poems presented the first, non-decadent, lesbian-desiring subject ever to be included in a book of Russian poetry. Parnok's poems about their affair were more restrained than Tsvetaeva's, but Parnok planned to have hers published in contrast to Tsvataeva who presented Podruga to Parnok as a gift.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{has noted}} Artpop as an EDM and synth-pop album. It was further described as [...] "coherently channeling R, techno, disco and rock music" [...] by Billboard. Its electronic landscape was initially tailored for Born This Way before Gaga and Garibay {{opted for a}} rock-influenced sound. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine claimed the singer [...] "continues to be a student" [...] of Madonna as she mirrors Confessions on a Dance Floor and [...] "Holiday" [...] with songs such as [...] "Applause" [...] and [...] "Fashion!", and further saw Artpop as a pastiche of Gaga's previous efforts. Adam Markovitz, writing for Entertainment Weekly, echoed this thought, writing that [...] "most of the songs here would fit right in" [...] with The Fame and Born This Way. Mof Gimmers from The Quietus noticed a [...] "tremendous juggernaut of pop" [...] within the album's frame, while Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph quipped [...] "it's like wandering drunk around a vast, labyrinthine club, and <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> a disorienting series of darkened rooms in which she tries on various musical genres {{as if they were}} hats" [...] in reference to the album's busy soundscape. Ben Kelly from Attitude described Artpop as a [...] "relentless odyssey of electronic sounds" [...] pierced by [...] "strong melodic refrains". Aizlewood of London Evening Standard said it was built to inspire [...] "hair-waving, body-shaking routines at stadium shows", pinpointing [...] "stentorian keyboards, clattering electro-percussion and thumping backbeats" [...] as the bedrock of the album's production.|$|E
2500|$|The novel opens by a {{conversation}} between two eminent physicians in an insane asylum. A beautiful woman had {{attracted the attention of}} the visiting physician. The strange story of her life is given in succeeding chapters, carrying the reader from story to philosophy, from pure description to metaphysical speculation without any break in continuity of thought. The story is not startling, and it has few strong dramatic passages. By stages, the reader is carried from the world of the physical into the realm of dreams. At one moment, he is with Mr. and Mrs. Varien; the next, he finds himself <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the beyond, gazing through the entranced vision of Mrs. Varien on the daily life of the little child which died when only three years old. The life story of Mrs. Varien is set as an odd tale. During the day, she is the same as other people, while at night, for 15 years, she is entranced, and her soul dwells with her child. In this other world, many life mysteries are explained. Many passages, especially the utterances of the mystic master, resemble prose poems. The chapters which aid in forming a conception of the character of the work include: “Doctors Agree,” “She Dreamed a Dream,” “The Dream World,” “The Beginning of the End,” “Science Fails,” “The Watch,” “The Voice of the Master,” “A Star Was Shining,” “A Strange Quest,” “The Gates Are Passed,” “A Successful Experiment,” “Such is the Law,” “Whom God Hath Joined,” “For all Eternity,” “An Innumerable Company.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1682, {{the minutes}} of the Royal Society in London Robert Hooke noted Thomas Digges' 1571 Pantometria, (a book on measurement, {{partially}} based on his father Leonard Digges' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to {{the invention of the}} telescope, describing Leonard as having a fare seeing glass in the mid 1500s based on an idea by Roger Bacon. Thomas described it as [...] "by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places." [...] Comments on the use of proportional or [...] "perspective glass" [...] are also made in the writings of John Dee (1575) and [...] William Bourne (1585). Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens. The idea of an [...] "Elizabethan Telescope" [...] has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian Colin Ronan 1990s explorations concluding this reflecting/refracting telescope was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559. This [...] "backwards" [...] reflecting telescope would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes. The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the time and it could be the [...] "perspective glass" [...] being described was a far simpler idea, originating with Bacon, of using a single lens held in front of the eye to magnify a distant view.|$|E
