25|$|A calcium {{silicate}} feedstock, made from <b>processed</b> <b>steel</b> slag, {{can also be}} used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H+ cations in the soil solution.

The Republic of China government partially repaired the site but it was destroyed again during the Chinese civil war that saw the Communist forces victorious. The mills were once again repaired and Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) was founded in 1948. Form then to 2001, the company produced 290 million tons of steel, 284 million tons of pig iron and 192 million tons of rolled steel. Until relatively recently, when a new steel plant opened in Shanghai, Angang was the largest steel producer in China. Today, Angang consists of three steelworks with 13 rolling mills plus supporting plants which produce coke, refractory materials and machinery for the steel plants. The company has an annual production capacity of 10 million tons of pig iron, 10 million tons of steel and 9.5 million tons of rolled steel. A quarter of China's total iron ore reserves, about 10 billion tons, are located in Anshan ensuring that the city will remain an important steel producer well into the future.|$|E

On this basis, a Research and Development Project {{is under way in}} Portugal, which is intended to re-use the <b>processed</b> <b>steel</b> slags pro- duced in the two Portuguese Companies. In this paper are presented the results obtained by laboratory performance-related tests for geometrical, physical and mechanical properties for the two Portuguese <b>processed</b> <b>steel</b> slags, named Inert Steel Aggregates for Construction (ISAC). A special emphasis is made in terms of elastic modulus, comparing the two ISACs, with two standard base course materials (granite and limestone aggregates). The laboratory results show that the ISACs could be used in transportation infrastructures. It was also exper- imentally observed that the two ISACs have better mechanical properties than the standard unbound granular base course materials.

It has been found that fine precipitation in a soft matrix, formed after hot rolling, can markedly improve the mechanical properties. In this work, three dimensional atom probe tomography (3 D-APT) has been used to study the formation of precipitates in thermomechanically simulated steel. 3 D-APT data reveals co-existence of numerous nano clusters with precipitates. Also, quantitative analysis of the nano clusters and precipitates shows clusters are as small as mm in size. Precipitates are found to be disc shaped with the composition of equilibrium precipitates (TiMo) C.

40|$|The {{growth of}} bainite causes coordinated {{displacements}} of atoms during {{the motion of}} its glissile transformation interface. The response of such a transformation to elastic or plastic strain in the austenite is discussed {{in the context of}} steel processing. There are some remarkable effects not found in ordinary thermomechanically <b>processed</b> <b>steels.</b> THERMOMECHANICAL PROCESSING The success of thermomechanically <b>processed</b> <b>steels</b> is because of their fine and relatively homogeneous microstructures, consisting of 10 µ m sized equiaxed ferrite grains. These grains growbyareconstructive mechanism in which all the atoms (including iron) diffuse, so that their growth is not impeded by crystallographic discontinuities such as austenite grain boundaries. This is not the case when the ferrite crystal structure is generated by a deformation of the corresponding austenite structure, because the ensuing coordinated displacements cannot in general be sustained across grain boundaries. Ferrite which grows by this displacive mechanism will be in the form of thin plates because this minimises the strain energy associated with the displacements [1]. The inability of such ferrite to cross grain boundaries, and its shape, bot...|$|R
