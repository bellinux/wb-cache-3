5000|$|In a recipe, the baker's {{percentage}} {{for water}} {{is referred to}} as the [...] "hydration"; it is indicative of the stickiness of the dough and the [...] "crumb" [...] of the bread. Lower hydration rates (e.g., 50 - 57%) are typical for bagels and pretzels, and medium hydration levels (58 - 65%) are typical for breads and rolls. Higher hydration levels are used to produce more and larger holes, as is common in artisan breads such as baguettes or ciabatta. Doughs are also often classified by the terms stiff, firm, soft, and slack. [...] Batters are more liquid doughs. Muffins are a type of drop batter while pancakes are a type of <b>pour</b> <b>batter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pour</b> <b>batters,</b> such as pancake batter, have {{a liquid}} to dry ratio of about 1:1 and so pours {{in a steady}} stream. Also called a [...] "low-ratio" [...] baked good.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{breaking}} them {{he found}} that not {{more than one in}} five was good. Still there were quite enough for the purpose. The frying-pan was used as a basin, and in this he made a sort of batter of eggs and flour. By the time he had done this four of the grouse were nearly roasted. He <b>poured</b> the <b>batter</b> into the empty kettle, melted some deer's fat in the pan, and then <b>poured</b> in the <b>batter</b> again. Then he washed out and filled the kettle, and placed it upon the fire.|$|R
50|$|Dibba Attu (Idli batter based Dosa): Idli <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> into a {{thick and}} deep frying dish and fried until {{the outer layers}} become crispy and brown.|$|R
50|$|The wonut is {{made from}} a {{combination}} of the ingredients of a waffle and a doughnut. The first stage of preparation is to <b>pour</b> the <b>batter,</b> which is slightly thicker than regular waffle batter, into a waffle iron. Then, the waffle is deep-fried until it is crisp. The final product can be glazed, frosted, and/or dunked in various toppings.|$|R
5000|$|... (poured) [...] is a pancake-like <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> onto {{a baking}} sheet. Pieces of fruitapples, pears or cherriesmeasuring 1x2 cm are spread {{on it and}} it is then {{sprinkled}} with sugar.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pouring</b> a <b>batter</b> {{similar to}} that of skillet-fried cornbread, but {{slightly}} thinner, into hot grease atop a griddle or a skillet produces a pancake-like bread called a johnnycake. This type of cornbread is prevalent in New England, particularly in Rhode Island, and also in the American Midwest and the American South. It is reminiscent of the term hoecake, used in the American South for fried cornbread pancakes, which may date back to stories about some people on the frontier making cornbread patties on the blade of a hoe.|$|R
50|$|A {{sheet of}} muslin (katsâ) is {{stretched}} over the steamer ring and the prepared rice <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> directly on it; an alternative method uses banana leaf as a liner. The puto is then sold as large, thick cakes in flat baskets called bilao lined with banana leaf, either as whole loaves or sliced into smaller, lozenge-shaped individual portions.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century food molds {{became popular}} {{as a vehicle}} for both {{identification}} and decoration. Confectioners would use intricately carved wooden molds to form and decorate pastries and marzipan candies while bakers would <b>pour</b> their cake <b>batters</b> into carved molds such as the Museum's George Washington cake mold made by John Conger, a renowned New York carver. Dairy farmers would likewise use ornamental, circular stamps to mark their butter with their brand.|$|R
50|$|The {{mung bean}} batter is ladled {{on a hot}} frying pan greased with a {{considerable}} amount of cooking oil, topped with the filling, and followed by another layer of the <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> {{over the top of the}} filling. Finally, the bindae-tteok is topped with pieces of diagonally sliced green and red chili pepper. The pancakes are pan-fried on both sides, and served with a dipping sauce consisting of soy sauce, vinegar, water, and ground pine nuts.|$|R
50|$|Two eggs, {{one-half}} cup of milk, one-half cup of flour, a {{pinch of}} salt, a little nutmeg and one teaspoonful of sugar. Mix well. Have {{a large frying pan}} ready with hot butter. Be sure and have the butter run all over the inside of the pan so the pancake will not stick to the sides when it rises. <b>Pour</b> in the <b>batter</b> and place in oven. When nearly done, powder with sugar and put back in oven to brown. Serve with lemon and powdered sugar.|$|R
50|$|Bing, a flatbread made {{of flour}} and fried in oil, {{was once a}} Northeastern street food that {{can also be found}} in many areas around the country. They can be served plain or stuffed with meat or eggs, or {{seasoned}} with scallions, sauces, or other flavours. One variety originating in Shandong and now found throughout China, jianbing guozi (煎饼果子), is made with the <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> directly onto an iron skillet and evened out into a thin pancake. An egg is cracked on top, then various seasonings are added. It is rolled for portability.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the final}} phase of those exercises, Tusk was {{operating}} in a unit which also included the submarine [...] On 25 August, while steaming through a gale off the coast of Norway, Cochino suffered an explosion in one of her batteries. Tusk rushed to the aid of the stricken submarine, providing medical supplies for Cochinos injured by way of life rafts. One such raft capsized in heavy seas sending a Cochino officer and a civilian employee of the Bureau of Ships into the icy Arctic Sea. Both were recovered, but during the administration of artificial respiration on board Tusk, another wave broke over her deck washing away the civilian and 11 Tusk crewmen. Only four sailors were subsequently rescued. After those tragic events, Tusk and the limping Cochino headed for Hammerfest, Norway. Along the way, another explosion erupted in Cochinos after battery. The second detonation sealed Cochinos fate. Water <b>poured</b> through her <b>battered</b> hull. Tusk came alongside in heavy seas and lashed herself to the sinking submarine. Under the worst possible conditions, Tusk took all of Cochinos crew off safely. Minutes later Cochino took her final plunge and Tusk headed for Hammerfest.|$|R
40|$|PACS. 47. 50. +d – Non-Newtonian fluid flows. Abstract. – We {{consider}} the nonlinear folding {{behavior of a}} viscous filament or a sheet {{under the influence of}} an external force such as gravity. Everyday examples of this phenomenon are provided by the periodic folding of a sheet of honey as it impinges on toast, or the folding of a stream of shampoo as it falls on one’s hand. To understand the evolution of a fold, we formulate and solve a free-boundary problem for the phenomenon, give scaling laws for the size of the folds and the frequency with which they are laid out, and verify these experimentally. The buckling of solids is a well-established subject whose origins date back to the work of Euler and Bernoulli. This instability, which arises {{as a result of the}} competition between axial compression and bending in slender objects, is not restricted to solids; it can also occur in creeping flows of fluids in slender geometries. As in the case of solids, the buckling, folding, and coiling of thin sheets and filaments of fluids occurs on length scales spanning several orders of magnitude, including phenomena from geophysics [1] to materials processing [2], see fig. 1. Everyday examples of this phenomenon abound. In the kitchen, a sheet of honey, maple syrup or cake <b>batter</b> <b>poured</b> onto a surface from a sufficient height is laid out in...|$|R
40|$|What Does Food Mean to Me Food {{has always}} been very {{important}} to me and I have always been very interested in it. Even when I was a little kid I would always be in the kitchen helping my mom. Whether I was pouring flour into cookie dough batter, spraying a cupcake pan with pam, or eating the leftover brownie batter, the different tastes and interesting flavors of food have always intrigued me. I noticed that different tastes and smells would trigger important memories for me. The repetition of certain meals helped me remember important moments in my life, this is why traditional meals have always stood out to me. A traditional meal that is very special to me is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle,. A traditional meal that stands out to me the most is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle. Many people do not know what spaetzle is because it is very foreign. Spaetzle is a soft egg noodle or dumpling found in cuisines of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. It is a very unique dish because it can be prepared as a savory or a sweet entrée. I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on it I was a little nervous to even try it. The noodles were a very odd shape and had an odd smell to them. They look like little larva worms with a light brown color to them. Without asking my grandpa would give me {{a large portion of the}} noodles and smile at me as I ate and tasted the delicious worm like noodles. The noodle would slowly melt in my mouth as I began to shove more into my mouth. The noodles were surprisingly addicting. I would not bother looking at the other food on my plate until all the noodles on my plate were gone. I was so intrigued by this oddly named, weird looking, and delicious dish that I had to have more. My two younger sisters and I would ask my grandpa to make his special spaetzle every time we would see him, whether it was an important holiday or a random family gathering, we needed to have it. This is my favorite recipe because it always reminds me of him. My dad agreed with me by saying “If I had to pick one thing that I really loved to cook with him it was spaetzle, essentially a German dumpling. This is one of the reasons why I asked him to teach you, Kara and Grace to make them as well-need to have the tradition carry on. ” This last winter my grandpa grew very ill and we knew he didn’t have much time left with him. We had him come over to our house to have him prepare some of our favorite dishes. I, of course, asked him to show me how to make his homemade spaetzle. I read different versions of the recipe online but his was slightly different. According to my dad “His recipe is not written-down. Like a good chef is comes from practice and taste. This is why he taught us-so we can pass it down. ” When he made his dough, he took a lot of time because he wanted to make sure it would be the perfect consistency. He would hand beat a couple eggs in a bowl and then he would slowly add in small amount of another mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (his little special touch). The batter was a lot thinner than I expected it to be but this was because he liked to have the dough form a small noodle rather than a chunky dumpling. He would use his ancient strainer and slowly <b>pour</b> the <b>batter</b> in. The droplets of batter would fall into a boiling pot of salty water. The little noodles would float to the surface of the water and begin to cook. Since the noodles were so thin, they did not take very long to cook. He would then scoop the noodles out of the water and throw them into a sauté pan lined with butter and a little bit f garlic. This was my favorite way to eat them because the little doughy noodles would get caramelized by the copious amounts of butter. My grandpa was very close to my family and not having him around makes the holidays a lot harder. He was a man of very few words, mostly because it was always so hard to understand him. He was fluent in 6 different languages, which gave him a very strange accent. The best way for him to speak was through his cooking. He taught me to appreciate the food that I ate. Food was meant to be simple and made with love. Through him I learned to be patient with food, the best meals take the most time and focus but it was always worth it. I began to appreciate the time I had left with him. He taught me everything I know about German cooking. My family and I miss him dearly. The best way for me to remember him is by preparing his favorite dish, Spatzel. Overall, food is {{very important to me}} because it has helped me remember the important moments in my life and has also provided me with the sense of community...|$|R
