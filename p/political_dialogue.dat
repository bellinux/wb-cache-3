5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

25|$|In the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, as {{elsewhere}} in the Soviet Union, political activity was expressed in various ways, including by organizing groups and clubs independent of the government that had long withheld the right of association to any sort of civil organization.
