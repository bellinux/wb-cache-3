2500|$|The word 'alumen' {{occurs in}} Pliny's Natural History. In the 52nd chapter of his 35th book, {{he gives a}} {{detailed}} description. By comparing this with the account of 'stupteria' given by Dioscorides in the 123rd chapter of his 5th book, it is obvious the two are identical. Pliny informs us that 'alumen' was found naturally in the earth. He calls it 'salsugoterrae'. Different substances were distinguished {{by the name of}} 'alumen', but they were all characterised by a certain degree of astringency, and were all employed in dyeing and medicine, the light-colored alumen being useful in brilliant dyes, the dark-colored only in dyeing black or very dark colors. One species was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but when pure it had the property of blackening when added to pomegranate juice. This property seems to characterize a solution of iron sulfate in water; a solution of ordinary (<b>potassium)</b> <b>alum</b> would possess no such property. Pliny says that there is another kind of alum that the Greeks call 'schiston', and which [...] "splits into filaments of a whitish colour", From the name 'schiston' and the mode of formation, it appears that this species was the salt that forms spontaneously on certain salty minerals, as alum slate and bituminous shale, and consists chiefly of sulfates of iron and aluminium. In some places the iron sulfate may have been lacking, so the salt would be white and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colors. Pliny describes several other species of alumen {{but it is not clear}} as to what these minerals are.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A {{component is}} connected as a cathode and immersed in a catholyte comprising chromium (III) salt(s) and compound(s) stabilizing chromium (II) ions. An anolyte comprising a Bronsted acid is separated from the catholyte by an anion-selective membrane. Measuring device(s) is used for continuously monitoring the deviation in pH from a preset value, and controller(s) is used for adjusting the pH to the preset value by automated addition of acid or base. Chromium layers are deposited using the above-mentioned arrangement. The chromium (III) salt is ammonium chromium <b>alum,</b> <b>potassium</b> chromium <b>alum,</b> chromium chloride, and/or chromium sulfate. The stabilizing compound is amino acid, urea, aliphatic, aromatic-aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic amine and/or amide. Boric acid/borate, citric acid/citrate, aluminum 3 +/aluminum sulfate, oxalic acid/oxalate, and/or tartaric acid/tartarate are added as buffer substance to the catholyte for buffering the pH of catholyte. Anionic and/or neutral surfactants chosen from sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyethylene glycol, diisohexyl sulfosuccinate, 2 -ethylhexyl sulfate, diisobutyl sulfosuccinate, diisoamyl sulfosuccinate, and isodecyl sulfosuccinate are added as wetting agent to the catholyte. The anolyte contains sulfuric acid. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for electroplating bath.
