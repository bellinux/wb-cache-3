25|$|Most horses do {{not object}} to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process. To make it more {{comfortable}} for the horse, a groom should pull the mane out of the crest in an upwards direction, rather than sideways or down. An application of Orajel or clove oil on {{the roots of the}} mane can help desensitize the area during the <b>pulling</b> <b>process.</b> It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the pores are open. Using a mane pulling device such as the ManePuller may also be considered because it tends to be quicker and therefore less stressful for the horse (and groom).|$|E

The formation of entangled structures {{at the ends}} of CNT bundles during pulling is very critical for the <b>pulling</b> <b>process.</b> By cutting the top and bottom layers of both pullable and not pullable CNT arrays, we confirm that the structures at the top or bottom surfaces of the as-grown CNT arrays are not the dominant reason to ensure the continuous <b>pulling</b> <b>process.</b> We have observed the formation of entangled structures when the <b>pulling</b> <b>process</b> approaches the bottom and top ends of the CNT arrays.

40|$|The New Zealand Treasury and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand both {{maintain}} and use comprehensive macroeconomic {{models of the}} New Zealand economy: NZM and FPS respectively. In this paper, shocks are applied to the two models to illustrate and compare their dynamic properties. The most notable differences arise from their characterisations of the inflation process. In NZM, inflation is modelled as a cost-push phenomenon, whereas FPS models inflation as a demand <b>pull</b> <b>process.</b> Consequently, shocks arising from demand and cost sources often have quite different implications for monetary policy in the two models. In contrast, in general the long-run responses of the models to permanent shocks are quite similar, although the transition paths differ reflecting both the differing inflation processes and adjustment dynamics. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{explored}} the diameter selectivity of dynamic self-assembly for the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) encapsulation in double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) via {{molecular dynamics simulation}} method. Moreover, the <b>pulling</b> out <b>process</b> {{was carried out by}} steered molecular dynamics simulations. Considering pi-pi stacking and solvent accessibility together, base-CNT binding should be strongest on a graphene sheet and weakest on the inner CNT surface. When pulling the ssDNA out of the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), the force exhibits characteristic fluctuations around a plateau about 300 pN. Each fluctuation force pulse to pull ssDNA corresponds to the exit of one base. In addition, the solvents used for the system are also of significant interest.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} determine tensile force-elongation diagrams of tapered {{optical fibers}} with a nanofiber waist. The tapered optical fibers are produced from standard silica optical fibers using a heat and <b>pull</b> <b>process.</b> Both, the force-elongation data and {{scanning electron microscope}} images of the rupture points indicate a brittle material. Despite the small waist radii {{of only a few}} hundred nanometers, our experimental data can be fully explained by a nonlinear stress-strain model that relies on material properties of macroscopic silica optical fibers. This is an important asset when it comes to designing miniaturized optical elements as one can rely on the well-founded material characteristics of standard optical fibers. Based on this understanding, we demonstrate a simple and non-destructive technique that allows us to determine the waist radius of the tapered optical fiber. We find excellent agreement with independent scanning electron microscope measurements of the waist radius...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of water quality on flotation performance. The experimental test work comprised of batch flotation tests using Denver lab cell for a period of 10 minutes. Nine different test runs were carried out in triplicates to ensure reproducibility using different water types from different thickener overflows, return and sewage effluent water (process water) and portable water. The water sources differed in pH, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids and conductivity. Process water was found to reduce the concentrate recovery and mass pull, while portable water increased the concentrate recovery and mass pull. Portable water reduced the concentrate grade while process water increased the concentrate grade. It is proposed that a combination of process water and portable water supply be used in flotation circuits to balance the different effects that the different water types have on the flotation efficiency.

30|$|The {{first is}} risk normalization, by which long-term, {{recurrent}} exposure increases flood awareness, but decreases aversion {{through a combination}} of previous experience and cognitive bias. This process erodes residents’ motivation to engage in activities and make adjustments that reduce risk and increase preparedness. The second is risk trade-off, in which the perceived benefits of living in the area outweigh the perceived problem of recurrent, low to medium intensity floods. Combined with risk normalization this process leads to increased risk taking and undermines the potential to anticipate and adapt to an escalating flood risk resulting from climate change, and other global changes. Finally, there is a set of pull-and-push processes. These carrots and sticks represent pressures that maintain the status quo. <b>Pull</b> <b>processes</b> include social processes that not only keep people in high-risk locations, but also provide the primary bulwark against adversity. Push processes refer to socioeconomic processes that determine the structural constraints that limit opportunities. Any effective risk reduction or preparedness activities must be based on an understanding of these underlying processes, and the perspective of the local community.|$|R
