5|$|After each {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as <b>Presiding</b> Officer, the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. The <b>Presiding</b> Officer (currently Ken Macintosh) and deputies (currently Linda Fabiani and Christine Grahame) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the <b>Presiding</b> Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the <b>Presiding</b> Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the <b>Presiding</b> Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the <b>Presiding</b> Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>presiding</b> magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, <b>presiding</b> magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a <b>presiding</b> magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by <b>presiding</b> magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Presiding</b> Officer (or Deputy <b>Presiding</b> Officer) decides {{who speaks}} in chamber debates {{and the amount}} of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the <b>Presiding</b> Officer tries to achieve a balance between {{different}} viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The <b>Presiding</b> Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the <b>Presiding</b> Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.|$|E

50|$|In total, 439 judges <b>preside</b> {{over the}} Court of Common Pleas, 9 judges <b>preside</b> over the Commonwealth Court, 15 judges <b>preside</b> over the Superior Court, and 7 justices <b>preside</b> over the Supreme Court. Elected judges run in 10 year terms, {{at which point}} they are {{required}} to run in a non-partisan retention election if they wish to continue to serve.|$|R
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the <b>Presiding</b> Officer is {{responsible}} for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the <b>Presiding</b> Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the <b>Presiding</b> Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The <b>Presiding</b> Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.|$|E

5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the <b>presiding</b> divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their <b>presiding</b> divinities reside {{in the mind of}} a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Marshalsea or marshalcy {{referred}} {{to the office of}} a marshal, derived from the Anglo-French mareschalcie. Marshal originally meant farrier, from the Old Germanic marh (horse) and scalc (servant), later a title bestowed on those <b>presiding</b> over the courts of Medieval Europe.|$|E

5000|$|... (The Vice President of the United States is constitutionally {{designated}} as the President of the United States Senate, and the President pro tempore of the United States Senate <b>presides</b> over its sessions or appoints another senator to do so when the Vice President does not <b>preside.</b> Ordinarily, neither the Vice President nor the president pro tempore <b>preside,</b> but instead the president pro tempore appoints a junior Senator of the majority party to <b>preside).</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Presiding</b> Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} <b>presiding</b> justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|Senators elect a President {{to serve}} as <b>presiding</b> officer of the {{legislative}} body, {{as well as a}} President Pro Tempore. The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees, four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees. When compared to other state legislatures in the United States, the Maryland Senate has one of the strongest <b>presiding</b> officers and some of the strongest committee chairs. Senators are also organized into caucuses, including party- and demographically-based caucuses. They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff.|$|E
5|$|Since the Romans used a form {{of direct}} democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the <b>presiding</b> magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the <b>presiding</b> magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power {{came in the form}} of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E

50|$|Midsummer Courts were {{sometimes}} <b>presided</b> over personally by the Lords of Mann, {{but more often}} by his representatives, as the Lords of Mann were often British aristocrats or monarchs who were not resident in the island.

George VI <b>presided</b> in 1946; his successor Elizabeth II <b>presided</b> in 1979 (the millennial anniversary of Tynwald's establishment) and again in 2003.

5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given {{at the moment when}} the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the <b>presiding</b> officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each <b>presiding</b> officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the <b>presiding</b> officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E
50|$|This list {{includes}} all Presidents of the Senate (the Vice Presidents of the United States), those Presidents pro tempore of the Senate who <b>presided</b> during intra - term vacancies in {{the vice presidency}} or when the Vice President was acting as President of the United States, and those Chief Justices who <b>presided</b> during presidential impeachment trials. It does not include Presidents pro tempore who <b>presided</b> over sessions temporarily during an absence of the Senate President, or junior senators designated by the President pro tempore to <b>preside</b> temporarily.|$|R
50|$|While {{vice presidents}} used to {{regularly}} <b>preside</b> over the Senate, modern vice presidents {{have done so}} only rarely, usually only when swearing in new senators, during joint sessions, announcing {{the result of a}} vote on a significant bill or confirmation, or when casting a tie-breaking vote. The Senate chooses a president pro tempore to <b>preside</b> in the vice president's absence. Modern presidents pro tempore, too, rarely <b>preside</b> over the Senate. In practice, the junior senators of the majority party typically <b>preside</b> in order to learn Senate procedure.|$|R
