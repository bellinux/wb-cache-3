500|$|David Lewis of CultBox {{called it}} [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>straightforward</b> thriller about {{chemical}} warfare, cover-ups and a colossal canine. It's also suspenseful, spooky and superb." [...] The reviewer also {{commented on the}} hound's appearance: [...] "It isn't , of coursejust an evil-looking mutt hired by Gary and Billy to drum up business for their boozerand happily, like all the previous hounds that have haunted Holmes in film and TV for nearly a hundred years, it looks gloriously rubbish when it finally appears." [...] Lewis rated the episode {{four out of five}} stars. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy thought [...] "The Hounds of Baskerville" [...] was [...] "an excellent installment of Sherlock— fun, moody and, at times, genuinely scary." [...] Jeffery felt that the final realisation of the hound was impressive, and praised the CGI work, as well as the performance of Cumberbatch and Freeman.|$|E

5000|$|Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind wrote, [...] "The {{directing}} {{and music}} choices this season on Supernatural have been fantastic; whoever chose the static-like sound {{that was all}} over this episode really outdid themselves, because that fit perfectly. The directing feels so much more daring and interesting and exciting than in the past; before, {{it seemed like it}} was <b>pretty</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> work was being done. I'm not putting that down, or at least I don't mean to, but this year feels so much different. Perhaps I'm just enjoying the story and the like so much I am being more charitable, but I don't think so. Something is different this year about Supernatural, and I can't quite put my finger on it." ...|$|R
5000|$|With Soulfire he's {{back with}} a little help from his friends Jimi Goodwin of Doves, Denise Johnson of Primal Scream fame and various members of The Fall in his live band. First single Happiness is <b>pretty</b> much a <b>straightforward</b> guitar pop tune which perhaps doesn't give a full {{indication}} of how eclectic this album actually is. Elsewhere the dance influence is prevalent taking in everything from subtle trip-hop on [...] "Formal Tourist" [...] and [...] "Work Rest and Play" [...] to breakbeats on [...] "Manmade". Not that guitars have been left out in favour of a new trendy dance direction, but more that they've simply been added into the melting pop of the Hingley. Half the album is co-written by Jem Kelly of The Lotus Eaters.|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Entertainment Weekly {{listed the}} show at #19 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25Years", saying, [...] "Supernatural began with a <b>pretty</b> <b>straightforward</b> premise – hot guys kill spooky things – but it didn't stay that way for long. The {{characters}} have literally been to hell and back, and along the way, they have woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). Supernatural has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary."

[...] Speaking of how much MDK2 was influenced by MDK, he explained [...] "I can't even begin to explain the strength of the visual influence that the original MDK has over MDK2. I was very impressed when I first saw MDK and I'm even more impressed after having played it many times. In many ways, in MDK2 we're striving to reach the goal Shiny set with the original by using new and improved technology." ...|$|E
40|$|The first {{splitting}} {{schemes for}} solving {{the system of}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been proposed already {{in the second half}} of the last century. Among them are continuous and discrete projection methods, ILUbased factorisation schemes, etc. The main purpose of splitting schemes is to divide the velocity-pressure coupled problem into smaller subproblems to be solved in an iterative way. Very often this leads to a drastic reduction of computational work and resources. The most popular splitting schemes are projection methods proposed by A. Chorin and R. Temam in the late 1960 ’s. Since then, the projection methods were thoroughly analysed and constantly improved, particularly for new CFD configurations and applications. In a broad class of industrial applications one has to deal with incompressible rotating flows. Very often it is helpful to perform coordinate transformation to a nonintertial frame of reference. On one hand, this technique facilitates the prescription of boundaries, since complex rotating objects become stationary, their mesh is constructed once and for all during the preprocessing phase. On the other hand, one has to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with rotational forces, which consist of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. In order to obtain an efficient and robust solver, it is important to come up with a proper handling of these extra terms. For coupled methods implementation of rotational forces is <b>pretty</b> much <b>straightforward.</b> For projection methods, however, some modifications in ever...|$|R
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} Andrew Robinson's birthday, the Ramsay Street teens {{decide to}} attend a concert in the city. Andrew, Natasha (Valentina Novakovic), Summer and Ed (Sebastian Gregory) get into Chris' car earlier in the evening, unaware that Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) is hiding in the boot, having rebelled against her uncle's decision to forbid her from attending the concert. Halfway into the journey, the group hear a mysterious ringing coming {{from the back of}} the car and when Chris pulls over he discovers Sophie hiding in the boot with her phone. Andrew just wants to get to the concert, so he persuades Chris to let Sophie sit on Summer's lap. Chris [...] "reluctantly agrees" [...] knowing that she will not have a seat belt on. Mason revealed [...] "Chris really is a <b>pretty</b> sensible, <b>straightforward</b> kind of guy who knows the rules - his morals are good. The last things he wants to do is jeopardise anyone's safety by doing something silly. But he gets talked into overloading the car by letting Sophie get in with them. He wants to please his friends and make sure everyone's happy - and it doesn't help that the whole group use a bit of peer pressure to convince him. The others just don't see any danger in what they're doing." [...] Shortly after restarting their journey, a heated argument breaks out between Natasha and Andrew when she learns he has sold their gambling app without her permission.|$|R

Our ultimate objective is to generate efficient parallel imperative code from an Alpha program. In this paper, we discuss the related problem of generating efficient single processor imperative code.

It's an A+ performance that would make Gaga proud." [...] Rae Votta of Billboard, though was not particularly positive of the episode, commented positively on Adam's audition, saying [...] "He puts previous over the top audition numbers on the show to shame with air humping, table posturing, and literal swinging on chandeliers with no regard for structural integrity.

2500|$|The {{next level}} of despair is [...] "The despair that is {{conscious}} of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self {{in which there is}} something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." [...] This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is <b>pretty</b> <b>straightforward.</b> A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God {{or at the very least}} see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading [...] "Despair over the earthly." ...|$|E
