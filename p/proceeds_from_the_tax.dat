Under the section, a law imposing a personal income tax must be ratified in a statewide referendum to take effect; any further change in the tax must also be ratified to take effect, if it would increase the [...] "collective liability" [...] of all persons subject to the tax. The <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> must first be used to reduce local school property taxes, with any remainder being used for the support of education.|$|E

40|$|The {{logic of}} {{dispossession}} in Colombia refers to structures and phenomena {{of the colonial}} legacy not yet overcome.

That is why the monopoly policy established forms of privilege by concentrating the rights to produce and supply liquor for the benefit of the pieces of territory called departments that make up the nation-state. The other face of the evolution of departmental revenue is revealed in the memories of persecution, fines, seizures and imprisonment in which witnesses recall their own life experiences or stories they have heard to illustrate the idea of uprootedness regarding taxes...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} unique {{resolution}} to the debate over political campaign participation by tax-exempt organizations, specifically religious organizations. By virtue of their tax-exempt status, these organizations are banned from participating in political campaign activity. Commentators have debated the merits of this ban for years {{and to say that}} commentators have been all over the map regarding their opinions over the ban is putting it charitably. The ban 2 ̆ 7 s advocates and opponents have staked out seemingly every position imaginable in arguing the merits of this ban. Some commentators have argued forcefully that the ban is needed to preserve constitutional separation of church and state. Other commentators have argued as passionately that the ban is unconstitutional and pulls at the fabric of American democracy by unduly limiting political participation by churches and religious organizations. The arguments of each side of the debate take a zero-sum gain approach to resolving the debate, and commentators seem to discount the concerns of the opposition as either irrelevant or insignificant. This Article does not attempt to resolve the debate in the literature over the ban 2 ̆ 7 s legitimacy. Rather, this Article proposes a solution that the literature has apparently ignored: finding a compromise between the two extremes of the debate that addresses the primary concerns of both sides. This Article proposes that section 501 (c) (3) organizations be permitted an increased amount of political campaign activity in exchange for paying a tax referred to as a 2 ̆ 2 self-directed tax. 2 ̆ 2 What makes the self-directed tax unique is that the organizations themselves would be permitted to direct the government as to how to allocate the <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> to a preset group of government spending choices. Similar rules would apply to the charitable deduction as well. The self-directed tax would allow section 501 (c) (3) organizations to become more politically active. This Article 2 ̆ 7 s proposal, however, still allows section 501 (c) (3) organizations to preserve their unique status as partners with government in the provision of public goods - a status that justifies not requiring them to provide a portion of their profits to the government for the government to do with as it pleases. 2 ̆ 2 People talk about {{the middle of the road}} as though it were unacceptable. Actually, all human problems, excepting morals, come into the gray areas. Things are not all black and white. There have to be compromises. The middle of the road is all of the usable surface. The extremes, right and left, are in the gutters. 2 ̆ 2 - Dwight D. Eisenhower, October 196...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} is {{revealed}} how <b>the</b> Belgian inheritance <b>tax</b> system {{was used as a}} functional political instrument, throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century. It was a tool, offering a broad range of unifying and disintegrating processes, which shaped a state identity. The emphasis lays on the many changes of the political power. This of course marked deeply the formation of the death duty legislation. Time after time, different political elites and majorities voted for changes in the existing system, using both continuous and discontinuous argumentations (the article mainly focuses on the parlementary motivations). The policy making was limited by the state itself, and by the ruling political elite (hence the use of the concept ‘state capacity’). The state merged technicity and prestige and employed <b>the</b> inheritance <b>taxes</b> to cling <b>the</b> local dignitaries and the local level to the administration. <b>The</b> Belgian <b>tax</b> culture – only examined in restricted sense, <b>proceeding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state’s and <b>tax</b> administration’s view – definitely was a manifestation of state identity. <b>The</b> Belgian <b>tax</b> morale – a concept comprehending fraud and anti-fiscality or the friction between the tax-paying citizen and the fiscal administration – was being modelled as well by the state and the fiscal administration, through the conscious and implicit decisions it made...|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} of the Treasury Single Account in Nigeria has not been without controversies. On Tuesday, 10 November 2015, Dino Melaye, a Nigerian senator representing Kogi West, raised a motion that the {{operation of}} the treasury single account (TSA) be investigated for possible corruption. He claimed that [...] "the appointment of REMITA, an e-collection agent, is a gross violation of section 162 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution and the banks and other Financial Institutions Act." [...] He claimed the constitution only recognised a banking institution to be the collector of government funds, that Remita was not a bank.The provision of the Constitution cited by Melaye states, “the federation shall maintain a special account to be called the federation account into which all revenues collected by the government of the federation except <b>the</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> personal income <b>tax</b> of <b>the</b> personnel of the Armed Forces of the Federation, the Nigeria Police Force, the ministry or department of government charged with foreign affairs and the residents of the FCT, Abuja.” According to Melaye, the total inflow of 1% commission charged and received by SystemSpecs for all revenue collected on behalf of <b>the</b> government <b>from</b> <b>the</b> various ministries, departments and agencies to be 25 billion Naira as of November, 2015 was fraud and must be returned to the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The senate consequently ordered its committee on finance and public accounts to [...] "commence an investigation into the use of Remita (which it erroneously described as an e-collection agent) since the inception of the TSA policy.|$|R
