5|$|State Route 279 is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of Utah. The highway was {{constructed}} in 1962–1963 to service the Cane Creek <b>potash</b> mine and processing plant southwest of Moab. The highway was {{named one of the}} most beautiful highways opened to traffic in 1963. The entire length of SR-279 has been designated the <b>Potash</b> – Lower Colorado River Scenic Byway by the Utah State Legislature, however is known locally as <b>Potash</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|Agrium Vanscoy <b>Potash</b> Operations is Canada's {{third largest}} {{producer}} of <b>potash</b> fertilizer. In the 1930s early homesteaders would maintain Highway 7 {{as a means}} to supplement their income. Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for direction of travel with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines. Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving <b>Potash</b> and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including <b>Potash,</b> whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while <b>Potash</b> recovered from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as <b>potash,</b> muriate of <b>potash,</b> or simply MOP.|$|E
5|$|There is also heavy {{freight traffic}} in the area. Port of Ashdod has its own railway spur line {{as well as a}} special {{terminal}} for <b>potash</b> brought from the Sodom area and exported abroad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potash</b> is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While <b>potash</b> has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for <b>potash</b> were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other <b>potash</b> deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important {{exceptions to this}} and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, <b>potash,</b> and soda.|$|E
5|$|FSN Pittsburgh was {{the primary}} {{television}} network. Paul Steigerwald, Dan <b>Potash,</b> Rob King, and former Penguins Bob Errey and Jay Caufield were the station's broadcast team. During the semi-final playoff round against the Washington Capitals, game five set a record as the highest watched game on any FSN regional network in history. It was then surpassed by games six and seven; {{the final game of}} the series drew a 24.97average rating—twice the viewers than the second most watched show of the evening.|$|E
5|$|High-purity thulium oxide {{was first}} offered commercially {{in the late}} 1950s, {{as a result of}} the {{adoption}} of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American <b>Potash</b> & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{deposits}} of iron ore {{are found in}} Cumbria and the North East, and fluorspar and baryte are also plentiful in northern parts of the Pennines. Salt mining in Cheshire has a long history, and both remaining rock salt mines in Great Britain are in the North: Winsford Mine in Cheshire and Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, which also produces half of the UK's <b>potash.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of <b>potash.</b>|$|E
5|$|John Williamson was {{released}} early, in 1955, and deported to England, {{although he had}} lived in the United States since the age of ten. Irving <b>Potash</b> moved to Poland after his release from prison, then re-entered the United States illegally in 1957, and was arrested and sentenced to two years for violating immigration laws. Robert G. Thompson skipped bail, was captured in 1953, and sentenced to an additional four years. He died in 1965 and U.S. Army officials refused him burial in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife challenged that decision, first losing in U.S. District Court and then winning in the Court of Appeals. Defense attorney George W. Crockett Jr. later became a Democratic congressman from Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's well {{developed}} industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%). More than 21% of Jordan's labor force was employed in industry in 2002. In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are <b>potash,</b> phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers. The most promising segment of this sector is construction. Petra Engineering Industries Company, {{which is considered}} {{to be one of the}} main pillars of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its air-conditioning units reaching NASA. Jordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the MENA region led by Jordanian pharmaceutical company Hikma.|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic <b>potash</b> (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, {{it took some time}} before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|This highway was {{intended}} {{to be part of a}} longer highway, State Route 278, that was to scale the canyon walls between Moab and Dead Horse Point State Park. Only the connection to the <b>potash</b> mine was constructed before the project was cancelled. Although the highway was constructed to aid the mining industry of southeastern Utah, the road is popular with tourists and four wheel drive enthusiasts. The jeep trails beginning where SR-279 ends are used to access Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point.|$|E
5|$|Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and {{the forced}} {{migration}} of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants {{settled in the}} central Susquehanna Valley, including {{in the area that}} would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a <b>potash</b> manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{was first}} isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic <b>potash</b> (KOH, potassium hydroxide) {{by the use}} of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) {{has been an important}} commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While <b>potash</b> has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.|$|E
5|$|King Felipe VI of Spain, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud of the Saudi Arabia royal family, and Prince Pavlos of Greece and Denmark {{are among}} the royals who {{attended}} Georgetown. Besides numerous members of the senior diplomatic corps, graduates have also headed military organizations on both the domestic and international level, such as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones. Notable alumni in business include Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Patricia Russo, former Alcatel-Lucent CEO, William J. Doyle of the <b>Potash</b> Corporation of Saskatchewan, and Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics franchises and former America Online executive. Leonsis is among four other undergraduate alumni who own professional sports teams, making Georgetown the most popular undergraduate university for major North American sports franchise owners. Actor Bradley Cooper, People Magazines Sexiest Man Alive 2011, is also a graduate of Georgetown and its English program. Actors/comedians Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jim Gaffigan, and Mike Birbiglia are also graduates of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Turahan {{also took}} several {{measures}} {{to restore order}} and prosperity in his province, most notably the foundation (or re-foundation) {{of the town of}} Tyrnavos, which before was a small pastoral settlement. To attract and protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as special administrative status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed it with both a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on yellow berries, madder and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of <b>potash.</b> From there these materials spread to the rest of Rumelia and thence to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress <b>potash</b> ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Potash</b> is a potassium-containing {{compound}} {{used as a}} fertilizer, {{along with}} nitrogen and phosphorus. <b>Potash</b> deposits were found underground across the Permian Basin in 1925. Two companies, Mosaic <b>Potash</b> Carlsbad (formerly IMC Global) and Intrepid <b>Potash</b> (formerly Mississippi Chemical Corporation), operate mining operations east of Carlsbad.

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract {{interest}} from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of <b>potash</b> (potassium chloride) and bromine. The Palestine <b>Potash</b> Company was chartered in 1929, after its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, worked for the charter for over ten years. The first plant was on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya and produced <b>potash</b> by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. The company quickly grew into the largest industrial site in the Middle East, and in 1934 built a second plant on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the 'Lashon' region of the Dead Sea. Palestine <b>Potash</b> Company supplied half of Britain's <b>potash</b> during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
25|$|On the Jordanian {{side of the}} Dead Sea, Arab <b>Potash</b> (APC), {{formed in}} 1956, {{produces}} 2.0 million tons of <b>potash</b> annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.|$|E
25|$|The Dead Sea Works {{was founded}} in 1952 as a {{state-owned}} enterprise based on {{the remnants of the}} Palestine <b>Potash</b> Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons <b>potash,</b> 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily <b>potash</b> and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, <b>potash</b> was {{discovered}} near Carlsbad, {{and for many}} years Carlsbad dominated the American <b>potash</b> market.
