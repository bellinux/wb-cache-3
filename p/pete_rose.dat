5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose,</b> who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E

The pregame and postgame show featured host Kevin Burkhardt with analysts Frank Thomas, Raul Ibanez, <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose,</b> and Alex Rodriguez. Fox Deportes offered a Spanish telecast of the series in the United States. The MLB International feed featured Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz with play-by-play and analysis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{rather than}} {{inducting}} a player into the Wall of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, commemorating {{the best players}} of the first 100 years in franchise history. The Centennial Team includes players from several periods in Phillies history. The team is honored with a plaque listing {{the names of all}} players selected at the left end of the Wall of Fame. 11 members of the Centennial Team also have their own individual plaques on the Wall; those not otherwise included on the Wall are Manny Trillo, Jim Konstanty, and <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose.</b>|$|E

5|$|The St. Louis Cardinals and Toronto Blue Jays {{played an}} {{exhibition}} game at Greer on April 3, 1983. Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander was in attendance to watch the teams, which included players Ozzie Smith, George Hendrick, Rafael Santana, Keith Hernandez, Alfredo Griffin, former Sounds outfielder Willie McGee, and manager Bobby Cox. The Blue Jays defeated the Cardinals, 7–6, before a crowd of 13,742. On April 4–5, 1987, the Cincinnati Reds (managed by <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose)</b> and Montreal Expos played a two-game exhibition series at Greer. The first game ended with an 8–8 tie in the eleventh inning, but the Reds defeated the Expos, by a score of 5–3, {{in the second game}} of the series.|$|E
5|$|Today, player–managers {{have become}} rare in baseball. <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> {{is the most}} recent player–manager, serving from 1984 through 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds. Whereas some player–managers, such as Lou Boudreau, were {{full-time}} players as player–managers, by the time Rose became player–manager, he was a part-time player. Rose was trying to prolong his career to break the all-time hit record set by Ty Cobb, and Reds owner Marge Schott used this as a marketing ploy. Rose removed himself from the 40-man roster after the 1986 season {{to make room for}} Pat Pacillo, unofficially retiring as a player, but remained as the Reds manager until he was banned from baseball following the release of the Dowd Report in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, Cobb hit in 35 {{consecutive}} games, {{still the}} only player with two 35-game hitting streaks (including his 40-game streak in 1911). [...] He had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games in his career, second only to <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> seven.|$|R
50|$|Vincent {{has also}} been {{connected}} with <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> lifetime banishment from baseball; however, Rose's banishment began while Giamatti was commissioner, not Vincent (although Vincent led the investigation and {{was involved in the}} negotiations). Vincent has publicly said he does not support Rose's reinstatement.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Dardis went to {{work for}} Sports Illustrated as an investigative reporter. He was {{involved}} in major stories, including Don Reese's revelation of widespread cocaine use in the National Football League and <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> gambling. He continued working for the sports magazine until about 2005.|$|R
5|$|Fatigued {{from the}} stress of chasing 3,000 career hits and wanting to rest his calf, Jeter opted not to attend the 2011 MLB All-Star Game. Jeter and Posada played their 1,660th game {{together}} on July 14, 2011, breaking the previous franchise record of 1,659 by Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri. Jeter played his 2,402nd game with the Yankees on August 29, 2011, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for most games played as a Yankee. He finished the 2011 season with 162 hits, his 16th consecutive season with 150 hits, which tied him with <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> for the second-most consecutive 150-hit seasons, one behind Hank Aaron for the MLB record. Jeter was honored with the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given in recognition of charitable endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
50|$|On July 27, 2012, {{he became}} the first player since Jim Thome in 2007 to homer in six {{straight}} games versus an opponent. He did this on the same day Chipper Jones tied <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> major league record for extra base hits by a switch hitter.|$|R
50|$|In Game Three of the NLCS {{against the}} Cincinnati Reds, Koosman pitched a complete-game, 9-2 victory {{in a game}} headlined by <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> altercation with Mets' shortstop Bud Harrelson. The victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the NLCS; they won the pennant two days later in five games.|$|R
50|$|McWilliams was {{the winning}} pitcher when the Atlanta Braves stopped <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> 44-game hitting streak in 1978, his rookie season. McWilliams made what was {{probably}} the key play to stop the streak when Rose, in his second at-bat of the game, lined a pitch up the middle that McWilliams reached back and caught.|$|R
5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 hit club is {{the group}} of batters who have {{collected}} 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers. Cap Anson {{was the first to}} join the club on July 18, 1897, although his precise career hit total is unclear. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927; he ultimately finished his career with more than 4,100. <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> became the second member of the 4,000 hit club on April 13, 1984 while playing for the Montreal Expos. Cobb, also the major leagues' all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit. Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits. Roberto Clemente's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career on September 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate umpire when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre. The manager became angry {{at the end of a}} game and followed West into the walkway outside the umpires dressing room. West then shoved Torre. On appeal, NL President Chub Feeney reduced West's fine to $300. Torre also received a fine stemming from the incident.|$|E

5000|$|August 1 - <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> 44-game hitting streak {{comes to}} an end in Atlanta. Rose goes 0-4 against Braves {{pitchers}} Larry McWilliams and Gene Garber, and strikes out in the ninth inning to end the game. Rose's streak is the second-longest in major league history, and he bats [...]385 (70 of 182) during the stretch.|$|R
5000|$|... 1963 was <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> rookie season. He {{made his}} major league debut on Opening Day, April 8, against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

50|$|Rose Garden. Adjacent to {{both the}} stadium and the Reds Hall of Fame is a rose garden that symbolizes <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> record-breaking 4,192nd hit. It was {{strategically}} placed here because the ball landed around this area in Riverfront Stadium. The garden is visible from a stairwell {{in the hall of}} fame displaying the amount of balls that Rose hit.|$|R
25|$|Tactics on {{the field}} changed too. Risky moves that could get players hurt, and {{sideline}} {{millions of dollars in}} payroll on the disabled list, became less common. Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the day like Ty Cobb or <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose,</b> became infrequent occurrences.|$|E
25|$|Although Dick Ebersol (then-president of NBC Sports) and Keith Olbermann – {{among others}} – have {{maintained}} that Gray was simply doing his job, {{it should be}} noted that in 2004, <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> would admit to betting on baseball (along with other sports) while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{banning of}} <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose</b> from MLB, the {{selection}} rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or Shoeless Joe Jackson. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications {{on the level of}} Jackson or Rose.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the [...] "no {{finding of}} fact" [...] provision, Giamatti {{immediately}} stated publicly {{that he felt}} that Rose bet on baseball games. Eight days later, September 1, Giamatti suffered a fatal heart attack. The consensus among baseball experts is that Giamatti's post-agreement statement, his sudden and untimely death, and appointment of new commissioner, Fay Vincent, a close friend and great admirer of Giamatti, doomed <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> hopes of reinstatement.|$|R
5000|$|Morgan {{started his}} {{broadcasting}} career in [...] for the Cincinnati Reds. On September 11, 1985, Morgan, {{along with his}} television broadcasting partner Ken Wilson, was on hand to call <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> record breaking 4,192 career hit. A year later, Morgan started a nine-year stint as an announcer for the San Francisco Giants. Morgan added one more local gig {{when he joined the}} Oakland Athletics' broadcasting team for the 1995 season.|$|R
5000|$|April 23 - At Colt Stadium, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt [...]45's no-hits the Cincinnati Reds, {{and loses}} 1-0. Two ninth-inning errors allow the Reds to score the game's lone run: a two-base {{throwing}} error by Johnson himself on <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> ground ball, {{and the second}} by Nellie Fox on Vada Pinson's grounder, which scores Rose. To date, the game {{is the only one}} in Major League history whose losing pitcher had pitched a nine-inning no-hitter.|$|R
25|$|The Phillies {{achieved}} {{some success}} in the mid-1970s. With such players as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose,</b> the spark that would put them over the top.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 2013, Ichiro {{collected}} his 4,000th {{professional career}} {{hit with a}} single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher R.A.

It {{is quite possible that}} Jake Beckley and Sam Crawford may have also produced 4,000 hits, but data for some of their minor league seasons is missing.|$|E
25|$|Winning the 1961 pennant secured Hutchinson's {{place in}} Cincinnati. In 1962, his Reds won 98 games but {{finished}} third, 3½ games behind the Giants. While the team fell to fifth in 1963, with an 86–76 mark, {{it continued to}} blend in young talent, such as young shortstop Leo Cárdenas and freshman second baseman <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose,</b> who was named the National League's Rookie of the Year. In July, Hutchinson was given a contract extension through the 1965 season, and with a solid corps of veterans and a strong farm system, the Reds were considered a contending club in 1964, provided that its pitching staff made a comeback.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the turmoil}} the Reds faced in [...] with manager <b>Pete</b> <b>Rose's</b> betting fiasco, Birtsas managed to put {{together}} a respectable season. He made a career high 42 appearances, and went 2-2 with a 3.75 ERA while earning his only career save, a rare four inning save, against the San Francisco Giants on August 7. He also got his only career hit in eighteen career at-bats on July 2, a home run off the New York Mets' Sid Fernandez.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915, Cobb set the single-season {{record for}} stolen bases with 96, which stood until Dodger Maury Wills broke it in 1962.
