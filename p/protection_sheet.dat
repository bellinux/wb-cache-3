Indeed the thermal conductivity of a material, thermal inertia of buildings, transmittances of a window, solar energy production, sound attenuation or absorption of a concrete wall or moisture permeability of a <b>protection</b> <b>sheet</b> are all key properties ruling the control of fluxes such as heat, sun, sound or moisture and will be explained here. A non-exhaustive review of the principle state-of-the-art multi-functional technologies using these key properties to achieve the different functions is given. Hence the review of building integrated photovoltaic solutions, phase change materials, smart windows, double skin fa&# 231;ades, green envelope, aerogels, multi-functional concretes and photocatalytic materials, among other technologies. The focus is put on the technologies explanation and the performances, in the multiple roles they have, are highlighted. Through a definition and a description of the ideal multi-functional building envelope as assuring safety, providing comfort and any other desired functions without any drawbacks this paper aims to orientate technological breakthrough of the future towards multi-functionality and to a total control of all the fluxes.

40|$|This note {{presents}} a scheme for compensating the persistent current multipole errors of the LHC dipoles {{by making the}} coil protection sheets from soft magnetic material of 0. 5 mm thickness. The material properties assumed {{in this study are}} those of iron sheets with a very low content of impurities (99. 99 % pure Fe). The non-linearities in the upramp cycle on the b 3 multipole component can be reduced by the factor of four (while decreasing the b 5 variation by the factor of two. Using sheets of slightly different thicknesses offers a tuning possibility for the series magnet coils and can compensate deviations arising from cables of different suppliers. The calculation method is based on a semi-analytical hysteresis model for hard superconductors and an M(B) - iteration using the method of coupled boundary elements - finite elements (BEM - FEM). It is now possible to compute persistent current multipole errors of geometries with arbitrarily shaped iron yokes and thin layers of soft magnetic material such as tuning shims or the coil <b>protection</b> <b>sheet.</b> The method (being available in the ROXIE 8. 0 version) is very briefly described my means of a flow chart.

40|$|Supplemental heat {{rejection}} devices are required in many spacecraft as the radiators are not sized {{to meet the}} full {{heat rejection}} demand. One means of obtaining additional heat rejection is {{through the use of}} phase change material heat exchangers (PCM HX's). PCM HX's utilize phase change to store energy in unfavorable thermal environments (melting) and reject the energy in favorable environments (freezing). Traditionally, wax {{has been used as a}} PCM on spacecraft. However, water is an attractive alternative because it is capable of storing about 40 % more energy per unit mass due to its higher latent heat of fusion. The significant problem in using water as a PCM is its expansion while freezing, leading to structural integrity concerns when housed in an enclosed heat exchanger volume. Significant investigation and development has taken place over the past five years to understand and overcome the problems associated with water PCM HX's. This paper reports on the final efforts by Johnson Space Center's Thermal Systems Branch to develop a water based PCM HX. The test article developed and reported on is a subscale version of the full-scale water-based PCM HX's constructed by Mezzo Technologies.

Their canopies were fully covered (FC) and (FC+) or enclosed by a hand-made individual windbreaks (SN and WB). We studied the evolution of temperature inside the canopy and evaluated the threshold of damage on leaves and shoots. We also monitored soil temperature under the trees. Precision self-made data loggers were assembled. A "heat exchanger" was realized for this experiment to try to recover heat from the ground and place it under the canopy of the plants. It was made with a 50 cm U-shaped aluminum pipeline using recycled materials; this was placed horizontally, 50 cm deep in the soil with one of two extremities above the soil and the other within the canopy. NC trees were damaged by cold temperature. More particular, the young shoot was injured by necrosis followed by fungal disease. The same behavior was observed in SN and WB when the canopy was only enclosed by the protection whereas FC tree shoots were intact. Non-woven sheets preserved intact the shoots only in the FC trees, as the canopies were completely covered by a closed space because the leaves and shoots were isolated from the outside.

It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent <b>protection</b> to steel <b>sheet.</b> Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated <b>sheet.</b> This cut-edge <b>protection</b> means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|R

40|$|Sheet steels {{intended}} for atmospheric exposure invariably require a sacrificial corrosion protective coating. Such coatings are commonly applied by either hot-dip galvanising or electrodeposition using large scale continuous processes. Armed {{with the desire}} to produce new products with improved performance, there has been considerable industrial interest in the use of physical vapour deposition (PVD) for the coating of sheet steels, and practical experience extends over the last three decades. Only in the last few years, however, have the most attractive aspects of P V D been investigated with some vigour: the preparation of novel alloy and multilayer coatings. In recognition of this climate, the research presented in this thesis was commenced with the intention of evaluating the microstructures of a range of alloy coatings prepared by magnetron sputtering. The investigation considered the impact of ion assistance on coating composition and microstructure, by using an unbalanced magnetron design and varying the bias voltage of the substrates, while maintaining a substrate temperature of 50 °C. The coating compositions targeted for study were based on the Al-Mg-Zn ternary system, with emphasis on the binary alloys. The study was mainly concerned with the investigation of supersaturated solid solubility and other metastable crystalline or amorphous phases. Coating characterisation was achieved by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Bragg- Brentano X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Crystallite Group Method (CGM). This latter technique is particularly effective for evaluation of the residual stress and strainfree lattice parameters for strongly fibre textured coatings. CGM was used for the first time for coatings with a close-packed hexagonal (cph) crystal structure. Elemental coatings of Zn, Al and Mg all developed strong fibre textures with the close-packed planes oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Ion assistance enhanced the texture of Zn and Al coatings while disrupting the preferred orientation of Mg coatings. Compressive residual stress was developed in ion assisted Al and Mg coatings due to the atomic peening mechanism. Energetic bombardment of Zn coatings resulted in tensile stress despite a dense, columnar structure which typically indicates compressive stress. This was explained by constrained shrinkage of the Zn coatings during dynamic recrystallisation. Zn and M g coatings were subject to very high proportions of entrapped Ar which was correlated to the residual stress, but was not causative. Al coatings did not retain detectable amounts of Ar. Binary Al-Zn alloy coatings possessed a dual phase structure with discrete (Al) and (Zn) grains. Supersaturation of the (Al) phase was apparent but there was some indication that it declined by spinodal decomposition or precipitation after ageing at room temperature. The surface appearance of Al-Zn coatings was influenced by the Zn content and substrate temperature, such that smooth reflective coatings with high Zn content (textured structure at lower substrate bias than was necessary for elemental Al coatings, probably because of a sputter yield amplification effect. The (Zn) phase in the alloy coatings also retained high proportions of Ar. Coatings of Al-Mg alloys were characterised by single-phase supersaturated (Al) solid solutions with up to about 38 at. %Mg, or a combination of supersaturated (Mg) and an amorphous phase for coatings with between 40 and 90 at. %Mg. The amorphous phase was thought to possess a composition of about 39 at. %Mg. The use of ion assistance resulted in preferential resputtering of M g from the coatings, due to the differences in surface binding energy. The consequential modification in stoichiometry was sufficient to produce different phases in the coatings, and also caused a sharp reduction in the supersaturation of (Al) and (Mg) solid solutions. Coatings containing the (Mg) phase were susceptible to the entrapment of exceptionally high proportions of Ar (The microstructure of binary Zn-Mg alloy coatings was also dependent on the composition. Coatings with between 15 and 40 at. %Mg were entirely amorphous due to slow growth kinetics of complex intermetallic phases within this composition range. Higher and lower Mg content typically provided coatings with a combination of terminal solid solutions and the amorphous phase. The solid solubility of (Zn) and (Mg) phases was considered to be within the equilibrium limits. Several intermetallic phases were detected in Zn-rich coatings, and some of these phases could not be identified. Ion assistance resulted in the preferential resputtering of Mg from the alloy coatings, which is opposite to the trend anticipated from elemental sputtering yields. This effect was attributed to sputter yield amplification, and was confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation of the ion assisted deposition process using the T-DYN code. All of the Zn-Mg coatings were susceptible to the retention of high proportions of Ar, particularly for the Mg-rich compositions. As for the Al-Mg coatings, the entrapped Ar appeared to favour amorphisation of the (Mg) phase. Coatings with high Ar content were sensitive to heavy oxidation with ageing. The ternary Al-Mg-Zn alloy coatings produced were based on Al-rich compositions. Ion assistance had a dramatic effect on the coating stoichiometry and microstructure. Increasing the ion energy resulted in the preferential resputtering of Mg, followed by Zn at higher energy. Coatings deposited with low bias were found to be amorphous, while those with virtually identical composition but prepared with high bias were found to contain (Al) phase with a strongfibre texture. Relatively high proportions of Ar were also present in coatings deposited with elevated bias, but did not interrupt the growth of (Al) phase, suggesting that it was associated with an undetected amorphous phase. The electrochemical performance of a range of the sputtered coatings was examined using a dilute chloride aqueous solution. The data was interpreted with the aim of pinpointing a coating with an optimum combination of both barrier and sacrificial properties which would ensure long term corrosion <b>protection</b> for a <b>sheet</b> steel substrate. All alloy coatings were found to exhibit passive regions.

40|$|Al-Zn-Si alloy {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used for the corrosion <b>protection</b> of steel <b>sheets.</b> In addition to the favorable corrosion properties, the Al- 43 wt%Zn- 1. 6 wt%Si coatings present several features which are of metallurgical interest. The first one is their surface appearance dominated by the typical spangle morphology exhibiting dull and shiny areas on the coating surface. Further on, the dendrite tips do apparently not grow along the 〈 100 〉 crystallographic directions that are typical for fcc-metals, but rather along directions in between 〈 100 〉 and 〈 110 〉. In addition, continuous variations of the crystallographic orientation, up to 35 °, are observed within individual grains of Al-Zn-Si coatings [Sémoroz 1 01]. The objective {{of the present study}} is to establish {{a better understanding of the}} microstructure development which is responsible for the formation of both the characteristic spangle pattern and the important variations of crystallographic orientation within the grains. In order to elucidate these questions, the present study includes three main axes, (i) a detailed microstructure characterization of industrially solidified samples, (ii) modeling work which encompasses microstructure modeling by the phase field method and a geometrical model, as well as the determination of the solid-liquid interfacial energy anisotropy by an inverse method, and (iii) re-solidification experiments aimed at studying the behavior of Al-Zn-Si layers under modified solidification conditions. The results show that the dendrite network spreads quickly in the coating layer at a temperature between 530 to 535 °C. During growth, the dendrite tips are separated from the confining boundaries by a thin, solute-rich liquid film. It was found that the preferred dendrite growth directions are in between 〈 100 〉 and 〈 110 〉, 28. 5 ° from 〈 100 〉. Further on, a mathematical expression for the interfacial energy anisotropy of the considered alloy has been determined. The combination of the geometrical model and surface topography measurements allowed concluding that the spangle pattern is due to preferential dendrite growth along one of the two boundaries confining the melt layer. In addition, the new experimental evidence forced to discard the mechanisms previously proposed for the formation of intragranular crystallographic misorientations. The experimental findings acquired during this study indicate that the solidification shrinkage occurring in the area of the grain envelope is the driving force for the formation of the observed intragranular misorientations. The solidification shrinkage leads to the development of tensile stresses in the oxide film covering the coating while it solidifies. These stresses apply on the dendrite network and lead to plastic deformation in the tip area of the growing dendrite arms...|$|R
