40|$|There {{are only}} few reports <b>on</b> protein <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> from {{overlapping}} mammalian genes even though computational predictions suggest that an appreciable fraction of mammalian genes could potentially overlap. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has now acquired {{the tools to}} probe proteins in an unbiased manner, providing direct evidence of {{the output of the}} genomic and gene expression machinery. In particular, proteomics can refine gene predictions and discover novel gene-processing events and gene arrangements. Here, we report the mass spectrometric discovery and biochemical validation of the novel protein encoded by a gene overlapping rab 34 oncogene. The novel protein is highly conserved in mammals. In humans, it contains 13 distinct Nine-Amino acid Residue-Repeats (NARR) with the consensus sequence PRVIV(S/T) PR in which the serine or threonine residues are phosphorylated during M-phase. NARR is ubiquitously expressed and resides in nucleoli where it colocalizes with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene clusters. Its distribution only partially overlaps with upstream binding factor, one of the main regulators of RNA Polymerase I activity, and is entirely uncoupled from it in mitotic cells and upon inhibition of transcription. NARR only partially colocalizes with fibrillarin, the pre-ribosomal RNA-processing protein, positioning NARR in a separate niche within the rDNA cluster...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy crisis}} {{and a greater}} {{awareness}} among the general public regarding the issue of climate change have, between them, led to a notable increase in the interest shown by governments {{in relation to the}} problem of environmental sustainability. An example has been the initiative taken by the President of France to set up a commission, known as the Sarkozy Commission, named after the President, bringing together renowned economists to study and propose forms of economic performance measurement related to social progress. This article aims to propose a methodology to establish a quantitative definition of sustainability structured on the principles of minimum and maximum entropy production, and, based on this, outline a way of organizing the many sources of, and kinds of energy, we have available to us in order of the intensity of their respective environmental impacts. Based on this, we could produce an Environmental Sustainability Index, linked to existing statistical indicators of human development, and thereby arrive at a Sustainable Human Development Index, which would be positively or negatively influenced by parameters linked to environmental sustainability and quality of life. In order to ensure that this index can produce practical results, the WTO (World Trade Organization) would have to establish a scale of increments, to be applied to export tariffs <b>on</b> <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> in countries with different indexes.

However, they lack anti-thrombotic activity and hence lead to cardiovascular and renal liabilities apart from gastrointestinal irritation. To ameliorate this situation, research can be foccuss <b>on</b> the <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> from natural <b>products</b> that could offer better relief from inflammation than the currently used commercial drugs. Aspirin blocks the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX 1, 2) which {{is involved in the}} ring closure and the addition of O 2 to arachidonic acid, converting it to prostaglandins (which induce inflammation, pain and fever). The present study is undertaken to analyse the docking efficacy of aspirin with the target molecule (2 AW 1), to assess the best ligand for inhibiting COX and to analyze the docking program by Arguslab. Substituting aspirin ligand by sapelenin G, the finding suggests that sapelenin G is a better ligand than aspirin. It satisfies Lipinski Rule of 5. The PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) prediction results show that Sapelenin G has an anti-inflammatory activity. Toxicity estimations of Sapelenin G using Toxtree on humans and based on the Cramer rules, Verhaar, Structural Alerts for Reactivity in Toxtree (START) biodegradability, eye irritation/corrosion and skin irritation/corrosion fell into class 3, 5, 1, 2 and 1, respectively.

Unlike enzymes involved in PCA biosynthesis, EsmA 1 and EsmA 2 together decisively promoted the PDC yield. The resulting PDC underwent a series of conversions to give 6 -acetylphenazine- 1 -carboxylic acid, saphenic acid, and saphenamycin through a unique one-carbon extension by EsmB 1 –B 5, a keto reduction by EsmC, and an esterification by EsmD 1 –D 3, the atypical polyketide sythases, respectively.
