The results of the discriminant analysis showed that edible fraction, peel pH, <b>pulp</b> <b>water</b> content, and pulp total phenolics were among the most contributing attributes for the discrimination of the cultivar groups.

In this study, a method to isolate pectic acids from peroxide-bleached TMP <b>pulp</b> <b>water</b> is presented. The pectic acids were isolated and purified in good yield using a polyacrylate resin to remove lignin, a cellulose filter to remove galactoglucomannans (GGM), and an anion exchange resin to separate pectic acids from neutral carbohydrates. Salts and residual low-molar-mass carbohydrates were further removed from the isolated pectic acids by dialysis. The isolated pectic acids (> 80 % purity) had a low molar mass and a wide polydispersity (5. 9 kDa, MW/MN 3. 3). The aggregation and precipitation of the isolated pectic acids, as well as citrus fruit pectic acids with well-defined molar masses, by Ca 2 +-ions were studied. The molar mass of pectic acids was a key factor determining the precipitation of Ca 2 +-pectates. Pectic acids below 6 kDa were not precipitated by Ca 2 +, while higher molar masses led first to partial and then to complete precipitation.

40|$|Aim: Birds play a {{major role}} in the {{dispersal}} of seeds of many fleshy-fruited invasive plants. The fruits that birds choose to consume are influenced by fruit traits. However, little is known of how the traits of invasive plant fruits contribute to invasiveness or to their use by frugivores. We aim to gain a greater understanding of these relationships to improve invasive plant management. Location: South-east Queensland, Australia. Methods: We measure a variety of fruit morphology, pulp nutrient and phenology traits of a suite of bird-dispersed alien plants. Frugivore richness of these aliens was derived from the literature. Using regressions and multivariate methods, we investigate relationships between fruit traits, frugivore richness and invasiveness. Results: Plant invasiveness was negatively correlated to fruit size, and all highly invasive species had quite similar fruit morphology [smaller fruits, seeds of intermediate size and few (< 10) seeds per fruit]. Lower <b>pulp</b> <b>water</b> was the only pulp nutrient trait associated with invasiveness. There were strong positive relationships between the diversity of bird frugivores and plant invasiveness, and in the diversity of bird frugivores in the study region and another part of the plants' alien range. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that weed risk assessments (WRA) and predictions of invasive success for bird-dispersed plants can be improved. Scoring criteria for WRA regarding fruit size would need to be system-specific, depending on the fruit-processing capabilities of local frugivores. Frugivore richness could be quantified in the plant's natural range, its invasive range elsewhere, or predictions made based on functionally similar fruits...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to produce {{information}} for the estimation of the flow balance of wood resin in mechanical pulping and to demonstrate the possibilities for improving the efficiency of deresination in practice. It was observed that chemical changes in wood resin take place only during peroxide bleaching, {{a significant amount of}} water dispersed wood resin is retained in the pulp mat during dewatering and the amount of wood resin in the solid phase of the process filtrates is very small. On the basis of this information there exist three parameters related to behaviour of wood resin that determine the flow balance in the process: 1. The liberation of wood resin to the <b>pulp</b> <b>water</b> phase 2. Theretention of water dispersed wood resin in dewatering 3. The proportion of wood resin degraded in the peroxide bleaching The effect of different factors on these parameters was evaluated with the help of laboratory studies and a literature survey.

With the help of this information, it was possible to evaluate the deresination efficiency and the effect of different factors on this efficiency in a pulping plant that produced low-freeness mechanical pulp. This evaluation showed that the wood resin content of mechanical pulp can be significantly decreased if there exists, in the process, a peroxide bleaching and subsequent washing stage.

Here, 300  ml of tofu yellow syrup is put into the 500 -ml beaker and placed onto the heating platform for constant heating. We find that when heating temperature is at about 93  °C and the heating time is for 3 to 5  h, the tofu yellow serofluid in the beaker can become burning dry. (ii) We let the stuff in the beaker cool down naturally till room temperature and add 50 – 200  ml deionized water into the beaker. (iii) The mixture is magnetically stirred for 4  min to achieve the uniform and full mix of the matters and water. (iv) The mixture is taken for 5  min ultrasonic shock to break the loosing clusters. Thus, we can obtain the supernatant which contains carbon dots. (v) The supernatant is further centrifuged at a speed of 12, 000  r/min for 20  min, and the further supernatant can be obtained. As a result, the CQDs can be finally acquired within deionized water. It is found that the heating temperature, the heating time, and the pH value of the yellow <b>pulp</b> <b>water</b> in the synthesis process can affect rather strongly the growth of the CQDs. Therefore, the CQDs can be fabricated with certain fluorescent features through varying the above synthesis conditions.
