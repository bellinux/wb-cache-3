5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. Unlike those of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time. He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family as a boy, sitting down or on an elevated seat, or engaging {{in a range of}} contemporary situations.|$|E
5|$|Mowgli, a young orphan boy, {{is found}} in a basket in the deep jungles of India by Bagheera, a black panther who {{promptly}} takes him to a mother wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted with jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wolf siblings.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{were granted}} a {{parliamentary}} annuity of £6000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. In addition, a dower of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000, which yielded {{an income of}} about £4000 a year. As {{well as that of}} Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> dog Corrie, feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions.|$|E
5000|$|The event's name {{took on a}} {{somewhat}} looser interpretation when Fuzzy Zoeller teamed up <b>with</b> <b>his</b> daughter Gretchen in 2005. In 2013 and 2016, Bernhard Langer <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> daughter Christina, and in 2013, Arnold Palmer <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> grandson Sam Saunders.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} girl talking about what she wants in her next boyfriend while on some bleachers. After her {{monologue}} is over, the video cuts between shots of Eric Church and scenes of the girl and a boy during various high points and low points in their relationship. Church is seen throughout the video either <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> band in a garage, {{in the middle of}} the street on a piano, or walking through the streets with an American flag around his shoulders while singing. The video ends without showing whether the girl and boy ended up together.|$|E
5|$|Tim {{was born}} in Downers Grove, Illinois on December 8, 1967 to James and Kathleen Breslin. He was one of six children, having three sisters and two {{brothers}}. Breslin grew up in Addison, Illinois where he began playing hockey at age five. He learned the game while <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brothers on a frozen pond near the family home and on a backyard rink his father made. As he got older Breslin played in local leagues and Driscoll Catholic High School's club team, which afforded {{him the opportunity to}} join the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Gillan then {{formed a}} new band, simply called Gillan, {{retaining}} Towns (who would co-write {{most of the}} material), and adding guitarist Steve Byrd, bassist John McCoy and drummer Pete Barnacle. Byrd and Barnacle were quickly replaced by Bernie Tormé and by former Episode Six bandmate Mick Underwood, after Gillan saw Torme <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> punk trio. This band had a more high powered hard rock sound, {{and the release of}} Mr. Universe in October 1979 saw Ian Gillan back in the UK charts, although the independent record company the album came out on – Acrobat Records – folded soon after the album was released, prompting a contract with Richard Branson's Virgin Records.|$|E

5|$|In June 1888, Lord Harris played {{twice for}} Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt {{was out of}} form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match. In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of Bournemouth against the Parsees cricket team during their tour of England, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings. Nevertheless, the Parsees won. On 8 September 1888, the Blackheath Club played against the Christopherson {{brothers}}. Druitt was bowled out by Stanley Christopherson, who was <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brothers instead of for Blackheath, and in reply Druitt bowled out Christopherson. Blackheath won by 22 runs.|$|E
5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on a backyard pitch on the family's dairy farm, owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller. Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who {{died in a plane crash}} in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his efforts in Adelaide, East Fremantle used him as a forward when he {{returned}} to the club in 1905. He was a member of their 1906 premiership winning team, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> younger brother Albert. Another brother, Wilhelm, would also later play at East Fremantle.|$|E

25|$|Kansas City's roster took a major hit the {{day before}} the first game, when Bullet Rogan, their star pitcher, ran a needle into his leg while <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> child on the floor. While {{attempting}} to remove it himself, he broke it, and had to have it removed surgically, leaving him unable to play in the series. Utility player Dink Mothell was confined to bed and also unable to play.|$|E
25|$|He also {{produced}} {{a series of}} small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted Aretino and Charles V's Ambassador as well as Aretino and Tintoretto, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included Henry IV <b>Playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>His</b> Children (1817) and the Death of Leonardo.|$|E
25|$|In March 1999, Manser {{successfully}} passed Kuching immigration by disguising {{himself in}} a business suit, carrying a briefcase, and wearing a badly knotted tie. On 29 March 1999, he flew a motorised paraglider, carrying a toy lamb knitted by himself while wearing a T-shirt {{with the image of}} a sheep and made a few turns above Taib's residence in Kuching, Sarawak. There were 10 Penan tribe members waiting on the ground to greet Manser. At 11:30 AM, he landed the glider beside a road just outside Taib's residence and was immediately arrested. He was then transported to Kuala Lumpur on Malaysia Airlines flight MH 2683. He briefly stayed at a prison in Kuala Lumpur. He was seen <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> knitted toy lamb by his jailers. He was later deported back to Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning {{completed}} 25 of 38 {{passes for}} 250 yards, the most passing yards yet {{allowed by the}} Buccaneers, and a touchdown to Henry Childs. Chuck Muncie broke four tackles while scoring on a 21-yard run. The Buccaneer defense played uncharacteristically poorly, allowing 421 yards of offense. Special teams also broke down on several occasions. McKay called it the worst game the team had yet played, and promised that changes would be made. Buccaneer receivers blamed lack of concentration for missed routes and dropped balls. Doug Williams returned to the starting lineup, but Tampa Bay was {{able to control the}} ball for only 19 of the game's 60 minutes. Williams, <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> jaw still wired shut, threw a 2-yard fourth-down pass to Jimmie Giles for the Buccaneers’ only touchdown.|$|E
25|$|A {{versatile}} forward, Sheringham {{was capable}} of playing as a striker and also as a supporting forward, courtesy of his ability both to score and create goals. Due to his vision, his ability to read the game, and his short passing ability, Sheringham {{was capable of}} playing off another striker, in a deeper, creative role, where he served as an assist provider, in particular in later years, as he lost pace and stamina. He also possessed good technical ability and upper body strength, which allowed him to retain possession in the box when <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> back to goal, and lay off the ball for his teammates. As a centre-forward in his prime, he was also very effective and extremely prolific, due to his accurate finishing, opportunism in the area, intelligence, and his ability in the air, which enabled him {{to be regarded as}} one of the top Premier League forwards of his generation.|$|E
25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E
