40|$|According to {{nineteenth century}} <b>periodical,</b> Literary <b>Gazette,</b> Byron's Mazeppa was "written in a humour between grace and gay, neither tragic nor comic, a mule and mongrel between Beppo and the Bride of Abydos. " Certainly the dual mode {{of the poem}} as {{expressed}} here is its characteristic, but the existence of comic elements is not dominantly strong enough to decide the general tenor of the poem. Rather, the poem has a more serious intention of treating such themes as fortune, war and freedom. Mazeppa's stance to these ideas tends to be ambivalent and eclectic respectively. Hance his treatment of these themes cam {{be said to be}} metaphorically 'a mule and mongrel', to borrow the wording used in the quotation above, in that Mazeppa often takes contradictory attitudes to these themes...|$|R
50|$|Born in 1890 in Liverpool, Sullivan is {{believed}} to have organized a group named the Order of Twelve from 1911-1914 and again from 1920. In about 1924 it became known as the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship (Crotona was the site of Pythagoras’s school in southern Italy). As a journalist, playwright and actor George Alexander Sullivan used the name Alex Mathews; in the context of his mystical activities he used the name Frater Aureolis. From 1925-1928 he put out a <b>periodical,</b> The Rosicrucian <b>Gazette.</b> The ROCF operated first from Liverpool area of England and then from the mid-1930s onwards from the Christchurch area.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1925, Monnier, with Beach's {{moral and}} {{literary}} support, launched a French language review, Le Navire d'Argent (The Silver Ship), with Jean Prévost as literary editor. Taking {{its name from}} the silver sailing ship, which appears in Paris's coat of arms, it cost 5 Fr per issue, or 50 Fr for a twelve-month subscription. Although financially unsuccessful, it was {{an important part of the}} literary scene of the Twenties and was [...] "a great European light", helping launch several writers' careers. Typically, about a hundred pages per issue, it was [...] "French in language, but international in spirit" [...] and drew heavily on the circle of writers frequenting her shop. The first edition contained a French-language translation (prepared jointly by Monnier and Beach) of T. S. Eliot's poem, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (May 1925). Other issues included an early draft of part of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (Oct 1925); and an abridged version of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's novella, The Aviator, in the penultimate (April 1926) edition. One edition (March 1926) was devoted to American writers (including Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams and E. E. Cummings). It also first introduced Ernest Hemingway in translation to French audiences. Monnier herself contributed under the pseudonym J-M Sollier, based on her mother's maiden name. After twelve issues, Monnier abandoned the Navire d’Argent, as the effort and the cost was more than she could manage. To cover her losses, Monnier auctioned her personal collection of 400 books, many inscribed to her by their authors. A decade later, Monnier launched a successor <b>periodical,</b> the <b>Gazette</b> des Amis des Livres, which ran from January 1938 until May 1940.|$|R
50|$|The complex early {{publication}} {{history of}} Sports et divertissements was elucidated by Ornella Volta in the 1980s. It was apparently {{ready for the}} printers when World War I broke out in July 1914; under ensuing military censorship many French <b>periodicals,</b> including La <b>Gazette</b> du Bon Ton, folded or were suspended. Vogel dissolved his company in 1916 and later sold the materials for Sports to the publisher Maynial. He remained interested in the project, however, and as Maynial {{made no effort to}} produce the album Vogel repurchased the rights under his new company Les Editions Lucien Vogel et du Bon Ton in March 1922. Fashions and graphic design had changed dramatically in the intervening years, so Charles Martin replaced his original illustrations with a new set of drawings in a Cubist-influenced style; these were rendered into full-color pochoir prints at the studio of Jean Saudé, a leading practitioner of the technique. This edition was announced in January 1923, but the publisher Éditions de La Sirène, which then had Satie under exclusive contract, intervened to assert their rights over the music. The work's release was further delayed as Vogel worked out a settlement with La Sirène.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{news media}} {{industry}} in France {{has a long}} tradition. Le Mercure Franc¸ois {{is known as the}} first news review. It started to appear in 1611. In 1631, The´ophraste Renaudot launched the first <b>periodical</b> paper, La <b>Gazette.</b> The first daily newspaper appeared in 1777 : Le Journal de Paris. In 1830 s, France became {{known as one of the}} three pioneers of the modern daily press in Europe. At that time, the newspaper industry was very innovative. For instance, the French penny press based on a new business model was introduced by journalist entrepreneurs Emile de Girardin and Armand Dutacq. They founded La Presse and Le Sie`cle in June and July 1836 respectively. These mass newspapers offered a content mixing news, romanfeuilleton and commercials. Due to the mass production, they could offer a lower subscription price (Eveno, 2003). In 1863, Moı¨se Millaud launched Le Petit Journal. It used an innovative business model based on the use of modern printingmachine (de la Motte and Przyblyski, 1999). In the turmoil after World War II (1944 – 1947), the evolution of the printed press was influenced by the intervention of the French government. The government decided to set conditions on the structure of the newspaper market with strong constraints. Although France played an important role in the development of the press and freedom of the press for centuries, it does not have a leading position anymore. France is ranked 38 th in the world regarding the press freedom index (Reporters Sans Frontières, 2015). The main reason for this position is that France does not provide effective protection for the confidentiality of journalists’ source...|$|R
40|$|From {{the start}} of his writing career, Thomas De Quincey was so dens ly {{surrounded}} by literary culture that it was difficult for him to write as he pleased. He had been forced to meet various editorial requirements and be sensitive to readers' response. This biographical fact should be considered when interpreting the Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and its long history, along with some critical appreciation of the generic characteristics of the Confessions as a work of modern autobiography. In 1821 the Confessions was published in London Magazine, and in a few months it circulated again in a book form. Then, in 1856 the work reappeared in one of the volumes of De Quincey's authorized collected writings. This history of the Confessions is also that of the author's revisionary endeavour, through which the revised version emerged quite differently from the original. And that is where the dynamics of these two vectors one originating from literary culture, and the other from the author's concern over his future identity as a writer holds a special significance for the Confessions itself. After working as the editor of a local <b>periodical,</b> The Westmorland <b>Gazette.</b> De Quincey composed the Confessions, and the work could be regarded as a typical article f r his contemporary magazines especially in view of its anonymous publication, and ample quotations from both classical and contemporary literature as well as philosophical knowledge scattered 'throughout it. However, viewed with wider perspective not only upon the literary culture but the work's autobiographical theme, the Confessions has noteworthy characteristics which might bring the author from his strictly conditioned status as a magazine contributor into the more genuine field for writers with abilities to produce original literary works. And it was his extraordinary opium experiences which could make the transition possible. The Confessions of 1821 does hot tell whether it will happen or not, and the question remains to be answered till the time when the history of the work unfolds...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers how imperial {{subjects and}} citizens made claims to political belonging {{in the period}} prior to the consolidation of nationalism as an ideology. Focusing on French and Ottoman texts produced between 1718 and 1905 that narrate movements across geographic, political, and cultural borders, my study explores shifting dynamics of political identification and belonging that defy easy geopolitical narratives, either of long-standing confrontation between “East” and “West” or of cosmopolitan coexistence in “contact zones. ” I argue that the relational and affective sensibility that characterizes belonging to a political community was cultivated and sustained through cross-cultural exchange: ideas and ideals of religion, geography, ethnicity, and most insistently, masculinity, femininity, and sexuality provided the terms of intelligibility through which imperial belonging was articulated, and imperial governance was defended and contested. This study contributes {{to the field of}} comparative political theory by bringing texts from the Ottoman Empire to the forefront of debates about political membership, identity, and belonging. Likewise, the theoretical framework I develop to navigate the historical and philosophical entanglements between Europe and the Middle East, Christianity and Islam, and Orient and Occident in the modern period challenges the primacy of Orientalism in accounting for the political and cultural construction of difference. My theoretical framework identifies four modalities of political belonging, that is, four distinct linguistic and discursive fields in which gendered, geographic, religious, ethnic, and cultural differences were transformed into political ones. These four modalities - encounter, translation, conversion, and resistance - provide interpretive lenses through which I trace the generative role of what I call a transnational imaginary. Chapter one theorizes encounter, which makes foreign communities an indispensable yet distorting mirror for the communal self, through a comparative reading of Montesquieu’s Persian Letters and Mehmed Efendi’s French Embassy Letters. Chapter two turns to Ignatius’ Mouradgea d’Ohsson’s General Sketch of the Ottoman Empire to theorize translation. As a modality of political belonging, translation simultaneously affirms difference between natives and foreigners and highlights their capacity to achieve universal understanding. Chapter three puts the first Ottoman novel Akabi’s Story in conversation with Chateaubriand’s novella Atala and French-Catholic missionary reports from the Ottoman Levant to elucidate conversion as a modality of belonging contingent on the other’s capacity to be radically changed. Chapter four analyzes a series of articles from the Ottoman women’s <b>periodical</b> Ladies’ Own <b>Gazette,</b> where resistance emerges as a modality of political belonging that entails both an identitarian attachment to community and a rejection of its exclusionary practices. A concluding chapter reflects on the sequencing of these modalities, the parallel consolidation of political belonging into nationalism and transnational entanglements into an East/West binary, and the potential contributions of interpretive categories developed in the dissertation to contemporary dilemmas of inclusion, exclusion, and globalization...|$|R
