In 1986, Sandy Weill convinced the Control Data management to spin off their Commercial Credit subsidiary to prevent the company's potential liquidation. Over a period of years, Weill used Commercial Credit to build an empire that became Citigroup. In 1999, Commercial Credit was renamed CitiFinancial, and in 2011, the full-service network of US CitiFinancial branches were renamed OneMain Financial.|$|E
50|$|After {{downsizing}} of the State Ministry in {{the year}} 2004 he was retained as a Minister & was allocated the additional charge of Industry & Commerce.This department was too full of challenges as the process of industrialization was very slack and many PSU's {{were on the verge}} of closure. Another prestigious PSU - Assam Tea Corporation was in the reds and it was only after Sri Dutta took over charge of its Chairman in February 2005 the fortunes were gradually revived. Today employees of ATC are receiving regular salaries as its production capacity was enhanced and its produce received good prices from the market. Sri Dutta as the Minister for Industries could also revive the dying Assam Small Industries Development Corporation (ASIDC) due to effective regulation of the Assam Store <b>Purchase</b> <b>Control</b> Act (APSP). He was also largely successful in taking the Industries and Commerce Department to the doorstep of the average entrepreneur by launching the innovative schemes of KarmaJyoti (beneficiary scheme for the weavers and artisans) and Chatra UdyogJyoti (motivational scheme for entrepreneurship).|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Forsythe {{returned}} to full {{ownership of a}} race team and retained Player's as his sponsor. At {{the end of that}} season, he opted to join Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) over Tony George's Indy Racing League when the IndyCar series split {{as a result of a}} bitter dispute between George and CART executives. Since that time, several notable drivers (mostly Canadians) have driven for him, including Greg Moore, Patrick Carpentier, Alex Tagliani and, most recently, Paul Tracy. The team had the most successful season in its history in 2003, with Tracy winning seven races en route to capturing the last-ever CART championship. After the 2003 campaign, Forsythe pooled resources with fellow team owners Kevin Kalkhoven and Paul Gentilozzi to purchase CART's liquidated assets and create the Champ Car World Series. His team, now known as Forsythe Championship Racing after losing Player's as a sponsor due to Canadian anti-tobacco legislation, promptly joined the new circuit. Shortly afterwards, he and his partners purchased CART's sole engine supplier, Cosworth, and in 2006 Forsythe and Kalkhoven formed the Grand Prix Association of Toronto to <b>purchase</b> <b>control</b> of the Molson Indy Toronto, one of Champ Car's marquee races, from Molson.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This paper investigates stock-market {{reactions}} to mergers and partial sales of non-financial Turkish firms. Turkish targets earn average cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) of 8. 56 {{percent in the}} three-day window around merger announcements when bidders <b>purchase</b> <b>control</b> rights and 2. 25 percent when they do not. The results indicate that acquirers pay a premium to <b>purchase</b> <b>control</b> rights. The smaller magnitude of target CAR in Turkish mergers (relative to CAR of around 20 percent in US and 10 percent in Europe) may be explained by: 1) {{the reduction in the}} power of event study method to capture the effect of merger announcements due to information leakages and misidentification of announcement dates; and 2) the differences in Turkish regulatory, operational and competitive environment...|$|E
40|$|Recent housing {{policies}} include measures for home <b>purchase</b> <b>control</b> and shanty town redevelopment. This study proposes sustainable pricing, {{in that the}} long-run equilibrium price {{is determined by the}} fundamentals of house prices. We argue that changes in CPI might have led to rapidly growing house prices and rather high price levels. We investigate the long-run or short-run impacts of new commodity housing completions, transacted square meters of commodity housing, and CPI for house prices in Shanghai. We adopt monthly data for the period of 2005 – 2010. We test for unit roots using both the ADF and PP techniques and structural breaks using both the Zivot-Andrews (Model B) and Perron (Model C) methods. Considering Cheung-Lai and Reinsel–Ahn finite-sample corrections, the results suggest a long-run equilibrium. Housing completions negatively impact house prices in the short run. A positive volume-price relationship is suggested. Housing sales affect house prices in the short run but not vice versa. Hence, the empirical evidence supports the search model. In addition, CPI is strongly exogenous with respect to the long-run relationship and thus is a long-term determinant of house prices. CPI also positively and drastically influences house prices in the short run. Therefore, a reduction in inflation rate could stabilize house prices, increasing the chances of sustainable prices in the future...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{monitoring}} of usage behavior necessitates applying accurate stochastic models to represent customer heterogeneous time-dependent behavior. In this research, {{it is assumed}} that the sequence of customer visits over a subscription period occurs based on the Poisson process, while usage at each purchase occasion follows an autoregressive Bernoulli model of first order. The autocorrelated observations are derived from a two-state Markov chain model. Generalized linear models are employed to describe heterogeneous behavior across customers. In order to monitor the number of visits as well as the fraction of visits eventuated in a <b>purchase,</b> <b>control</b> statistics are defined on the basis of generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} marginal logistic model for dependent observations, a chi-square test statistic based on the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of quasi-likelihood estimates is employed. Performances of the monitoring schemes are compared with an illustrative case provided by simulation. Results indicate that the adjusted Shewhart c chart resembles the deviance residual control chart for monitoring the frequency of customer visit. On the other hand, the GLR statistic based on the conditional logistic regression is more powerful in detecting unnatural usage behavior when compared with the chi-square control statistic based on the marginal logistic model. generalized linear models, autocorrelated Bernoulli process, quasi-likelihood, longitudinal data, customer usage behavior,...|$|E
