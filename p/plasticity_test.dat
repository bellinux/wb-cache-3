Micro-scale specimens, representative of stent struts, are manufactured via laser micro-machining and electro-polishing from biomedical grade CoCr alloy foil. Crystal plasticity models of the micro-specimens are developed using a length scale-dependent, strain-gradient constitutive model and a phenomenological (power-law) constitutive model, calibrated from monotonic and cyclic <b>plasticity</b> <b>test</b> data. Experimental microstructural characterisation of the grain morphology and precipitate distributions is used as input for the polycrystalline finite element (FE) morphologies.

We examined the interaction between correlated (seasonally matching) and conflicting (seasonally opposite) temperature and photoperiod cues on the acclimation of performance traits in male zebrafish, Danio rerio. We acclimated fish for 8 weeks and then tested the change in thermal dependence of maximum burst swimming and feeding rate between 8 and 38 °C. We predicted that correlated environmental cues should induce a greater acclimation response than uncorrelated cues. However, we found that only temperature was important for the seasonal acclimation of performance traits in zebrafish. Thermal acclimation shifted the thermal performance curve of both traits. For maximum burst swimming, performance increased for each group near the acclimation temperature and reduced in environments that were far from their acclimation temperature. The feeding rate of cold-acclimated zebrafish was reduced across the test temperature range compared with that of warm-acclimated fish. Our study is the first that has found no effect of the covariation between temperature and photoperiod acclimation cues on locomotor performance in fishes.

40|$|The {{empirical}} concepts for {{the liquid}} limit and plastic limit of fine-grained soils {{have been in}} use since they were originally defined by Atterberg in 1911, introduced into use by Terzaghi and modified by Casagrande. The liquid limit by fall-cone has been the preferred method since 1975 and is currently described in BS 1377 : Part 2 : (1990). It seems a logical step that the plasticity index should also be determined using the fall-cone. It is at present defined as the mathematical difference between two separate tests:- the current thread rolling plastic limit test and the cone penetrometer liquid limit test, both as described in BS 1377 : Part 2 : (1990). This research, whilst {{taking into account the}} findings of others is empirical in nature. Laboratory testing is carried out by the author to produce data for analysis from samples of natural remoulded UK soils. The initial testing programme involves the determination of cone penetration and undrained shear strength by laboratory shear vane. Determination of plastic limit, (thread-roll method), and liquid limit, (fall-cone method), is also carried out for each soil sample. Other tests include clay content, particle density and dry density. Samples are also prepared and tested for clay mineralogy by x-ray diffraction. A correlation is discovered linking density at the cone penetromer liquid limit with plasticity index. Consequently, additional samples are obtained and tested for index limits and density only. A new method of determining plasticity index from fall cone and density determination is proposed. A survey is conducted whereby volunteers are asked to carry out liquid limit and plastic limit tests on standard soil samples. Additionally, extra weighings are required. Analysis of these data enable a direct comparison to be made between plasticity index determiations produced by the colunteers using both the current method and the proposed new method.

The design of the road was carried out. The stabiliser SoilTech Mk III polymer was added to the soil at different percentages and the maximum dry densities, CBR and optimum moisture content measured.

40|$|In Europe, clay {{roof tiles}} are {{manufactured}} by pressing in 'open' moulds whereas in South East Asia 'closed' moulds are commonly used. The European products are more complex, having {{a greater degree}} of detail. Closed mould pressing could, however, be advantageous as it would minimise scrap recycling but the products would need to have equivalent or superior durability to existing tiles. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using a closed mould for the manufacture of European tiles by examining the relationship between the type of pressing and subsequent durability, in terms of resistance to repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. One specific clay type, the Marseille rose blend, was investigated over a range of forming water contents. Preliminary data relating to plasticity and friction were obtained through an empirical (Pfefferkorn) <b>plasticity</b> <b>test,</b> uniaxial compression of cylinders and friction ring experiments. Clay cylinders containing 16 - 21 wt % water were deformed at a compression rate of 240 mm/min. The yield stress was found to increase with decreasing moisture content. The plastic ranges of the stress-strain curves were well represented by a plastic deformation equation of uniaxial compression under sticking friction conditions. A laboratory-scale pressing rig was designed to make profiled specimens which would reproduce the essential features of a European tile. Comparison of the microstructures of the laboratory and factory samples showed that there was sufficient resemblance to validate the replication of the Marseille products in the laboratory tests. Bats of three moisture contents of 16. 4, 18. 4 and 20. 6 wt % and different geometries were pressed in open, partially closed and closed rubber lined resin moulds in a mechanical testing machine using a cross-head speed of 240 mm/min. This was lower than a typical pressing operation but the speed of pressing had been found to not be a significant variable over the range commonly encountered. Clay was trapped in the features as the mould closed and flowed mainly within the flat part of the samples during pressing. For the open and partially closed moulds excess material was extruded through the gaps at the sides, a process referred to as flashing. The shape of the load-displacement curves was characteristic of the stages of the pressing process. The stress-strain curves for the pressing in open moulds showed good qualitative agreement with the results from uniaxial compression of cylinders. The open porosity of the samples after firing was strongly related to the forming moisture content of the clay with the open porosity increasing with increasing water content. Comparison of extruded bats and pressed bars showed that the influence of the pressing processes was not significant. Likewise, in freeze-thaw testing, the effect of the moisture content was again the overriding parameter, with acceptable durability always being obtained from the lowest open porosity samples. Given the marginal differences, the pressing processes investigated in this study were assumed to be equivalent in terms {{of the quality of the}} samples produced.

The overall goal was worked out through simple laboratory experiments, such as particle size analysis, <b>plasticity</b> <b>tests,</b> compaction tests, permeability tests, and strength tests. A review of the problems suggested three areas of study: pavement cracking due to improper management of pavement geotechnical materials, permeability of mixed-subgrade soils, and settlement of soil above the pipe due to improper compaction of the backfill. This resulted in the following three areas of study: (1) The optimization and management of earthwork materials through general soil mixing of various select and unsuitable soils and a specific example of optimization of materials in earthwork construction by soil mixing; (2) An investigation of the saturated permeability of compacted glacial till in relation to validation and prediction with the Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model (EICM); and (3) A field investigation and numerical modeling of culvert settlement. For each area of study, a literature review was conducted, research data were collected and analyzed, and important findings and conclusions were drawn.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and painless method to stimulate the human brain.

40|$|Poster Presentation - Theme 5 : NeuroscienceDuring the {{formative}} period of neural circuits, perineuronal nets (PN) are established to restrict plasticity of the circuit. The role of PN in vestibular <b>plasticity</b> can be <b>tested</b> {{by studying the}} emergence of negative geotaxis with postnatal maturation of the vestibular circuitry for gravity detection. Using rats as model, we observed that negative geotaxis was mature by postnatal day (P) 9, in correlation with consolidation of PN around GABAergic neurons …postprin...|$|R

Prolonged cortical thickening observed in individuals with high IQ might reflect {{an extended period of}} synaptogenesis and high environmental sensitivity or <b>plasticity.</b> We <b>tested</b> this hypothesis by examining the timing of changes in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on IQ as a function of IQ score. We found that individuals with high IQ show high environmental influence on IQ into adolescence (resembling younger children), whereas individuals with low IQ show high heritability of IQ in adolescence (resembling adults), a pattern consistent with an extended sensitive period for intellectual development in more-intelligent individuals. The pattern held across a cross-sectional sample of almost 11, 000 twin pairs and a longitudinal sample of twins, biological siblings, and adoptive siblings. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGABAergic (GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons from {{different}} brain regions contain {{high levels of}} parvalbumin, both in their soma and in their neurites. Parvalbumin is a slow Ca(2 +) buffer that may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2 +) transients in terminals after an action potential, and hence may regulate short-term synaptic <b>plasticity.</b> To <b>test</b> this possibility, we have applied paired-pulse stimulations (with 30 - to 300 -ms intervals) at GABAergic synapses between interneurons and Purkinje cells, both in wild-type (PV+/+) mice and in parvalbumin knockout (PV-/-) mice. We observed paired-pulse depression in PV+/+ mice, but paired-pulse facilitation in PV-/- mice. In paired recordings of connected interneuron-Purkinje cells, dialysis of the presynaptic interneuron with the slow Ca(2 +) buffer EGTA (1 mM) rescues paired-pulse depression in PV-/- mice. These data show that parvalbumin potently modulates short-term synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Post yield {{uniaxial}} tension-compression {{tests were}} {{run on a}} solution treated and aged (STA), titanium 6 -percent aluminum 4 -percent vanadium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) alloy to determine the yield behavior on load reversal. The material exhibits plastic behavior almost immediately on load reversal implying a strong Bauschinger effect. The resultant stress-strain data was compared to a 1 D mechanics model and a finite element model used to design a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV). Although the models and experimental data compare well for the initial loading and unloading in the tensile regime, agreement is lost in the compressive regime due to the Bauschinger effect and the assumption of perfect <b>plasticity.</b> The <b>test</b> data presented here {{are being used to}} develop more accurate cyclic hardening constitutive models for future finite element design analysis of COPVs...|$|R
