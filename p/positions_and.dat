40|$|AbstractA 6 -degree {{of freedom}} (6 -DOF) {{aircraft}} wing <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose automatic adjustment method {{is presented to}} improve ARJ 21 wing-fuselage connection precision <b>and</b> efficiency. Wing <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose are adjusted by three pillars which are driven by six high-precision servo motors. During the adjustment process, wing is tracked <b>and</b> <b>positioned</b> by laser tracker. Wing initial <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose are calibrated by using the measurement coordinates of assembly reference points. Wing target <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose are calculated according to wing initial, fuselage <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose, <b>and</b> relative <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose requirements between wing and fuselage for the connection. Combining Newton-Euler method with quaternion <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose analyzing method, the inverse kinematics of servo motors, together with the adjustment system dynamics is obtained. Wing quintic polynomial trajectory planning algorithm based on quaternion is proposed; the initial, target <b>position</b> <b>and</b> pose need to be solved and the intermediate moving path is uncertain. Simulation {{results show that the}} adjustment method has good dynamic characteristics and satisfies engineering requirements. Preliminary engineering application indicates that ARJ 21 wing adjustment efficiency and precision are improved by using the proposed method...|$|R

5000|$|The caliper {{controller}} {{controls the}} <b>position</b> <b>and</b> {{speed of the}} brake actuator (besides its main task which is tracking of its reference brake command). Thus, <b>position</b> <b>and</b> speed sensors are vitally required in each e-caliper and an efficient design of a measurement mechanism to sense the <b>position</b> <b>and</b> speed of the actuator is required. Recent designs for brake-by-wire systems use resolvers to provide accurate and continuous measurements for both absolute <b>position</b> <b>and</b> speed of the [...] of the actuators. Incremental encoders are relative <b>position</b> sensors <b>and</b> their additive error needs to be calibrated or compensated for by different methods. Unlike the encoders, resolvers provide two output signals that always allow the detection of absolute angular position. In addition, they suppress common mode noise and are especially useful in a noisy environment. Because of these reasons, resolvers are usually applied {{for the purpose of}} <b>position</b> <b>and</b> speed measurement in brake-by-wire systems. However, nonlinear and robust observers are required to extract accurate <b>position</b> <b>and</b> speed estimates from the sinusoidal signals provided by resolvers.|$|R

40|$|WO 2006058633 A UPAB: 20060706 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} determining <b>position</b> <b>and</b> {{orientation of}} an object e. g. hip prosthesis, and a femur of a patient relative to a reference system based on a scanning rate. Momentary <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation of the object relative to the femur obtained from the determined <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation are compared with a desired preset <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation to modify the object position to reach the desired <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method determines the <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation of the object and the femur relative to the reference system by using a three-dimensional inertial sensor system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for execution of a method for navigating <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> an object relative to a patient during a surgery in operating room. USE - Used for navigating <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> an object e. g. hip prosthesis, relative to a femur of a patient during a surgery in an operating room. ADVANTAGE - The momentary <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation of the prosthesis relative to the femur of the patient is obtained from the <b>position</b> <b>and</b> {{the orientation of the}} prosthesis determined by the three-dimensional inertial sensor system, thus avoiding the need for providing the cameras and an evaluation unit in a device, which implements a method of navigating <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> {{of an object}}. The method hence reduces the cost of the device, and makes the device compact and easy to transport. The method also ensures correct positioning of the hip prosthesis relative to the femur...|$|R
