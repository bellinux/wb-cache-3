2500|$|The Colour and the Shape {{has been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, and grunge by professional reviewers. Much of the lyricism found on the album revolves around battered romanticism, more specifically the dissolution of Grohl and Jennifer Youngblood's marriage {{during the winter of}} 1996, which Grohl described as [...] "the winter of my discontent." [...] The album's track sequence reflects this sentiment, chronicling his change from chaos to newfound happiness. Although Grohl admitted the lyricism found on Foo Fighters was obscure and [...] "nonsense," [...] Norton pushed Grohl to write lyrics that had meaning. Grohl also found new strength in his singing compared to the insecurities on his voice for the debut, and delved deeper into his feelings with the lyrics, with him stating that [...] "there was a new freedom: 'Wow, I can actually write about things I feel strongly about and things that mean something to me and things I wouldn't normally say in everyday conversation.'"

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{planning}} in stochastic domains {{by means of}} partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). POMDPs are difficult to solve. This paper considers problems where one, although does not know the true state of the world, has a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> idea <b>about</b> it and uses such problem characteristics to transform POMDPs into approximately equivalent ones that are much easier to solve.

40|$|It {{is often}} implied, and {{sometimes}} explicitly asserted, that folk psychology is {{best understood as}} a kind of predictive device. The key contention of this widely held view is that people apply folk-psychological concepts because the application of these concepts enables them to predict future behavior. If we know what an agent believes, desires, intends, etc., we can make a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> guess <b>about</b> what he or she will do next. It {{seems to me that this}} picture is not quite right. In a series of recent papers, my colleagues and I have presented data that suggests that moral considerations actually play an important role in folk psychology (Knobe 2003 a; 2003 b; 2004; Knobe & Burra forthcoming; Knobe & Mendlow forthcoming). These findings do not sit well with the view according to which folk psychology is best understood as a predictive device. It appears that folk psychology might be better understood {{as a kind of}} multi-purpose tool. It is used not only in making predictive judgments but also in making moral judgments, and both of these uses appear to have shaped the fundamental competencies that underlie it.

[...] In 1994, Perrotta published his first book, {{a collection of short stories}} titled Bad Haircut: Stories of the Seventies which The Washington Post called [...] "more powerful than any other coming-of-age novel." [...] The same year, Perrotta left Yale and began teaching expository writing at Harvard University. In 1997 he published The Wishbones, his first novel, which Perrotta has said is basically [...] "about my high school years." [...] The unpublished manuscript of Election was optioned as a screenplay in 1996 by director Alexander Payne, which then led to interest in publishing it as a book. It arrived in bookstores in March 1998, followed shortly by its film adaptation, which was released in April 1999 to critical acclaim. The film, which starred Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, helped popularize Perrotta as an author.|$|R
