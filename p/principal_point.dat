Between 1932 and 1938, he chaired the Union of Soviet Architects, a state-managed union that replaced all the formerly independent associations. In the same period, being chief architect of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy and its successor, Commissariat for Heavy Industry, he reported directly to Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze and was the top-ranking architect of the Soviet industrialization. He cooperated on good terms with Albert Kahn and was the only Soviet to send condolences to Kahn's widow {{after his death in}} 1942. Vesnin's alumnus and protege Anatoly Fisenko (1902–1982, MVTU class of 1925) was the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> of contact between Soviet authorities and Kahn's firm, and was secretly tasked with training masses of local students at the expense of Kahn's Moscow offices. After the breakup with Kahn in 1932 Fisenko was arrested, spent half a year in prison but was extricated by Victor Vesnin. Gosproyektstroy-1 (later Metallostroyproyekt), managed by Fisenko and supervised by Vesnin before World War II, designed practically all Soviet metallurgical plants, Gorky Auto Plant, Zhiguli Hydroelectric Station and other top priority industrial sites.|$|E

40|$|The set of k {{points that}} optimally {{represent}} a distribution {{in terms of}} mean squared error have been called <b>principal</b> <b>points</b> (Flury 1990). <b>Principal</b> <b>points</b> are a special case of self-consistent points. Any given set of k distinct points in R p induce a partition of R p into Voronoi regions or domains of attraction according to minimal distance. A set of k points are called self-consistent for a distribution if each point equals the conditional mean of the distribution over its respective Voronoi region. For symmetric multivariate distributions, sets of self-consistent points typically form symmetric patterns. This paper investigates the optimality of different symmetric patterns of self-consistent points for symmetric multivariate distributions and in particular for the bivariate normal distribution.

One of his hardest hits was delivered on Calgary's Matt Stajan in November 2010. As Stajan skated into the offensive zone, he prepared to send a pass toward his left. Unknown to Stajan, who had turned to follow his pass, Staal was coming across from Stajan's right and delivered a clean, hard shoulder to shoulder hit that left Stajan struggling on the ice. The hit dislodged Stajan's helmet and stick.
