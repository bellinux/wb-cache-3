5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} smoking {{cigarettes}} {{is followed by}} diverse effects on ovaries anddeveloping follicles but the effect of passive smoking on ovarian function is unknown. On the otherhand, the ovarian response to induction {{is a very important}} step in assisted reproduction. The aimof this study is to compare ovarian response in passive smokers and non-passive smokers in anassisted reproductive program. Materials and Methods: In a cohort study at the Isfahan Fertility and Infertility Center, there were 72 women in the <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> group and 72 women in the non-passive smoker group who underwentan assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. The follicle number at administration of humanchorionic gonadotropin (HCG), number of gonadotropin ampoules and duration of super ovulationinduction were compared. Results: Statistical analyses indicated that the number of mature follicles in the <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> groupwas not different from the control group; but the number of unresponsive cycles to super ovulation inthe <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> group (33. 3 %) was significantly higher than the control group (12. 5 %). Durationof induction and number of gonadotropin ampoules were not different between the two groups. Conclusion: The results of this study show that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the chanceof unresponsiveness to ovulation induction. This condition {{may be due to the}} result of decline inovarian reserve in second-hand smokers. The duration of induction and number of gonadotropinampules is similar in the two groups. Furthermore, the results show that exposure to cigarette smokedoes not clinically impact women with good ovarian reserve...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low birth weigth babies (LBW) {{are most}} likely a cause of the infant {{mortality}} and morbidity. Many factors causes LBW babies as maternal health, behavior during pregnancy, environmental  as well as fetal and placental factors. Negative behavior during pregnancy such as exposure of cigarette smoke can affect the body’s supply of oxygen from mother to fetus and placenta. Exposure to cigarette smoke may also reduce maternal folic acid level which causes disruption of fetal growth inside the womb. Objective: This study was aimed to fnd out the risk of low birth weight baby in the <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> pregnant woman. Method: The study used a case control design. The subject consisted of mothers who delivered at RSU dr. Zainoel Abidin in Banda Aceh municipality. The case group were mothers who delivered babies of less than 2, 500 grams and the control group were those who delivered babies of 2, 500 grams or more. Each group consisted of 105 mothers (1 : 1). Sample were taken using non probability with consecutive sampling method. Data analysis used univariable method with frequency distribution, bivariable with chi square and multivariable with logistic regression. Results: <b>Passive</b> <b>smoker</b> pregnant woman exposed the 1 - 10 cigarettes a day had risk 2, 4 times greater of getting low birth weight baby (OR= 2, 42; 95 %CI 1, 24 - 4, 71). Pregnant mother exposed to ≥ 11 cigarettes a day had the risk 3, 1 times greates in having LBW infants than those not exposed (OR= 3, 1; 95 %CI 1, 50 - 6, 70). Conclusion: <b>Passive</b> <b>smoker</b> of pregnant mother increased the risk of low birth weight babies...|$|E

40|$|Background Indonesia ranks fifth among {{countries}} {{with the highest}} aggregate levels of tobacco consumption in the world. Infants and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke have increased rates of asthma, respiratory and ear infections, as well as reduced lung function. The effects of tobacco smoke exposure on lung function in children {{have been reported to}} be dependent on the source of smoke and the length and dose of exposure. Lung function may also be affected by a child’s gender and asthma status. Objective To compare peak expiratory flow (PEF) in pediatric <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> to that of children not exposed to second hand smoke, and to define factors that may affect PEF in <b>passive</b> <b>smokers.</b> Methods In August 2009 we conducted a cross-sectional study at an elementary school in the Langkat district. Subjects were aged 6 to 12 years, and divided into two groups: <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> and those not exposed to secondhand smoke. Subjects’ PEFs were measured with a Mini-Wright peak flow meter. Measurements were performed in triplicate with the highest value recorded as the PEF. Demographic data including age, sex, weight, height, family income, parental education levels and occupations were obtained through questionnaires. Results Of the 170 participants, 100 were <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> and 70 were not exposed to secondhand smoke. Age distribution, weight and height were similar in both groups. We observed a significant difference in PEFs between the group of <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> and the group not exposed to secondhand smoke, 211. 3 L/minute (SD 61. 08) and 242. 7 L/minute (SD 77. 09), respectively (P < 0. 005). The number of years of exposure to smoke (P = 0. 079) and the number of cigarettes smoked daily in the household (P = 0. 098) did not significantly influence PEF. Conclusion The PEF in pediatric <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> was significantly lower than that of children not exposed to secondhand smoke. PEF in <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> was not influenced by the number of years of smoke exposure or the number of cigarettes smoked daily in the household...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the correlation of exposing to the cigarette smoke in childhood and adolescence with infertility and abortion in women. This case-control study evaluated 178 women who had been attended to at the Amir-al-Momenin Hospital in Tehran in 2012 - 2013. Seventy-eight women with chief complaint of abortion, infertility, and missed abortion and 100 healthy women were considered as case and control groups, respectively. The tool was a questionnaire with two parts. In the first part demographic information was gathered and in the second part the information regarding the history of passive smoking in childhood and adolescence period, abortion, and infertility was gathered. The mean age in case and control groups was 26. 24 ± 3. 1 and 27. 3 ± 4. 2 years, respectively. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25. 74 ± 1. 38 [*]Kg/m 2. Abortion rates among <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> and nonpassive smoker patients were statistically significant (P= 0. 036). Based on findings of this study, the experience of being a <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> in childhood and adolescence in women will increase the risk of abortion and infertility in the future, which could be the reason to encourage the society to step back from smoking cigarettes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aerosol {{generated}} when {{a cigarette}} is smoked {{is a significant}} indoor contaminant. Both smokers and non-smokers can be exposed to this class of pollutants. Nevertheless, they are not exposed to {{the same kind of}} smoke. The active smoker breathes in the mainstream smoke (MSS) during a puff, whereas the <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> inhales not only the smoke generated by the lit cigarette between two puffs (SSS) but also the smoke exhaled by active smokers (EXS). The aerosol fraction of EXS has until now been poorly documented; its composition is expected to be different from MSS. This study aims to investigate the complex composition of aerosol from EXS to better understand the difference in exposure between active and passive smokers. To address this, the in-situ laser desorption ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (LDI-FTICRMS) was used to characterise the aerosol composition of EXS from two different smokers. Results clearly indicated many similarities between EXS samples but also significant differences with MSS and SSS aerosol. The comparison of MSS and EXS aerosol allowed the chemicals retained by the active smoker's lungs to be identified, whereas the convolution of the EXS and SSS aerosol compositions were considered relevant to the exposition of a <b>passive</b> <b>smoker.</b> As a consequence, active smokers are thought to be mainly exposed to polar and poorly unsaturated oxygenated and nitrogenated organics, compared with poorly oxygenated but highly unsaturated compounds in passive smokers...|$|E

It´s divided in several parts {{one of which}} is a description of the process of becoming a involuntary <b>passive</b> <b>smoker,</b> an overview about principal consequences of being active or <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> as well as the summary of composition of the tobacco smoke, which is very injurious to human health. There is also a chapter talking about main differences between the influence of the passive and active smoking on human organism. Passive smoking belongs to the most extended global and social problems nowadays and the most endangered group of passive smokers are children living with active smokers at home. Children frequenting elementary schools are very specific group of young people. Active smoking is dramatically extended in this type of schools, that´s way this bachelor work also talks about the prevention, its meaning and possibilities. The last part of this bachelor work is a research realized on the group of 80 pupils as well as their age, family background and particularly experiences with smoking, their knowledge about the prevention of negative influence of smoking on the organism and how important role do the schools and family have in the process of the prevention.

We further show that the response to STS is not linear and that, for both mainstream tobacco smoke and STS, doses that induced significant increases in expanded simple tandem repeat mutations in sperm did not increase the frequencies of micronucleated reticulocytes and erythrocytes in the bone marrow and blood of exposed mice. These data show that passive exposure to cigarette smoke can cause tandem repeat mutations in sperm under conditions that may not induce genetic damage in somatic cells.

Vibration energy curves with low expiratory phase and plateau were present in 6. 35 % and 3. 17 %, respectively, of healthy non-smokers, 41. 07 % and 28. 60 % of smokers, and 39. 13 % and 30. 43 % of <b>passive</b> <b>smokers,</b> respectively. The massive energy peak in the non-smokers, smokers, and passive-smokers was 1. 77 ± 0. 27, 1. 57 ± 0. 29, and 1. 66 ± 0. 33, respectively (all P< 0. 001). A weak but positive correlation was observed between VRIS and smoking index. Conclusions: VRI can intuitively show the differences between non-smokers and smokers. VRI revealed that passive smok...|$|R

40|$|Background: Alectinib is an oral drug {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} patients with fusion gene encoding echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 -anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML 4 -ALK) -rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we present the case of a patient treated with alectinib who developed a hypersensitivity reaction with successful rechallenge treatment. Case Presentation: A 39 -year-old woman who was a <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> was referred to Osaka City University Hospital for the evaluation of a skin event caused by treatment for NSCLC with the fusion gene EML 4 -ALK. The skin reaction was observed on the anterior chest, upper arms, and ear auricles on day 11 of treatment with oral alectinib. The skin event presented as widely distributed erythematous macules that were confluent, indicating a severe and life-threatening form. The skin lesions started to resolve after the initiation of treatment with 40 mg prednisolone. After regrowth of the tumor, she received a rechallenge program for alectinib for 2 weeks; thereafter, alectinib treatment was successfully reinitiated. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case in which alectinib, which binds to the adenosine triphosphate site of EML 4 -ALK, induced erythema multiforme. Moreover, successful readministration of alectinib through our rechallenge program has not been reported so far...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Exposure to {{environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS) {{is one of the}} major factors of predisposing children to develop several hazardous health problems. We decided to investigate the association between nicotinine, one of the nicotine metabolites and esophagitis in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods: In a case control study 46 children suffering from esophagitis referred to endoscopy ward were recruited. The control group consisted of 45 healthy children. Urine samples were collected and urinary cotinine level (UCL) measured. Findings: The mean age of esophagitis and control groups were 5. 11 ± 2. 93 and 6. 72 ± 2. 8 respectively. Sixty children were passive smokers; 31 of them had non-smoker parents. In control group, 32 (71. 1 %) children and in esophagitis group 29 (63 %) children had non-smoker parents. The mean value of UCL in patients suffering from esophagitis was significantly higher than those in normal group (P= 0. 04, 24. 98 ± 6. 4 ng/ml vs. 15. 16 ± 3. 9 ng/ml). Considering 50 ng/ml as a cutoff point for UCL, it was significantly higher in <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> group than in non smoker group (P= 0. 02). The mean cotinine level differed significantly in esophagitis and control group. Conclusion: Our results indicate the increased risk of developing esophagitis in children with ETS exposure...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{a review}} of the {{influences}} of parental smoking and depression on physical, behavioral, and cognitive development of children. The negative rela-tionship between smoking and child development has been shown to follow a dose-response relationship and to be independent of several important con-founds. Likewise, parental characteristics, particularly depression, have also been shown to be related to both smoking and child development. Since cigarette smoking is also linked with depression, there are many unanswered questions regarding the interrelationship of these three factors. Research should use a biobehavioral model to address the issues related to parental influences on child development. Suggestions are made for such an approach to studying parental smoking and child development which addresses the overlap between depression and parental smoking and their influence on child maturation. KEY WORDS: parental smoking; depression; child development; biobehavioral models; substance abuse. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of health problems for both the active and <b>passive</b> <b>smoker</b> (Ecobichon & Wu, 1989; U. S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 1980, 1988). The effects of passive smoking have histori-cally focused on underlying physiological mechanisms.

40|$|Epidermal barrier quality, skin wrinkling, {{and skin}} dryness were {{compared}} among groups of active <b>smokers,</b> <b>passive</b> <b>smokers,</b> and non-smokers. Epidermal barrier quality was assessed via {{transepidermal water loss}} (TEWL). Skin dryness was measured by digital image analysis of corneocytes that {{had been removed from}} skin by tape strippings, and the degree of skin wrinkling was estimated by digitized image analysis of Silflow replicas of the periorbital area. Data obtained from this particular population indicated that active smokers had poorer barrier quality, more wrinkles, and drier skin than non-smokers. <b>Passive</b> <b>smokers</b> presented the same degree of skin barrier damage and skin dryness as active smokers. Sun exposure appeared to play a larger role in the enhancement of skin damage than chronological ging factors, especially in combination with chronic cigarette smoke exposure. Chronic smoke exposure appeared to contribute equally or more than sun exposure to deterioration of barrier quality and the degree of wrinkling...|$|R

40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of cigarette smoke on the occurrence and prognosis of women patients with lung cancer. Patients and methods : Patients with operable lung cancer (78 women, 164 men) were divided into three groups; active smokers who smoked themselves (18 women, 141 men), <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> whose spouses smoked (43 women, 0 men), and non-smokers whose spouses also had never smoked (17 women, 23 men). The smoking habits, proportion of cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and prognoses were compared among groups. Results : Women active smokers had smoked a mean of 11. 8 ± 2. 1 cigarettes/day for 28. 6 ± 4. 1 years (Brinkman Index, 408. 1 ± 77. 8). These data were similar to those of the spouses of women <b>passive</b> <b>smokers,</b> but significantly less than those of men active smokers. The proportion of cases of squamous cell carcinoma was 44 % in women active smokers, which was significantly higher than that in women <b>passive</b> <b>smokers</b> (16 %) and women non-smokers (6 %). Survival rates of women patients were significantly superior to those of men patients, independent of smoking habits. However, there was no significant difference in the survival rates among the women groups. Conclusion : The prognosis of women patients with lung cancer is superior to that of men patients, independent of smoking habits. Although smoking is considered a significant cause of lung cancer, it did not affect the prognoses of men or women patients with lung cancer in this study...|$|R
