SEMPLE, of Mount Vernon, {{county of}} Knox, and State of Ohio, have invented {{a new and}} {{improved}} Chewing-Gum; and I do hereby declare that {{the following is a}} full, clear, and exact description of the same. The nature of my invention consists in compounding with rubber, in any proportions, other suitable substances, so as to form not only an agreeable chewing-gum, but also, that from the scouring-properties of the same, it will subserve the purpose of a dentifrice. It is well known that rubber itself is too hard {{to be used as a}} chewing-gum, but in combination with non-adhesive earths may be rendered capable of kneading into any shape under the teeth. In the manufacture of this improved chewing-gum, no vulcanizing-process is employed. It is produced by simply dissolving the rubber in naphtha and alcohol, and when of the consistence of jelly, mixing with it <b>prepared</b> <b>chalk,</b> powdered licorice-root, or any other suitable material, in the desired proportions, and subsequently evaporating the solvents. I do not, however, confine myself to this method alone for the manufacture of the gum. For commercial purposes, other equally effectual processes maybe used for the uniting of the rubber with suitable substances. Instead of the solvents named, any other that will soften the rubber, without being offensive, may be employed, such as paraffine, spermaceti, wax, gums, resins, and the like. Any of the materials commonly used for the manufacture of dentifrices may be combined with the rubber, such as orris-root, myrrh, licorice-root, sugar, barytes, charcoal, &c. By the term [...] "rubber," [...] I wish to include the allied vegetable gums, which are ordinarily known as the equivalents of caoutchouc. Having thus fully described my invention, What I claim as new, and, desire to secure by Letters Patent, is— The combination of rubber with other articles, in any proportions adapted to the formation of an acceptable chewing-gum.W. F. SEMPLE. [...] Witnesses: C. MAGERS, T. V. PARKE.” ...|$|E
30|$|References were <b>prepared</b> with <b>chalk</b> (CaCO 3), from Roig Farma, gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O), from Panreac, collagen, from “Jerónimos” gelatin, KBr and {{distilled}} water. Firstly, chalk and gypsum were ground {{together in}} a mortar with different ratios, from 90 : 10 to 10 : 90. Following that, the different combinations were prepared as collagen paint and as a pellet. The ground paints references were made by admixing the mixtures of compounds (0.1  g) with collagen binder (0.05  ml), and applied over glass slides. The microsamples were compressed in a diamond cell for infrared analysis. The binder was prepared in a first stage, leaving the gelatine leaf in water for 2  h, and then was subjected to 90  °C with stirring. Concerning the pellets, the mixtures of compounds (0.1  g) were ground with KBr powder (0.1  g), and pressed under high pressure (10 tons, during 10  min). For both methods and different components proportion, three replicates were prepared and analysed.|$|R
50|$|Chalk may be {{used for}} its {{properties}} as a base. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive. Polishing <b>chalk</b> is <b>chalk</b> <b>prepared</b> with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine polishing of metals. Chalk can also be used as fingerprint powder.|$|R

(2008) “Smart Water” for Oil Recovery from Fractured Limestone: A Preliminary Study. Energy & Fuels, 22 (5), 3126 - 3133 [URL] production is generally divided into three stages, primary recovery, secondary recovery and tertiary recovery. In primary recovery, which is usually (but not necessarily) the first production stage, the natural energy of the reservoir is used to displace the oil from the reservoir. The drive mechanisms are pressure depletion of the reservoir pressure, in the form of solution-gas drive, gas cap drive, natural water drive, or fluid and rock expansion, or gravity drainage. In this stage, only 10 - 30 % of the OOIP (oil originally in place) is produced (Castor et al., 1981). Secondary recovery is usually initiated when primary production is declining, adding additional energy to the reservoir in order to maintain pressure or provide a more efficient oil displacement. Gas injection and waterflooding are two secondary methods, the latter being the most common. The recovery factor after the secondary stage is usually 30 - 50 % of OOIP (Castor et al., 1981). The tertiary recovery stage, comprising miscible gas injection, chemical injection and thermal energy methods, typically takes over when secondary recovery becomes uneconomical. However, oil production does not always follow this chronological order. Therefore, the term ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery’ (EOR) is nowadays more widely used than ‘tertiary recovery’. Another term, IOR (Improved oil recovery) is also often seen, and in addition to EOR this term includes reservoir characterization, reservoir management and infill drilling (Green and Willhite, 1998). The EOR methods most commonly target the oil left in the waterflooded reservoir, which especially in carbonate reservoirs can be a substantial amount. There are five categories of EOR processes (Green and Willhite, 1998) : mobility-control (polymers, foams), chemical (surfactants, alkaline agents), miscible (hydrocarbon solvents, CO 2), thermal (steam, in-situ combustion) and other processes, such as microbial EOR, immiscible CO 2 etc. Seawater injection should perhaps be categorized under other processes, as it is a superb EOR fluid to chalk. This will be discussed later in chapter 3 [...] ...|$|R
