5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this <b>point</b> <b>it</b> had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some <b>point</b> <b>it</b> was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
5|$|At one <b>point</b> <b>it</b> was {{considered}} {{that the two}} former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E

At this <b>point</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that in Angela's version of Silent Hill the town is always on fire.|$|E

5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them.

5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road. It then {{traverses}} mostly rural, undeveloped land, {{before reaching the}} Bexar–Medina county line, where it becomes Potranco Road. In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, patchy, residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which <b>point</b> <b>it</b> enters the San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes wide, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E

In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that <b>point.</b> <b>It</b> was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film to look like a comic book.|$|E
