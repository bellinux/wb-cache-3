40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> It clarifies the differences between numbering <b>plans</b> and <b>dialling</b> <b>plans,</b> and shows that the closure of a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of numbering capacity within a numbering <b>plan.</b> Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to close its <b>dialling</b> <b>plan,</b> but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries location portability is considered as a voluntary service aspect, closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> {{establishes}} the permitted sequences of digits dialed on subscriber or station lines with subscriber premises equipment, such as telephones and {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) systems. [...] <b>Dialing</b> <b>plans</b> in the public switch telephone network (PSTN) have traditionally been more {{commonly referred to as}} dialing procedures. The <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> of a <b>private</b> telephone system or a customer premise equipment, such as an analog telephone adapter (ATA) or an IP phone, is sometimes also called <b>dial</b> <b>plan.</b> The digit sequences (numbers) permissible in a <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> may be as short as a single digit, e.g. for reaching an operator, or as long as a complete international telephone number, including trunk prefixes and international prefixes.|$|R
5000|$|PBX equipment, carrier {{switching}} systems, or end-user telephones may {{specify a}} variable-length <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> or a fixed-length <b>dial</b> plan.In <b>private</b> branch exchanges in the U.S. a <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> may specify the addresses {{for the following}} destinations: ...|$|R
50|$|Gatekeepers {{have the}} ability to {{neighbor}} together so that call resolution can happen between zones. Neighboring facilitates the use of <b>dial</b> <b>plans</b> such as the Global <b>Dialing</b> Scheme. <b>Dial</b> <b>plans</b> facilitate “inter-zone” <b>dialing</b> so that two endpoints in separate zones can still communicate with each other.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dialing</b> <b>plans</b> {{vary from}} place to place {{depending}} on whether an area has overlays (multiple area codes serving the same area) and whether the state requires toll alerting (a leading 1+ for toll calls). The NANPA web site includes <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> information in their information on individual area codes.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> {{examples}} {{using the}} above syntax look as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Colombia has various {{telephone}} <b>dial</b> <b>plans,</b> {{depending on}} the type of service.|$|R
50|$|Analog {{telephone}} adapters, IP phones, {{and many}} other VoIP media gateways have configuration options that establish the digit sequences that can be dialed with the equipment. The <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> of these devices is established by a digit map.The following syntax {{may be used for}} such <b>dial</b> <b>plan,</b> as adapted from RFC 2705, the specification for the Media Gateway Control Protocol.|$|R
50|$|Voice over IP {{adapters}} can be networked and configured {{to provide}} automatic ringdown by selecting a <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> which replaces the empty string with a predefined number or SIP address, dialed immediately. (Some Cisco VoIP phones and analog adapters treat a <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> of (S0 <:1234567890>) as a hotline configuration which dials 1-234-567890 zero {{seconds after the}} telephone is taken off-hook, for instance).|$|R

50|$|A {{variable}} <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> {{has different}} <b>dialing</b> procedures for local and long distance telephone calls. A call {{within the same}} city or within an area is dialed only by the subscriber number, while for calls outside the area, the number must be prefixed with the destination area code. For fixed <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> it is always required to dial all digits of the complete telephone number, including any area codes, if implemented.|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} the Philippines follow an open {{telephone}} numbering plan and an open <b>dial</b> <b>plan.</b> Both plans are regulated by the National Telecommunications Commission, an attached agency under the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} already switched, but {{trunk prefix}} re-added with the closed <b>dialing</b> <b>plan,</b> {{for example in}} Bangkok, Thailand before 1997: ...|$|R
50|$|Russia uses a four-level (local, zone, country, international) open <b>dialing</b> <b>plan.</b> Local {{telecommunications}} regulators {{had planned}} to abandon this system and change to a closed <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> at all levels by 2009, but postponed the changeover until 2010, and later pushed once more until 2012. Currently, all national subscriber numbers consist of 10 digits (excluding any prefixes), with 3 digits for an area code and a 7-digit individual number which includes a zone code.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> for mobile {{networks}} (numbers {{starting with}} 07) and new landline operators (numbers starting with 03) is closed; all subscriber numbers must be dialled in full. For landline numbers starting with 02, the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> {{used to be}} open; the trunk digit and area code could be omitted if the caller {{was in the same}} area code as the callee. However, starting May 3, 2008, all landline numbers must be dialled in full.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of the North American Numbering Plan permits implementation of local <b>dial</b> <b>plans</b> in each plan area, depending on requirements. When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes. Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, {{it may be necessary}} to prefix a telephone numbers with 1. The NANPA publishes <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> information for individual area codes.|$|R

50|$|The 289 NPA overlay was {{approved}} by the CRTC on August 15, 2000 (Order CRTC 2000-772). Earlier that month, Toufic Saliba, consultant and technical engineer at the Commission, directed the addition of area code 289 in the 905 area code region. In doing so, Saliba directed that all carriers put in place a 10-digit <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> for all local calls. In this order, the Commission directed Bell Canada to implement the 10-digit local <b>dialing</b> <b>plan.</b> 289 came into service on April 7, 2001, and was in full operation by June 9, 2001.|$|R
50|$|Some countries, such as Uruguay, have merged variable-length area {{codes and}} {{telephone}} numbers into fixed-length numbers that {{must always be}} dialed independently of location. In such closed <b>dialing</b> <b>plans,</b> also having a closed numbering plan, the area code is formally not distinguished in the telephone number. In the UK, area codes were first known as subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes. Depending on local <b>dialing</b> <b>plans,</b> they are often necessary only when dialed from outside the code area or from mobile phones. In North America ten-digit dialing is required in areas with overlay plans.|$|R

50|$|The Ethiopian <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> {{changed on}} 17 September 2005. City codes (i.e., {{internal}} prefixes) changed from two digits to three (or, from outside Ethiopia, one digit to two). Phone numbers changed from six digits to seven.|$|R
50|$|The {{associated}} <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> {{requires that}} all numbers, even for local calls, must be dialed with the assigned NDC, {{in contrast to}} previous <b>plans.</b> When <b>dialing</b> from within the country, a prefix 0 must be dialed.|$|R
50|$|The {{protocol}} {{was invented by}} Mark Spencer who also made the PBX-system called Asterisk. Therefore, the syntax of the output of a DUNDi-lookup can be directly used in the dial commands in an Asterisk <b>Dial</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thailand {{switched}} to a closed <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> in 2001, which means that calling within the area code requires the area code to be dialed. E.g., When calling a number 2134567 in Bangkok (02) from a fixed-line phone: ...|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} Bulgaria are under an open <b>dialing</b> <b>plan,</b> {{similar to those}} of Germany and Austria. Area codes should only be dialed when necessary. Area codes are prefixed with a trunk code of 0 when dialled domestically.|$|R
5000|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} Israel consist {{of an area}} code and a {{subscriber}} number. The <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> type in Israel is closed, and [...] "0" [...] is the internal Trunk prefix in Israel. Israel's country calling code is +972.|$|R
50|$|A linked {{numbering}} scheme (LNS) is a telephone numbering plan in effect in a service area within which call routing between subscriber lines on adjacent exchanges {{does not require}} a dialing code. It is a form of open <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting January 1, 2012, fixed lines will {{be allowed}} to dial {{directly}} to other provinces/countries, but still using open <b>dialing</b> <b>plan.</b> To <b>dial</b> to other province, dial area code+phone number (0xx-xxxxxx), and to dial to other countries, dial 00+country code+phone number.|$|R
50|$|The {{service is}} based on a <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> (written either in Asterisk-like syntax or in Ruby). This <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> allows routing of inbound and {{outbound}} calls depending on the parameters you want : call prefix, time of the day, availability … You can fork an incoming call to various end points, you can forward the call to a second or third end point if the first ones are not responding, you can block calls, you can create a speed dial directory (for instance if you press *1 or *2 …, it automatically dials, the number you specified …). On top of these call management features you have various debugging tools that allow playing with and testing the service.|$|R
