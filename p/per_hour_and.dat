5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> per week began to rise.|$|E

5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> per week rose.|$|E
5|$|In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, {{where the}} firm of Broadwood {{provided}} him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements {{of some of his}} mazurkas to Spanish texts. On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, at 20years of age, Richard {{was promoted}} to the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67hits in 109 total innings pitched. Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished {{the season with a}} 2.39ERA and even threw a no-hitter against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate fastball which occasionally exceeded 100miles <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> his slider 93miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers. During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to Class-AAA baseball, one step below the major leagues, with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the now-defunct American Association. Richard wore number50 and kept that number {{for the rest of his}} minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight complete games and led the league with 202strikeouts in 173innings of work. He ended the season with twelvewins and sevenlosses before being called up by the Houston Astros.|$|E
5|$|With a {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted {{for several days}} prior {{to the arrival of}} the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures {{to the north of the}} hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Hurricane Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
