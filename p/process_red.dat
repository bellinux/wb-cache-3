Through this <b>process</b> <b>red</b> blood cells are {{continuously}} produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney.

25|$|The wet {{beans are}} then transported to a {{facility}} {{so they can}} be fermented and dried. They are fermented for four to seven days and must be mixed every two days. They are dried for five to 14 days, depending on the climate conditions. The fermented beans are dried by spreading them out over a large surface and constantly raking them. In large plantations, this is done on huge trays under the sun or by using artificial heat. Small plantations may dry their harvest on little trays or on cowhides. Finally, the beans are trodden and shuffled about (often using bare human feet) and sometimes, during this <b>process,</b> <b>red</b> clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Drying in the sun is preferable to drying by artificial means, as no extraneous flavors such as smoke or oil are introduced which might otherwise taint the flavor.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>processed</b> <b>red</b> meat consumption {{is a risk}} factor for CVD and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). This analysis investigates the association between dietary patterns, their <b>processed</b> <b>red</b> meat contributions, and association with blood biomarkers of CVD and T 2 D, in 786 Irish adults (18 – 90 years) using cross-sectional data from a 2011 national food consumption survey. All meat-containing foods consumed were assigned to four food groups (n 502) on the basis of whether they contained red or white meat and whether they were processed or unprocessed. The remaining foods (n 2050) were assigned to twenty-nine food groups. Two-step and k-means cluster analyses were applied to derive dietary patterns. Nutrient intakes, plasma fatty acids and biomarkers of CVD and T 2 D were assessed. A total of four dietary patterns were derived. In comparison with the pattern with lower contributions from <b>processed</b> <b>red</b> meat, the dietary pattern with greater <b>processed</b> <b>red</b> meat intakes presented a poorer Alternate Healthy Eating Index (21 · 2 (sd 7 · 7)), a greater proportion of smokers (29 %) and lower plasma EPA (1 · 34 (sd 0 · 72) %) and DHA (2 · 21 (sd 0 · 84) %) levels (P< 0 · 001). There were no differences in classical biomarkers of CVD and T 2 D, including serum cholesterol and insulin, across dietary patterns. This {{suggests that}} the consideration of <b>processed</b> <b>red</b> meat consumption as {{a risk factor for}} CVD and T 2 D may need to be re-assessed...|$|R

Red Feather is currently developing two new workshops on the health linkages to the burning of wood and coal stoves in reservation homes and the impact of mold and mildew in reservation homes. Red Feather is a partner with APS (Arizona Public Service) to present weatherization workshops and interventions to improve energy-efficient homes. Red Feather partners with tribal resources such as the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Housing Authority to build self-sustaining communities for safe and healthy housing through tenant seminars. NATIVE HOMES REPAIR NETWORK: Red Feather partners with Native American homeowners to identify housing repair needs and access to resources to solve their home issues. Using a case management <b>process,</b> <b>Red</b> Feather is currently piloting assistance through home repair and health assessment professionals to assess reservation homes for health risks and necessary repairs. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIAL PROJECTS: Red Feather engages in projects on the 3 reservations that require special intervention. In 2015, a $70,000 home renovation project was initiated for Navajo Code Talker Dan Akee, a WWII veteran and one of 12 living Navajo Code Talkers. Red Feather engages volunteers {{from all walks of life}} to contribute to housing projects on Native American reservations.|$|E
50|$|Theta One One {{is still}} {{experiencing}} {{the sense of}} loss when at the next stop it meets an infantry Tek who seeks to confess its sins.

At the next stop, the same fabricator that Theta One One first talked to that night comes aboard, and reveals it was the Red Tek others spoke of, and is leading this plan. It planned to use the infantry Teks to kill management and have Teks take over which could run the city more efficiently; this would help the humans working low-level jobs to be able to pursue more constructive options while Teks replace their roles. Otherwise, without this change, the system will continue on the status quo, with management using Teks to replace humans, and hurting many humans in the <b>process.</b> <b>Red</b> Tek needed Theta One One to investigate as it did as to scout the current situation in the city from the Tek's perspective, providing its high-level intelligence to analyze the situation. At this point, Red Tek offers Theta One One a weapon and tells it that a choice to kill Red Tek or itself must be made; by killing Red Tek, Theta One One will be able to report to management about the infantry Teks and give them time to stop it, as to let the status quo remain; by killing itself, Theta One One would allow the Tek overthrow proceed.

And the same analyses were conducted in the <b>process</b> of <b>red</b> ginseng. Results: 1. For content comparison of ginsenoside Rb 1, Rc, Rd, Rf, Rg 1 and Rh 1, wild ginseng showed high content, followed cultivated ginseng 4 and 6 years, cultivated wild ginseng showed low content than any other samples. 2. For content comparison of ginsenoside Rb 2 and Re, cultivated ginseng 4 years showed high content, followed wild ginseng and cultivated ginseng 6 years, cultivated wild ginseng showed low content than any other samples. 3. For content comparison of ginsenoside Rg 3, wild ginseng and cultivated wild ginseng were only showed low content. 4. For content comparison of ginsenoside Rh 2, cultivated wild ginseng was only showed low content. 5. In the <b>process</b> of <b>red</b> ginseng, ginsenoside Rb 1, Rb 2, Rc, Rd, Rg 3 and Rh 1 were increased, and ginsenoside Re and Rg 1 were decreased in cultivated wild ginseng. 6.
