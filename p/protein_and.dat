5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms.

5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection.

40|$|Marine fish {{provide a}} rich source of {{bioactive}} compounds such as <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> peptides. The bioactive <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> peptides derived from marine fish have gained enormous interest in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical industries due to their broad spectrum of bioactivities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-aging activities. Recently, the development of cosmeceuticals using marine fish-derived <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> peptides obtained from chemical or enzymatical hydrolysis of fish processing by-products has increased rapidly owing to their activities in antioxidation and tissue regeneration. Marine fish-derived collagen has been utilized for the development of cosmeceutical products due to its abilities in skin repair and tissue regeneration. Marine fish-derived peptides have also been utilized for various cosmeceutical applications due to their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activities. In addition, marine fish-derived <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> hydrolysates demonstrated efficient anti-photoaging activity. The present review highlights and presents an overview of the current status of the isolation and applications of marine fish-derived <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> peptides.

5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins.

40|$|Argyrophilic {{proteins}} {{associated with}} nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR <b>proteins)</b> <b>and</b> Ki- 67 antigen were investigated {{in patients with}} lung adenocarcinoma. Tumors with low and high content of Ag-NOR <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> proliferation index (PI) Ki- 67 were determined. The relationship between the Ag-NOR content and T and N parameters, tumor size of 3 cm or more and stage of the disease was found. High survival rates in patients with lung adenocarcinoma {{were associated with the}} low content of Ag-NOR <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> PI Ki- 67 and low survival rates were related to the high content of Ag-NOR <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> PI Ki- 67. The intermediate survival rates were related to the opposite values of the content of Ag-NOR <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> PI Ki- 67. The tumor size, N parameter and the content of Ag-NOR proteins had an independent effect on survival of patients. Survival was related {{to the size of the}} tumor in lung cancer patients having no lymph node involvement and it was related to the content of Ag-NOR proteins in cases with the presence of metastases. Mutual study of Ag-NOR <b>proteins</b> <b>and</b> antigen Ki- 67 has differential diagnostic and prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma...|$|R
