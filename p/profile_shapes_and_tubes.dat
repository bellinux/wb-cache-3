40|$|Tracer {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for estimation of soil water and groundwater recharge flux especially in arid and semiarid regions. These tracer methods {{are based on the}} solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> (distribution of concentration with depth) and peak position. For soils of semi-arid to sub-humid climates, vertical water movement may seasonally vary in direction due to climate conditions and vegetative demands. The first objective of this thesis was to show that TDR (time domain reflectometry) can be a useful tool for estimation of soil water fluxes using tracer methods. The second objective was to study the effects of repeated cycles of directionally-varying flow upon solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position used by tracer methods under controlled laboratory conditions. Three soil columns with a KCl tracer and Beaver Creek sand were used for this study. Rain and evaporative systems were used to cause the downward and upward soil water movements in the column, respectively. Soil moisture content and solute concentration were measured using TDR. The result for the first objective was that the peak migration and the soil water balance methods gave similar average upward and downward soil water fluxes. This result indicates that the TDR method can be recommended for determination of soil water fluxes with tracer methods in fields or in laboratory studies for sufficient time and depth. In the second objective, three different seasonal flow regimes were studied using the sand columns, and each flow regime simulated climatic seasons that might occur in the field. Several apparent and statistical parameters were used to evaluate the change of the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position under cycling conditions of the three different flow regimes. These parameters showed that the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position clearly changed under the three different repeated regimes of downward and upward seasonal flows. It was concluded that climate (seasonality) can have significant impacts on the estimation of soil water fluxes using tracer methods. The result from this investigation shows that the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position after a number of cycles (years of fluctuations) can provide a description of the previous climatic effects on the concentration profile. Therefore, the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> can be used as an indicator of the flow regime that has affected the solute <b>profile</b> <b>shape.</b> Moreover, if a reference of a solute profile is available (a solute profile before a period of time), it is easier to determine the flow regime affected the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position by determining the change of the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> position using statistical parameters presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to conventional mechanisms, compliant mechanisms exploit structural flexibility to produce controllable large deformations. Belt-rib airfoils are shape-adaptable lightweight structures {{based on this}} idea. A belt-rib structure originally consists of a deformable closed shell (belt) whose kinematic degrees of freedom are constrained by inner stiffeners called spokes. Using standard spoke elements, the possible profile changes of the airfoil are limited. The purpose of the work reported in the current article is to define an inner stiffening struc-ture based on numerical topology optimization in order to realize arbitrary profile changes. A ground structure with moveable connection points within the external belt represents the set of possible topologies <b>and</b> <b>shapes.</b> A new modal objective function for the synthesis of compliant mechanisms with selective compliance is introduced. The optimization problem is approached by using genetic algorithms. The applicability of the current procedure is validated by a <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> adaptation example. For this purpose, an initial <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> a target <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> are defined. The outcome of the procedure is a complex inner stiffening structure, which fulfils the imposed requirements. The solution is validated by modal analysis based on an finite-element model. Furthermore, the structural behaviour is experimentally investigated...|$|R
