5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in <b>Physics.</b> Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in <b>Physics</b> is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in <b>Physics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ehlers {{directly}} addressed <b>physics</b> teachers, {{in talks}} and journal {{articles on the}} teaching of relativity and related basic ideas, such as mathematics as the language of <b>physics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Smyth {{returned}} full-time to {{his duties}} at Princeton. He continued to chair the <b>Physics</b> Department {{and was named}} the Joseph Henry Professor of <b>Physics</b> in 1946. During this time he spoke and wrote regularly about nuclear energy and science policy and worked to expand the <b>physics</b> department.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and {{returned}} to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic <b>physics</b> led to {{an interest in the}} health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in health <b>physics.</b> At the Health <b>Physics</b> Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health <b>physics,</b> teaching and advising graduate fellows in health <b>physics</b> from 1949.|$|E
5|$|Franck {{became the}} Head of the <b>Physics</b> Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became {{professor}} ordinarius of experimental <b>physics</b> and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental <b>Physics</b> at the University of Göttingen. While there {{he worked on}} quantum <b>physics</b> with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical <b>Physics.</b> His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in <b>physics,</b> notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world <b>physics</b> that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle <b>physics.</b> Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical <b>physics</b> in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle <b>physics</b> based on string and M-theory.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{returned}} from the conflict as a junior and in 1948 he changed his major to <b>physics,</b> as the School of <b>Physics</b> started its degree program that year. He received a Bachelor of Science in <b>Physics</b> in 1948, and a Master of Science in <b>Physics</b> (also from Georgia Tech) in 1950. Robinson was {{also a member of}} Georgia Tech's prestigious secret society, ANAK. Robinson had been a ham radio operator enthusiast since the age of 14, and started a radio repair service to provide additional income while he was a student at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Segrè {{was also}} active as a {{photographer}} and took many photos documenting events {{and people in the}} history of modern science, which were donated to the American Institute of <b>Physics</b> after his death.

5|$|Smyth endowed a {{chair in}} the <b>Physics</b> Department in his will. The sitting Henry DeWolf Smyth Professor of <b>Physics</b> is Suzanne Staggs.|$|E
5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in <b>physics</b> and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not see}} space science as an option for a career path in <b>physics,</b> choosing instead to pursue high-energy <b>physics.</b> In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in <b>physics</b> in 1954.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Goeppert Mayer {{became a}} {{voluntary}} {{associate professor of}} <b>Physics</b> at the University of Chicago (where Teller and her husband worked) and a senior physicist at the nearby Argonne National Laboratory. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in <b>Physics</b> in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of <b>physics</b> at the University of California, San Diego.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no family}} matches the Curie family's record, {{there have been}} several with two laureates. The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe). J. J. Thomson was awarded the <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1906 for showing that {{electrons}} are particles. His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves. William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer. Niels Bohr was awarded the <b>Physics</b> prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975. Manne Siegbahn, who received the <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received the <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1981. Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of Ulf von Euler, who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970. C. V. Raman was awarded the <b>Physics</b> Prize in 1930 and was the uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who was awarded the same prize in 1983. Arthur Kornberg received the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1959; Kornberg's son, Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006. Jan Tinbergen, who was awarded the first Economics Prize in 1969, was the brother of Nikolaas Tinbergen, who received the 1973 Physiology or Medicine Prize. Alva Myrdal, Peace Prize laureate in 1982, was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal who was awarded the Economics Prize in 1974. Economics laureates Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow were brothers-in-law. Frits Zernike, who was awarded the 1953 <b>Physics</b> Prize, is the great-uncle of 1999 <b>Physics</b> laureate Gerard 't Hooft.|$|E
5|$|Atoms {{are small}} enough that {{attempting}} to predict their behavior using classical <b>physics</b> – {{as if they}} were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of <b>physics,</b> atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.|$|E
5|$|Awarded Comstock Prize in <b>Physics,</b> National Academy of Sciences, 1943.|$|E
5|$|Awarded Robert R. Wilson Prize for {{accelerator}} <b>physics,</b> 1988.|$|E
5|$|Burhop won a scholarship, {{and entered}} the University of Melbourne in 1928. He {{initially}} studied civil engineering, but switched to science after two years, and majored in <b>physics.</b> In 1929, he was awarded a bursary that provided financial assistance. He graduated in 1931 with a bachelor of science BSc degree with first class honours in <b>physics.</b> He then earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA), also with first class honours, in mathematics in 1932, and a master of science in <b>physics</b> in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of <b>physics,</b> Ehlers researched the history of <b>physics.</b> Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of <b>physics</b> and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in <b>physics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Condensed matter <b>physics</b> is {{a branch}} of <b>physics</b> that deals with the {{physical}} properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Donald William Kerst (November 1, 1911 – August 19, 1993) was an American {{physicist}} {{who worked}} on advanced particle accelerator concepts (accelerator <b>physics)</b> and plasma <b>physics.</b> He is most notable for his development of the betatron, a novel type of particle accelerator used to accelerate electrons.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the {{director}} of the <b>physics</b> laboratory, Luigi Puccianti, who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum <b>physics</b> reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a mathematical technique invented by Gregorio Ricci and Tullio Levi-Civita that was needed to demonstrate the principles of general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to <b>physics.</b> He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic <b>physics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Educated at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge, he was {{a faculty}} member in Princeton's Department of <b>Physics</b> from 1924 to 1966. He chaired the {{department}} from 1935 to 1949. His early research was on the ionization of gases, but his interests shifted toward nuclear <b>physics</b> beginning in the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a fellow}} of the American Physical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and {{was a member of the}} National Academy of Science, the American Institute of <b>Physics,</b> the American Association of <b>Physics</b> Teachers and the Optical Society of America.|$|E
5|$|If general {{relativity}} {{were considered to}} be one of the two pillars of modern <b>physics,</b> then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state <b>physics,</b> would be the other. However, how to reconcile quantum theory with {{general relativity}} is still an open question.|$|E
5|$|Ijaz and {{his wife}} arrived in Tallahassee, Florida in August 1960, where they settled as {{incoming}} graduate students at Florida State University. He developed an early interest in particle <b>physics</b> and accelerator experiments while at Florida State, from where he graduated in June 1962 with a master's degree in <b>Physics.</b> His thesis was titled Study of Angular Distributions of Elastically Scattered 8 to 19 Mev Alpha Particles from Al27 and from Ohio University in May 1964 with a Ph.D. in Nuclear <b>Physics</b> with a thesis titled Proton-Proton Collisions at 2.0 BeV.|$|E
5|$|Ijaz {{attained}} {{the rank}} of Full Professor of <b>Physics</b> in 1977, and during the same year served as acting head of the <b>Physics</b> department. After several foreign sabbaticals in the 1980s, the first at U.P.M. in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia from 1979 until 1981 and another at I.C.T.P. in 1985, he continued his teaching duties at Virginia Tech until retirement in December 1991 as Professor Emeritus of <b>Physics.</b> During {{the latter part of}} his career, Ijaz published papers that focused on methods and results in teaching, religion and science and other aspects of <b>physics</b> that did not form part of his technical research in earlier years. Also a physicist and teaching researcher at Virginia Tech, Lubna Razia Ijaz established a scholarship in 1996 that is awarded to students involved in <b>physics</b> education.|$|E
5|$|Ijaz {{received}} his bachelor's degree in <b>physics</b> from the University of Virginia in 1983 and a master's degree {{in mechanical engineering}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985, where he was trained as a neural sciences engineer in the Harvard-MIT Medical Engineering Medical <b>Physics</b> Program (M.E.M.P.).|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its {{chair of}} {{theoretical}} <b>physics,</b> which {{had recently been}} vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, {{but not so much}} for <b>physics.</b> This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental <b>physics</b> there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental <b>Physics</b> and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental <b>Physics,</b> a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Anderson {{moved to}} Oak Ridge, Tennessee {{to become the}} first chief of {{education}} and training in the Health <b>Physics</b> Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Anderson also worked with faculty members at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to create a master's degree program in health <b>physics</b> at that institution.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ijaz {{launched}} a Distinguished Visitors Colloquium Series under the <b>Physics</b> department's sponsorship that brought world-renowned physicists to the Blacksburg campus {{for nearly a}} decade. Visiting scholars included Salam, Sheldon Glashow, and Nobel <b>physics</b> laureates Hans Bethe, Robert Hofstadter, Eugene Wigner and Richard Feynman. Noted Chinese physicist Luke W. Mo (whose group at the Stanford Linear Accelerator had won the Nobel Prize in <b>Physics</b> in 1990) also lectured at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in <b>physics,</b> most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream <b>physics,</b> in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of <b>physics</b> with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
