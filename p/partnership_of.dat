5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to bowl first. Somerset scored 269 runs off their full {{allocation}} of 60 overs, during which West Indian batsman Viv Richards top-scored for the county, totalling 117 runs.

5|$|Australia {{once more}} batted {{first in the}} third Test, scoring 489. For {{tactical}} reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe. Wet weather altered {{the course of the}} match and, despite an opening <b>partnership</b> <b>of</b> 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Australia won by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century <b>partnership</b> <b>of</b> the series in the fourth Test as England won by an innings, but Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and in a heavy defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, he scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66, and made two half-centuries in addition to his three hundreds. Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world. Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and Wisden judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series. In all games, Hobbs scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the {{presence}} of local public goods differences in tastes are an important determinant {{of the way in}} which partnerships are formed. Heterogeneity in tastes for private vs. public goods produces a tendency to positive assortment and <b>partnerships</b> <b>of</b> couples with similar tastes; heterogeneity in tastes for different public goods brings about <b>partnerships</b> <b>of</b> couples with similar tastes only if there is a significant overlap in the distribution of tastes of the two groups to be matched. We show that with two public goods we may get negative assortment, pure positive assortment being only one of many possibilities...|$|R

5|$|During the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre {{travelled}} to England with a West Indian team. Invited to tour England by Lord Hawke {{following the}} success of English tours to the Caribbean, the team was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not first-class. The team improved steadily throughout, {{and by the end}} of the tour were judged to be playing well. Although predominantly made up from white players, the team contained several black cricketers; at the time, the dominant teams in the West Indies were exclusively white. Ollivierre was the most consistent and successful batsman in the team, scoring 883 runs at a batting average of 32. His highest score, and only century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and shared an opening <b>partnership</b> <b>of</b> 238 with Pelham Warner. He also shared an opening <b>partnership</b> <b>of</b> 208 with Percy Cox against Surrey.
