50|$|Although immune {{interventions}} {{have been}} successful in preventing T1D in animal models, the same has not so far proved true for humans. The disparity suggests that the mechanisms may be different, and questions whether the autoimmunity paradigm, in the way it is currently configured, is appropriate for T1D in man. The accelerator hypothesis offers an alternative account, which is needed to explain the rise in childhood diabetes over the past 40 years, and the inability so far of immune-based interventions to prevent it. It views T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as disorders of beta cell stress, set against different genetic backgrounds. Stress shortens the life of beta cells, and the accelerator hypothesis is built, not on difference in type of diabetes, but on variation in tempo of beta cell loss. The rise in insulin demand associated with contemporary living is considered to be the <b>primary</b> <b>accelerator,</b> and the immune response to it a secondary accelerator that can propel a critical loss into childhood. Where the conventional explanation for T1D has invoked an immune attack on the insulin-producing beta cells by a faulty immune system, the accelerator hypothesis sees ‘autoimmunity’ as a normal, albeit inflammatory, response to beta cell stress confined to the small minority of the population with reactive immune response or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. If insulin demand is the primary driver, and ‘autoimmunity’ the response, logic suggests that interventions to prevent childhood diabetes should aim at reduction of insulin demand rather than suppression of the immune system.|$|E

40|$|The rubber {{formulation}} plays {{a significant}} role in the properties of NR compounds filled with silica. In this work, the influences of various silicas, silane coupling agents and diphenylguanidine (DPG) on the properties of compounds and vulcanizates, i. e. cure characteristics, Mooney viscosity, flocculation kinetics, bound rubber content, Payne effect, tan δ at 60 °C, tensile and tear properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that compound viscosity and curing behavior, as well as vulcanizate properties of the silica-filled NR are much improved by incorporating silane coupling agents. Bis-triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulfide (TESPT) clearly gives better overall properties than the disulfide-based silane (TESPD), except for scorch safety. DPG acts as a synergist to sulfenamide <b>primary</b> <b>accelerators,</b> as well as activator for the silanization reaction. Highly dispersible (HD) silicas can significantly enhance the degree of dispersion, and so lead to higher filler-rubber interaction. As a consequence, the HD silicas provide better dynamic and mechanical properties for filled NR vulcanizates compared to conventional (CV) counterparts. The optimal quantities of both, silane coupling agent and DPG, required in the formulation are correlated to the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) specific surface area of the silicas. Furthermore, the results reveal that the silica structure as characterized by the dibutylphthalate (DBP) adsorption also strongly influences the reinforcing efficienc...|$|R

The Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) is the highest priority of the nuclear physics community in the United States for a major new facility. RIA is a next generation facility for basic research with radioactive beams that utilizes both standard Isotope-separator On-line (ISOL) and in-flight fragmentation methods with novel approaches to handle high primary-beam power and remove existing limitations in the extraction of short-lived isotopes. A versatile <b>primary</b> <b>accelerator,</b> a 1. 4 -GV, CW superconducting linac designed to simultaneously accelerate several heavy-ion charge states, will provide beams from protons at 900 MeV to uranium at 400 MeV/u at power levels of 400 kW. The wide variety of primary beams allows various production and extraction schemes {{to be used to}} optimize production of specific isotopes. These isotopes, at unprecedented intensities, are available for research at a broad range of energies. They can be delivered at ion source energy for stopped-beam studies, reaccelerated by a second superconducting linac, or directly separated in-flight for use at energies up to 500 MeV/u. The post accelerator uses a unique injection scheme, based on CW low-frequency RFQs, for efficient acceleration of singly charged heavy ions with masses up to 240 amu from ion source energy. • First rate experimental equipment and multiple user capability to maximize use of the facility.

40|$|When {{a massive}} star explodes as a supernova, it injects {{a huge amount}} of energy into its surroundings. The {{resultant}} expanding blast-wave and its interaction with the surrounding medium is known as a supernova remnant (SNR). The shock created by the supernova event {{is believed to be the}} <b>primary</b> <b>accelerator</b> of cosmic rays (CRs) in our Galaxy. While SNRs are observable across the electromagnetic spectrum, studying the gamma-ray emission from these sources is crucial in understanding the origin of CRs and acceleration processes acting therein. Recent advances in gamma-ray astronomy present new opportunities to study the aftermath of stellar explosions at gamma-ray energies. In 2008 the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope was launched into orbit and, with its unmatched gamma-ray resolution, has opened up a new window on the high-energy sky. In this thesis, I present new work using data from the primary instrument on the Fermi observatory, the Large Area Telescope (LAT), to study both individual SNRs as well as the population of remnants observable by the LAT, with a focus on searching for spatially extended emission from these remnants. To uniformly determine the high-energy properties of SNRs, I developed an automated method to systematically characterize the gamma-ray emission in a region of the sky. Applying this method to the locations of several hundred radio-observed SNRs, we classified 30 gamma-ray sources as likely being associated with SNRs. Our results, combined with archival radio, X-ray, and TeV observations, serve to challenge previously sufficient, simple gamma-ray SNR emission models. I also present a study of the sources detected above 50 GeV, focusing on those lying in the Galactic plane. 31 sources were shown to be significantly spatially extended with 5 of those being newly detected. Finally, I present a dedicated analysis of one of the 5 newly detected extended sources. I determined that the extended GeV emission likely originated from the shock of SNR G 150. 3 + 4. 5.

40|$|Background The {{present report}} {{provides}} preliminary outcomes with intraoperative radiotherapy delivered to women {{with breast cancer}} included in a re-irradiation program. Materials and methods From October 2010 to April 2014, thirty women were included in a re-irradiation protocol by exploiting IORT technique. The median time between the two irradiations was 10 years (range 3 – 50). All patients underwent conservative surgery, sentinel lymph node excision and IORT with electron beam delivered by a mobile linear <b>accelerator.</b> <b>Primary</b> endpoint was esthetic result and consequential/late toxicity; secondary endpoints were local control (LC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results With a median follow up of 47 months (range 10 – 78), we analyzed 29 patients (1 lost at follow up). Twenty-seven patients (90 %) had presented breast cancer local relapse or a new primary cancer in the same breast after a previous conservative surgery plus radiation treatment; three patients (10 %) had previously received irradiation with mantle field for Hodgkin Lymphoma. Esthetic result was excellent in 3 pts (10 %), good in 12 pts (41 %), fair in 8 pts (28 %) and poor in 6 pts (21 %). 12 (41 %) patients showed subcutaneous fibrosis at the last follow-up. LC, DFS and OS at five years was 92. 3 %, 86. 3 % and 91. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion Although we analyzed {{a small number of}} patients, our results are satisfactory and this approach is feasible even if it could not be considered the standard treatment. Further clinical trials exploring IORT are needed to identify possible subgroups of patients that might be suitable for this type of approach...|$|R
40|$|Rubber is {{viscoelastic}} {{in nature}} and used {{in a variety of}} industrial applications. Rubber mounts are used to dampen vibration and shock. Damping, fatigue and dynamic properties of rubber mounts depend to a large extent on chemical ingredients mixed with the rubber. Natural rubber is the most widely used polymer for conventional mounts. Apart from natural rubber, different fillers and rubber chemicals are also present in conventional formulation of rubber mounts. Conventionally, five different classes of chemical curatives are used in rubber industries, which include curing agents, <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>accelerators</b> as well as primary and secondary activators. When chemical curatives are present in excessive amounts in rubber, they migrate to the rubber surface and form a bloomed layer. In this work, two rubber formulations were used for preparing rubber-to-metal bonded bobbin mounts. The formulations were primarily based on natural rubber with 60 parts per hundred rubber by weight (p. h. r.) precipitated amorphous white silica nanofiller. The surface of silica was pre-treated with bis(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT) coupling agent to chemically bond silica to the rubber. The rubber was cured primarily by reacting the tetrasulphane groups of TESPT with the rubber chains using a sulphenamide accelerator and the cure was then optimised by adding zinc oxide as an activator. The ratio of the accelerator to activator in one compound was 6 p. h. r. / 0. 3. p. h. r. and the compound showed extensive blooming of the accelerator on the rubber surface when stored at ambient temperature for up to 60 days. However, the blooming was reduced significantly by changing the ratio of the accelerator to activator to 3 p. h. r. / 2. 5. p. h. r., which was subsequently used to prepare a second compound. Dynamic and static properties of the bobbins were subsequently measured. Both compounds showed very low phase angle (δ) and spring rate ratio K d /K s (K d : dynamic spring rate; K s : static spring rate). Notably, the compound with the high accelerator to activator ratio had superior aforementioned properties, but the dynamic fatigue life of the bobbin reduced noticeably due to a gradual deterioration of the bond caused by the migration of the accelerator to the bonded interface...|$|R
40|$|The <b>primary</b> {{advantages}} that <b>accelerator</b> driven systems have over critical reactors are: (1) Greater flexibility regarding {{the composition and}} placement of fissile, fertile, or fission product waste within the blanket surrounding the target, and (2) Potentially enhanced safety brought about by operating at a sufficiently low value of the multiplication factor to preclude reactivity induced events. The control of the power production {{can be achieved by}} vary the accelerator beam current. Furthermore, once the beam is shut off the system shuts down. The primary difference between the operation of an accelerator driven system and a critical system is the issue of beam interruptions of the accelerator. These beam interruptions impose thermo-mechanical loads on the fuel and mechanical components not found in critical systems. Studies have been performed to estimate an acceptable number of trips, and the value is significantly less stringent than had been previously estimated. The number of acceptable beam interruptions {{is a function of the}} length of the interruption and the mission of the system. Thus, for demonstration type systems and interruption durations of 1 sec 5 mins 2500 /yr and 50 /yr are deemed acceptable. However, for industrial scale power generation without energy storage type systems and interruption durations of t 5 mins, the acceptable number of interruptions are 25000, 2500, 250, and 3 respectively. However, it has also been concluded that further development is required to reduce the number of trips. It is with this in mind that the following study was undertaken. The primary focus of this study will be the merit of a multi-beam target system, which allows for multiple spallation sources within the target/blanket assembly. In this manner it is possible to ameliorate the effects of sudden accelerator beam interruption on the surrounding reactor, since the remaining beams will still be supplying source neutrons. The proton beam will be assumed to have an energy of 1 GeV, and the target material will be natural lead, which will also be the coolant for the reactor assembly. Three proton beam arrangements will be considered, first a single beam (the traditional arrangement) with an entry at the assembly center, two more options will consist of three and six entry locations. The reactor fuel assembly parameters will be based on those of the S-PRISM fast reactor proposed by GE, and the fuel composition and type will be based on that proposed by Aker Solutions for use in their accelerator driven thorium reactor. The following table summarizes the parameters to be used in this study. The isotopic composition of the fertile material is 100 % Th- 232, and the plutonium isotopic distribution corresponds to that characteristic of the discharge from a typical LWR, following five years of decay. Thus, the isotopic distribution for the plutonium is; Pu- 238 2. 5 %, Pu- 239 53. 3 %, Pu- 240 25. 1 %, Pu- 241 11. 8 %, and Pu- 242 7. 3 %...|$|R
