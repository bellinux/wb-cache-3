50|$|The subject-side parameter, {{also called}} the specifier-head parameter, is a <b>proposed</b> <b>parameter</b> within {{generative}} linguistics which states that {{the position of the}} subject may precede or follow the head. In the world's languages, Specifier-first order (i.e., subject-initial order) is more common that Specifier-final order (i.e., subject-final order). For example, in the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures (WALS), 76% of the languages in their sample Specifier-first (either SOV or SVO). In this respect, the subject-side parameter contrasts with the head-directionality parameter. The latter, which classifies languages according to whether the head precedes or follows its complement, shows a roughly 50-50 split: in languages that have a fixed word order, about half have a Head-Complement order, and half have a Complement-Head order.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{momentum}} equation in the kinematic wave {{model is a}} power-law equation with two parameters. These parameters, which relate the discharge to the flow area, are commonly derived using Manning’s equation. In general, the values of these parameters depend on the flow depth except for some special cross sections.

Using this indicator, the parameters were mathematically derived nearly independent of the flow depth for two cases: constant and variable Manning’s roughness coefficients. The <b>proposed</b> <b>parameters</b> were estimated for a practical range of water depth levels and were verified using an approximate method.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple approach {{in assessing the}} amount of seismic mitigation of passive seismic protection of steel skeletal type structures. The amount of seismic protection is {{expressed in terms of}} reduction in the amplitudes of kinematical parameters associated to seismically induced oscillatory motion of the analyzed structures. The introduced parameter for assessing seismic protection is associated to the mitigation interval of steel skeletal structures equipped with passive protection. This interval is expressed in terms of natural vibration periods of the structure and is considered from the moment when the vibratory motion is initiated until the moment the motion reaches its steady state. During this time interval, a clear picture of vibratory motion is exhibited: length of the interval, number of vibratory cycles, amplitudes, their variation/decrease in time, the end of transitory motion {{and the beginning of the}} (short, nevertheless) pseudo – steady state motion. The paper proposes a time variable parameter that synthesizes all these features of the transitory motion. The length of this interval and its descending slope emphasize the effectiveness of seismic protection. The shorter the interval and the greater its descending slope, the more effective the associated seismic protection. Time history type analyses have been carried out on several sets of skeletal steel structures. The structures are analyzed in two situations: without seismic protection (reference structure) and equipped with passive seismic protection (viscous dampers). The numerical results of time history analyses are presented and discussed with reference to the <b>proposed</b> <b>parameter</b> assessing seismic mitigation. The time variation of the <b>proposed</b> <b>parameter</b> is presented graphically for a better and immediate “physical ” perception.

The recent American Society of Echocardiography and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging joint recommendations have tried to simplify the diagnosis and the grading of LVDD. However, both an often unknown pre-morbid LV diastolic function and the presence of several confounders—i.e., use of vasopressors, positive pressure ventilation, volume loading—make the <b>proposed</b> <b>parameters</b> difficult to interpret, especially in the ICU. Among the <b>proposed</b> <b>parameters</b> for diagnosis and grading of LVDD, the two tissue Doppler imaging-derived variables e′ and E/e′ seem most reliable.
