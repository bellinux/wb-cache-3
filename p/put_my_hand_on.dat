500|$|Peter Doyle may be {{the most}} likely {{candidate}} for the love of Whitman's life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: [...] "We were familiar at once—I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his knee—we understood. He did not get {{out at the end of}} the trip—in fact went all the way back with me." [...] In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code [...] "16.4" [...] (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips." [...] The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his [...] "Calamus" [...] poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond. The manuscript of his love poem [...] "Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.|$|E
2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done anything yet. There is nothing that I can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
60|$|He {{had given}} me my cue. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} and spoke sorrowfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> him {{within an}} hour; {{but it may}} be we'll stay {{overnight}} so's I can bring him into town in the mornin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked again}} into the kitchen; then I {{returned}} and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Robina's shoulders. [...] "It is a most amusing incident--as it has turned out," [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|When I saw young Burt {{start for}} the plate and {{realized}} {{it was his turn}} at bat, I jumped as if I had been shot. <b>Putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Old Well-Well's shoulder I whispered: [...] "Burt's at bat: He'll break up this game! I know he's going to lose one!" ...|$|R
60|$|How could I resist that? I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers. [...] "Don't quit, Nan. You'll {{never forgive}} {{yourself}} if you quit. Take it from me, Whit will pull out of this hole!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] and I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not our fault. I could <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> half a {{dozen men}} who're {{at the bottom of}} the trouble; but what would be the use of that, when the blamed jury would {{certainly}} let them off? In a case of this kind, our system of justice is mighty apt to break down. It's a pet idea of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! thou ugly old toad. He {{has begun}} a new one, for which I have promised to sit. I'll pay for the breakfast he gives me, by donning a {{gorgeous}} gold embroidered doubtlet which he once stole from somewhere, by <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hip, tilting my hat at a becoming angle, and winking at him by the hour whilst he paints away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} most happy {{to tell you}} the facts," [...] said Valentin. [...] "They are very simple, and it will be quickly done. But now {{everything}} depends <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> friends without delay. I will jump into a cab; you had better drive to my room and wait for me there. I will turn {{up at the end of}} an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you see him?" [...] said Beetle. [...] "I almost <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> him. Wasn't he a wopper! Didn't he stink! Hullo, Turkey, what's the matter? Are you hit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} my word not to meet him or write to him again without your knowledge. That {{is the only thing}} I will say. I will <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the Bible if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS, {{showing how}} {{the thing was}} done, {{with the help of}} a chair, 'I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} as it might be thus. [...] "Kenneth Dowey," [...] I said, [...] "I know your mother."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{she threw}} herself {{down on the sofa}} and she sobbed--I never heard a girl cry like that in all my life. She shrieked, she was pretty nearly in hysterics, and I couldn't get a word out of her. When she was through at last, she was all limp and white. She wouldn't tell me anything. She simply sat and looked at the stove. Presently she got up to go. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her {{shoulders}} and I forced her back in the chair.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{whole world}} of misery in those simple words. Cristel kept her place, unmoved. I rose, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> kindly <b>on</b> his shoulder. It {{was the best way}} I could devise of assuring him of my sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|We {{found that}} Uncle Jesse's [...] "cup of tea" [...] meant a veritable spread. He had aired the little dining room, {{set out the}} table daintily with Aunt Elizabeth's china and linen--"knowed jest where to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> 'em--often and often helped old Miss Kennedy wash 'em. We were cronies, her and me. I miss her terrible"--and adorned it with mayflowers which, as we {{afterwards}} discovered, he had tramped several miles to gather. There was good bread and butter, [...] "store" [...] biscuits, a dish of tea fit for the gods on high Olympus, and a platter of the most delicious sea trout, done to a turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I could swear to that. And {{now we must}} act together. When I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> him, you do the same, and give him no chance to use his sword or pistols." ...|$|E
60|$|Doesn't some poet or philosopher fellow {{say that}} it's when our {{intentions}} are best {{that we always}} make the worst breaks? I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the passage, but you'll find it in Shakespeare or somewhere, I'm pretty certain.|$|E
6000|$|She did not answer, but {{continued}} {{staring at the}} letter. I went up to her, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her shoulder, feeling very uncomfortable. She took no notice of me, beginning to murmur: [...] "Poor Frank—Poor Frank." [...] That was my father's name.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the word}} Pauline the spell seemed to fall again over the bright spirit of Mrs. Harris. Her eyelids drooped, her limbs lost their power, and she sank into her chair as before, a {{helpless}} victim, apparently, to the hidden forces. For a moment I {{was at a}} loss. I {{could not believe that}} she was deceiving us, but it was possible that she was deceiving herself. [...] "In either case, she must be brought out of this," [...] I decided, and, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her shoulders, I said: [...] "If there is any 'control' here, let them stop this. We want no more of it. Stop it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} of the Kaaba, I was granted one of those {{extraordinary}} moments which sometimes occur around the Black Stone. As I approached the Corner the large crowd was suddenly pushed back by a strong man who had just kissed the Black Stone. This push generated a backward current, creating a momentary opening around the Black Stone as I came to it; I swiftly accepted the opportunity reciting, Bismillahi Allahu akbar wa lillahi-hamd the name of God, God is great, all praise to God", <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Black Stone and kissed it. Thousands of silver lines sparkled, the Stone glistened, and something stirred deep inside me. A few seconds passed. Then I was pushed away by the guard.|$|R
5000|$|In response, Oakley {{claimed that}} {{he sat down in}} his seat and he saw the Knicks owner James Dolan look at him and within four minutes he was being asked to leave the arena. He says that he didn't become combative until he was asked to leave for no {{apparent}} reason. While admitting [...] "I shouldn't have <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> anyone," [...] Oakley disputed the Knicks' rendition of events in an interview with ESPN's [...] "The Undefeated," [...] which reported that Oakley says he [...] "never said a word to Dolan" [...] and [...] "was minding his own business when he was confronted by Madison Square Garden Security, who asked why he was sitting so close to Dolan before demanding that he leave the building." ...|$|R
6000|$|John Morton, {{who was a}} man of business, went to work at {{once with}} his pencil and in two minutes had made out a total. [...] "I don't know that I could <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> £14,000 even if I were minded to make the purchase." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, I've seen it. But I wouldn't believe it. When I've <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> your shoulder, I've {{seen that}} you could hardly help shuddering. And {{sometimes}} when I've kissed you, I've seen you put out all your strength to prevent yourself from pushing me away.|$|E
60|$|MAUD. Should I {{naturally}} <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> them; {{or would}} there be a reaction quick enough to stop me? You see, I'm alone--and the point is whether {{the fear of being}} seen would stop me although I knew I couldn't be seen. It's rather subtle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{curse of}} New York,' he said, mournfully, 'is the way {{everything}} changes in it. You can't take your eyes off {{it for a}} minute. The population's always shifting. It's like a railway station. You go away for a bit {{and come back and}} try to find your old pals, and they're all gone: Ike's in Arizona, Mike's in a sanatorium, Spike's in jail, and nobody seems to know where the rest of them have got to. I came up from the country two days ago, expecting to find the old gang along Broadway the same as ever, and I'm dashed if I've been able to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> one of them! Not a single, solitary one of them! And it's only six months since I was here last.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy I {{understand}} what you mean, my dear boy," [...] I said, and in the right of my ten years' seniority I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> caressingly <b>on</b> his shoulder, [...] "and you are no more guilty than I am in knowing that if Mrs. Bentley {{were not in the}} way there would be no obstacle to your happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} her," [...] she said, [...] "and {{have given her}} the message. I {{could see that she}} {{understood}} it, but as there were other women round, she made no sign. I told the mistress of the zenana that you had given me some magic words that I was to whisper to her to prepare the way for the philter, so she let me in without difficulty, and I was allowed to go close up to her and repeat your message. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her before I did so, and I think she felt that it was the touch of a friend. She hushed up when I spoke to her. The mistress, who was standing close by, thought that this was a sign {{of the power of the}} words I had spoken to her. I did not stay more than a minute. I was afraid she might try to speak to me in your tongue, and that would have been dangerous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{leave you}} {{at the door of}} these places. I am too well known to enter. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the {{shoulder}} of too many men, during the year, for me to go into any society without the risk of someone knowing me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I've {{not seen}} him for a week--and of course I've wondered." [...] His wonderment showed at this moment as sharper, but he {{presently}} went on. [...] "Still, I dare say I can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> him. Did she strike you," [...] he asked, [...] "as anxious?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm again, {{and this}} time he was less alarmed. [...] "We seem to have a sort of {{invisible}} bodies," [...] said he. [...] "By Jove! there's a boat coming round the headland. It's very much like the old life after all--in a different climate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> right <b>on</b> the spot. First place," [...] {{he looked}} {{to the side and}} saw Lucile {{stealing}} an anxious glance to him,--"first place, only the other day she gave you a song about St. Vincent. Second place, and therefore, you think her heart's not in this present proposition; that she doesn't care a rap for me; in short, that she's marrying me for reinstatement and spoils. Isn't that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Scott, {{this money}} {{must be paid}} back at once, or I shall lose my senses. Fortune has so far favoured me as to enable me to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> at once <b>on</b> the larger portion of it. You must let me have the remainder. In God's name say that you will do so.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Gavin Robertson, Jilly's handler, {{revealed}} that Jilly would be retired after Crufts. He said [...] "We always decided {{this would be}} Jilly's retirement show, so really wanted this to be her best. I can't express how happy I feel, she never lets me down, she's my {{once in a lifetime}} dog. I am sad Sunday will be our last show, but she has really given me everything. It is like our cup final." [...] Robertson also stated that Jilly may have a litter of puppies later in the year.In his best in show report, judge Geoff Corish stated: [...] "I have admired this bitch since she was very young but today was the first time I was able to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her. She is a delight to go over, the most lovely head & soft expression. She has neck & the right balance, super in coat & she was in the hardest of condition, they must have walked her miles. But it’s on the move that she really comes into her own. She has so much charisma moving, that I could watch her all day." ...|$|R
