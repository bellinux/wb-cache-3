50|$|Among the {{smallest}} countries in Africa, Togo enjoys {{one of the}} highest standards of living on the continent owing to its valuable phosphate deposits and a well-developed export sector based on agricultural products such as coffee, cocoa bean, and <b>peanuts</b> (<b>groundnuts),</b> which together generate roughly 30% of export earnings. The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Major crops are cassava, jasmine rice, corn and millet. Other important sectors are brewery and the textile industry. A permanent problem is the lack of electricity, because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption, the rest is covered by imports from Ghana and Nigeria. Low market prices for Togo’s major export commodities, however, coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s, had a negative effect on the economy.|$|E

The low yields of this crop are mainly attributed to unreliable rainfall patterns with frequent droughts, lack of highyielding adapted cultivars, damage by diseases and pests, poor agronomic practices, and limited use of inputs. Genetic engineering approaches have been shown to be comparatively fast, leading to better isolation and cloning of desired traits for combating the various biotic and abiotic stresses.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Caryedon serratus, the <b>peanut</b> (<b>groundnut)</b> bruchid, on 2 Australian native plants, Cassia brewsteri and C. tomentella, was documented over 2 years.

Seed loss to C. serratus in these species assessed across all collection sites was 40 ± 8. 0 % (mean ± s. e.). Where the bruchid was detected at a given site, 72 ± 8. 6 % of pods on 71 ± 8. 5 % of trees were affected. Additional distribution points and other potential host species from previous C. serratus collections in the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) are reported. The combined data were used to predict a potential range for the bruchid across the dry tropics of Australia. No reports of migration to cultivated or stored peanut (Arachis hypogaea) in Australia were located. Further investigation of the potential impact of this bruchid on the Australian peanut industry is recommended. A potentially beneficial aspect of C. serratus establishment may be the biological control of Acacia nilotica (prickly acacia) in Australia...|$|R
