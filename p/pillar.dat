5|$|On 29 April 1969 the Irish {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Nelson <b>Pillar</b> Act, terminating the <b>Pillar</b> Trust and vesting {{ownership of the}} site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that the <b>Pillar</b> had been capable of repair {{and should have been}} re-assembled and rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's <b>Pillar</b> (also {{known as}} the Nelson <b>Pillar</b> or simply the <b>Pillar)</b> was a large granite column capped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed O'Connell Street) in Dublin, Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom, it survived until March 1966, when it was {{severely}} damaged by explosives planted by Irish republicans. Its remnants were later destroyed by the Irish Army.|$|E
50|$|The temple {{has quite}} a few sculptures and art. In the 'Alankara mandapam' {{adjacent}} to the Northern corridor there are four large <b>pillars</b> each formed {{by a group of}} smaller <b>pillars</b> all carved from a single stone. Two of these large <b>pillars</b> have 33 smaller <b>pillars</b> and the other two 25 each.

Unfortunately these <b>pillars</b> are surrounded by iron grills to prevent vandalism.|$|R

5|$|The Harpy Tomb is {{a marble}} chamber from a <b>pillar</b> tomb {{that stands in}} the {{abandoned}} city of Xanthos, capital of ancient Lycia, a region of southwestern Anatolia {{in what is now}} Turkey.

5|$|On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the <b>Pillar.</b> They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the <b>Pillar</b> when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E

50|$|Cave Temple 3 - Situated {{south of}} the {{previous}} cave, {{this is the largest}} of the four caves.

The corbel above the <b>pillars</b> is in curved profile. The southern façade has two <b>pillars</b> and two pilasters. Corbels are finished above the <b>pillars,</b> however these are not fully cut in to make the space for circumambulation.

The ship initiates a jump to slipspace (similar to hyperspace), hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth. The game starts with the <b>Pillar</b> of Autumn encountering Halo.|$|E
5|$|Two {{accounts}} exist {{regarding the}} adoption of Rakotomavo, whom Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana designated to rule after him as King Andriambelomasina. According to the first version, Rakotomavo and Mandriamohara were sons of Rangorimanana. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana sent messengers to Ranorimanana to bring the boys to him with the instructions {{to take note of}} which child stood closer to the central <b>pillar</b> (andry, symbolic of strength) of their mother's house. When the boys entered the house, Rakotomavo stood closer to the <b>pillar.</b> The children's relatives refused to allow the messengers to take the children, so the king sent them back with rice, milk, honey and other goods and successfully lured the boys away.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{specific}} architectural features which evolved {{with the}} Bayon style are clearly discerned in this temple. The roof is supported on free-standing <b>pillars</b> {{in the eastern}} and western pavilions in the third enclosure, built in a cruciform plan with the inner row of <b>pillars</b> supporting the roof. The <b>pillars</b> are also tied to the wall by a tie beam using a [...] "mortise-and-tenon join" [...] patterned on wooden structures. Other features noted are of the four central <b>pillars</b> in the western pavilion which have been strengthened with temporary supports of laterite stone block <b>pillars.</b> Carvings of Buddha are seen on all these <b>pillars</b> but mostly defaced. The temporary support system provided to the roof built on free standing <b>pillars</b> is indicative of problems of design seen in the temples built during this period.|$|R
5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control <b>Pillar,</b> disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control <b>Pillar,</b> and knocks Gould into the <b>Pillar,</b> electrocuting him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive {{and destroy the}} Control <b>Pillar,</b> permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron {{that he will be}} replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm, and is about to execute him when Megatron intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first <b>pillar</b> is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second <b>pillar</b> is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third <b>pillar</b> is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a pragmatic {{definition}} of clinical excellence. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a conceptual review of key studies relating to clinical excellence. Findings – The pursuit of clinical excellence can be profitably considered in terms of 15 <b>pillars</b> of excellence comprising “technical” <b>pillars,</b> “personal” <b>pillars,</b> and “future” <b>pillars.</b> The five technical <b>pillars</b> are: evidence-based thinking and practice; professional and peer accreditation; decision support systems; effectiveness and efficiency; learning and risk management. The five personal <b>pillars</b> comprise: interpersonal skills; collaboration and leadership; resilience and stress management; user involvement; moral principles. The five future <b>pillars</b> consist of: policy and succession planning; teaching and training; innovation; research and publications; income-resource generation. Originality/value – These 15 <b>pillars</b> of excellence may serve as an aide-memoire for clinicians in their professional practice, as a pragmatic framework for both individual and organizational appraisal, accreditation, revalidation and reward systems, and as a teaching tool for a range of health-care professionals. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} phase, once advance mining has been completed, <b>pillars</b> are removed [...] "on the retreat."

As the <b>pillars</b> are removed, the mine collapses because nothing remains to support the roof and overburden. Removing <b>pillars</b> causes stresses within the mine to shift and must be planned and executed carefully to reduce danger to miners and control the amount of stress exerted on remaining <b>pillars</b> and the mine floor.|$|R
