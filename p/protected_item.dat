The <b>protected</b> <b>item</b> has a Bluetooth marker (e.g., a tag) that is in constant communication with the phone. If the connection is broken (the marker is {{out of range of}} the phone) then an alarm is raised. This can also be used as a man overboard alarm. A product using this technology has been available since 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Documents, products, seals {{or other}} items can be {{equipped}} with a hologram. The hologram is expected to ensure anti-counterfeit protection {{because it can be}} neither copied nor imitated (provided that advanced technology has been used for hologram origination). Holograms are considered the strongest anti-counterfeit measure available. Connecting of a hologram with the <b>protected</b> <b>item</b> is a critical task, and there are many specific technologies for it. Microholograms enable to protect material (substrate)l for a production of documents, stamps, products, etc. Tiny metallic particles of the size from 40 micrometers to half a millimeter are blended into plastic, paper, foil, etc. There is a complete hologram on each particle.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} {{restored}} mainly by the labour of enthusiasts and laid-off dock workers, and is kept operational to date. Most of the time, the Cap San Diego is moored {{at the port}} of Hamburg, where visitors can access virtually all areas of the ship from the bridge to the engine. One of the cargo holds hosts temporary exhibitions. Passenger cabins can be booked for overnight stays. Several times a year, the ship leaves the harbour for trips on its own power, mostly on the river Elbe or to Cuxhaven. In 2001, the ship was awarded the Maritime Heritage Award by the World Ship Trust, and in 2003 it was declared a <b>protected</b> <b>item</b> of cultural heritage by German law.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the amount of content {{available}} in a digital format, such as music, movies and books, has increased exponentially. Along with this has come {{an increase in the}} use of technologies to control and restrict how the content can be used. Collectively, these technologies are categorized as ―digital rights management, ‖ sometimes shortened to DRM. Virtually every provider of paid digital content uses some form of DRM technology, and it is usually the choice of the original provider of the digital content rather than the online store that sells it to utilize it. There has been a good deal of resistance from consumers in this area, and only now are content providers and online stores responding to it. While early attempts at online content distribution contained none of these restrictions, those in use today contain methods to restrict where a given copy of a <b>protected</b> <b>item</b> can be played, how many times it can be copied, or how many times it can be recorded to an audio CD. In the case of a music CD purchased at retail, DRM methods on the disc can restrict if and how often the tracks on the disc can be ripped to a computer. While the use of DRM on music CDs has dropped off {{in the last couple of}} years, it is only now beginning to go away in the online stores. Apple made the first move on May 30 with the launch of ―iTunes Plus, ‖ an addition t...|$|E
40|$|Approved as a Wallops {{control center}} backup system, the Wallops Ship Surveillance Software is a day-of-launch risk {{analysis}} tool for spaceport activities. The system calculates impact probabilities and displays ship locations relative to boundary lines. It enables rapid analysis of possible flight paths to preclude {{the need to}} cancel launches and allow execution of launches in a timely manner. Its design is based on low-cost, large-customer- base elements including personal computers, the Windows operating system, C/C++ object-oriented software, and network interfaces. In conformance with the NASA software safety standard, the system is designed {{to ensure that it}} does not falsely report a safe-for-launch condition. To improve the current ship surveillance method, the system is designed to prevent delay of launch under a safe-for-launch condition. A single workstation is designated the controller of the official ship information and the official risk analysis. Copies of this information are shared with other networked workstations. The program design is divided into five subsystems areas: 1. Communication Link [...] threads that control the networking of workstations; 2. Contact List [...] a thread that controls a list of <b>protected</b> <b>item</b> (ocean vessel) information; 3. Hazard List [...] threads that control a list of hazardous item (debris) information and associated risk calculation information; 4. Display [...] threads that control operator inputs and screen display outputs; and 5. Archive [...] a thread that controls archive file read and write access. Currently, most of the hazard list thread and parts of other threads are being reused as part of a new ship surveillance system, under the SureTrak project...|$|E

50|$|In Sweden, {{distraint}} (Swedish:Utmätning) {{is performed}} by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Bank assets and similar are taken first, but if needed the Enforcement Authority can visit people's homes, assisted by the police. Goods needed for an acceptable standard of living are protected, like clothes, TV-sets and stoves. <b>Protected</b> <b>items</b> that are expensive can be replaced with cheaper, and excess items can be taken. Goods found in the home, but belonging to others, e.g. to the girlfriend, can also be taken unless it is proven who it belongs to. Homes can be forcibly sold (Swedish:exekutiv auktion), and everyone living there might be evicted.|$|R
50|$|The best angle {{may be seen}} by {{following}} the money involved in arms trade.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these tests}} {{was to determine whether}} Insta-Foam can be used successfully to <b>protect</b> <b>items</b> inside the solid rocket booster aft skirt during reentry. On some of the early Space Shuttle flights the aft skirt heat shield curtain failed during reentry. This allowed the hot gases to damage some of the equipment, etc., inside the skirt. For example, some of the propellant lines were overheated and ruptured and some of the NSI (nozzle severance) cables were damaged. It was suggested that the Insta-Foam thermal protection system be sprayed over these lines, etc., to protect them during future flights in case of a curtain failure. The tests presented were devised and run to check out the feasibility of this idea...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{protection}} of heritage has been discussed {{in many parts of}} the world. In Australia, new laws have been passed, such as "The Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1998 (Cth) ", "The Heritage Act 1993 (SA) ", "Heritage Amendment Act 1988 (NSW) ", "Heritage Act 1995 (Vic) ". Heritage has acquired a beatific image in popular culture (see for instance the cover of this issue of the "AltLJ"). However, in a diverse Australia the struggle for ownership of the past has lead to disputes about which heritage should be protected and to debates as to the level of protection that should be provided. As more 'things' have been included in the definition of cultural heritage, so too has protection of these 'things' been sought through the legal system. Thus legal definitions of cultural heritage can be cast in a narrow restrictive way to limit heritage to tangibles such as buildings, sites or objects. Conversely, legal definitions can be broad enough to encapsulate intangibles such as religion, folklore, oral history and living culture. When we consider all these points, it becomes obvious that the process of legislating for {{the protection}} of cultural heritage requires decisions as to what is to be protected, how it is to be protected and why it is to be protected. Legislators and regulators do not just <b>protect</b> <b>items,</b> they <b>protect</b> <b>items</b> understood in particular ways. The significant past is chosen - treating a war medal as something which should be protected to preserve what is quintessentially Australian is very different from treating it as a minor piece of Victorian bronze work. Further, in choosing the significant past, legislators and regulators are not just responding to demands made by some members of the public or by historians. They are also acting to shape the public's view of how the past is politically laden...|$|R
50|$|New {{cases may}} be preferred, {{constructed}} of safe {{materials such as}} metal, plexiglass, or some sealed woods. Separating certain materials from the display section of an exhibition case by lining relevant surfaces with an impermeable barrier film will help <b>protect</b> <b>items</b> from damage. Any fabrics that line or decorate the case (e.g. polyester blend fabric), and any adhesives used in the process, should also be tested to determine any risk. Using internal buffers and pollutant absorbers, such as silica gel, activated carbon, or zeolite, {{is a good way}} to control relative humidity and pollutants. Buffers and absorbers should be placed out of sight, in the base or behind the backboard of a case. If the case is to be painted, it is recommended oil paints be avoided; acrylic or latex paint is preferable.|$|R
50|$|Special {{handling}} originated as {{a service}} that secured accelerated processing of fourth class mail (mostly parcels), {{so that it would}} be delivered as promptly as first-class material.

40|$|E-commerce {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features to have emerged from the presence of the Internet. It allows people to exchange goods with low time or distance barriers. E-commerce creates new opportunities; meanwhile, it also presents new challenges in terms of supplying chain management, particularly regarding the packaging system. Packaging functions have had to develop along with the new requirements enforced by e-commerce (i. e., increased amounts of packaging materials for each product, an increased need to <b>protect</b> <b>items,</b> end-life management, environmental sustainability, etc.). In this paper, the authors propose an original reference framework for the design of a product packaging system that can be applied to e-operations. According to the framework, the authors have developed a mathematical model for evaluating the cost that a company has to sustain when partaking in e-commerce business. In conclusion, the paper discusses the application of both the framework and the mathematical model to a case study in order to develop an innovative packaging solution for e-commerce...|$|R
