In this paper, a method for location <b>of</b> a <b>door</b> handle in HSI color space is presented. The image <b>of</b> the <b>door</b> handle is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a rectangle frame fitted to the door handle to be displayed in real time. The distance value <b>of</b> the <b>door</b> handle is obtained from the depth image. Experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R
