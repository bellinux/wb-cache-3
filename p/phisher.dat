25|$|A Universal Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Phishing Kit, {{discovered}} in 2007, provides a simple-to-use interface {{that allows a}} <b>phisher</b> to convincingly reproduce websites and capture log-in details entered at the fake site.|$|E
25|$|To avoid {{directly}} {{dealing with}} the source code of web pages, hackers are increasingly using a phishing tool called Super <b>Phisher</b> that makes the work easy when compared to manual methods of creating phishing websites.|$|E
25|$|Even digital {{certificates}} do not {{solve this problem}} because {{it is quite possible}} for a <b>phisher</b> to purchase a valid certificate and subsequently change content to spoof a genuine website, or, to host the phish site without SSL at all.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new password-based mutual authentication protocol for Web systems which prevents {{various kinds of}} phishing attacks. This protocol provides a protection of user's passwords against any <b>phishers</b> even if dictionary attack is employed, and prevents <b>phishers</b> from imitating {{a false sense of}} successful authentication to users. The protocol is designed considering interoperability with many recent Web applications which requires many features which current HTTP authentication does not provide. The protocol is proposed as an Internet Draft submitted to IETF, and implemented in both server side (as an Apache extension) and client side (as a Mozilla-based browser and an IE-based one). The paper also proposes a new user-interface for this protocol which is always distinguishable from fake dialogs provided by <b>phishers...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{process of}} how <b>phishers</b> prepare {{the ground for}} their attacks. Phishing attacks can be {{subdivided}} into three phases: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Phishers</b> are {{targeting}} the customers of banks and online payment services. Emails, supposedly from the Internal Revenue Service, {{have been used}} to glean sensitive data from U.S. taxpayers. While the first such examples were sent indiscriminately in the expectation that some would be received by customers of a given bank or service, recent research has shown that <b>phishers</b> may in principle be able to determine which banks potential victims use, and target bogus emails accordingly.|$|R
25|$|Evil twin is a {{phishing}} {{technique that}} is hard to detect. A <b>phisher</b> creates a fake wireless network that looks similar to a legitimate public network that may be found in public places such as airports, hotels or coffee shops. Whenever someone logs on to the bogus network, fraudsters try to capture their passwords and/or credit card information.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{phishing}} attacks {{require a}} fake website. Messages that {{claimed to be}} from a bank told users to dial a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts. Once the phone number (owned by the <b>phisher,</b> and provided by a voice over IP service) was dialed, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. Vishing (voice phishing) sometimes uses fake caller-ID data to give the appearance that calls come from a trusted organisation. SMS phishing uses cell phone text messages to induce people to divulge their personal information.|$|E
2500|$|Responsibility {{for this}} attack was {{claimed by the}} hacker known as [...] "Phineas Fisher" [...] (or <b>Phisher)</b> on Twitter. Phineas has {{previously}} attacked spyware firm Gamma International, who produce malware, such as FinFisher, for governments and corporations. [...] In 2016, Phineas published details of the attack, in Spanish and English, as a [...] "how-to" [...] for others, and explained the motivations behind the attack.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{example of}} a {{phishing}} email, disguised as an official email from a (fictional) bank. The sender is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing confidential information by [...] "confirming" [...] it at the <b>phisher's</b> website. Note the misspelling of the words received and discrepancy as [...] Also note that although the URL of the bank's webpage appears to be legitimate, the hyperlink would actually be pointed at the <b>phisher's</b> webpage.|$|R

50|$|If {{a domain}} publishes an SPF record, spammers and <b>phishers</b> {{are less likely}} to forge e-mails pretending to be from that domain, because the forged e-mails {{are more likely to be}} caught in spam filters which check the SPF record. Therefore, an SPF-protected domain is less {{attractive}} to spammers and <b>phishers.</b> Because an SPF-protected domain is less attractive as a spoofed address, it is less likely to be blacklisted by spam filters and so ultimately the legitimate e-mail from the domain is more likely to get through.|$|R
2500|$|On January 26, 2004, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission {{filed the}} first lawsuit against a {{suspected}} <b>phisher.</b> The defendant, a Californian teenager, allegedly created a webpage {{designed to look}} like the America Online website, and used it to steal credit card information. Other countries have followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers. A phishing kingpin, Valdir Paulo de Almeida, was arrested in Brazil for leading one of the largest phishing crime rings, which in two years stole between [...] and [...] UK authorities jailed two men in June 2005 for their role in a phishing scam, in a case connected to the U.S. Secret Service Operation Firewall, which targeted notorious [...] "carder" [...] websites.

[...] The arrests continued in 2006 with the FBI Operation Cardkeeper detaining a gang of sixteen in the U.S. and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{methods of}} {{phishing}} use {{some form of}} technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear {{to belong to the}} spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will take you to the example section of the yourbank website; actually this URL points to the [...] "yourbank" [...] (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the [...] tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the <b>phisher.</b> Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview feature.|$|E
5000|$|Identity Providers {{must be able}} {{to trust}} that the Relying Party is {{legitimate}} (i.e. not a hacker, <b>phisher,</b> etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{identify}} methods that <b>phishers</b> employ to attack unsuspecting internet users. The aim was {{for the purpose of}} minimizing their effects on websites as well as users. Eleven statements, namely, Emails, Web based, Malware based, Internet Relay Chats (IRCâ€™s) Man in the middle (MITM) Domain Name Server (DNS) based, Impersonate, Forward Attack, Pop-up attack, Voice Phishing and Mobile Phishing, depicting methods used by <b>phishers</b> to carry out their attacks against unsuspecting victims who are the internet users were presented to respondents to indicate their level of agreement. The result showed that only two, (MITM and Web based) out of the eleven were not significant while the remaining nine were significant. That means only the two strategies of attacks are not really dangerous as such can be ignored. This also indicates a high level of danger posed by <b>phishers.</b> Suggestion for further studies was made...|$|R
50|$|TOTP codes can be phished just as {{passwords}} can, {{though they}} require <b>phishers</b> to proxy the credentials {{in real time}} rather than collect them for later use.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 {{while working}} at Cloudmark, Abad spent six months {{examining}} the phishing underworld from the inside. Abad discovered that <b>phishers</b> were using IRC channels in order to trade personal information. He stalked and collected messages from thirteen chat rooms <b>phishers</b> use. Whereas past phishing researchers believed that phishing was coordinated by highly organized criminals, Abad discovered that phishing rings were decentralized. Abad published his findings in First Monday. This paper was the first examination of how the economy of phishing agents functioned, and highlighted {{the high degree of}} specialization within the economy.|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of the}} CSC cannot {{protect against}} {{phishing}} scams, where the cardholder is tricked into entering the CSC among other card details via a fraudulent website. The growth in phishing has reduced the real-world effectiveness of the CSC as an anti-fraud device. There is now also a scam where a <b>phisher</b> has already obtained the card account number (perhaps by hacking a merchant database or from a poorly designed receipt) and gives this information to the victims (lulling them into {{a false sense of}} security) before asking for the CSC (which is all that the <b>phisher</b> needs).|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} based in the Netherlands and was {{launched}} in January 2005 as a successor to Suprnova.org, which went offline {{at the end of}} 2004 following legal difficulties. In April 2007, Mininova B.V. (the company running Mininova.org) won a domain dispute about the domain mininova.com, which had been exploited by a <b>phisher.</b>|$|E
25|$|This flaw {{means that}} <b>phishers</b> can keep links from {{previous}} emails functioning by simply {{moving to a}} new server when their original web page is blacklisted and adding a redirect.|$|R
40|$|Each month, {{more attacks}} are {{launched}} {{with the aim}} of making web users believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity which compels them to share their personal, financial information. Phishing costs Internet users billions of dollars every year. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) created an anti-phishing landing page supported by Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) with the aim to train users on how to prevent themselves from phishing attacks. It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors, government organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks on a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the landing page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two datasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from September 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April 30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users against phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing URLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing page helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that <b>phishers</b> have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate looking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We observed that <b>phishers</b> are exploiting ICANN accredited registrars to launch their attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that <b>phishers</b> are trying to exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this paper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by <b>phishers</b> to lure victims in 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably over time. <b>Phishers</b> have adopted new techniques like sending promotional e-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs...|$|R

50|$|There are {{anti-phishing}} websites which publish exact {{messages that}} have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages.To avoid directly dealing with the source code of web pages, hackers are increasingly using a phishing tool called Super <b>Phisher</b> that makes the work easy when compared to manual methods of creating phishing websites.|$|E

5000|$|It is not {{mandatory}} for a merchant {{to require the}} security code for making a transaction, hence the card may still be prone to fraud even if only its number is known to <b>phishers.</b>|$|R
25|$|To avoid {{anti-phishing}} {{techniques that}} scan websites for phishing-related text, <b>phishers</b> {{have begun to}} use Flash-based websites (a technique known as phlashing). These look much like the real website, but hide the text in a multimedia object.|$|R
5000|$|User Interface flaws: Some {{password}} managers {{will ask}} the user to log in through an iframe. This is unfortunately insecure. It trains the user to fill in her password while the URL displayed by the browser {{is not the one}} of the password manager. A <b>phisher</b> can abuse this by creating a fake iframe and capturing the user's credentials. Instead of using an iframe, a more secure approach is to open a new tab where users can login to the password manager.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{phishing}} attacks {{require a}} fake website. Messages that {{claimed to be}} from a bank told users to dial a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts. Once the phone number (owned by the <b>phisher,</b> and provided by a voice over IP service) was dialed, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. Vishing (voice phishing) sometimes uses fake caller-ID data to give the appearance that calls come from a trusted organisation. SMS phishing uses cell phone text messages to induce people to divulge their personal information.|$|E
50|$|A further {{problem with}} URLs {{has been found}} in the {{handling}} of internationalized domain names (IDN) in web browsers, that might allow visually identical web addresses to lead to different, possibly malicious, websites. Despite the publicity surrounding the flaw, known as IDN spoofing or homograph attack, phishers have taken advantage of a similar risk, using open URL redirectors on the websites of trusted organizations to disguise malicious URLs with a trusted domain.Even digital certificates do not solve this problem because it is quite possible for a <b>phisher</b> to purchase a valid certificate and subsequently change content to spoof a genuine website, or, to host the phish site without SSL at all.|$|E
25|$|The Anti-Phishing Working Group, an {{industry}} {{and law enforcement}} association, has suggested that conventional phishing techniques could become obsolete {{in the future as}} people are increasingly aware of the social engineering techniques used by <b>phishers.</b> They predict that pharming and other uses of malware will become more common tools for stealing information.|$|R

40|$|Phishing is {{a serious}} threat to the web economy and the Internet communication, because <b>phishers</b> put both users and {{organizations}} at risk of identity theft and financial losses. <b>Phishers</b> continually exploit new sophisticated features to impersonate legitimate web pages, modify their components and host their phishes. Furthermore, the prediction susceptibilities of features that were previously investigated become a key challenge for discriminating the evolving phishes. Accordingly, this paper investigated the prediction susceptibility of 58 hybrid features. It was observed that the investigated features were highly exploited in the content and hosted the URLs of phish webpages. The prediction susceptibility of the proposed features was experimentally examined in the suspected webpages using the SVM machine learning classification technique. The results revealed that the introduced features could be considered as potentially predictive ones and they could be utilized in the upcoming research to improve phishing detection approaches...|$|R
