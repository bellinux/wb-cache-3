60|$|Mrs Crich recoiled {{back upon}} herself, she recoiled {{away from this}} world of {{creeping}} democracy. A band of tight, baleful exclusion fastened round her heart, her isolation was fierce and hard, her antagonism was passive but terribly pure, {{like that of a}} hawk in a cage. As the years went on, she lost more and more count of the world, she seemed rapt in some glittering abstraction, almost purely unconscious. She would wander about the house and about the surrounding country, staring keenly and seeing nothing. She rarely spoke, she had no connection with the world. And she did not even think. She was consumed in a fierce tension of opposition, like the negative <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} a {{professional}} man, but some years before had retired upon a very comfortable income. I had always been very fond of scientific pursuits, and now made these the occupation and pleasure of much of my leisure time. Our home was in a small town; and {{in a corner of}} my grounds I built a laboratory, where I carried on my work and my experiments. I had long been anxious to discover the means not only of producing, but of retaining and controlling, a natural force, really the same as centrifugal force, but which I called negative gravity. This name I adopted because it indicated better than any other the action of the force in question, as I produced it. Positive gravity attracts everything toward the centre of the earth. Negative gravity, therefore, would be that power which repels everything from the centre of the earth, just as the negative <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> repels the needle, while the positive pole attracts it. My object was, in fact, to store centrifugal force and to render it constant, controllable, and available for use. The advantages of such a discovery could scarcely be described. In a word, it would lighten the burdens of the world.|$|E

5000|$|Paramagnetic substances, such as platinum, aluminum, and oxygen, are weakly {{attracted}} to either <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet.</b> This attraction is {{hundreds of thousands}} of times weaker than that of ferromagnetic materials, so it can only be detected by using sensitive instruments or using extremely strong magnets.

50|$|Both {{the torque}} and force exerted on a magnet by an {{external}} magnetic field are proportional to that magnet's magnetic moment. The magnetic moment is a vector: it has both a magnitude and direction. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> (inside the magnet).

50|$|The {{mirror image}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{electromagnet}} produces a field {{with the opposite}} polarity. Thus {{the north and south}} <b>poles</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> have the same symmetry as left and right. Prior to 1956, it was believed that this symmetry was perfect, and that a technician would be unable to distinguish the north and south <b>poles</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> except by reference to left and right. In that year, T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang predicted the nonconservation of parity in the weak interaction. To the surprise of many physicists, in 1957 C. S. Wu and collaborators at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards demonstrated that under suitable conditions for polarization of nuclei, the beta decay of cobalt-60 preferentially releases electrons toward the south <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> external magnetic field, and a somewhat higher number of gamma rays toward the north pole.

5000|$|The north <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> {{is defined}} as the pole that, when the magnet is freely suspended, points towards the Earth's North Magnetic Pole in the Arctic ( [...] the {{magnetic}} and geographic poles do not coincide, see magnetic declination). Since opposite poles (north and south) attract, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field. As a practical matter, to tell which [...] of a magnet is north and which is south, {{it is not necessary to}} use the Earth's magnetic field at all. For example, one method would be to compare it to an electromagnet, whose poles can be identified by the right-hand rule. The magnetic field lines of a magnet are considered by convention to emerge from the magnet's north pole and reenter at the south pole.|$|E

The Earth's North Magnetic Pole (currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Canada) is physically a south pole, as it attracts the north pole of a compass.A magnetic field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.|$|E

5000|$|His {{researches}} on {{the subject}} of electric discharge in rarefied gases led him to form a new theory of the aurora borealis. In 1840 he described a process for the electro-gilding of silver and brass, for which in the following year he received a prize of 3000 francs from the French Academy of Sciences. This and other papers were deemed of sufficient value to be republished in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique or in the Comptes Rendus. The principal work of De la Rive was his Treatise on Electricity in Theory and Practice in three volumes published simultaneously in French and English. which appeared in the years 1854-58. De la Rive described his theory of the cause of the Aurora Borealis, first published as a memoir in 1854, and illustrated by the experiment, now familiar to physicists, of rotating the voltaic arc of light around the <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magnet</b> as any other ponderable conductor would rotate.

This projectaimed to design a tool suitable for assembling these strongmagnets into rows and eventually full inner stator segments. To specify the problems and to analyse the different magneticforces present, electromagnetic simulations were made using thesoftware COMSOL Multiphysics. The results showed differentforces between the poles when varying the position of one pole. Based on the results, conclusions were made of how the mountingtool had to function.
