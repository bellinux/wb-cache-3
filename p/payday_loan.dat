Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E
25|$|Research for the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation {{found that}} a {{majority}} of Illinois <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> borrowers earn $30,000 or less per year. Texas' Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner collected data on 2012 <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> usage, and found that refinances accounted for $2.01 billion in loan volume, compared with $1.08 billion in initial loan volume. The report did not include information about annual indebtedness. A letter to the editor from an industry expert argued that other studies have found that consumers fare better when payday loans are available to them. Pew's reports have focused on how payday lending can be improved, but have not assessed whether consumers fare better with or without access to high-interest loans. Pew's demographic analysis was based on a random-digit-dialing (RDD) survey of 33,576 people, including 1,855 <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> borrowers.|$|E
25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a <b>payday</b> <b>loan.</b> Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the <b>payday</b> <b>loan.</b> The external costs of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the children and family who are left with fewer resources than before the loan. The external costs alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower him or herself understood the full implications of the decision to seek a <b>payday</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{interest}} rates on <b>payday</b> <b>loans</b> were capped to 150% in Oregon, causing a mass exit from the industry and preventing borrowers from taking out <b>payday</b> <b>loans,</b> there was a negative effect with bank overdrafts, late bills, and employment. The effect is {{in the opposite direction}} for military personnel. Job performance and military readiness declines with increasing access to <b>payday</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alberta rates {{became the}} lowest in Canada, for provinces that allow <b>payday</b> <b>loans,</b> {{effective}} August 2016, with the maximum rate of <b>payday</b> <b>loans</b> of $15 per $100 lent, an effective interest rate of 3,724%.|$|R

50|$|<b>Payday</b> <b>loans</b> in Canada are {{permitted}} under section 347.1 of the Criminal Code, {{so long as}} the province of the borrower has enacted sufficient provincial legislation concerning the provisioning of <b>payday</b> <b>loans.</b> In the event that no such provincial legislation exists (as is the case in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador) <b>payday</b> <b>loans</b> are limited by usury laws, with any effective (compound) rate of interest charged above 60% per annum considered criminal. However, so far this has not been enforced by Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to calculate annual percentage rate of a loan. Depending on which method is used, the rate calculated may differ dramatically; e.g., for a $15 charge on a $100 14-day <b>payday</b> <b>loan,</b> it could be (from the borrower's perspective) anywhere from 391% to 3,733%. − 1 = 37.33, which converts to a percentage increase (interest rate) of: 37.33 x 100 = 3733%).|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom has {{announced}} {{that there have been}} an increase of unauthorized firms, also known as 'clone firms', using the name of other genuine companies to offer <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> services. Therefore, acting as a clone of the original company, such as the case of Payday Loans Now. The FCA strongly advised to verify financial firms by using the Financial Services Register, prior to participating in any sort of monetary engagement.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{tendency}} to characterize <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> default rates as high, several researchers have noted {{that this is an}} artifact of the normal short term of the payday product, and that during the term of loans with longer periods there are frequently points where the borrower is in default and then becomes current again. Actual charge offs are no more frequent than with traditional forms of credit, as the majority of payday loans are rolled over into new loans repeatedly without any payment applied to the original principal.|$|E

25|$|Wonga saw losses {{more than}} double in 2015 as tougher {{regulation}} of the <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> sector led to a sharp fall {{in the number of}} loans taken out by UK consumers; the business reported a pre-tax loss of £80.2m for the year – up from £38.1m the year before. After tax, the company lost £76.5m, versus £43.6m in 2014. The UK remained a core part of the business - as of 2013 customers in the UK accounted for 3.8m of the 4m loans it granted. The drop in revenues was driven primarily by a new price cap and stricter criteria set by UK regulators.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, several {{publications}} {{appeared in}} the media, claiming nurses depend on food banks and payday loans to survive. In October 2016, Western Circle published research, claiming that the sector of NHS Nurses are heavily dependent on <b>payday</b> <b>loan.</b> According to the research, the number of nurses using payday loans has doubled in 3 years, since 2013. This research brought {{the matter of the}} low wages nurses received in the UK to the attention of media outlets. The claims were that nurses' salaries were frozen for more than 6 years and in some cases, resulted in financial distress, clearly as wages have not kept pace with the cost of living increases in this time. The lack of pay increases for, particularly nurses within the NHS continues to be an important topic of public discussion in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured <b>payday</b> <b>loan,</b> since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E

Payday loans in the United Kingdom are a rapidly growing industry, with four times as many people using such loans in 2009 compared to 2006 – in 2009 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million loans, with total lending amounting to £1.2 billion. In 2012, it is estimated that the market was worth £2.2 billion and that the average loan size was around £270. Two-thirds of borrowers have annual incomes below £25,000. There are no restrictions on the interest rates <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> companies can charge, although they are required by law to state the effective annual percentage rate (APR). In the early 2010s there was much criticism in Parliament of payday lenders.|$|E

[...] The Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2013 their study on {{the ways in which}} users pay off payday loans that borrowers often took a <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> to avoid one of these alternatives, only to turn to one of them to pay off the <b>payday</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{likelihood}} that a family will use a <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> increases if they are unbanked, or lack access to a traditional deposit bank account. [...] In an American context the families who will use a <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> are disproportionately either of black or Hispanic descent, recent immigrants, and/or under-educated. These individuals are least able to secure normal, lower-interest-rate forms of credit. Since payday lending operations charge higher interest-rates than traditional banks, they {{have the effect of}} depleting the assets of low-income communities. [...] The Insight Center, a consumer advocacy group, reported in 2013 that payday lending cost U.S communities $774 million a year.|$|E

2500|$|A {{report from}} the Federal Reserve Bank of New York {{concluded}} that, [...] "We ... test whether payday lending fits our definition of predatory. We find that in states with higher <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> limits, less educated households and households with uncertain income {{are less likely to}} be denied credit, but are not more likely to miss a debt payment. Absent higher delinquency, the extra credit from payday lenders does not fit our definition of predatory." [...] The caveat to this is that with a term of under 30 days there are no payments, and the lender is more than willing to roll the loan over at the end of the period upon payment of another fee. [...] The report goes on to note that payday loans are extremely expensive, and borrowers who take a <b>payday</b> <b>loan</b> are at a disadvantage in comparison to the lender, a reversal of the normal consumer lending information asymmetry, where the lender must underwrite the loan to assess creditworthiness.|$|E
50|$|Some groups, {{such as the}} Texas Fair Lending Alliance, present title <b>loans</b> and <b>payday</b> <b>loans</b> {{as a form of}} entrapment, where {{taking out}} one of these means that borrowers will find {{themselves}} cycling further into debt with less chances of getting out of debt when compared to not taking the loan out at all, contending that 75% of <b>payday</b> <b>loans</b> are taken out within two weeks of the previous loan in order to fill the gap in finances from when the loan was originally taken out. In 2001, Texas passed a law capping interest rates on title <b>loans</b> and <b>payday</b> <b>loans.</b> However, lenders are getting around the restrictions by exploiting loopholes allowing them to lend for the same purposes, with high interest rates, disguised as loan brokers or as a Credit Services Organization (CSO).|$|R
