25|$|The Aramaic-speaking Assyrians are the {{indigenous}} <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and descendants {{of those who}} ruled ancient Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. More generally speaking, the Assyrians (like the Mandeans) are descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra). They speak dialects of the Aramaic of the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and have their own written script. They began to convert to Christianity in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD formerly having followed the ancient Sumerian-Akkadian religion (also known as Ashurism). There {{are believed to be}} no more than 500,000 Assyrians remaining in Iraq, with a large concentration in the diaspora. They are Iraq's third largest ethnic group after the Arabs and the Kurds.|$|E

In the video, released just before the Iraqi Army Day on 6 January, Douri claimed to be somewhere in Iraq's Babil Province. However, former U.S intelligence officials believe it was filmed in Damascus, Syria. Hours after the tape was released, Iraqi military intelligence arrested Abdul Rahman Mohammed Ibrahim, the nephew of al-Douri, in Saladin Province.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002 Kenneth O'Keefe, an ex-U.S. Marine and Gulf War {{veteran who}} had {{attempted}} multiple times to renounce his U.S. citizenship, posted {{a call to}} action for large numbers of western citizens to migrate to Iraq and deploy themselves as [...] "Human Shields". The action was ultimately named the TJP (Truth Justice Peace) Human Shield Action to Iraq. O'Keefe believed that protests and petitions had no chance of preventing the invasion and that a large presence of western citizens, strategically placed in Iraq at potential targets, was the only viable deterrent to war. He argued that thousands of human shields deployed to these sites would make the invasion politically untenable. O'Keefe publicly acknowledged Saddam Hussein as a [...] "violent dictator" [...] and [...] "mass-murderer" [...] before he arrived in Iraq; it has been speculated he did this in an attempt to neutralize the perception that the human shields were simply pawns of Saddam. [...] Consequently, he received no favor from Saddam, his influence within the action declined rapidly as he traveled to Iraq, and eventually he was deported days before the invasion. Before his deportation he repeatedly alleged U.S. and British support for Hussein during some of his worst crimes; ultimately he argued that it was the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> who would suffer most from war.|$|E

40|$|In this rejoinder, {{we respond}} to {{comments}} by Lynn, Rushton, and Templer on our previous paper in which we criticized the use of national IQs in studies of evolutionary theories of race differences in intelligence. We reiterate {{that because of the}} Flynn Effect and psychometric issues, national IQs cannot be taken to reflect populations’ levels of g as fixed since the last ice age. We argue that the socio-cultural achievements <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> Mesopotamia and Egypt in 3000 B. C. stand {{in stark contrast to the}} current low level of national IQ <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Egypt and that these ancient achievements appear to contradict evolutionary accounts of differences in national IQ. We argue that race differences in brain size, even if these were entirely of genetic origin, leave unexplained 91 - 95 % of the black-white IQ gap. We highlight additional problems with hypotheses raised by Rushton and Templer. National IQs cannot be viewed solely in evolutionary terms but should be considered in light of global differences in socio-economic development, the causes of which are unknown...|$|R
