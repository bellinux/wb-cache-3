5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Dr. Watson Scott Swail founded EPI to {{establish}} stronger connections between educational research and educational policy, {{with an emphasis}} on historically underserved communities such as students from low-income families, students of color, and students with disabilities. Swail chose this focus because these student populations tend to be the primary target of the majority of educational policy programs, while their voices are simultaneously under-represented in the policy-making arena. This discrepancy <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a greater understanding of what factors have the greatest influence on their educational outcomes.|$|E

50|$|In Once Saved, Always Saved?, Pawson uses scripture to {{question}} the frequent evangelical claim that someone who has once believed in Jesus Christ {{will end up with}} Christ in heaven whatever that person subsequently believes or does.

5000|$|A [...] "right to communicate" [...] and [...] "communication rights" [...] {{are closely}} related, but not identical.
