Virtually {{all of those}} were performed in medical facilities; only 19 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 32,677 children were born in wedlock or within 300days {{after the end of}} the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 28.4 years. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents. In 2014, the birth rate was 9.3 <b>per</b> <b>mille,</b> exceeded by the mortality rate of 12.0 <b>per</b> <b>mille.</b> The infant mortality rate was 5.0 <b>per</b> <b>mille</b> in 2014. In terms of age structure, the population of Croatia is dominated by the 15–64year older segment (68.1%), while the size of the population younger than 15 and older than 64 is relatively small (15.1% and 16.9% respectively). The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>per</b> cent <b>mille</b> or pcm is one one-thousandth of a percent. It can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "milli-percent". It is {{commonly}} used in nuclear reactor engineering as a unit of reactivity.|$|R
50|$|Reactivity is an {{expression}} of the departure from criticality. δk = (k − 1)/k. When the reactor is critical, δk = 0. When the reactor is subcritical, δk < 0. When the reactor is supercritical, δk > 0. Reactivity is also represented by the lowercase Greek letter rho (ρ). Reactivity is commonly expressed in decimals or percentages or pcm (<b>per</b> cent <b>mille)</b> of Δk/k. When reactivity ρ is expressed in units of delayed neutron fraction β, the unit is called the dollar.|$|R

In ten days, it became the best-selling album in Spain.The title comes from a phrase pronounced by Kenneth Branagh in Much Ado about Nothing. In its first week, it sold more than 10,000 copies and reached number 1 on the CD sales chart in Spain, something which hadn't happened with a Catalan disc in more than 15 years. This second album was also released on vinyl.|$|R

25|$|The {{ratio of}} women per 1,000 men was 1,102. The birth rate per 1000 people was 12.3 <b>per</b> <b>mille</b> and {{steadily}} increasing {{in the last}} 5 years, the death rate reaching 12.1 <b>per</b> <b>mille</b> and decreasing. The natural growth rate during 2009 was 0.2 <b>per</b> <b>mille,</b> the first positive growth rate in nearly 20 years. The considerable immigration to the capital from poorer regions of the country, as well as urbanisation, are among the other reasons for the increase in Sofia's population. The infant mortality rate was 5.6 per 1,000, down from 18.9 in 1980. According to the 2011 census, people aged 20–24 years are the most numerous group, numbering 133,170 individuals and accounting for 11% of the total 1,202,761 people. The median age is 38 though. According to the census, 1,056,738 citizens (87.9%) are recorded as ethnic Bulgarians, 17,550 (1.5%) as Romani, 6,149 (0.5%) as Turks, 9,569 (0.8%) belonged to other ethnic groups, 6,993 (0.6%) do not self-identify and 105,762 (8.8%) remained with undeclared affiliation. This statistic should not necessarily be taken at face value due to conflicting data– such as for the predominantly Roma neighbourhood of Fakulteta, which alone may have a population of 45,000.|$|E

These observations and isotope mass balance model results imply that large variations {{in the degree of}} biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere occurred during the last 650 years, with a decrease by about 50 % in the 1600 s, an increase of about 100 % by the late 1800 s, and another decrease by about 70 % from the late 1800 s to present day...|$|R
25|$|Cost <b>per</b> <b>mille</b> {{requires}} {{only that the}} publisher make the advertising available {{on his or her}} website and display it to the page visitors in order to receive a commission.

25|$|In {{the case}} of cost per mille/click, the {{publisher}} is not concerned about a visitor {{being a member of}} the audience that the advertiser tries to attract and is able to convert, because at this point the publisher has already earned his commission. This leaves the greater, and, in case of cost <b>per</b> <b>mille,</b> the full risk and loss (if the visitor can not be converted) to the advertiser.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{ancient and}} medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin {{ampersand}} (&) replaces the conjunction and in English, et in Latin and French, and y in Spanish (but {{its use in}} Spanish is frowned upon, since the y is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign ⁊, resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction et and is written only to the x-height; in current Irish language usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction agus ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the percentage sign (%), from the Italian per cento ("per hundred"); the permille sign (‰), from the Italian <b>per</b> <b>mille</b> ("per thousand"); the pound sign (₤, £ and #, all descending from ℔ or lb, librum) and the dollar sign ($), which derives from the Spanish word Peso. The commercial at symbol (@), originally denoting [...] "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition at; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of e-mail addresses.|$|E
