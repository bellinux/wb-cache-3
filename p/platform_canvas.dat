40|$|The {{platform}} economy is disrupting innovation while presenting both {{opportunities and challenges}} for startups. Platforms support value creation between multiple participant groups, and this operationalization of an ecosystem’s value co-creation represents the “core interaction” of a platform. This article focuses on that core interaction and studies how startups connect producers and users in value-creating core interaction through digital platforms. The study {{is based on an}} analysis of 29 cases of platform startups interviewed at a leading European startup event. The studied startups were envisioning even millions of users and hundreds or thousands of producers co-creating value on their platforms. In such platform businesses, our results highlight the importance of attracting a large user pool, providing novel services to those users, offering a new market for producers, supporting the core interaction in various ways, and utilizing elements of the <b>platform</b> <b>canvas</b> – an adaptation of the business model canvas, which we have accommodated for platform-based business models – to accomplish these goals...|$|E
40|$|Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple {{and many}} more. The success of {{companies}} behind platform ecosystems is widely known. In this context, a platform {{is considered to}} be a marketplace where transactions between two or more user groups take place. Platform economy is causing a disruption in the global markets. The mankind is facing the fourth industrial revolution, where the way how people work, live, and even relate to each oth-er is changing dramatically. The accumulation of value in platform ecosystems is no longer linear like in traditional business models, nor is the pricing model as simple as in a traditional supply chain. In this thesis, the learning points from already implemented platform ecosystem projects were collected. The study was conducted as a case study complemented with a comprehensive literature review. A case study was selected as the research method as the aim on this thesis was to find out how the Finnish companies have implemented the plat-forms and also why they decided to utilize this particular business model. The study included two types of companies – international benchmarks and Finnish traditional pipeline companies having some kind of platform. As a result, a list of critical characteristics –a <b>platform</b> <b>canvas</b> – is proposed to facilitate platform creation and development. In addition, this thesis provides a collection of learning points from the case companies, with which current and future Finnish platform owners can avoid pitfalls and gain success with less effort and better probability. There are only a handful of Finnish manufacturing companies that are actively develop-ing a platform ecosystem. Those companies are relatively old, large in size, and have a history of profitable business. The studied companies rely heavily on the implementation of Internet of Things and analyzing of big data. They know well the value the platform can provide as well as the producers and users of the value. However, there is room for improvement in finding the way to capture value to the platform owner as well as exploiting the network effects. The case companies have defined and opened their boundary resources much less than the international benchmarks. This may hinder the expansion – and ultimately the success – of their platforms. The companies need more under-standing about the prerequisites – like value capturing models – of a successful platform ecosystem as well as training and tools to develop the platform...|$|E

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} have a central and continuing {{role to play}} in the future of learning, competing models of education are prompting institutions to evaluate how they facilitate taught content and adapt to new technologies (NMC, 2015). Technology has the ability to disrupt and empower, to captivate and deviate, as do the learners themselves. This session will focus on the use of Canvas LMS, new to Falmouth University, to facilitate performance based distance learning. Harnessing the power of the crowd is central to student experience, particularly in relation to online environments where the physical convening of students is not possible. Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) can be used to facilitate conversation, aid assessment and provide valuable feedback in an online environment. Focusing on the benefits of CSCL, we have implemented an environment for a fully online transnational degree launched in the 2014 / 15 academic year. The <b>Canvas</b> <b>platform</b> was chosen as an alternative learning environment (not widely used in UK Higher Education) that facilitates user interaction, collaboration and discussion. There is a requirement from creative arts students that they are able to upload work in various digital forms; electronic submission and feedback of work should utilise available technologies. It has been demonstrated that cooperative learning is beneficial (Johnson, Johnson & Stanne, 2000), we need to find methods to enable collaboration {{in a way that is}} digitally accessible for students. The approach implemented in Canvas for performance based courses is suggested as one method to facilitate collaboration. This session will address the main conference theme “Harnessing the power of the crowd” by detailing the introduction and implementation of a fully distant learning initiative using Canvas as an online platform to facilitate collaborative arts based learning. Participants can expect to hear how the environment has handled functionality fundamental to performance based courses; including audio and visual submissions and peer review. This is an anecdotal take on the Canvas environment from an educational technology team who have developed and supported its use for new distance courses, and as such would be of benefit to others thinking of using the <b>Canvas</b> <b>platform.</b> Johnson, D.

5000|$|In the Middle Ages, {{domestic}} interiors {{were becoming}} {{more comfortable and}} upholstery was playing {{an important part in}} interior decoration. The decorations consisted mainly of what we would now consider as [...] "soft furnishings", though there were simple <b>platforms</b> of webbing, <b>canvas</b> or leather for stools, chairs and elaborately decorated coverings that already demonstrated the rudimentary beginnings of upholstered furniture. By the beginning of the 17th century chair seats were being padded, but this form of upholstery was still fairly basic. All sorts of stuffings from sawdust, grass, feathers, to deer, goat or horsehair were used, although in England the Livery Company forbade the use of goat and deer hair and imposed fines for misdemeanors. The stuffing was heaped on a wooden platform and held in place with a decorative top fabric and nails. This produced a simple dome shape sloping towards the seat. Only {{towards the end of the}} 17th century did upholsterers start to develop the techniques that would distribute and shape the stuffing into more controlled shapes. Curled horsehair was being used more consistently for stuffing that was easier to hold in place with stitches in twine that were developed from saddlery techniques. Thus layers of stuffing could be distributed evenly and secured to stay in place. On a basic level, squab cushions were made more stable by using tufting ties. Stuffed edge rolls appeared on seat fronts providing support for cushions to be retained and later for deeper stuffing to be held in place under a fixed top cover.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 June 2010, Neil Berkett {{revealed}} to The Guardian that [...] "Far {{from trying to}} block {{the development of these}} open standards, we have offered to work commercially with Canvas to explore mutually beneficial ways in which we could incorporate them as a self-contained service in the next generation of Virgin Media set-top boxes." [...] Berkett went on to explain his opposition to the project; [...] "The Canvas consortium has rejected the opportunity to incorporate Canvas into the Virgin Media customer experience, insisting that if we want to use their standards we must also accept that the entire Virgin Media entertainment service be accessed by our subscribers via a Canvas-imposed interface, including the Canvas channel listing and search facility. This [...] "shop window" [...] to services would be entirely controlled by the joint venture partners and would allow the Canvas partners to give preference and prominence to their own channel content above that of any other content provider. At this point, Canvas starts to look less like a set of genuinely [...] "open" [...] standards and more like a fully-fledged competing distribution platform from which established pay TV operators are effectively excluded, along with other innovative platforms offering a differentiated user experience, such as the PS3 and the Xbox. Unless we accept the Canvas consortium's conditions, people who want both Canvas and a pay TV service will have to buy two set-top boxes. Far from simplifying the digital world, Canvas will complicate it." [...] On the BBC's involvement Berkett said: [...] "Quite rightly, much attention has been focused on whether the BBC should be using the licence fee to bank-roll such a controversial intervention in a dynamic market. And it's true that many private sector companies are already investing precious capital in [...] "connected TV". But it's the closed nature of the <b>Canvas</b> <b>platform</b> which gives the BBC's involvement significance. A set of standards that are genuinely open to all and to which the BBC has contributed is one thing. A proprietary gateway to the digital world, underpinned by the formidable brand and marketing muscle of the BBC, is quite another." ...|$|R
