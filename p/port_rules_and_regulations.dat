40|$|Background: Substantial {{empirical}} {{research has shown}} conflicting results regarding the influence of organizational external factors on construction risk management, suggesting the necessity to introduce a moderator into the study. The present research confirmed whether <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> matter on the relationships between organizational external factors and construction risk management. Methods: Based on discouragement and organizational control theory, this research {{examined the effects of}} organizational external factors <b>and</b> <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> on construction risk management among 238 employees operating in construction companies in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria. A personally administered questionnaire was used to acquire the data. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results: A significant positive relationship between organizational external factors and construction risk management was asserted. This study also found a significant positive relationship between <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> construction risk management. As anticipated, <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> were found to moderate the relationship between organizational external factors and construction risk management, with a significant positive result. Similarly, a significant interaction effect was also found between <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> organizational external factors. Implications of the research from a Nigerian point of view have also been discussed. Conclusion: Political, economy, and technology factors helped the construction companies to reduce the chance of risk occurrence during the construction activities. <b>Rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> also helped to lessen the rate of accidents involving construction workers as well as the duration of the projects. Similarly, the influence of the organizational external factors with <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> on construction risk management has proven that most of the construction companies that implement the aforementioned factors have the chance to deliver their projects within the stipulated time, cost, and qualities, which {{can be used as a}} yardstick to measure a good project...|$|R
