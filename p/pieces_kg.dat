40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} emerges after {{comparing the}} effects of some action with the efforts needed to produce it and has general applicability in decision-making in any country. It {{can be said that}} economic efficiency is closely related to the use of resources in the economy and its essential feature is the stress/effects causal ratio. In the competitive system of the free market, the activity of the economic agents provides performance {{to the extent that it}} has a high efficiency. Any human activity is, at the same time, resources consuming and effects producing. In the economic theory, the concept of efficiency characterizes the activity developed in various fields: economic, social, educational, health, sports, etc. More concretely, it reflects the physical, intellectual and moral (in the deontological sense) effort made to achieve a goal or the pre-established objective, respectively the relationship between two waves: the resources spent and the resulting effects, expressed in physical (<b>pieces,</b> <b>kg,</b> and meter) or value (lei) units of measurement...|$|E

The complete proceedings of this special session are available ([URL] through the Aquaculture & Fisheries Collaborative Research Support Program gender web site, ([URL] study evaluated the Philippine tilapia supply chain including the roles of key actors, logistical issues, external influences, and transaction flows among market levels. It identified improvement areas and provided recommendations for the industry. Key players include hatcheries, nurseries, commercial/small-scale farmers, consumers and institutional buyers. Pampanga, Batangas and Laguna are major tilapia sources while Metro Manila, Angeles and Baguio are the major demand centers. Dagupan is the major tilapia transshipment point for Northern Luzon. Many farmers employ a 'circuitous' production technique to meet markets' preferences. Direct buying and selling at central markets are the common operations of the tilapia industry. Consumers generally prefer whole live fish with size from 250 - 300 grams per fish. The requirements of institutional buyers are more varied. Filleted tilapia requires about 2 - 3 <b>pieces</b> per <b>kg.</b> High costs of logistics and transactions; lack of cold storage and transport vehicles; and meeting delivery requirements are the major concerns of nurseries, farmers and traders. Irregular supply of desired quality and volume of tilapia, limited capital for expansion, and predatory market practices are the main concerns of processors. Some recommendations to address the issues and concerns, are: encourage the establishment of more nurseries while intensifying technology transfer to farmers; conduct promotions for niche opportunities of tilapia; motivate small farmers to link with supply chains through an incentive mix; institutionalize an accreditation program for feed manufacturers, hatcheries, processors, etc.; and provide capital windows to improve facilities and reduce logistics and transaction costs in the entire supply chain...|$|R

The silicate inclusions possess a chondritic mineralogy and relict chondrules occur throughout the inclusions. Major element analysis, oxygen isotopic analysis (D 17 O = 0. 71 0. 02 &), and mean Fa and Fs molar contents (Fa 15. 7 0. 4 and Fs 14. 4 0. 5) indicate that MD originated as an H chondrite.

30|$|Flammability of {{the leaves}} was {{determined}} by methods modified from Taylor and Fonda (1990). Forty samples per species per month were burned in the laboratory {{for a total of}} 880 burns. Our fuel bed for each burn was composed of a sample of leaves weighed out to 10.00 g to 10.09 g and arranged so they would fit within a 25 cm × 25 cm area on a 35 cm × 35 cm flat metal tray, and all fuel beds were < 4 cm deep. Fuel beds did vary over the sample time; earlier in the sample period fuel beds were thicker and less compact due to leaf size (3 cm to 4 cm deep). As time from leaf fall increased, leaves were often broken and more decomposed, which made the fuel beds more compact and thinner (2 cm to 3 cm deep). Each prepared sample was placed under a 62 cm × 98 cm laboratory fume hood with the vent running. Four 25 cm long <b>pieces</b> of 1.4 <b>kg</b> cotton string were soaked in xylene and placed overlapping each other on top of the sample, and within 2 cm of the sample edge, to achieve ignition. The string was ignited at a single point and the fume hood door closed. Initially the twine was placed under the samples, as described by Taylor and Fonda (1990), but consistent and even ignition of the samples could not be obtained using this method. A type K thermocouple of 24 AWG insulated wire was positioned 10 cm above the center of the tray then attached to a ExTech™ EasyView 15 thermometer datalogger (FLIR Commercial Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire, USA) to record maximum and average burn temperatures (average of temperature from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember). In the darkened laboratory, flame time (time from ignition to extinction of last flame) and total burn time (time from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember) was recorded with a stopwatch. From these two readings we determined ember time (time from the extinction of last flame to the extinction of last glowing ember). After the sample had completed combustion, the percent consumption of the sample was determined by weighing the remaining residue. Individual leaf weights were determined just prior to burning by randomly selecting and weighing 50 individual leaves by species from each sample for each collection period (n = 1110).|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Milkfish is an {{economically}} important fish cultured {{in many countries}} in Asia. In Thailand, milkfish culture has not been given much attention and has not as been developed as in the other Asian countries because {{in the past the}} farmers prefer to grow shrimps and other high value fishes. Nowadays, environmental changes and degradation can affect water resources as well as the important aquaculture species that thrive in them hence the Thai Department of Fisheries recognizes the importance of developing aquaculture that is environment-friendly. This includes milkfish in particular because milkfish meat tastes good, easy to manage on farm, grows rapidly and can be grown in sea water, brackish or even freshwater. Milkfish farming is a low cost operation because milkfish feed mainly on algae and organic matter and these are natural food produced from other types of aquaculture activities. Milkfish can therefore be co-cultured with other species and are capable of reducing the amount of organic material from the process of aquaculture before entering the environment. In 2002, milkfish was first bred successfully through hormone injection and later broodstock mated naturally in Thailand. At present, production of the 1 -inch milkfish has reached 1, 000, 000 per year. The culture sites are in the southern and eastern parts of the country, in brackish and salty areas. Culture methods are either monoculture or polyculture with other species such as shrimp, mussel etc. Milkfish culture in reservoirs last from 6 to 12 months when fish size is about 500 g or two <b>pieces</b> to a <b>kg.</b> and the price is about 50 baht/ kg. On the other hand, milkfish that are 600 - 1, 000 g can sell at 65 - 90 baht/kg. Apart from culture, processing as well as marketing promotion of milkfish has also started in Thailand. Milkfish processing training is being conducted at least 2 times a year. As for the marketing initiatives, there is a move for the milkfish to be declared the symbol of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province since it was here that the fish was first found naturally in Thailand. This, apart from the plan to promote milkfish in the festivals throughout the country. Although found promising, some problems in the Thai milkfish industry are also recognized. Such issues notwithstanding, the Thai Department of Fisheries is coming up with guidelines for milkfish aquaculture as it is optimistic that this commodity shall open the doors to a new alternative industry in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Overall Aim To {{develop a}} robust system for identifying, testing, {{multiplying}} and marketing cereal varieties, lines, mixtures and populations {{best suited to}} organic production {{in different parts of}} the country. Objectives 1. 	Develop a participatory research and development methodology for UK organic farmers using variety trialling and the management of seed-borne disease as examples. 2. 	Collect information on the range of cereal varieties currently grown by organic farmers to help identify the major priorities and constraints among the varieties available. 3. 	Establish a pilot programme of cereal variety trials with organic farmers on organic farms using the methodology developed by Objective 1. 4. 	To obtain information on which seed-borne diseases, including ergot, may cause problems in the organic seed production chain of wheat, barley, oats and triticale, and to examine any relationship between organic husbandry conditions (seed rate, sowing date, rotation etc.) and incidence/severity of disease. 5. 	Determine whether cultivars with good potential for organic production are resistant to one or more of the seed-borne disease problems. 6. 	Working with farmers (Objective 1), review and identify a range of organically acceptable seed treatments and processes, considering both chemical and physical methods, and test these under organic conditions to determine efficacy. 7. 	Formulate a code of best practice for the production of certified organic seed, and for the processing of seed on organic farms. 8. 	To evaluate the participatory research and development approach throughout the entire research process and produce guidelines and materials for best practice. Data will be collected throughout the duration of the project. Objective 1. A literature review was undertaken and an agenda for future research set out. Questions to be addressed included: Have we identified the research that farmers and other stakeholders want? What roles do farmers and other stakeholders play? How do we carry out the testing, adaptation and development of options? How can the effective forms of participatory research (if there are any) be ‘mainstreamed’ into other agricultural research? Existing systems of farmer involvement in research were also examined through interviews with farmers, agri-businesses and scientists. It was found that almost all farmers were carrying out some kind of research on their farm. This may be using scientific methods or using a more holistic approach with multiple criteria. Farmers may set hypotheses explicitly before starting the experiment or they may use gut feelings and be experimenting without acknowledging it. They also often changed treatments during the experiment. It was concluded that the best results are more likely to come when topics are addressed by combining farmers’ own research with research on farms controlled and managed by scientists. From discussions with various farmer groups and the previous experience of Elm Farm Organic Research Centre researchers, it was decided that: the project should focus on winter wheat; and the basic experimental protocol must be simple, be able to be undertaken by the farmer with their own machinery and within the farmers’ time constraints. A protocol was established and reviewed each year at annual post harvest review meetings. Objective 2. Planting data was collected from the members of the Organic Arable Marketing Group in the first year of the project. Hereward and Claire were the most popular winter wheat varieties grown, and this was confirmed by a survey of the farmers involved in this project. A major concern of farmers was achieving milling quality specifications (especially protein concentration). Objective 3. Plots of three bread making winter wheat varieties (Hereward, Solstice and Xi 19) and a mixture (1 : 1 : 1) of the varieties were grown at up to 19 UK farms in two seasons (2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05). Measurements were taken of growth habit, yield and grain quality. Grain yields in both seasons showed significant site by variety interactions, although the variation among sites was greater than among varieties in both instances. Wheat grown at Western sites was significantly shorter and higher-yielding than that grown at Eastern sites in 2003 / 04 but significantly taller in 2004 / 05. As with grain yield, greater variation among sites than varieties was found in the Hagberg Falling Number and protein concentration results in both seasons. The results from the two years of trials illustrate the variability of organic systems and the difficulty in selecting a single wheat variety suitable for organic farms. Garlic oil was used as a seed treatment for Hereward on two of the sites in the second year of trials. However, the treatment had no effect on establishment of the variety, and yields were variable. Benchmarking data was collected from 24 farms. Exsept appeared to be the highest yielding variety and yields varied with soil type (silts>clays>sands). More data would be needed to give an accurate picture of organic yields across the country. Objective 4. A total of 676 samples were tested between 2002 and 2005. Treatment thresholds for wheat seed have recently been extensively investigated and revised, producing a safe level below which untreated seed could be sown. Results showed that most samples had higher health status than the conventional treatment thresholds. However, there were occasional problems, most notably in the case of bunt on wheat, where very high levels of infection were seen, and the seed would have been unsuitable for further multiplication as seed, or for ware production. It was not possible to relate these occurrences consistently with any particular farm practice, with the possible exception of one site where minimum tillage was used, and the crop was always a second wheat. Ergot (Claviceps purpurea) was present at high levels (e. g. over 50 <b>pieces</b> per <b>kg</b> of seed) in several samples, but ergot infestation has also been increasing in frequency and severity in conventional production recently. Microdochium nivale sometimes reached high levels on wheat seed in seasons favourable to the disease, but similar levels were also seen in conventional samples received for testing at NIAB. Objective 5. Tests on appropriate varieties were carried out in 2 years. Of the wheat varieties: Hereward and Solstice appeared to show ‘resistance’ to bunt although the nature of the resistance is not known; Exsept, was consistently more resistant to Microdochium in the ear than other varieties; and Claire, Deben and Nijinsky appeared to be more resistant to loose smut than other varieties. There has been little effort to breed for seed borne disease resistance but these results indicate that it should be possible to introduce resistance, especially for diseases like loose smut. Objective 6. Seed treatment trials were carried out in 2004 and 2005 and comprised examples of biological, micronutrient and physical treatments. None of the treatments used in 2004 significantly improved establishment when wheat seed had a high level (30...|$|R
