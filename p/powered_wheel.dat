50|$|Very small {{airplanes}} may {{be moved}} by human power alone. The airplane may be pushed or pulled by landing gear, wing struts, or even the propeller blades, since they're known to {{be strong enough to}} drag the airplane through the air. To allow for turns, a person may either pick up or push down on the tail to raise either the nose wheel or tail wheel off the ground, then rotate the airplane by hand. A less cumbersome method involves attaching a short tow bar to either the nose wheel or tail wheel, which provides a solid handhold and leverage to steer with, as well as eliminates the danger of handling the propeller. These tow bars are usually a lightweight aluminum alloy construction which allows them to be carried on board the airplane. Other small tow bars have a <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> to help move the airplane, with power sources as diverse as lawnmower engines or battery-operated electric drills. However, powered tow bars are usually too large and heavy to be practically carried on small airplanes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> {{chair is}} a mobility-aided device {{for persons with}} moderate/severe {{physical}} disabilities or chronic diseases {{as well as the}} elderly. In order to take care for different disabilities, various kinds of interfaces have been developed for powered wheelchair control; such as joystick control, head control and sip-puff control. Many people with disabilities do not have the ability to control <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> chair using the above mentioned interfaces. The proposed model is a possible alternative. In this paper, we use the optical-type eye tracking system to control <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> chair. User‘s eye movement are translated to screen position using the optical type eye tracking system. When user looks at appropriate angle, then computer input system will send command to the software based on the angle of rotation of pupil i. e., when user moves his eyes balls up (move forward), left (move left), right (move right) in all other cases wheel chair will stop. Once the image has been processed it moves onto the second part, our microprocessor. The microprocessor will take a USB output from the laptop and convert the signal into signals that will be sent to the wheelchair wheels for movement. Also, the pressure and object detection sensors will be connected to our microprocessor to provide necessary feedback for proper operation of the wheelchair system. The final part of the project is the wheelchair itself. The rear wheels will provide forward. The front two wheels will be used for steering left and right. All four wheels will be connected to our microprocessor that will send signals to control the wheels and thus the overall movement...|$|E

40|$|While {{the impact}} of "human error" on {{failures}} of complex human-technology systems has widely been demonstrated and accepted, the relevance of situational and task-related characteristics on human performance {{has not yet been}} considered sufficiently. For this purpose and on the example of electrically <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> chair control this paper analyzes the effects of situational characteristics (e. g., turns to the left/right in the backward/forward driving mode) on {{the impact of}} fine motor abilities on human performance. A study with 23 participants is described in the paper, during which relevant data such as the subjects' precision and aiming capacity, the number of collisions caused while driving as an indicator for human performance, and the situational characteristics were measured. The data analyses demonstrate an influence of especially the number of turns driven to the right in the backward mode on the impact of the precision ability on the number of safety-critical collisions. The results highlight the necessity not only to develop a wheelchair system which is adaptable to the user’s fine motor abilities, but also to the situational characteristics in order to increase the dependability of the human-technology system at hand...|$|E

40|$|Many {{products}} {{are designed to}} be hand operated in use. These extend from industrial machine tools to domestic appliances. In these the designer has to rely upon experience and ergonomic guidelines to ensure that the final product is comfortable, usable and not dangerous when in use. In order to aid in this problem a computer-based manikin has been created to investigate the posture of humans, which now incorporates the movements of the hand. This creates a number of difficulties, which extend from the large number of degrees of freedom to those of redundancy and interaction. In representing such hand movements within a modelling environment it is necessary to firstly understand the natural motions and to then represent then in a realistic manner. Whilst some of the responses are required to form contact with surfaces, to affect a grip or reaction, others are the responses arising from the interaction between the fingers. Other more complex actions require both combinations and sequences of grip actions to achieve the desired action. Many of these actions have been explored in order that the hands of the manikin can be instructed to undertake a range of activities extending from simply that of pointing at an object through to gripping, such as occurs when a manually <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> chair is in use...|$|E

This work is to provide ergonomic constraints for user’s maximum comfort while dealing with various body movements like sitting, lying and lifting. The final output is a wheelchair with very simple mechanism which gives the facility to lie down by reclining the chair backwards and lift upto the desired level with maximum upto standing height. Apart from this simple mechanism ergonomic constraints have been given so that patient can avoid large pressure on body parts allowing body flexibility...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the slip}} {{indicator}} {{was designed and}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor <b>powered</b> <b>wheel</b> during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip draft control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip draft control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|E
