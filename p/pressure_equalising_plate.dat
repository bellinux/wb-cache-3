40|$|Substitution {{of ammonia}} by methyl amine is {{proposed}} in neutral gas absorption refrigeration units using hydrogen as the <b>pressure</b> <b>equalising</b> gas. The throttling {{process of the}} conventional refrigeration units is being replaced by the diffusion of evaporated methyl amine through the hydrogen atmosphere. Accurate knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the working fluids, as well as heat and mass transfer characteristics, are required {{in the design of}} these units. This work reports an algorithm for the 'psychrometric problem', i. e. for the determination of the mass fraction of the methyl amine/hydrogen gas mixture from known 'dry' and 'wet' bulb temperatures. The values of the mixture's mass fraction are computed for various combinations of 'dry' and 'wet' bulb temperatures, due to analytical correlations concerning the thermodynamic and transport properties presented by this paper. The final results are given in psychrometric charts for pressures from 17. 5 bar to 27. 5 bar and temperatures between - 30 and 50 degrees C. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R
25|$|Patients {{inside the}} chamber may notice {{discomfort}} inside their ears as a pressure difference develops between their middle ear and the chamber atmosphere. This can be relieved by ear clearing using the Valsalva maneuver or other techniques.

5000|$|Windblast {{is common}} in {{longwall}} coal mines, especially those whose roof strata are competent, and do not cave immediately behind the roof supports as the face advances. This results in the tendency for a large void to be created behind the roof supports in the goaf (or gob) which collapses when the overlying cantilevered strata can no longer support its own weight. When the collapse occurs, the air or gas occupying the void is displaced by rock, resulting in a pressure wave and windblast that propagates along the roadways (tunnels) of the mine. This may {{be followed by a}} [...] "suck back" [...] as the air <b>pressure</b> is <b>equalised</b> with the low pressure created higher up in the goaf.|$|R

50|$|Cabin {{doors are}} {{designed}} to make it nearly impossible to lose pressurization through opening a cabin door in flight, either accidentally or intentionally. The plug door design ensures that when the pressure inside the cabin exceeds the pressure outside the doors are forced shut and will not open until the <b>pressure</b> is <b>equalised.</b> Cabin doors, including the emergency exits, but not all cargo doors, open inwards, or must first be pulled inwards and then rotated {{before they can be}} pushed out through the door frame because at least one dimension of the door is larger than the door frame. Pressurization apparently prevented the doors of Saudia Flight 163 from being opened on the ground after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing, resulting in the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew members from fire and smoke.|$|R
50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the <b>pressure</b> is <b>equalised,</b> taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R
50|$|Bolton's next {{match was}} away to Nottingham Forest after falling behind to an Andy Reid {{goal in the}} 59th minute, Bolton survived heavy <b>pressure</b> and <b>equalised</b> through Craig Davies' second goal in as many matches in the 77th minute. The match {{finished}} level despite Marcos Alonso being sent off for two bookable offences with ten minutes remaining to prevent returning Forest manager Billy Davies from starting his second spell in charge with a win. Against another of Brian Clough's former sides, Derby County, Bolton took the lead {{late in the first}} half with a headed goal that was initially attributed to Craig Dawson but was later given as an own goal by Derby captain Richard Keogh. Bolton could not hold on to their lead, however, and conceded to another headed goal in the 81st minute; Jamie Ward's tenth goal of the season. The draw left Bolton four points from the relegation zone and 12 points from the play-off positions.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams. Once the collar is in between the rams, the upper rams are closed and <b>pressure</b> is <b>equalised</b> either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the rams.|$|R
50|$|The {{loudspeaker}} driver's {{moving mass}} and compliance (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's resonant frequency (Fs). In {{combination with the}} damping properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (Fc), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position {{in the absence of}} a signal. A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air. The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external <b>pressures</b> can <b>equalise</b> over time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow pressure equalisation.|$|R

50|$|Trevithick's {{response}} was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one {{of which could be}} adjusted by the operator. The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole {{at the top of the}} boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam <b>pressure</b> was <b>equalised</b> by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever. The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.|$|R

This was an important starting point because various suppliers of roof tiles and fittings assess their products {{on the basis of this}} method, both domestically and throughout Europe.

CEN/TR 15601 has been designed such that a test product is validated against a reference product. Within this assessment method, a product/system is assessed in terms of application in the project to be realised; it is region-dependent (Netherlands wind region) and can thus be checked against Bouwbesluit 2012. The assessment method is also suitable for prototype research in order to determine the maximum building height and wind region for which a system can be used. The assessment method consists of: 1. Determining the quantity of water that has penetrated the outer permeable layer in an established (rain and wind) climate; 3. Classifying the quantity of penetrating water; 4. Assessing the inner layer on the basis of the quantity of water that has penetrated the outer layer. The assessment of the outer layer is consistent with CEN/TR 15601, except for the fact that the assessment does not involve a reference model but instead an absolute quantity of penetrating water at a fixed difference in pressure in relation to an applicable project. Definitive values of the quantities of penetrating water must be established on a reference test surface to be determined by the industry.

Methods:The hospital records of 108 patients with carotid subclavian transposition were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative symptoms, Doppler examination, arteriography, blood pressure differentials and postoperative complications. Long-term patency and symptoms were determined during a follow-up examination including a history, physical examination, blood pressure differentials, Doppler examinations and arteriography in selected cases.

There was no mortality, blood <b>pressure</b> differentials were <b>equalised</b> in all patients without any early reocclusions. The complication rate was 15 % with a permanent morbidity of 3 %. Eighty-four patients (77 %) could be re-examined during follow-up. For them the overall patency after a mean observation period of 70 months (1 – 144 months) was 100 %.

40|$|Offshore piles are {{subjected}} to complex loading regimes, which include both rapidly applied static and cyclic loads. This note describes an experimental investigation conducted {{in order to assess}} the factors influencing the response of offshore piles to these loading conditions. The tests were performed using instrumented model piles installed in soft clay. During cyclic loading, the piles demonstrated a transition from stable to unstable behaviour when the applied loads reached a specific load threshold. Stable behaviour was defined when increments of plastic displacement decreased as the number of load cycles increased. During stable behaviour, radial effective stresses at the pile-soil interface remained constant. During unstable behaviour, pore pressures at the pile-soil interface rose as the number of cycles increased. This resulted in reduced radial effective stresses and progressively increasing displacement rates. Due to the presence of these excess pore pressures, the shaft resistance recorded during static load tests, performed after a period of unstable cyclic loading, were lower than those measured on piles where the pore <b>pressure</b> was fully <b>equalised.</b> However, the axial resistance was seen to be rate dependent. Fast loading of the pile resulted in reductions of pore water pressure at the soil-pile interface and enhanced shaft resistance which could overcome the negative effect caused by cyclic loading...|$|R

[...] The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while <b>equalising</b> <b>pressure</b> in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap {{at the back of the}} head for stability and comfort.|$|R
5000|$|Onduparaka FC {{lost in the}} 42nd Uganda Cup Final by 3-1 to Vipers SC at Nakivubo Stadium on Saturday 18 June 2016 but won a lot of {{popularity}} even before their first AUPL match. One of the club's targets in its maiden season was to avoid relegation {{and by the end}} of the first round of matches, Onduparaka had climbed to the Top 4 bracket. The last time an upcountry team won the league was in 1999 by Dairy Heroes from Mbale and fans hoped Onduparaka would be next or even pull off a promotion miracle like Leicester FC had just done in England. They started the season with a goalless draw against Soana, then lost to Bright Stars before drawing again on 6 September 2016, this time with Express FC, the Oldest Team in the league. The fourth game was against defending champions KCCA who had won all their first three games. Ondu needed a quick second half brace by Muhammad Shaban to inflict the first season loss to the 11-time champions on Friday 9 September 2016 at Greenlight Stadium. Despite a late onslaught, the visitors only managed a consolation goal; that was Onduparaka's first Uganda Premier League win. On Saturday 1 October 2016, SC Villa - the Most Successful Club in Ugandan Football scored first, then the Newcomers from Arua crawled back scoring three through Caesar Okhuti, Wahab Ajuman Gadafi and the leading Azam Uganda Premier League Top Scorer at that time Muhammad Shaban. The visitors fought back from 3-1 down until they equalised via a penalty netted by Tabu Vitalis (a former Onduparaka Captain) but Shaban had the last laugh with his second of the game. The match took place at Greenlight Stadium. Ondu couldn't be bullied by the Jogoos. A week before, Ondu had handcuffed Police FC 2-1 on the same ground (with goals by Shaban and Kabon). Three days prior to Ondu ending Villa's Unbeaten Run of the Season, FUFA cleared 26 year old Caesar Okhuti to play for the Northwesterners who sat at 5th on the table; he was on a six-month loan from KCCA since the middle of September. On Saturday 10 December 2016, Ondu beat Sadolin FC 1-0 at Bugembe Stadium to climb to 3rd place around half season courtesy of a Gaddafi free-kick. Ondu's leading goalscorer Muhammad Shaban (aka Ijagason) was voted the 2016 FUFA MVP (Most Valuable Player) in a year when Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango also performed well and actually won the CAF Best Player in Africa Award and Farouk Miya scored the goal against Comoros that took Uganda to the tournament. In 2017, the three travelled to Gabon for AFCON; Onyango only played in the two narrow 0-1 defeats to Ghana and Egypt. Shaban came on as a substitute in both games while Miya was substituted but scored Uganda's only goal in the third game; Uganda drew 1-1 with Mali in the third group game to register at least a point after a 39-year absence from the continental showpiece. Also on Onduparaka's squad is KCCA loanee Caesar Okhuti who is no stranger to being a hot newcomer especially after he took the nation by storm with another Arua club called Ediofe Hills FC in 2007 and was called up to the national team. Other players on the 2017 Onduparaka team include: Richard Anyama (goalkeeper formerly at Saints FC), Nisar Kasim (another Goalkeeper), Alex Gasper Adriko (aka The Rock), Norman Saddam, Rashid Toha, Gibson Adinho, Akram Kakembo, Ivan Mbowa, Ibrahim Faizul (aka Anini), Sabir Simba, Dickens Okwir, Mohammad Rashid, Ajobe Toto, Denis Andama, Rashid Agau, Living Kabon, Wahab Ajuman Gaddafi Gadinho and Fahd Muhammad Toko. On Friday 17 February 2017, Azam TV broadcast a live game from Onduparaka's Greenlight Stadium for the first time. Kabon Living known as Messi, clad in a number 13 shirt scored the only goal of the game from a Shaban assist in the 88th minute to give Ondu a win over Kirinya Jinja SS. Kabon took off his shirt, somersaulted in the goal celebration and got a yellow card for indecency but his goal leapfrogged Ondu to 3rd place next to SC Villa and KCCA. They dropped points with humiliating away defeats to KCCA (7-0 at the Phillip Omondi Stadium in Lugogo - Record Biggest Loss in Uganda Premier League - Caesar Okhuti, loaned to Ondu by KCCA missed the match) and SC Villa (4-1 at Masaka Recreation Ground) but bounced back. Starting the day in 6th place on Saturday 1 April 2017 with a chance to climb to 4th with a win at Kakindu Stadium in Jinja after Vipers SC had already lost to a different Jinja side, Gaddafi scored one of the Contenders for Goal of the Season against Jinja Municipal Council who salvaged a 1-1 draw. On Wednesday 5 April 2017, Muhammad Shaban's first half goal was enough to beat nine-man Lweza at Greenlight Stadium and end a three match winless streak. In their first international friendly of the season, Onduparaka beat Gor Mahia 2-0 at Mandela National Stadium Nambole on Saturday 4 February 2017. Kizza Besigye, the four time Runner-up in the Ugandan Presidential Elections, watched the game clad in a green jersey and offered Ondu 2 Million UgX. Then on Tuesday 21 February 2017, Onduparaka dressed in all white came from a goal down to beat Mbarara FC and advance to the Uganda Cup Round of 16. Airtel - FUFA MVP Shaban missed a penalty but Okhuti scored the winner in a 2-1 triumph at Kakyeka Stadium in Mbarara. On Sunday 26 March 2017, goals from Okhuti again and a returning Rashid Agau helped Ondu knock out Big League team Water FC and qualify for the quarterfinals. On Sunday 9 April 2017, Sadolin Paints FC knocked Onduparaka out of the Uganda Cup by 2-1 in Jinja. Nevertheless, Onduparaka's Greenlight Stadium was chosen to host the 43rd Uganda Cup Final (KCCA defeated Paidha Black Angels 2-0 in June 2017). In a UPL fixture twelve days later, the Painters left Onduparaka with a point after a 0-0 draw. According to Coach Livingstone Mbabazi, his side created the most chances in the league during the 2017 season. He added that his [...] "players don't fear big teams" [...] because they know that they are big too though recovering from a 2-1 loss to Soana where substitute Shaban scored the consolation on 29 April 2017. In fact, Ondu was one of the only two teams in the AUPL still unbeaten at home going into the Game Week 27 Fixture against Express FC on Friday 5 May 2017. Livingstone would miss Living Kabon suspended for three accumulated yellow cards and Akram Kakembo who had family issues. Sabir Simba meanwhile was recovering from malaria. Livingstone's first game as Onduparaka Coach was at Wankulukuku and ended 1-1. The return leg almost seemed to be heading in that direction with Express taking the lead through Didier Jean within the first halfhour after assistant captain Rashid Toha (towering defender nicknamed Per Mertesacker) slipped and Express capitalised. Ondu badly needed an equaliser after all their wasted chances; Muhammad Shaban hit the woodwork and missed other chances. Kickoff was in sunny weather but even the winds could not discourage lots of high balls. Then just before halftime, Dickens Okwir was fouled in the penalty box by the Express captain. Toha stepped up to score the equaliser in the 41st minute and redeem himself after sending the keeper the wrong way. In the second half, Coach Livingstone was restless on the touchline and urged his defence not to concede again. Rashid Agau excited the fans when he was called from the bench to warm up as a replacement for Caesar Okhuti, the Oldest Caterpillar. Fahd Toko meanwhile replaced Okwir less than 20 minutes from full-time. Express FC's Sulaiman Jjingo was the Shortest Player on the Pitch, shorter than Gaddafi but also served up great entertainment for the fans despite some bad throw-ins. Shaban played his heart out but it just wasn't his day to steal the show when he missed a good opportunity for the winner close to extratime. Four minutes were added and while the game seemed to be headed to a repeat of the first leg, Rashid Toha scored the winner in the 3rd additional minute to send the stadium into a glorious frenzy. As the celebrations waned, Agau - the substitute for Caesar Okhuti was substituted with Caesar Olega, a fairytale of two Caesars crossing the line before and after the winner. A few seconds later, the final whistle was blown. Coach Leo Adraa said that Ondu had more time to prepare unlike the Oldest Club in Ugandan football who were thumped four goals by Lweza in their previous game. Kampala musician Kalifah Aganaga who had a show in Arua that weekend was present donning a green Onduparaka jersey. Arua musician and producer King Weedah was also at the game. This win propelled the Caterpillars from 6th to 5th Position out of 16 above Express who remained with 40 points with three games left to the end of the season. Four points behind third-placed Vipers, the Caterpillars needed a win to reduce the gap to within one point. Fatefully, they were beaten 4-1 at the St. Mary's Kitende Stadium in Kajjansi on Tuesday 9 May 2017. The game was marred with violence. That same day, KCCA were crowned Champions for the second consecutive year. In the Last Home Game of the Season, Muhammad Shaban scored in the 16th minute but Saints FC equalised just before halftime. The army side needed only one point, that is a draw to be safe from relegation and leave the battle for survival to Lweza and Police; JMC Hippos had already been relegated. Caesar Okuti replaced Dickens Okwir in the second half while Denis Andama (aka Koko Makosa) later replaced Gasper. Saints goalie Alex Mugabi hit himself on the goalpost while trying to save a goal attempt and seriously needed medical attention; he was stretchered off and replaced by Harrison Sempajji who made a number of saves from rejuvenated Onduparaka attacks. Mohammad Rashid was replaced with Rashid Agau, the darling of Ondu fans and minutes later, Kabon Living was fouled in the penalty box. Captain Rashid Toha stepped up to convert the spotkick. Close to the end of normal time, Richard Anyama in the Ondu goal who had been transferred from Saints in January (along with Ivan Mbowa) conceded the second equaliser from a freekick. It seemed like the visitors were safe but after the four additional minutes were over, Kabon also known as Messi scored and relegated the Saints. Armymen cocked their guns while disgruntled visiting fans and officials pursued the referee plus his linesmen. After the chaos subsided minutes later, the game resumed until the 100th minute but Ondu still maintained their Unbeaten Record at home in their maiden top flight season. The last team to defeat them at Greenlight Stadium was Nebbi Central three years behind. In the final game of the season at Kakindu Stadium in Jinja, Dickens Okwir put Ondu ahead in the 28th minute while BUL FC had a goal disallowed immediately after. However, after some <b>pressure,</b> the hosts <b>equalised</b> in the 57th minute. This season finale in which Ibrahim Faizul was redcarded ended 1-1. Since Express and Soana - the nearest two challengers drew 2-2, Onduparaka ended their first Azam Uganda Premier League season in 5th place on 45 points. Despite a negative Goal Difference having scored 33 and conceded 41 (the bulk was against the eventual Champions KCCA), Ondu managed 11 wins, 12 draws and 7 losses in 30 games. At the Uganda Premier League Awards on Wednesday 27th July 2017, Muhammad Shaban was included in the Azam UPL Team of the Year. Each player in the list receives 250,000 UgX courtesy of Betway. Meanwhile, Ondu fans were voted the Best Fans in the same gala at Imperial Royale (Kampala).|$|R
