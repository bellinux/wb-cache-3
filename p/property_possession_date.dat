40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new metaphysical theory of {{material}} objects. On our theory, objects are bundles of property instances, where those properties give the nature or essence of that object. We call the theory essential bundle theory. <b>Property</b> <b>possession</b> is not analysed as bundle-membership, as in traditional bundle theories, since accidental properties {{are not included in}} the object’s bundle. We have a different story to tell about accidental <b>property</b> <b>possession.</b> This move reaps many benefits. Essential bundle theory delivers a simple theory of the essential properties of material objects; an explanation of how object coincidence can arise; an actual-world ground for modal differences between coincident objects; a simple story about intrinsic properties; and a plausible account of certain ubiquitous cases of causal overdetermination...|$|R
