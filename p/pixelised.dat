50|$|The HEALPix {{projection}} is {{a general}} class of spherical projections, sharing several key properties, which map the 2-sphere to the Euclidean plane. Any of these can be followed by partitioning (<b>pixelising)</b> the resulting region of the 2-plane. In particular, when one of these projections (the H=4, K=3 HEALPix projection) {{is followed by a}} pixelisation of the 2-plane, the result is generally known as the HEALPix pixelisation, which is widely used in physical cosmology for maps of the cosmic microwave background. This pixelisation {{can be thought of as}} mapping the sphere to twelve square facets (diamonds) on the plane followed by the binary division of these facets into pixels, though it can be derived without using the projection. The associated software package HEALPix implements the algorithm. The HEALPix projection (as a general class of spherical projections) is represented by the keyword HPX in the FITS standard for writing astronomical data files. It was approved as part of the official FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) by the IAU FITS Working Group on April 26, 2006.|$|R

The PWF method allows us to obtain information about the presence of propagating and nonpropagating waves in the data and localise them precisely in time and in space. The method is tested on the data sets obtained in microwaves with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph and in the EUV with TRACE. The method reveals fine spatial structuring of the sources of 3 -, 5 -, and 15 -minute periodicities in the microwave and EUV emission generated in sunspot atmospheres. In addition, the PWF method provides us with unique information about the temporal variability of the power, amplitude, and phase narrowband maps of the observed oscillations and waves. The applicability of the method to the analysis of coronal wave phenomena is discussed. ...|$|E

30|$|The rise of deep {{generative}} models {{has sparked}} {{a strong interest}} in the field of astronomy. Deep generative models have been used to generate astronomical images of galaxies (Regier et al. 2015; Ravanbakhsh et al. 2017; Schawinski et al. 2017) or to recover certain features out of noisy astrophysical images (Schawinski et al. 2017). GANs were recently applied to generating samples of projected 2 D mass distribution, called convergence (Mustafa et al. 2017). This approach can generate random samples of convergence maps, which are consistent with the original simulated maps according to several summary statistics. The projection process, however, washes out the complex network structures present in the dark matter distribution. Here, we instead focus on generating the structure of the cosmic web without projection, therefore preserving the ability of the generative model to create halos, filaments, and sheets. We accomplish our goal by synthesizing thin slices of dark matter distribution which have been <b>pixelised</b> to create 2 D images that serve as training data for a GAN model.|$|E
3000|$|We created N-body {{simulations}} of cosmic structures in boxes of size 100 Mpc and 500 Mpc with 5123 and 10243 particles respectively. We used L-PICOLA (Howlett et al. 2015) to create 10 independent simulation boxes for both box sizes. The cosmological model used was ΛCDM (Cold Dark Matter) with Hubble constant H_ 0 = 100, h= 70  km s− 1  Mpc− 1, dark energy density _ = 0.72 and matter density [...] _m = 0.28. We used the particle distribution at redshift z= 0. We cut the boxes {{into thin slices}} to create grayscale, two-dimensional images of the cosmic web. This is accomplished by dividing the x-coordinates into uniform intervals to create 1000 segments. We then selected 500 non-consecutive slices and repeated this process for the y and z axes, which gave us 1500 samples {{from each of the}} 10 realizations, yielding a total of 15, 000 samples as our training dataset. We <b>pixelised</b> these slices into 256 × 256 pixel images. The value at each pixel corresponded to its particle count. After the pixelisation, the images are smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of one pixel. This step is done to decrease the particle shot noise.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpatial heterogeneity, in {{the wide}} sense of pattern {{complexity}} and variability, appears {{to be one of}} the dominant influences of ecological functions and processes. The most widely used quantification of heterogeneity in environmental studies is based on derived Shannon information theory indices. Yet, such heterogeneity index is not able to quantify the surface patterns of a landscape with a fully explicit scheme at each place and scale of the landscape. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology to bypass this disadvantage and to capture the local and scaling variations of the landscape. The method developed here combines a multiscale heterogeneity map (MHM) with a heterogeneity profile (HP) averaging at each place (respectively, at each scale) the spatial information contained in the landscape. Confidence levels have been estimated on the basis of a simple neutral landscape model to detect significant non-random heterogeneity fluctuations. This methodology is illustrated on both categorical (patchy) and continuous (<b>pixelised)</b> real landscapes: a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in Brittany and a spring phytoplankton bloom in north Atlantic. Heterogeneity analyses of both image types can simultaneously reveal subtle quantitative and qualitative features (gradients, boundaries, random or patchy patterns at successive scales) linked to ecological processes.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the physics of the cosmic {{microwave}} background anisotropies is most naturally expressed in Fourier space, <b>pixelised</b> maps are almost always used in the analysis and simulation of microwave data. A complementary approach is investigated here, in which maps are used only in the visualisation of the data, and the temperature anisotropies and polarization are only ever expressed in terms of their spherical multipoles. This approach has a number of advantages: there is no information loss (assuming a band-limited observation); deconvolution of asymmetric beam profiles and the temporal response of the instrument are naturally included; correlated noise can easily be taken into account, removing the need for additional ‘destriping’; polarization is also analysed in the same framework; and reliable estimates of the spherical multipoles of the sky and their errors are obtained directly for subsequent component separation and power spectrum estimation. The formalism required to analyse experiments which survey the full sky by scanning on circles is derived here, with particular emphasis on the Planck mission. A number of analytical results are obtained in the limit of simple scanning strategies. Although there are non-trivial computational obstacles to be overcome before the techniques described here can be implemented at high resolution, if these can be overcome the method should allow for a more robust return from the next generation of full-sky microwave background experiments...|$|E
40|$|Context. The cut-off {{frequency}} of magnetoacoustic gravity (MAG) waves could be decreased by the inclined magnetic field, and therefore, low-frequency waves could penetrate {{into the upper}} atmosphere. Aims. We observe {{the distribution of the}} {{cut-off frequency}} of compressive waves at various heights and reconstruct the magnetic field inclination, according to the MAG wave theory in a stratified atmosphere permeated by a uniform magnetic field. Methods. We analysed the emission intensity oscillations of sunspot AR 11131 (08 Dec. 2010) observed at the 1700 Å, 1600 Å, and 304 Å bandpasses of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and computed the narrow-band power maps with the <b>pixelised</b> wavelet filtering method. The distribution of the cut-off frequency was defined as the median contour in the azimuthally-averaged oscillation power. The magnetic field inclination was estimated with the local cut-off frequency according to the MAG wave theory in the low-β limit and was compared to the potential field extrapolation. Results. Shorter period oscillations dominate in the sunspot umbra, while longer period oscillations form an annular shape approximately concentric with the sunspot. Oscillations with longer periods are distributed further away from the sunspot centre. The 5 min oscillations appear to originate at or lower than the photosphere.

The cut-off frequency was defined as contours where the spectral power droped to the median level. It was measured {{as a function of}} the spatial location. We inferred the magnetic field inclination according to the MAG wave theory in the low-β limit and compared it with the potential field extrapolation. We analysed intensity oscillations in a symmetric sunspot AR 11131 (08 Dec 2010) and an asymmetric sunspot AR 11330 (27 Oct 2011). We reconstructed the magnetic field inclination in the radial direction for the symmetric sunspot and in both radial and azimuthal directions for the asymmetric sunspot. We observed 3 D variation of the main oscillation periods in sunspots. We found that shorter-period oscillations were mostly constrained in sunspot umbrae, while longer-period oscillations formed an annular shape enclosing the umbra. Longer periods are found to be distributed further away from the sunspot centre. Our results indicate that 3 -min oscillation are generated in the chromosphere, possibly by the acoustic resonator model, while 5 -min and longer-period oscillations seemed to originate in a level under the photosphere. The reconstructed field inclinations gives the values of the field inclination that are systematically larger than the values obtained by the potential field extrapolation. The inclined magnetic field line can account for 60 - 80...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} measure energy and fluence of neutron fields, with energy ranging from 8 keV to 1 MeV, a new primary {{standard}} {{is being developed}} at the IRSN (Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety). This project, micro-TPC (Micro Time Projection Chamber), carried out {{in collaboration with the}} LPSC, is based on the nucleus recoil detector principle. The measurement strategy requires track reconstruction of recoiling nuclei down to a few keV, which can be achieved with a low pressure gaseous detector using a micro-pattern gaseous detector. A gas mixture, mainly isobutane, is used as a n-p converter to detect neutrons into the detection volume. Then electrons, coming from the ionization of the gas by the proton recoil, are collected by the <b>pixelised</b> anode (2 D projection). A self-triggered electronics is able to perform the anode readout at a 50 MHz frequency in order to give the third dimension of the track. Then the scattering angle is deduced from this track using algorithms. The charge collection leads to the proton energy, taking into account the ionization quenching factor. This article emphasizes the neutron energy measurements of a monoenergetic neutron field produced at 127 keV. The measurements are compared to Monte Carlo simulations using realistic neutron fields and simulations of the detector response. The discrepancy between experiments and simulations is 5 keV mainly due to the calibration uncertainties of 10 %. Comment: Neudos 12 symposium proceeding. 4 page...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} object-oriented techniques for habitat classification based on remotely sensed images and ancillary data. The study reports the results of habitat mapping at multiple scales using Earth Observation (EO) data at various spatial resolutions and multi temporal acquisition dates. We investigate the role of object texture and context in classification {{as well as the}} value of integrating knowledge from ancillary data sources. Habitat maps were produced at regional and local scales in two case studies; Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and Wye Downs, United Kingdom. At the regional scale, the main task was the development of a consistent object-oriented classification scheme that is transferable to satellite images for other years. This is demonstrated for a time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes. At the local scale, investigations focus on the development of appropriate object-oriented rule networks for the detailed mapping of habitats, e. g. dry grasslands and wetlands using very high resolution satellite and airborne scanner images. The results are evaluated using statistical accuracy assessment and visual comparison with traditional field-based habitat maps. Whereas the application of traditional pixel-based classification result in a <b>pixelised</b> (salt and pepper) representation of land cover, the object-based classification technique result in solid habitat objects allowing easy integration into a vector-GIS for further analysis. The level of detail obtained at the local scale is comparable to that achieved by visual interpretation of aerial photographs or field-based mapping and also retains spatially explicit, fine scale information such as scrub encroachment or ecotone patterns within habitats...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new study}} aiming at constraining the gluon contribution Δ G to the 1 / 2 nucleon spin. The collinear pQCD theoretical framework, on which it is based, deals with asymmetries calculated from cross-sections for single inclusive hadron in the regime of quasi-real photoproduction Q^ 2 1 GeV/c). These calculations are done up to Next-to-Leading order with a foreseen inclusion of Next-to-Leading logarithm threshold gluon resummation, only performed for the unpolarised cross-sections yet. This makes the asymmetries sensitive to the gluon polarisation not only through Photon Gluon Fusion γ g but also through resolved γg processes such as qg or gg. The measurement of the asymmetries is performed for all the COMPASS data available from 2002 to 2011 with a polarised muon beam at 160 - 200 GeV scattered off a longitudinally polarised target of deuteron (_ 6 LiD for 2002 - 2006) or proton (NH_ 3 for 2007 and 2011). The asymmetries are presented in bins of pT and of pseudorapidity η_h(p_T ∈[1, 4] with _T^ 2 〉 = 3 (GeV/c) ^ 2, and η_h ∈ [- 0. 1, 2. 4]. Since the resummation calculations are not completed yet for the polarised case, the measurements are only compared with theoretical calculations using different parameterisation sets of polarised Parton Distribution Functions with a large range of different Δ G. This comparison is then {{used to evaluate the}} Δ G of these measurements. Complementary to this analysis, a study of new tracking detectors, the <b>pixelised</b> Micromegas, is performed.

40|$|ADC counts Figure 1 : ADC {{spectrum}} for a fibre detector with SSPM read-out fitted {{by physical}} model {{to determine the}} basic SSPM operation parameters. Solid state photomultipliers (SSPM) consist of a <b>pixelised</b> array of micrometric avalanche photodiodes connected in parallel. Despite the digital character of the signals from the individual pixels the device as a whole behaves analogically {{as long as the}} number of incoming photons remains small compared to the quantity of pixels. SSPM technology reduces even further the complexity and price of fibre tracking detectors by getting rid of voluminous high voltage power supplies and stiff cables used for conventional photomultipliers. In addition, such a detector will be insensitive to magnetic fields. The price to pay is a MHz dark count rate at room temperature. These events are generated by thermal electrons. Internal cross-talk between adjacent pixels can bring that noise to high amplitudes competing with real signals generated by a small number of photons. A small fibre barrel read-out by SSPM has been discussed as an option for a time-of-flight start detector in PANDA and as an active target for the hypernuclear physics programme in PANDA. Such a detector can be used for the particle identification, for a time reference for the DIRC detector, and for track deconvolution of the TP chamber [1]. The main purpose of the active hypernuclear target is the tracking and stopping of the produced Ξ hyperons and their decay products [1].

40|$|We analyse 3 -min {{oscillations}} of {{microwave and}} EUV emission generated at different heights of a sunspot atmosphere, studying the amplitude and frequency modulation of the oscillations, {{and its relationship}} with the variation of the spatial structure of the oscillations. High-resolution data obtained with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, TRACE and SDO/AIA are analysed {{with the use of the}} <b>Pixelised</b> Wavelet Filtering and wavelet skeleton techniques. 3 -min oscillations in sunspots appear in the form of repetitive trains of the duration 8 - 20 min (13 min in average). The typical interval between the trains is 30 - 50 min. The oscillation trains are transient in frequency and power. We detected a repetitive frequency drifts of 3 -min oscillations during the development of individual trains. Wavelet analysis shows three types of the frequency drift: positive, negative and fluctuations without drift. The start and end of the drifts coincide with the start time and end of the train. The comparative study of 3 -min oscillations in the sequences of microwave and EUV images show the appearance of new sources of the oscillations in sunspots during the development of the trains. These structures can be interpreted as waveguides that channel upward propagating waves, responsible for 3 -min oscillations. A possible explanation of the observed properties is the operation of two simultaneous factors: dispersive evolution of the upwardly-propagating wave pulses and the non-uniformity of the distribution of the oscillation power over the sunspot umbra with different wave sources corresponding to different magnetic flux tubes with different physical conditions and line-of-sight angles.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{presents}} a {{measurement of the}} Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect through cross-correlation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the galaxy distribution tracing the large scale structure of the Universe. The CMB data used are from the 2013 release from the Planck satellite, and the large-scale structure data are from the 2 MASS Photometric Redshift Catalogue (2 MPZ). The galaxy data were divided into redshift shells, and HEALPix was used to create <b>pixelised</b> maps of the CMB temperature anisotropies and the galaxy overdensity. The linear galaxy bias, relating the galaxy density distribution to the underlying matter density distribution, was measured through least squares fitting of the theoretical prediction of the galaxy auto-correlation function in each redshift shell. The bias values were then used to rescale the theoretical predictions for the matter-CMB crosscorrelation functions in each shell. The observed cross-correlation function between the Planck and 2 MPZ data in each shell was computed, and the uncertainties associated with each measurement were calculated using cross-correlation of simulated CMB and galaxy overdensity maps. To quantify the possible detection of the ISW effect, hypothesis testing was performed through computation of the covariance matrix and &# 967; 2 statistic in each shell. Detection of the ISW effect {{was found to be}} preferred over no detection in every case, with a total likelihood ratio of 3. 4 : 1. While this is not quite strong evidence of detection of the ISW effect, this ratio is more than twice better than previous measurements using photometric redshift shells. While the photometric redshifts in the 2 MPZ are more accurate than those that have been used before, a strong detection is out of reach with this data, as the redshifts in the 2 MPZ are too shallow for more decisive ISW detection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSimulations of {{artificial}} vision {{were performed to}} assess “minimum requirements for useful artificial vision”. Retinal prostheses will be implanted at a fixed (and probably eccentric) location of the retina. To mimic this condition on normal observers, we projected stimuli of various sizes and content on a defined stabilised area of the visual field. In experiment 1, we asked subjects to read isolated 4 -letter words presented at various degrees of pixelisation and at various eccentricities. Reading performance dropped abruptly {{when the number of}} pixels was reduced below a certain threshold. For central reading, a viewing area containing about 300 pixels was necessary for close to perfect reading (> 90 % correctly read words). At eccentricities beyond 10 °, close to perfect reading was never achieved even if more than 300 pixels were used. A control experiment using isolated letter recognition in the same conditions suggested that lower reading performance at high eccentricity was in part due to the “crowding effect”. In experiment 2, we investigated whether the task of eccentric reading under such specific conditions could be improved by training. Two subjects, naive to this task, were trained to read <b>pixelised</b> 4 -letter words presented at 15 ° eccentricity. Reading performance of both subjects increased impressively throughout the experiment. Low initial reading scores (range 6 %– 23 % correct) improved impressively (range 64 %– 85 % correct) after about one month of training (about 1 h/day). Control tests demonstrated that the learning process consisted essentially in an adaptation to use an eccentric area of the retina for reading. These results indicate that functional retinal implants consisting of more than 300 stimulation contacts will be needed. They might successfully restore some reading abilities in blind patients, even if they have to be placed outside the foveal area. Reaching optimal performance may, however, require a significant adaptation process...|$|E

Oscillations in the 3 min band dominate in the umbra. The integrated spectrum of umbral oscillations contains distinct narrowband peaks at 1. 9 min, 2. 3 min, and 2. 8 min. The power significantly varies in time, forming distinct oscillation trains. The oscillation power distribution over the sunspot in the horizontal plane {{reveals that the}} enhancements of the oscillation amplitude, or wave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed spiral and a stationary circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the umbra centre. This structure is seen from the temperature minimum to the corona. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front spirality is most pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations. In the low-amplitude phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2 D cross-correlation function shows that the oscillations at higher atmospheric levels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed {{is estimated to be}} about 100 km/s. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch corresponds to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight the lower-frequency oscillations in the 3 -min band. The vertical and horizontal radial structure of the oscillations is consistent with the model that interprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the atmospheric temperature non-uniformity {{in the presence of the}} magnetic field inclination from the vertical. The mechanism for the polar-angle structure of the oscillations, in particular the spirality of the wave fronts, needs to be revealed.

40|$|Reading of {{isolated}} words in conditions mimicking artificial vision {{has been found}} to be a difficult but feasible task. In particular at relatively high eccentricities, a significant adaptation process was required to reach optimal performances [Vision Res. 43 (2003) 269]. The present study addressed the task of full-page reading, including page navigation under control of subject's own eye movements. Conditions of artificial vision mimicking a retinal implant were simulated by projecting stimuli with reduced information content (lines of <b>pixelised</b> text) onto a restricted and eccentric area of the retina. Three subjects, naïve to the task, were trained for almost two months (about 1 h/day) to read full-page texts. Subjects had to use their own eye movements to displace a 10 degrees x 7 degrees viewing window, stabilised at 15 degrees eccentricity in their lower visual field. Initial reading scores were very low for two subjects (about 13 % correctly read words), and astonishingly high for the third subject (86 % correctly read words). However, all of them significantly improved their performance with time, reaching close to perfect reading scores (ranging from 86 % to 98 % correct) at the end of the training process. Reading rates were as low as 1 - 5 words/min at the beginning of the experiment and increased significantly with time to 14 - 28 words/min. Qualitative text understanding was also estimated. We observed that reading scores of at least 85 % correct were necessary to achieve 'good' text understanding. Gaze position recordings, made during the experimental sessions, demonstrated that the control of eye movements, especially the suppression of reflexive vertical saccades, constituted an important part of the overall adaptive learning process. Taken together, these results suggest that retinal implants might restore full-page text reading abilities to blind patients. About 600 stimulation contacts, distributed on an implant surface of 3 x 2 mm 2, appear to be a minimum to allow for useful reading performance. A significant learning process will however be required to reach optimal performance with such devices, especially if they have to be placed outside the foveal area...|$|E
40|$|Context. Sunspot {{oscillations}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} frequently studied wave phenomena in the solar atmosphere. Understanding the basic physical processes responsible for sunspot oscillations requires detailed information about their fine structure. Aims. We aim to reveal the relationship between the fine horizontal and vertical structure, time evolution, and the fine spectral structure of oscillations in a sunspot umbra. Methods. The high spatial and time resolution data obtained with SDO/AIA for the sunspot in active region NOAA 11131 on 08 December 2010 were analysed with the time-distance plot technique and the <b>pixelised</b> wavelet filtering method. Different levels of the sunspot atmosphere were studied from the temperature minimum to the corona. Results. Oscillations in the 3 min band dominate in the umbra. The integrated spectrum of umbral oscillations contains distinct narrowband peaks at 1. 9 min, 2. 3 min, and 2. 8 min. The power significantly varies in time, forming distinct 12 – 20 min oscillation trains. The oscillation power distribution over the sunspot in the horizontal plane reveals that the enhancements of the oscillation amplitude, or wave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed spiral and a stationary circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the umbra centre. This structure is seen from the temperature minimum at 1700 Å to the 1. 6 MK corona at 193 Å. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front spirality is most pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations, and in the bandpasses where umbral oscillations have the highest power, 304 Å and 171 Å. In the low-amplitude phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2 D cross-correlation function shows that the oscillations at higher atmospheric levels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed is estimated to be about 100 km[*]s- 1. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch corresponds to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight the lower-frequency oscillations in the 3 min band. Conclusions. The vertical and horizontal radial structure of the oscillations is consistent with the model that interprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the atmospheric temperature non-uniformity in the presence of the magnetic field inclination from the vertical. The mechanism for the polar-angle structure of the oscillations, in particular the spirality of the wave fronts, needs to be revealed...|$|E
40|$|Aims. We {{analysed}} 3 -min oscillations of {{microwave and}} extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission generated at different heights of a sunspot atmosphere, studied the amplitude and frequency modulation of the oscillations, {{and its relationship}} with the variation of the spatial structure of the oscillations. Methods. High-resolution data obtained with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, TRACE and SDO/AIA were analysed with <b>pixelised</b> wavelet filtering (PWF) and wavelet skeleton techniques. Results. Three-minute oscillations in sunspots appear in the form of recurring trains of 8 - 20 min duration (13 min in average). The typical interval between the trains is 30 - 50 min. The oscillation trains are transient in frequency and power. The relative amplitude of 3 -min oscillations was about 3 - 8 % and sometimes reached 17 %. Recurring frequency drifts of 3 -min oscillations were detected during the development of individual trains, with the period varying in the range 90 - 240 s. A wavelet analysis showed that there are three types of oscillation trains: with positive drifts (to high frequencies), negative drifts, and without a drift. Negative drifts, i. e., when the 3 -min oscillation period gradually increases, were found to occur more often. The start and end of the drifts coincides with the start time and end of the train. Sometimes two drifts co-exist, i. e. during the end of the previous drift, a new drift appears near 160 s, when the frequency is in the low-frequency part of the 3 -min spectrum, near 200 s. This behaviour is seen {{at all levels of the}} sunspot atmosphere. The speed of the drift is 4 - 5 mHz/h in the photosphere, 5 - 8 mHz/h in the chromosphere, and 11 - 13 mHz/h in the corona. There were also low-frequency peaks in the spectrum, corresponding to the periods of 10 - 20 min, and 30 - 60 min. The comparative study of the spatial structure of 3 -min oscillations in microwave and EUV shows the appearance of new sources of the sunspot oscillations during the development of the trains. Conclusions. These structures can be interpreted as waveguides that channel upward propagating waves, which in turn are responsible for the 3 -min oscillations. A possible explanation of the observed properties are two simultaneously operating factors: dispersive evolution of the upward propagating wave pulses and the non-uniformity of the oscillation power distribution over the sunspot umbra with different wave sources that correspond to different magnetic flux tubes with different physical conditions and line-of-sight angles. © 2012 ESO...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new study}} aiming at constraining the gluon contribution DeltaG to the 1 / 2 nucleon spin. The collinear pQCD theoretical framework, on which it is based, deals with asymmetries calculated from cross-sections for single inclusive hadron in the regime of quasi-real photoproduction (Q^ 2 1 GeV/c). These calculations are done up to Next-to-Leading order with a foreseen inclusion of Next-to-Leading logarithm threshold gluon resummation, only performed for the unpolarised cross-sections yet. This makes the asymmetries sensitive to the gluon polarisation not only through Photon Gluon Fusion ("gamma^* g") but also through resolved photon processes such as "q g" or "g g". The measurement of the asymmetries is performed for all the COMPASS data available from 2002 to 2011 with a polarised muon beam at 160 - 200 GeV scattered off a longitudinally polarised target of deuteron (LiD for 2002 - 2006) or proton (NH 3 for 2007 and 2011). The asymmetries are presented in bins of pT and of pseudorapidity eta (p_T in [1, 4]$ with = 3 (GeV/c) ^ 2, and eta in [- 0. 1, 2. 4]). Since the resummation calculations are not completed yet for the polarised case, the measurements are only compared with theoretical calculations using different parametrisation sets of polarised Parton Distribution Functions with a large range of different DeltaG. This comparison is then {{used to evaluate the}} DeltaG of these measurements. Complementary to this analysis, a study of new tracking detectors, the <b>pixelised</b> Micromegas, is performed. After calibration, it shows promising efficiencies and time and spatial resolutions. Cette thèse présente une nouvelle étude ayant pour but de contraindre la contribution du gluon au spin 1 / 2 du nucléon. Cette analyse se place dans le cadre théorique de la pQCD colinéaire pour calculer des asymétries de section efficaces pour des hadrons inclusifs à grande impulsion transverse (pT> 1 GeV/c) dans le régime de photoproduction quasi-réel (Q^ 2 = 3 (GeV/c) ^ 2, et eta dans [- 0. 1, 2. 4]). Les calculs de resommation n'étant pas terminés pour le cas polarisé, les mesures sont seulement comparés aux calculs théoriques en utilisant différents jeux de parametrisations de fonctions de distribution de parton polarisées ayant des valeurs de DeltaG assez étendues. Ces comparaisons sont ensuite utilisées pour évaluer le DeltaG des mesures. De façon complémentaire à cette analyse, une étude sur de nouveaux détecteurs, les pixel Micromegas, servant à pister le passage des particules, a été réalisée. Après certaines calibrations, ces détecteurs montrent des résultats prometteurs aussi bien en terme d'éfficacité qu'en terme de résolution temporelle et spatiale...|$|E
40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} {{has been}} designed to study CP violation and rare B meson decays with very high precision. Particle identification over the wide momentum range 1 [...] 100 GeV/c is provided by two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH 1 and RICH 2) detectors. The Cherenkov photons are detected by 484 Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPD) which cover a 2. 6 m^ 2 surface with a granularity of 2. 5 × 2. 5 mm^ 2. A HPD consists of a vacuum tube operating at a high [...] voltage of - 20 kV. Cherenkov photons converted to photoelectrons in a photocathode are accelerated towards a <b>pixelised</b> Silicon anode bump [...] bonded to the encapsulated front [...] end electronics. Two additional electrodes determine the shape of the accelerating electric field. The work presented in this thesis was carried out at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) during the commissioning phase of the LHCb experiment. The main part of my work was the development of a software for the magnetic distortion compensation. A magnetic field of less than 10 Gauss can be present inside the HPD {{in spite of all the}} magnetic shields. Given that 484 HPDs are installed in RICH 1 and RICH 2, an automated procedure to determine the magnetic distortion in each tube, and the resulting correction factors, is required. A general pattern recognition tool was developed to analyse data both with and without magnetic field and for alignment purpose. The ultimate goal was to achieve such an accuracy in the correction procedure that the residual uncertainty due to magnetic distortions is negligible in comparison to the pixel size, i. e. 2. 5 × 2. 5 mm^ 2. A centre [...] of [...] gravity procedure is combined with a maximum local search and an advanced clusterization algorithms obtaining an uncertainty of 0. 9 × 0. 6 mm^ 2 (at the photocathode) in the pattern reconstruction. The second main project was the study of a a selection procedure for the decay channel B^ 0 _s → J/ψ(μ^+ μ^-) ϕ(K^+ K^-). A Monte Carlo simulation is used for the B^ 0 _s → J/ψ(μ^+ μ^-) ϕ(K^+ K^-); events and for the background channels B_d^ 0 → J/Ψ(μ^+ μ^-) K^* and B^±→ J/Ψ(μ^+ μ^-) K^± to search for the adequate selection cuts to be applied in order to extract the signal. An annual event yield, using the nominal integrated luminosity of 2 f b^- 1 and a b-b production cross section of 500 μ b of 93000 is then expected for the decay channel B^ 0 _s → J/ψ(μ^+ μ^-) ϕ(K^+ K^-) using the proposed selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of strong interaction in {{the regime of}} low energies, i. e. large distances, is still not understood. Given its simplicity the non-relativistic simple quark model (SQM) describes successfully the observed hadronic spectra. QCD-inspired models, however, predict hadronic states where the gluonic content contributes to the hadron quantum numbers. These so-called hybrids cannot be explained within the SQM. A solid experimental proof {{of the existence of}} such systems would be the observation of spin-exotic states, with spin-parity quantum numbers, not allowed in the SQM. The study of mesons, the simplest hadrons, permits to gain insight into the realm of strong interaction where hadrons are the relevant degrees of freedom. The most promising spin-exotic meson candidate is the π_ 1 (1600), which was claimed in several experiments and in particular in data taken during a previous hadron campaign of the COMPASS experiment. The hadron spectroscopy program of the COMPASS experiment at CERN focuses on the investigation of the light-meson spectrum in order to enlighten this rarely understood regime of strong interaction. During the 2008 data taking an unprecedented statistical precision has been reached in peripheral interactions of 190 GeV/c pions with a proton target leading to the π^-π^-π^+ final state. A spin-parity analysis in the kinematical region of the squared four-momentum transfer 0. 1 ≤ t' ≤ 1. 0 GeV^ 2 /c^ 2 was carried out based on a model of 88 partial waves up to a total angular momentum of 6. Besides the precise determination of properties of known resonances, a new axial-vector state, the a_ 1 (1420), was observed {{for the first time in}} a mass region where neither model nor lattice calculations predict mesons with this quantum numbers. Noteworthy is the very small intensity of this signal and that it only couples to the f_ 0 (980) isobar which is assumed to have a large strangeness content. The spin-exotic π_ 1 (1600) was observed albeit as a broad component dominated by non-resonant contributions. The simultaneous analysis in bins of the three-pion invariant mass and the squared four-momentum transfer t' allowed to study resonant and non-resonant contributions in more detail. Of special interest is the Deck effect, a non-resonant production mechanism, leading to the same final state and assumed to contribute to the partial waves that also contain the a_ 1 (1260) and the spin-exotic π_ 1 (1600). The hybrid nature of the two established states π(1800) and π_ 2 (1880) was investigated. In addition the π_ 2 (1880) was confirmed as a resonance separate from the π_ 2 (1670). For the first time a study of the t' dependence on the level of partial waves was undertaken. These findings will serve as input for future models of light-meson production. The same spin-parity analysis was applied to a smaller data set taken in 2009 with a lead target. The aim was to compare the result with the 2004 analysis and to learn more about the production by a direct comparison with the 2008 proton data set. In order to improve the tracking close to the high-intensity hadron beam, five GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors with <b>pixelised</b> readout were developed and constructed for the 2008 data-taking. Similar detectors with strip readout and inactive areas around the beam axis were already installed in COMPASS and proved their high-rate capability in combination with a small interaction length. These new detectors replaced parts of the inner tracking system and were the backbone of the Small Angle Tracker (SAT) system during the 2008 / 2009 hadron campaign...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic scintillators {{are widely}} used in modern medical imaging {{modalities}} as converter for the X- and gamma-radiation {{that is used to}} obtain information about the interior of the body. Likewise, they are applied in high-energy physics to measure the energy of particles that are produced in particle physics experiments. Their use is motivated by the very good detection efficiency of these materials for hard radiation which allows the construction of relatively compact and finely <b>pixelised</b> systems with a high spatial resolution. One key problem {{in the development of the}} next generation of particle detectors and medical imaging systems is the optimisation of the energy resolution of the detectors. This parameter is influenced by the statistical fluctuations of the light output of the scintillators, i. e. by the number of photons that are detected when a particle deposits its energy in the scintillator. The light output of the scintillator depends not only on the absolute number of generated photons but also on the geometrical shape of the material, its transmission properties at the wavelength of scintillation, and its refractive index. Especially in tiny detector crystals with small aspect ratio, a significant fraction of photons is lost before conversion into an electronic signal in the photo detector. This effect increases the statistical fluctuations of the light output and therefore, deteriorates the energy resolution. The present work explores possible ways to overcome the problem of total internal reflection at the surface of the scintillator that couples to the photo detector, which is one of the principal reasons for signal losses in heavy inorganic scintillators with high refractive index. The emphasis is placed on the recently developed Ce doped scintillators LuYAP:Ce and LYSO:Ce which are used in the dedicated PET imaging systems ClearPEM and ClearPET developed by the Crystal Clear Collaboration. Starting point of the work are Monte-Carlo simulations of standard LuYAP and LYSO crystals used in ClearPEM and ClearPET with the light ray tracing program LITRANI. These simulations are used to assess the losses induced by total internal reflection and the potential in effective light yield gain. In order to calibrate the model, experiments in several reference setups are performed and the results compared with those from simulations of equivalent systems. This combination of experimental and simulated data is also used for a precise determination of the absolute light yield of the scintillators. The results of the simulations are then used to study the effect of non-planar coupling faces on the light extraction. Two approaches are considered: A macroscopic one, in which trapezoidal grooves with a depth of several hundred micrometer are used to break up total internal reflection at the coupling face; and a microscopic one that uses the unique op tical properties of photonic crystals to assess photons outside the extraction cone of a plain coupling face. The potential of the macroscopic approach is assessed by means of LITRANI simulations and validated by experiments with prototype samples designed on basis of the simulation results. The experimental results show that the gain in light yield is less than predicted from simulations of an idealized system. However, they are found to be well described by a model where the crystal layers immediately beneath the groove surfaces are described by a heavily absorbing and diffusing material. The microscopic approach is probed by means of simulations with a scattering-matrix algorithm. This algorithm is used to evaluate the impact of several structural parameters of the photonic crystal on the transmission properties of the exit surface. From these data, a model is developed which uses the results obtained with LITRANI to calculate the gain in light collection efficiency for a number of possible designs. Finally, possible fabrication techniques for photonic crystal structures on scintillators are briefly discussed. The thesis closes with a short summary of the results and a short outlook on possible future projects based on the presented approaches...|$|E
