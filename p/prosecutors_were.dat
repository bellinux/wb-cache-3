5|$|The Slatina crisis reverberated in {{the capital}} and posed {{problems}} for the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. Reportedly, both the Minister of Agriculture Nicolae Fleva and the Minister of Justice Dissescu were ready to hand in their resignations. Bogdan-Pitești himself was arrested for sedition, but soon after checked himself into Filantropia Hospital. He averted sentencing when the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> unable to conclusively prove this involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Tapas Seven {{were interviewed}} by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance. The Polícia Judiciária planned the {{following}} month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate. The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, {{on the day the}} couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects. As of May 2008 Portuguese <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.|$|E
5|$|These {{and several}} other accusations brought public and {{political}} pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to State Attorney General) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months. On November 29, 1983, three <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> relieved of their duties after {{a report by the}} state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations. This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978.|$|E

40|$|A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> {{viewed by}} the public as a {{powerful}} law enforcement official whose responsibility is to convict guilty people of crimes. But not everybody understands that a <b>prosecutor’s</b> function <b>is</b> not only to win convictions of law-breakers. A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> a quasi-judicial official who {{has a duty to}} promote justice to the entire community, including those people charged with crimes. Indeed, an overriding function of a <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> to ensure that innocent people not get convicted and punished. A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> constitutionally and ethically mandated to promote justice. The <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> even considered a 2 ̆ 2 Minister of Justice 2 ̆ 2 who has a constitutional, statutory, and ethical duty to ensure that a defendant is convicted on the basis of reliable evidence in proceedings that are fair. Nevertheless, some prosecutors deviate from these rules and engage in conduct that distorts the fact-finding process and produces erroneous convictions. Indeed, if a <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> motivated to zealously win a conviction by any means, and engages in conduct that either intentionally or carelessly undermines the integrity of the fact-finding process, the prosecutor inescapably will bring about the conviction of a defendant who is actually innocent...|$|R
25|$|In August 2014, private {{prosecutors}} {{alleged that}} state <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> compromising {{the case in}} exchange for bribes, saying {{that some of the}} state <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> receiving bribes as large as PhP 300 million. The Department of Justice issued an official statement reporting that Supervising Undersecretary Francisco Baraan III and the Department of Justice Panel of Prosecutors handling the Maguindanao massacre case vehemently denied having received any bribes and expressing Justice Secretary Leila De Lima's full trust and confidence in, and continuing support for, Undersecretary Baraan and the Panel of Prosecutors.|$|E

He was expected to provide testimony in the trial of Malik and Bagri, but <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> vague.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} {{regarded}} as farcical, with reports of blatant witness intimidation and evidence tampering. For example, fragments of a broken car light found at the Navarra murder scene which had been identified as belonging to an Alfa Romeo car owned by Leggio had, {{by the time of}} the trial, been replaced by bits of a broken light from a completely different make of car.

25|$|Judges {{were chosen}} {{from among the}} local {{hereditary}} nobles and had little formal training; therefore {{the quality of the}} courts varied from judge to judge, and levels of corruption were high. Attorneys, on the other hand, were required to have professional training. Sometimes a court included an asesor, who assisted the judge and collected fines and fees. <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> extremely rare. Instygators maintained order and security on court grounds, and a court runner (woźny) delivered summons.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} in mid-August that some courts were advised by senior justice clerks to deal harshly with offences committed during the disturbances. The advice was said to tell the courts that they could ignore existing sentencing guidelines and hand down heavy sentences. David Cameron defended the courts for handing out tough sentences, while some Liberal Democrat MPs and civil rights groups criticised some sentences being handed down. Groups of lawyers complained that Crown <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> opposing bail in more cases than usual.|$|E

25|$|According {{to federal}} prosecutors, Peter Milano once {{discussed}} in the 1980s {{with members of the}} Cleveland crime family a plot to have Dragna murdered for violating the oath of Omertà.

Milano’s lawyer strongly denied these allegations, stating that if it were true, Dragna would have received a formal warning from the FBI. Milano pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and a trial never took place.|$|E
25|$|Holdom {{was charged}} at Parramatta Local Court and refused bail. His case was adjourned until 28 January 2016, when his trial was {{intended}} to {{take place at the}} Central Law Courts of Sydney. The case was further adjourned to March as the police and <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> still collating the brief of evidence, and only about one third of it had been provided to the defence lawyers. It was adjourned again in September 2016 to at least November due to evidence being collected in a total of five jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|When {{it turned}} out that the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> slow to {{continue}} the Klongchan lawsuit with regard to Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI and several other police departments started to press charges on other people related to the temple. To further pressurize Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI also expanded its focus to branch centers of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Branch centers in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiangmai, Kanchanaburi, Loei, and Tak were investigated and charged with encroaching on nature reserves. On 21 November, this finally led to another two arrest warrants, totaling three, and plans were made by the Thai police, and the DSI to take Luang Por Dhammajayo into custody, through force if required.|$|E

25|$|In December 2011 the Pennsylvania Legislature {{passed an}} {{amendment}} stating that {{an employee of}} a school who engages in sexual relations with any student or athletic player {{under the age of}} 18 may receive a third-degree felony charge.

25|$|The Crimes Act of 1790 gave 20 {{peremptory}} {{challenges to}} capital defendants and 35 to treason defendants. An 1840 statute provided that federal jury selection should follow state {{procedures in the}} absence of a more specific federal statute. In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court held that—with regard to peremptory challenges by prosecutors in capital and treason cases—the Crimes Act controlled, and thus <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> to be given no peremptory challenges, even if they would have such challenges under the laws of the relevant state. Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.|$|E
