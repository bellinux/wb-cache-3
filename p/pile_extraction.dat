40|$|The first {{generation}} of fusion reactors will use deuterium and tritium as fuel. Since tritium is not available in nature, it must be produced in the fusion reactor blanket which surrounds the plasma zone. Tritium extraction facility has been designed and fabricated. Calibration procedure has been performed to determine tritium losses, if any during the extraction. Lithium compounds were irradiated using Am-Be neutron source. Out of <b>pile</b> <b>extraction</b> from neutron irradiated lithium compounds {{was carried out by}} flushing the samples with helium plus 0. 1 % hydrogen as a carrier gas in the temperature range 450 C to 900 C. Tritium losses will have been estimated. Extracted tritium activity will be measured by commercially available liquid scintillation counter...|$|E
40|$|Centrifuge model {{tests were}} {{performed}} to investigate the torsional behavior of a well-instrumented model pile jacked into loose and dense sand. The whole process of pile jacking, torsional loading, and <b>pile</b> <b>extraction</b> was conducted in-flight at 40 g using a four-axis robotic manipulator. The torsional response at the pile head, distributions of torque and shaft friction along the pile shaft, torsional load transfer, and loading rate effects were studied. The shaft resistances along the pile during torsional loading, compression loading, and tension loading were compared. The shear stress - local pile movement curves obtained from the present torsional load tests {{were found to be}} approximately hyperbolic and similar to those obtained from axial load tests reported in the literature. The torsional shear stress distribution along the pile shaft was influenced by stress degradation effects, particularly in the loose sand. A criterion was proposed to define pile failure under torsional loading. Torsional loading rates in the range of 1 - 8 degrees/s had little effect on the torsional resistance of the pile. Depending on the initial state of the soil around the pile, the shaft resistance under torsional loading may be greater than that under axial loading when the horizontal stress is larger than the vertical stress, but smaller when the horizontal stress is smaller than the vertical stress...|$|E
50|$|The Yue state {{appears to}} have been a largely {{indigenous}} political development in the lower Yangtze. This region corresponds with that of the old corded-ware Neolithic, and it continued to be one that shared a number of practices, such as tooth <b>extraction,</b> <b>pile</b> building, and cliff burial, practices that continued until relatively recent times in places such as Taiwan. Austronesian speakers also still lived in the region down to its conquest and sinification beginning about 240 B.C.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{possible causes}} of {{failure of the}} rotating footbridge over the Ustka port channel. In July, 2015, strange behaviour of this object was observed {{in the form of}} excessive vibrations of bridge platform suspension rods, with the accompanying acoustic effects. A preliminary geotechnical analysis has revealed that this destructive effect was caused by the nearby construction works, namely construction of a fishing basin and communication routes in the area close to the bridge, which affected the bridge lashing rod foundation settings. Ground vibrations generated by certain construction activities were likely to have direct impact on decreasing the bearing capacity of these rods and increasing the susceptibility od the <b>piles</b> to <b>extraction.</b> After detecting the above problems in bridge operation, its geodetic monitoring was started. The data recorded during this monitoring, along with the results of force measurements in the rods, have made the basis for a series of numerical simulations, performed in the Finite Element Method (FEM) formalism. The bridge structure was analysed in the conditions defined as the emergency state. Extreme efforts of bridge elements and its dynamic characteristics were examined. A possible source of strange behaviour of the footbridge during its operation which was recognised during these simulations was the coincidence of the global natural frequency of the entire bridge structure with local vibrations of suspension rods, at the frequency approximately equal to 1 Hz. This situation was likely to lead to the appearance of the so-called internal resonance phenomenon. As a final conclusion of the research, recommendations were formulated on possible object oriented corrective actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{decrease}} in old-growth forests threatens {{the diversity of}} a range of organisms. Only {{a small portion of the}} forested area in Sweden is formally protected and the majority of unprotected forests are young (< 70 years). The objective of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the production forest landscape, with special focus on young forests and to increase the knowledge about man-made substrates. Moreover, this thesis investigates the long-term survival chances of forest bryophytes and lichens, and gives insight into the dispersal biology of bryophytes. After clear-cutting, the remaining dead wood consists of logging residues (slash), logs, snags and man-made high and low stumps. Results from this thesis show that the effect on dead wood supply of harvesting slash for biofuel is most significant for slash and logs. Sixty-five percent of the lying dead wood volume left after clear-cutting was <b>piled</b> for <b>extraction.</b> In addition, 36 % of the remaining dead wood was removed, including a significant volume of coarse dead wood. On stumps in different age classes, bryophytes showed a tendency to increase in richness over time, whereas lichens colonized stands in early succession more rapidly and had an earlier peak in species richness. As a dispersal mechanism for bryophytes living on stumps, ants inhabiting the same substrates were shown to passively carry bryophyte diaspores for a significant period of time. This result sheds light on the complexity of species dispersal. In adjoining young and old forest stands, red-listed bryophytes and lichens were more abundant in the old stands. This difference disappeared when the amount of substrate available was taken into account. When the young stands were positioned north of the old, the bryophytes were equally frequent in both forest stages, indicating that the aspect of a clearcut matters. In conclusion, young forests have the potential to host a high diversity of species. Research on young natural and managed forests is needed to formulate science-based conservation strategies in managed forest landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Civil {{engineering}} construction frequently requires {{the use of}} piles to carry structural loads to stronger ground strata or to control lateral ground movements. A variety of techniques are available to install piles into the ground. Of central interest to this research is the vibratory hammer, or vibrodriver, which is the preferred method used to drive piles into granular soils.. The installation of sheet and bearing piles by vibrodriver causes periodic vibration in the adjacent ground which is severe very close to the piles, but attenuates with distance. A potential consequential effect of the vibrations that are caused by vibrodriving is ground compaction, which may be observed as differential surface settlement. It is desirable that vibration induced ground compaction settlement should be estimated for contracts where loose to medium-dense granular soils occur, especially when buildings on shallow foundations or poorly bedded service pipes are adjacent. It is unlikely that a simple in-situ soils test will allow accurate, specific estimates, but rather that a range of vibratory tests should be performed which can then be used as a knowledge base. Settlement trends and associated parameters can then be identified which will allow the prediction of settlement with reference to the in-situ soil and the ground vibration data. This argument forms the basis of the laboratory test programme. A range of granular soils were studied using an adapted 150 mm Rowe cell (a hydraulic oedometer). Use of the Rowe cell enabled samples to experience compaction under effective stress conditions that are appropriate for equivalent soils in the field. The complete cell was mounted on an electromagnetic shaker and after static consolidation, the samples were vibrated under maintained hydraulic load, at frequencies and accelerations that are appropriate for soils adjacent to vibrodrivers. Change in sample height was recorded for controlled vertical (and horizontal) vibrations, typically in the range of 0. lg to 5. 0 g at 25 Hz and 40 Hz. Soils were tested under a range of effective stresses and moisture content. The results of the laboratory programme and subsequent data analysis are presented in tables and diagrams. Expressions that describe a good relationship between acceleration, soil type, relative density and static load allow upperbound estimates of vibratory settlements to be made for accelerations of up to 6. 0 g. An additional expression is presented that accounts for the influence of moisture content, ground vibration frequency and vibration duration. Summary tables are presented that define categories of vibration induced ground compaction settlement based on settlement potential, risk and severity. The use of the settlement equations and the influence of various parameters are demonstrated for a range of example applications, hi addition, data is abstracted from case studies found in the literature and sites that were visited during the research. The abstracted data are then used to perform settlement estimates which are compared to the reported examples. Good correlation between observed and calculated settlement is demonstrated in many cases. However, in some instances, it appears that ground settlements were exacerbated by at least one additional mechanism, such as cumulative pore water pressure increase, or lateral movement of sheet <b>piles,</b> in addition, <b>extraction</b> of <b>piles</b> by vibrodriver appears to contribute significantly to the reported cases of ground settlement...|$|R
