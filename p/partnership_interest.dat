40|$|An {{informal}} {{secondary market}} for publicly syndicated limited partnerships has formed {{in response to}} a need of owners to sell their <b>partnership</b> <b>interests</b> and as a means for prospective buyers to exploit an investment opportunity. Sellers and buyers frequently meet on unequal terms. Original limited partners are often unsophisticated investors with an incomplete understanding of real estate securities. Limited partners who seek to liquidate their investment find they have suffered severe diminution in the value of their investments and severe restrictions on the saleability of the <b>partnership</b> <b>interests.</b> This thesis attempts to document the obstacles in the establishment of an efficient secondary market for publicly syndicated limited <b>partnership</b> <b>interests.</b> The limited <b>partnership</b> investment structure is itself a major impediment to the development of an efficient market.

40|$|This article {{examines}} indirect exchanges of <b>partnership</b> <b>interests</b> {{in light of}} the distinctive continuity-of-investment principles of section 1031 and Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code. Part II of the article focuses on the failure of judicial responses and alternative approaches prior to the 1984 Act to prevent the potential abuses of direct exchanges of <b>partnership</b> <b>interests.</b> Part III examines section 1031 (a) (2) (D) against the background of two recent decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning successive tax-free exchanges. Part IV focuses on planning techniques involving like-kind exchanges coupled with partnership contributions and distributions. Part V proposes that a strict aggregate approach to successive tax-free exchanges is necessary to reconcile the nonrecognition provisions of section 1031 and Subchapter K. Finally, the article concludes that combined use of these nonrecognition provisions could be permitted without rekindling the old abuses of direct exchanges of <b>partnership</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R
