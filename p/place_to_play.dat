5|$|The precise {{founding}} of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The University's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport {{was introduced to the}} campus from a rival school, Minnesota A in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke {{was one of the first}} full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{baseball}} was popular enough in Philadelphia that Philadelphia Athletics president Ben Shibe found his team regularly turning away customers from their cramped Columbia Park ballpark even though it was just a few years old. When as many as 28,000 showed up to fill the 9,500 wooden bleacher seats, Shibe and partner Connie Mack decided the A's needed a new <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

In 1901 the Giants folded {{because of a lack of}} a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Leland bought the Giants in 1905 and merged it with his Unions (despite the fact that not a single Giant player ended up on the roster), and named them the Leland Giants.|$|E

25|$|The AJHL {{returned}} to Calgary in 1971 when the Calgary Canucks was formed. The Canucks was {{the brainchild of}} Doug Eastcott, and was created as an outlet to give Calgary area youngsters a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> without sacrificing their education. Acting {{as an extension of the}} Calgary minor hockey association, the Canucks restricted themselves to only three out-of-town players for many years. The Canucks have become one of the most dominant clubs in the AJHL, having won nine AJHL championships, two Doyle Cups and the Centennial Cup in 1995 as Canadian Tier II national champions. Nearly 50 former Canucks have gone on to play in the NHL, including Heatley, Mike Vernon, Jason Smith, Doug Houda and Craig Adams.|$|E

25|$|Weekes had {{a classic}} batting style, possessed {{a variety of}} shots {{on both sides of}} the wicket, and is {{considered}} one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by The Times as lightly bow-legged, with a wonderful eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always the right <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action said he was the closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could even begin to match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find another <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E

500|$|A {{proposal}} for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948; however, plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s. The Pittsburgh Pirates played their home games at Forbes Field, which opened in 1909, and was the second oldest venue in the National League (Philadelphia's Connie Mack Stadium was oldest, having opened only two months earlier than Forbes). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who had moved from Forbes Field to Pitt Stadium in 1964, were large supporters of the project. [...] For their part, according to longtime Pirates announcer Bob Prince, the Pirates wanted a bigger <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in order to draw more revenue.|$|E
500|$|In March 1979, Coleman went to RCA Records' New York {{studio to}} produce an album with Prime Time by direct-to-disc recording. They had {{mechanical}} problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected. The failed session was a project under Phrase Text, Coleman's music publishing company. He wanted to set up his own record company with the same name, and chose his old friend Kunle Mwanga as his manager. In April, Mwanga arranged another session at CBS Studios in New York City, and Coleman recorded Of Human Feelings there on April 25; the session was originally titled Fashion Faces. Jackson did not record with the band and Calvin Weston was hired in his <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> simultaneously with Denardo Coleman. They recorded all the album's songs on the first take without any equipment problems.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} also {{influential}} in advancing {{the status of}} women, who were admitted singly without escorts.

The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies-only parlor and provided women with a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> billiards and ping-pong. [...] It was the first New York hotel to allocate an entire room for afternoon tea. [...] The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large, both the Empire Room and at times, the Rose Room, had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests.

500|$|Desperate for a break, the overworked band {{began to}} argue and {{tensions}} formed.

The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore 98, described as [...] "a winter version of the Warped Tour." [...] Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion.

500|$|Calgary {{failed to}} reach the playoffs in both seasons, and while Bouwmeester's {{offensive}} production increased in the lock-out-shortened 2012â€“13 season â€“ he had 6 goals and 15 points in 33 games for Calgary and again led the team in ice time â€“ he also reached 750 career games without appearing in the playoffs. With the Flames entering a rebuilding phase, Bouwmeester agreed to waive his no-trade clause and accepted a trade on April 1, 2013. [...] He was dealt to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for prospects Mark Cundari, Reto Berra, and a first round draft pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Bouwmeester described leaving Calgary as [...] "bittersweet", calling the city a great <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> but expressed hope that he would finally reach the post-season with the Blues. [...] He achieved this goal after the Blues clinched a playoff spot in their third-to-last game of the season, and the 762nd of Bouwmeester's career. In doing so, he avoided breaking Olli Jokinen's NHL record of 799 career games before making his playoff debut.|$|E

The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A few of us were standing behind the stage and vividly remember the feeling of this is the new Blink. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was obvious what band he belonged in."
