We show that, at this level of resolution (250 x 250 m), the vegetation index (NDVI) contributes very little to an explanation of both yield levels and change. To reach more powerful explanations researchers need to incorporate socio-economic parameters in their models...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> <b>corn</b> {{size and}} texture {{on the performance}} parameters of laying hens and power consumption required for grinding <b>maize</b> <b>corn</b> were evaluated. The experiment was carried out on 384 Isa Brown hens, 36 weeks old, penned in a conventional aviary with 562. 5 cm 2 bird- 1 stocking rate. The treatments were distributed in a completely randomized 2 x 3 factorial design (maize textures: flint and dent; and milling degree: fine, medium and coarse) with eight replicates of eight birds per plot. Data were evaluated with SISVAR and means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. Difference was reported for the variable texture and flint increased the variables feed intake and egg weight. Significant difference in the characteristics of egg quality occurred only for the colorof the yolk. Larger corn sizes consumed less electricity during grinding.

50|$|Theories vary as to {{the causes}} of the catastrophic warfare and {{migration}} of many tribes in the area. Supposedly, populations had increased greatly in Zululand following the Portuguese introduction <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn)</b> in Mozambique from the Americas in the late 17th century, reaching the inland Zambezi basin around 1750. While corn was more productive than the grains from native grasses, it required more water during cultivation. The agricultural surpluses and increased population enabled Shaka to raise a standing army of Zulus. By the end of the 18th century, the Zulus occupied much of their arable land. Declining rainfall and a ten-year drought in the early 19th century set off a competition for land and water resources among the peoples of the area.|$|R
