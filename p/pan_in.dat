5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>in</b> 1953.|$|E

30|$|In IEEE 802.15. 4 networks, when non-interfering logical {{channels}} are used <b>in</b> multiple <b>PANs</b> operating <b>in</b> a Personal Operating Space the inter-PAN communication {{is not possible}} because the <b>PANs</b> <b>in</b> the same region remain unaware of each other’s presence. This situation adversely hinders realizing the pervasive and synergistic vision of PANs, e.g., sharing information of common interest amongst PANs and accessing infrastructure networks hopping through multiple <b>PANs.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we have presented a novel mechanism to allow communication between multiple <b>PANs</b> <b>in</b> the same POS that are using different logical channels. We have proposed a framework that enables neighboring PANs {{to communicate with each}} other by diffusing into each other through “bordering nodes”. The simulation results show improvement in delivery ratio when number of border nodes is increased, and also hinting at the likely detrimental effects when the borders nodes are indefinitely increased.|$|R
5|$|She further {{asserted}} {{that in the}} Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, {{as well as the}} deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by <b>Pan</b> <b>in</b> Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless {{asserted that}} his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration.|$|E
