40|$|This paper {{examines}} the GATT/WTO rules for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in a duopoly model with both {{horizontal and vertical}} product differentiation. The GATT/WTO rules allow for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> if the domestic producers are injured associated with price discrimination. However, it is argued in this paper that the calculations of injury margins are flawed because of negligence of quality differences. This gives countries with high quality producers an option to practice protectionism. This bias in the possibility to implement <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> predominantly favours the developed countries which are specialized in producing high quality products. The paper also shows that qualities and prices converge when trade costs decrease. Moreover, it is shown that a decrease of trade costs harms the profit of the high quality producer and this might increase the high quality producer’s pressure for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper suggests that prices should be corrected for quality differences {{in the assessment of}} injury. Such change will limit the number of anti-dumping cases, but also eliminate the advantage of the developed countries in the ability to introduce <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Anti-dumping and {{countervailing duty}} actions are {{legitimate}} measures permitted under th GATT/WTO rules, {{and are now}} {{the most frequently used}} trade remedies. Over the past decade, 2, 500 anti-dumping actions and almost 300 countervailing duty actions have been initiated and notified to the GATT/WTO. The strengthening of the multilateral disciplines on afeguards — including the prohibition and elimination of voluntary export restraints and he commitments to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) — appears to have provoked an increasing resort to <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> C rtain countries and product sectors, such as teel and textiles, have been targeted more than others. At the same time, there has been an increasing resort to <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> by non-traditional users — particularly developing countries — many of which have introduced anti-dumping and countervailing legislation since the entry into force of the WTO Agreements. Developing countries continue to be the main targets of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> This has the effect of creating instability and uncertainty for their exports, which has resulted in reductions in trade volumes and market shares for their goods. The increased resort to <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> and the rising number of disputes related to these measures, have prompted many countries, including several developing countries, to call for improvements in the application of these measures.

40|$|Textiles and {{clothing}} (T 2 ̆ 6 C) sector is {{of critical importance}} to developing countries/Least developed countries (LDCs). With the expiration of quotas in 2005, many developing countries/LDCs have experienced considerable adjustment challenges. With the end of quotas {{and the increase in}} competitive pressures on countries, use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures,</b> has become increasingly attractive as a market protection mechanism. This presentation assesses the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in T 2 ̆ 6 C sector through two possible application scenarios i. e. developing-to-developing countries and developed-to-developing countries. The presentation refers to earlier work done by Chad Bown on the Endogenous Trade Policy theory and would extend Bown’s analysis to the T 2 ̆ 6 C sector. The main objective behind the presentation is to propagate a newer and much-simpler “Reactive and Pre-Emptive Model. ” The purpose behind the model is to distinguish between reactive users and pre-emptive users of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> and how these users are likely to employ <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> to protect their T 2 ̆ 6 C industries after quota expiration. The presentation expands upon my recently submitted PhD thesis, supervised by Professors Ross Buckley (UNSW) and Bryan Mercurio (CUHK). The idea is to float the theory before a larger audience with a view to elicit comments. At the moment, only T 2 ̆ 6 C sector has been studied as a possible sector of application.

40|$|Abstract: While many trade {{barriers}} {{have been reduced}} in recent years, contingency trade policy barriers have tended {{to take their place}} in many countries. <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> can be legitimate protection against predatory pricing but often constitute important {{trade barriers}}. Consequently, some industries lobby for such measures when facing particularly competitive foreign firms. However, it is obvious that not all lobbying is successful. Previous literature has followed Olson‟s (1965) argument that small industries are likely to succeed in lobbying as they can overcome free-rider problems and coordination costs, and that particularly vocal actors may exert more influence. However, the characteristics of the politicians being lobbied are often ignored. In this paper, we focus on the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in the European Union. Our main question is to which extent geographical or political proximity to Brussels, the political centre of the EU, makes anti-dumping petitions more or less likely to succeed? We provide a tentative answer to the question by estimating a set of determinants of the probability of success in anti-dumping petitions, and the subsequent value of the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> implemented. Our results suggest that being geographical distant to Brussels does make the success of anti-dumping petitions more probable, but does not influence the level of implemented duties. On the other hand, the results suggest that being ideologically distant to the country chairing the EU Council of Ministers at the time of decision reduces the chances of approval an anti-dumping petition, but given approval rightwing governments chairing the Council increase the chance for a higher level of protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> beyond the original five-year period through a so-called sunset review. Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a sunset review analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the dumped imports caused injury. At the moment, sunset reviews seem adrift as panels and the Appellate Body fail to give guidance to Members on how to do a more economically sound and informed revie...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> as a trade {{protection}} tool, {{has increased}} phenomenally {{during the last}} decade. One significant aspect of this new trend is the increasing involvement of developing countries. India is one such country which {{has emerged as a}} very frequent user of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures,</b> surpassing even the traditional users. It had initiated more than 300 anti-dumping cases by the end of 2002 - 03. Many of these cases are against developing countries. Most of the cases are concentrated in narrow range product groups, like chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, pharmaceuticals and textiles. This study examines India's experience with <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> The main objective of the study is to identify the factors which might have influenced the anti-dumping behaviour in India. Discussion of these factors shows that imports have increased considerably. This is particularly true for a number of developing countries facing dumping charges in India. At the same time, many of the domestic producers of the like products have performed poorly during the last decade. Such trends may instigate the import-competing industries to seek anti-dumping protection and may also influence the authority to provide that. However, the results of our statistical exercise show that, although imports and performance of the domestic industry might have influenced the initiation of anti-dumping cases, these factors did not seem to significantly influence the final decision of the authority. The results rather indicated a tendency {{on the part of the}} authority to provide anti-dumping protection to industries, which are characterised by a large number of firms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> {{in order to make}} economic sense of what seems to amount to cheating on an international agreement. There are numerous loopholes in the Anti-dumping Agreement which allow <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> {{to be used as a}} form of protection by import-competing industries against fair trade. Some of these loopholes are of a purely legal nature, while others are more practical. During an anti-dumping investigation, a dumping margin is calculated in order to establish whether or not an accused exporter is dumping. This calculation is known as the determination of dumping. In this thesis, the various ways in which the dumping margin can be manipulated or ”captured” are investigated. It is shown that there are numerous ways in which the determination of dumping result can be manipulated in order to ensure a positive dumping result. And economists are concerned about this abuse of anti-dumping as it could have a chilling effect on international trade. However, it is shown in this thesis that anti-dumping investigations are concentrated in certain sectors. In other words, <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> (and other non-tariff remedies) are being used as a strategy to protect certain industries. Adam Smith, the ”father” of economics, pointed out that certain sensitive or strategic industries may need to be protected, even if such protection is at the cost of economic welfare. So, it seems that the economic issue is not really about dumping, but about whether or not certain strategic industries should be protected. And it is the protection of these strategic industries, for example the iron and steel industry, that needs further research. EconomicsD. Comm. (Economics...|$|R
40|$|The federal government, {{with the}} support of the opposition, has sought to {{strengthen}} Australia’s anti-dumping and countervailing system against cheap foreign imports. Recent changes to the Customs Act and the creation of a new Anti-Dumping Commission are designed to make it easier for Australian producers to bring anti-dumping actions against foreign producers. If this leads to a sustained increase in anti-dumping actions, it will mark the end of a downward trend in Australia’s use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> since the mid- 1980 s.

40|$|On December 11, 2016, Article 15 (a) (ii) of China’s Accession Protocol to the WTO will expire. The {{expiration}} of {{this provision}} terminates {{the right of}} WTO members’ to calculate anti-dumping duties against China {{on the basis of}} methodologies that “are not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China”. In this context, this paper shall serve, first, as a reminder that the European Union will violate its WTO obligations under the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) if the Union’s institutions continue - after December 11, 2016 - to adopt <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> against China that are based on ‘non-market economy’ (NME) treatment of Chinese exports in anti-dumping investigations. Moreover, the 2009 EU Anti-Dumping Regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism “as such” if it is not brought into compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement by that date. These observations, however, do not prejudge the legality of EU <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> – “as applied” - that the EU has (or will have) adopted against Chinese producers prior to the December deadline. The post- 2016 legality of already existing EU <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> that are “not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China” is particularly relevant in context of the rising amount of new EU AD measures and investigations against Chinese producers of steel and solar panels that the EU has imposed and initiated in the last 2 years.

40|$|China {{is a major}} {{target for}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> by both {{developed}} and developing countries. Its rapid industrial transition to higher value-added sectors brings it in direct conflict with the US and the EU. <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> have consistently been employed by the US and the EU to protect their domestic markets from encroaching Chinese exports. In the initial few years of joining the WTO, China rarely initiated any complaint in the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM), while facing several complaints itself. This approach has now evolved. China appears to have acquired the knowledge and capacity to access the WTO DSM for safeguarding its interests. As countries attempt {{to recover from the}} global financial crisis through an export-led strategy, the likelihood of developed countries using antidumping measures and countervailing duties (CVD) to protect their domestic sectors consequently increase. With this background, this paper tracks China 2 ̆ 7 s experience in the WTO with reference to antidumping disputes (both as a complainant and as a respondent). The recurrence of disputes between China and the US/EU is frequently due to alleged currency manipulation that gives China an 2 ̆ 2 unfair 2 ̆ 2 advantage in exports. Tins unfairness is then made the basis of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> and countervailing duties. The paper analyses the developments in recent disputes between involving China. Furthermore, this paper aims to anticipate the effects of the 2016 expiry of the non-market methodology that is currently used to calculate dumping margin against Chinese exports. Once free from being subjected to a surrogate method of calculating dumping margin, China can potentially flood the world market with competitively priced exports that could have long-term consequences for industries in the US and the EU and other developed countries...|$|R
