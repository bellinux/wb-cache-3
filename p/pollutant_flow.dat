40|$|International audienceIn {{a recent}} paper, a generic model, {{based on a}} multiobjective {{optimization}} procedure, for water supply system for a single company and for an eco-industrial park was proposed and illustrated by a park involving three companies A, B and C. The best configuration was identified by simultaneously minimizing the fresh water flow rate, the regenerated water flow rate {{and the number of}} connections in the eco-industrial park. The question is now to know what the maximal increase/decrease in <b>pollutant</b> <b>flow</b> rates is, so that the eco-industrial park remains feasible, economically profitable and environmentally friendly. A preliminary study shows that the park can accept an increase of <b>pollutant</b> <b>flow</b> rates of 29 % in company A, 12 % in company B and only 1 % in company C; beyond these limits the industrial symbiosis becomes not feasible. The proposed configuration is not flexible with a very limited number of connections. Indeed, the solution implemented for conferring some flexibility to this network is {{to increase the number of}} connections within the park. However, connections have a cost, so the increase of their number needs to remain moderate. The number of connections is augmented until the symbiosis becomes unfeasible, or until the gain for each company to participate to the park becomes lower than a given threshold. Several cases are studied by increasing the <b>pollutant</b> <b>flow</b> rates under two different scenarios: 1) in only one company, 2) in two or three companies simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer a {{possible}} explanation for the empirical finding that the pollution-income relationship (PIR) for <b>flow</b> <b>pollutants</b> is an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), i. e. inverted-U shaped, but that the PIR for stock pollutants is monotonically rising. We analyse an overlapping generations model with two pollutants: The <b>flow</b> <b>pollutant</b> causes immediate damages, but the stock pollutant harms the environment only in the future. Hence, a succession of myopic governments lets stock pollution grow with income. In contrast, the <b>flow</b> <b>pollutant</b> follows an EKC whose downturn might be caused by the neglect of future damages and by ever rising stock pollution: Without the stock pollutant the PIR for the <b>flow</b> <b>pollutant</b> can increase monotonically. We also show that the turning point of the EKC for the <b>flow</b> <b>pollutant</b> lies at lower levels of income and of flow pollution if stock pollution is high and harmful. This casts doubts on most empirical EKC studies because they assume that the turning point occurs at the same income level in all countries.

Based on the results of this study, we observed that nanoparticulate and gaseous behaviours are strongly correlated, thus showing the predominance of air driven transport over particle specific behavior. The average level of protection afforded by the MSC was found systematically slightly higher for the nanoaerosol than for the gas in the studied configurations (emission properties of the source, operating conditions, measurements protocol). This improved protection efficiency can however not be considered as a warrant of protection for operators, since operating condition and ventilation parameters are still more influent on the containment than the pollutant nature (i. e. nanoaerosol or gas) ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrological drainage/river basins {{constitute}} highly heterogeneous {{systems of}} coupled natural and anthropogenic water and pollutant flows across political, {{national and international}} boundaries. These flows need to be appropriately understood, quantified and communicated to stakeholders, in order to appropriately guide environmental water system management. In this thesis, various uncertainties about water and pollutant flows in drainage/river basins and their implications for effective and efficient water pollution abatement are investigated, in particular for mine-related heavy metal loadings in the Swedish Dalälven River basin and for nitrogen loadings in the Swedish Norrström drainage basin. Economic cost-minimization modeling is used to investigate the implications of pollutant load uncertainties for the cost-efficiency of catchment-scale abatement of water pollution. Results indicate that effective and efficient pollution abatement requires explicit consideration of uncertainties about pollution sources, diffuse contributions of the subsurface water system to downstream pollutant observations in surface waters, and downstream effects of different possible measures to reduce water pollution. In many cases, downstream load abatement measures must be used, in addition to source abatement, {{in order to reduce}} not only expected, but also uncertainties around expected pollutant loads. Effective and efficient environmental management of water systems must generally also consider the entire catchments of these systems, rather than focusing only on discrete pollutant sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) are extensively used in hydrological {{analysis to}} obtain the direction of flow on a topographical surface. Knowing the direction of flow helps in determining channel networks, and in obtaining the distributed specific catchments, which are important hydrological attributes in a DEM based analysis. There are certain demerits in the known methods of DEM-based flow-path mapping, despite the ease of handling the DEM in present generation computational capacity. A major demerit {{is the problem of}} accounting multidirectional flow path mapping efficiently. In this study, a new approach of assigning the flow direction is proposed. This approach considers the flow as a vector component and argues that the direction of flow can be different from the direction of steepest slope on a planar surface depending on surface roughness and flow vectors. The direction of flow, if assigned to the direction of the maximum flow tendency, gives a better flow path mapping. In this case, the direction is not necessarily restrict either on grid or across diagonal of the grid-centers, which enables to assign the flow direction toward multiple downstream cells. This method is named as the Ranked Flow Tendency (RAFT) method. This method was tested using the DEM of Kamishiiba Reservoir Site (210 km 2) as the case. The results show the RAFT method is better than the conventional D 8 method and modified D 8 method. The RAFT method identifies the network of channels and lakes and can incorporate the flow dispersion properly. These abilities show higher possibility of yielding a better result while used this method in sediment and <b>pollutant</b> <b>flow</b> simulation and water quality modeling...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of chemicals in many anthropogenic activities and their dispersion into the environment can damage irreversibly the natural resources essential for human life. Among these, groundwater resources are, undoubtedly, strategic {{for the existence of}} human communities, primarily in those areas where population density is high and the land human use is intensive, so that a relevant groundwater resource vulnerability exists. The identification and characterization of contamination sources for groundwater can be more difficult than for other environmental pathways; in fact the relationship between environmental pressures and the complex structure of groundwater flow systems involves many processes, which affect the behaviour and transport of pollutants. With regard to the wide variety of structural, volcanic and depositional processes which characterize the alluvial aquifer systems in the Campania Region (South Italy), this paper describes a multidisciplinary approach to delineate aquifer/aquitard unit and recognizes scale-dependent heterogeneity by means of geological, hydrogeological, geochemical and geostatistical techniques. In such complex hydrogeological structures special attention has to be paid to recharge mechanism of confined or semiconfined aquifers, as well as of bedrock karst aquifers underlying heterogeneous deposits such as pyroclastic-alluvial successions. Moreover, heterogeneity affects leakage in complex aquifer systems and increases hydrodispersion parameter uncertainty. Decisions on groundwater protection policy, according to European directives, may be based on the improvement of the concept of “aquifer analogue” to basin fills. It is useful to identify heterogeneity properties, which control the permeability distribution. So hydro-stratigraphic architecture derives from equivalent parameters variability, which describes homogeneous media or hydrogeological units. In this line, the aquifer analogy can be associated to a set of indicators representative of the groundwater composition. Each indicator describes a specific aspect of groundwater quality and leads in combination with others to the definition of groundwater environmental index, due to natural and anthropogenic phenomena. The results of multivariate statistical analyses provide the identification of a number of homogeneous zones even in complex alluvial aquifer systems. At the same time, in wide regions this approach is able to point out the more hazardous sites where contamination sources are likely to be localized, and provides the working scale for planning technical and procedural solutions.
