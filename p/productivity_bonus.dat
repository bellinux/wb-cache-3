40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} (PE) is {{a process}} that estimates the employee overall performance during a given period, and it is a common function carried out inside modern companies. PE is important because it is an instrument that encourages employees, organizational areas, and the whole company to have an appropriate behavior and continuous improvement. In addition, PE is useful in decision making about personnel allocation, <b>productivity</b> <b>bonuses,</b> incentives, promotions, disciplinary measures, and dismissals. There are many performance evaluation methods; however, none is universal and common to all companies. This paper proposes an expert performance evaluation system based on a fuzzy logic model, with competences 360 ° feedback oriented to human behavior. This model uses linguistic labels and adjustable numerical values to represent ambiguous concepts, such as imprecision and subjectivity.

40|$|Background: We {{examined}} whether physician compensation, financial incentives, {{and care}} management tools {{were associated with}} primary physician job and referral satisfaction. Our study was guided by a conceptual model of physician satisfaction derived from published evidence. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed of 495 primary physicians (family practitioners, general practitioners, general internists) in the Seattle metropolitan area in 1997. Results: Bivariate analyses revealed that salary compensation, <b>productivity</b> <b>bonuses,</b> and withholds for referrals were associated with job and referral dissatisfaction. However, after controlling for physi-cian, practice, and office characteristics, only the association between salary payment and job dissatis-faction remained significant. Practice in offices with more physicians had the strongest association with physician job dissatisfaction. Conclusions: Although managed care features are correlated with physician job and referral dissatis-faction, the source of dissatisfaction may originate from being an employed physician in a large medical group with more physicians, which {{may be more likely}} to impose bureaucratic controls that limit physi-cian autonomy.

40|$|Decision making {{tools and}} {{architectures}} of nowadays consist {{an effective way}} of extracting useful information from complex data domains. A decision making scheme is presented here, combining fuzzy cluster analysis and TDIDT (Top Down Induction of Decision Trees) algorithms. Cluster analysis is primarily used by applying fuzzy C-means, in order to group uniform data sets stored in databases as attribute value vectors. This process has two outputs: an identification of clusters (through description of clusters' "center") and a membership function to each attribute value vector. Once clusters have been identified, attribute value vectors are extended, containing the membership {{value of the data}} set to each cluster. An inductive learning algorithm is then applied, producing meaningful discrimination rules among clusters, {{in the form of a}} decision tree. The proposed decision making architecture can cope with any kind of data - quantitative or qualitative - depending on the application domain and the nature of the decisions to be taken. A real world application has been selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. Specifically, it is shown how the top-management team of a domestic bank network should decide, about granting the annual <b>productivity</b> <b>bonus</b> among the branches of its network. Further directions are addressed through this paper, proposing the construction of a data mining tool, able to discover interesting information in on-line mode.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{performance}} of the Dutch economy in terms of growth in real GDP, employment and per capita income {{can be traced back}} to the mid- 1980 s. This paper suggests that the growth acceleration of the Dutch economy has primarily been the result of a below-average performance during earlier times (i. e. the 1970 s and early 1980 s). Wage moderation and strict exchange rate and fiscal policies have contributed to the fact that the Netherlands has more or less returned to the Northwest European average of GDP per capita. This paper argues that this catch-up effect may disappear in the near future. According to many authors the acceleration of growth in the Netherlands is also related to recent structural reforms in the labour and product markets. If this were to be the case, we may expect that the Dutch economy will continue to perform on a structurally higher growth path than economies where such reforms are slower or absent. This paper begins with a review of GDP and GDP per capita growth {{performance of the}} Netherlands in an internationally comparative perspective. It then presents an overview of structural reform measures and evaluates to what extent deregulation of product and labour markets has enhanced the economic growth performance. Next, it is shown that the increase of the participation rate is an important factor behind the improvement of the Dutch economic performance. Despite the improved GDP and per capita income performance, labour productivity growth in the Netherlands has slowed down since the mid 1980 s, and the <b>productivity</b> <b>bonus</b> of the Netherlands over other Northwest European countries has eroded. This strengthens the view that the recent growth performance may in fact be no more than a catch-up process in terms of labour market expansion at the expense of productivity. The decelaration of productivity growth occurred across the board: in almost all sectors growth in labour productivity and multifactor productivity slowed down. However, the productivity problem should not be mixed up with a technology problem "per se". As multifactor productivity growth is weakest in service sectors, it is suggested that technology diffusion and organizational innovations require at least as much attention as technology creation. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters exploring the economic implications of reference-dependent preferences over incentive design and belief formation. The first chapter studies the intertemporal allocation of incentives in a repeated moral hazard model. Beside consumption utility, reference-dependent agents experience utility from changes in their expectations about present and future income caused by the performance measure realization. In contrast to the prediction with classical preferences but consistent with real-world contracts, this paper shows that if consumption utility is not too concave and if changes in expectations about present income carries sufficiently larger weight in utility than changes in expectations about future income, the optimal contract defers all present incentives into future payments by setting a present fixed wage. Despite this prediction, I further prove that several standard features of the contract with classical preferences [...] -no rents to the agent, conditions to achieve first-best cost and non-optimality of random contracts [...] -still hold. The second chapter studies the temporal path of subjective beliefs when a reference-dependent agent who experiences standard anticipatory utility and utility from changes in these anticipatory feelings waits T periods for a binary outcome realization. Following the optimal beliefs literature, in each period the agent chooses a belief about her likelihood of success to maximize her intertemporal utility. Consistent with the empirical evidence, the model predicts that optimism decreases as the pay-off date approaches if the outcome is important enough or if the agent is sufficiently loss averse. Intuitively, when the pay-off date is distant disappointment is less salient than the joy of hoping favorable outcomes; as the realization date gets closer, however, the threat of disappointment becomes important. Applying the model to the optimal timing of <b>productivity</b> <b>bonuses,</b> I find these should be granted as frequently as possible because optimism acts as a non-pecuniary motivator that allows the principal to induce the desired effort path at a cheaper expected cost...|$|R

This study therefore seeks {{to find out the}} impact of workforce diversity on organizational effectiveness using a Nigerian bank for the study. We used the Blau’s 1977 index of heterogeneity to measure the diversity index. While asset growth for the year 2008 and 2009, using 2007 and 2008 as base year was used to measure the growth strategy. To determine group diversity and performance outcomes moderated by workgroup context, a series of hierarchical regression analysis were conducted. The study finds significant correlation between some of the diversity variables as well as individual diversity variables with the measures of organizational effectiveness. Also it reveals that gender and ethnicity are negatively related to both employee <b>productivity</b> and performance <b>bonus.</b> In addition the study find that gender, age and tenure diversities are positively correlated and are significantly related. It is recommended that company executives use good strategies to effectively manage workforce diversity and collaborative research efforts should be done to ascertain the contextual variables that moderate workforce diversity to produce positive performance outcome...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} theoretically and empirically examines several topics {{relating to}} the Japanese labor market. Chapter II explores how the 2004 tax reform in Japan affected the income distribution of married women. Quantile difference-in-difference estimations and FFL and DFL decompositions indicate that i) the tax reform contributed to increasing work hours (and hence the incomes) of low-income married women, and ii) the kink at 1. 03 million yen in the budget line, which was made more conspicuous by the tax reform, dragged even medium- to high-income married women, who were not presumed {{to be affected by}} the tax reform, {{toward the center of the}} income distribution in response to an increase in their husbands' incomes. Consequently, the conventional distortion at 1. 03 million yen in the income distribution became stronger after the reform. Chapter III provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effect of performance-based layoffs on wage rigidity in the context of performance pay. In the model, it becomes optimal for firms to raise the future regular pay so as to maintain the workers' current efforts, which results in the downwardly rigid regular pay of experienced employees under the threat of performance-based layoffs. Together with the finding that layoffs are more likely to occur during recessions, this result has an implication on the downward rigidity of regular pay during recessions. Furthermore, it becomes optimal for firms to base wages less on workers' performance during recessions due to the lower value of <b>productivity.</b> Thus, <b>bonuses</b> move proportionally to the output price. The results from Japanese panel data set supported these theoretical implications. Chapter IV assesses the impact of Japan's reduction of weekly standard work hours on labor-market outcomes using the regression discontinuity approach: Although the reduction of standard hours reduced total hours worked, the monthly wages of existing workers did not decrease in response to the policy change. As a result, overall labor costs per hour increased, and we do not see any evidence of job creation. Even in Japan, where wages are determined flexibly, we observe evidence similar to that in European countries, where pay is largely determined through union-employer bargaining...|$|R
