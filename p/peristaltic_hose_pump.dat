50|$|A {{slurry pump}} {{is a type}} of {{centrifugal}} pump, lobe pump or <b>peristaltic</b> <b>hose</b> <b>pump</b> in physics principle that increases the pressure of liquid and solid particle mixture (aka slurry), through centrifugal force (a rotating impeller) and converts electrical energy into slurry potential and kinetic energy.|$|E
40|$|Pumping {{suspensions}} and pastes {{has always}} been a significant technological challenge in a number of industrial applications ranging from food processing to mining. Peristaltic pumps have become popular to pump and/or dose complex fluids, due to their robustness. During the transport of suspensions with peristaltic pumps, clogging issues may arise, particularly during transient operations. That is a matter of particular concern whenever the pumping device is used intermittently to generate flow only on demand. Further understanding of the transient dynamics of such systems and of the conditions that can lead to jamming would result in more robust peristaltic pump design. To achieve these goals, an experimental setup that simplifies the statorrotor assembly of a <b>peristaltic</b> <b>hose</b> <b>pump</b> was used. In this setup, a roller transfers momentum to a liquid suspension, upon application of a constant load. The evolution of the velocity of the roller was recorded for different concentrations of mono-dispersed spheres of different diameters. The flow is found not to be strongly dependent on the dispersed particle volume fraction, if the size of the suspended phase is comparable with the hose diameter. Conversely, the flow is strongly slowed down when their size is small and the particle concentration is increased. These findings could help improving the design of peristaltic pumps by a more appropriate sizing, given the diameter of the hose and that of the particles to be transported...|$|E
5000|$|Higher {{pressure}} <b>peristaltic</b> <b>hose</b> <b>pumps</b> {{which can}} typically operate against up to 16 bar in continuous service, use shoes (rollers only used on low pressure types) and have casings filled with lubricant to prevent abrasion of {{the exterior of}} the pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called [...] "hoses". This class of pump is often called a [...] "hose pump".|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} {{with the}} <b>hose</b> <b>pumps</b> over the roller pumps {{is the high}} operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a <b>hose</b> <b>pump</b> if the pumped medium is not abrasive. With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life and chemical compatibility, {{as well as the}} higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that <b>hose</b> <b>pumps</b> had over roller pumps continues to erode.|$|R

When the AFS was disbanded in 1968, the 4x2 Green Goddess units were auctioned, but the 4x4 version and Land Rovers and Austin Gipsys were mothballed against some future emergency. Local authority fire brigades could borrow Home Office vehicles to meet exceptional needs, and 500 Green Goddesses were brought out of retirement during the drought of 1976. The Government used Army personnel to man and operate fire appliances during the Firemen's strikes, including Home Office equipment brought out of storage.
