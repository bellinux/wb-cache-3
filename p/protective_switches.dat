This paper proposes a closed-loop non-destructive tester for high power multi-chip IGBT modules. Other than proposed elsewhere in the past, the solution put forward here includes the possibility to be used in closed-loop, by proper identification and monitoring of representative pre-failure signatures to automatically trigger the activation of a <b>protective</b> <b>switch</b> and prevent the failure of the device under test. The advantage is that devices of different characteristics (e. g., voltage range, type) can be tested without having to set a specific intervention delay for the protection circuit.

Along with this oxidative stress response, we recently characterized an elegant reversible disulfide bond-dependent protective mechanism in the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) of various Desulfovibrio species. Here, we searched for thiol redox systems involved in this mechanism. Using thiol fluorescent labeling, we show that glutathione is not the major thiol/disulfide balance-controlling compound in four different Desulfovibrio species and that no other plentiful low molecular weight thiol can be detected. Enzymatic analyses of two thioredoxins (Trxs) and three thioredoxin reductases allow us to propose the existence of two independent Trx systems in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH). The TR 1 /Trx 1 system corresponds to the typical bacterial Trx system. We measured a TR 1 apparent K(m) value for Trx 1 of 8. 9 mu M. Moreover, our results showed that activity of TR 1 was NADPH-dependent. The second system named TR 3 /Trx 3 corresponds to an unconventional Trx system as TR 3 used preferentially NADH (K(m) for NADPH, 743 mu M; K(m) for NADH, 5. 6 mu M), and Trx 3 was unable to reduce insulin.

40|$|Although quite {{a number}} of {{applications}} of spatial solitons can be envisaged, the main application is their use as a dynamic optical interconnection. Depending on the speed at which the optical interconnection can be redirected from one output to another, different possibilities arise. If the switching time is in the order of a second, then typically only reconfigurable interconnects are possible, e. g. <b>protective</b> <b>switching</b> (when one optical path fails, the optical signal is switched to a backup optical path). More interesting is the use as high speed optical modulators, but then typically switching times in the order of a nanosecond are necessary. It is clear that the switching speed will be determinant for which application solitons can be of practical use, but in general one can state: the faster the switching speed, the better. In this Chapter, when we speak about switching time, we refer to the time that it takes for the soliton to form when the optical beam is switched on. For applications as reconfigurable interconnects, the switching time is actually {{the time it takes to}} switch the optical signal from one output to another, but since this is much harder to describe theoretically, we stick to the simpler problem of switching on (or off) the soliton beam. Obviously, the temporal behavior of the soliton will be determined by the optical nonlinearity used for the soliton formation and different nonlinearities are important in liquid crystals with completely different typical timescales. Therefore, in the first part of this Chapter we will give an overview of the behavior of the two most important optical nonlinearities in liquid crystals, namely the reorientational and the thermal nonlinearity. The other nonlinearities will be summarized briefly. In the second part, results for the soliton formation time will be presented for the reorientational nonlinearity...|$|R

50|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are often}} the primary defense against current runaway, especially {{if there are no}} secondary fuses, so if an arc flash develops in a breaker there may be nothing to stop a flash from going out of control. Once an arc flash begins in a breaker, it can quickly migrate from a single circuit to the busbars of the panel itself, allowing very high energies to flow. Precautions must usually be used when switching circuit breakers, such as standing off to the side while switching to keep the body out of the way, wearing protective clothing, or turning off equipment, circuits and panels downline prior to switching. Very large switchgear is often able to handle very high energies and, thus, many places require the use of full <b>protective</b> equipment before <b>switching</b> one on.|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} vessel wall. Recent evidence suggests that chronic vascular inflammation ensues as an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Recently identified lipid mediators (eg, lipoxins and resolvins) play active roles in promoting the resolution of inflammation. Alterations in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, which manifest as a loss of contractile protein expression and increased proliferation and migration, are prominent mechanistic features of both atherosclerosis and restenosis following various interventions (eg, angioplasty and bypass grafting). We sought to determine whether human atherosclerosis {{is associated with a}} “resolution deficit” and whether lipoxins and resolvins influence VSMC phenotype. Here we report that plasma levels of aspirin-triggered lipoxin are significantly lower in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease than in healthy volunteers. Both aspirin-triggered lipoxin and resolvin E 1 block platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated migration of human saphenous vein SMCs and decrease phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β. Importantly, receptors for aspirin-triggered lipoxin and resolvin E 1 (ALX and ChemR 23, respectively) were identified in human VSMCs. Overall, these results demonstrate that stimulatory lipid mediators confer a <b>protective</b> phenotypic <b>switch</b> in VSMCs and elucidate new functions for these mediators in the regulation of SMC biology. These results also suggest that peripheral artery disease is associated with an inflammation-resolution deficit and highlight a potential therapeutic opportunity for the regulation of vascular injury responses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{striking}} {{feature in}} tumor biology is uncontrolled cell proliferation and growth. Any alteration in the genetic make up may cause cell cycle deregulation {{that leads to}} aberrant cell cycle re-entry. These cascades ultimately cause cancerous situation with unwanted cell growth and division. There are several factors in cell cycle events {{that can lead to}} cancerous situations, for instance, checkpoint breach, extracellular signals, malfunctioned protein kinases, re-expression of cyclins and cyclin-CDKs complex. A crucial function of cyclin-CDK complex is phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene that inhibits its ability to regulate the action of E 2 F transcription factor, which induces the gene expression and thus cause cell proliferation. To maintain the cellular homeostasis under tumorous condition, a line of <b>protective</b> mechanism is <b>switched</b> on such as availability of molecular chaperones; and if repair work fails, ubiquitin proteasome system comes in action. These regulatory mechanisms are highly conserved and {{play a critical role in}} maintaining several molecular events in the brain tumor or any stress situation.

The <b>protective</b> devices and <b>switches</b> {{play an important role in}} the reliability of electrical distribution systems by minimizing the impact of interruption. In this project, a method for identifying the type and location for protection devices and switches on the distribution system using cost-based optimization is proposed.

The proposed method is based on the existing reliability analysis and reliability analysis, after introducing various components, e. g., Sectionalizes, Auto-recloses and switching gantry. The detailed design of the protection devices and the switches are determined by minimizing the total cost of reliability that comprises apparatus investment, maintenance, and interruption cost.

40|$|PURPOSEIntergroup Exemestane Study (IES), an investigator-led {{study in}} 4, 724 {{postmenopausal}} patients with early-stage breast cancer has demonstrated clinically important benefits from switching adjuvant endocrine therapy after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to exemestane. Now, with longer follow-up, {{a large number}} of non-breast cancer-related events have been reported. Exploratory analyses describe breast cancer-free survival (BCFS) and explore incidence and patterns of the different competing events. PATIENTS AND METHODSPatients who were disease-free after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. At this planned analysis, the median follow-up was 91 months. Principal analysis focuses on 4, 052 patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive and 547 with ER-unknown tumors. ResultsIn all, 930 BCFS events have been reported (exemestane, 423; tamoxifen, 507), giving an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 81 (95 % CI, 0. 71 to 0. 92; P =. 001) in favor of exemestane in the ER-positive/ER unknown group. Analysis partitioned at 2. 5 years after random assignment showed that the on-treatment benefit of switching to exemestane (HR, 0. 60; 95 % CI, 0. 48 to 0. 75; P <. 001) was not lost post-treatment, but that there was no additional gain once treatment had ceased (HR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 80 to 1. 10; P =. 60). Improvement in overall survival was demonstrated, with 352 deaths in the exemestane group versus 405 deaths in the tamoxifen group (HR, 0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 75 to 0. 99; P =. 04). Of these, 222 were reported as intercurrent deaths (exemestane, 107; tamoxifen, 115). CONCLUSIONThe <b>protective</b> effect of <b>switching</b> to exemestane compared with continuing on tamoxifen on risk of relapse or death was maintained for at least 5 years post-treatment and was associated with a continuing beneficial impact on overall survival. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Urinary schistosomiasis, {{which is}} caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium, is a {{tropical}} disease infecting over 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection typically involves repeated re-infection with long-lived parasites, and field studies have demonstrated that protective immunity takes many years to develop in humans. In communities with endemic schistosomiasis, distinctive patterns of infection and schistosome-specific antibody responses are seen, including a peaked age-infection curve, a highly aggregated distribution of infection intensities among individuals, and an age-related switch in the subclasses of antibody produced. The antibody switch, which occurs naturally in older children, is also seen in younger children following treatment with the antihelminthic drug praziquantel, which kills adult worms. This study aimed to identify the important mechanisms underlying the slow development of protective immunity, using a mathematical modelling approach. Deterministic population-level and stochastic individual-based models were developed that describe how levels of infection and antibody change with age for individuals living in endemic communities. These models were used to explore different hypotheses for the slow development of protective immunity: (1) that schistosome parasites actively suppress protective immune responses; (2) that dying worms provide the main antigenic stimulus for protective immunity and (3) that a threshold level of antigen must be experienced before a protective immune response is initiated. Models were assessed for their ability to simultaneously reproduce different robust patterns of infection and antibody responses identified in cross-sectional and post-treatment field data from Zimbabwe. It was found that significant immunosuppression by schistosomes was not consistent with population-level patterns of infection intensity, including the peaked age-infection curve. In order to explain both age-related and post-treatment changes in infection intensity and antibody responses, including the antibody <b>switch,</b> <b>protective</b> antibody responses had to be stimulated by antigens from dying worms. Additionally, it was shown that these protective responses reduced worm fecundity rather than reducing rates of re-infection. An antigen threshold was found to be consistent with observed field patterns, but was not necessary to explain them. From a large number of possible models that were considered, a single model structure and a subset of parameter combinations were identified that were consistent with field data. This model was used to predict the longer-term impact of mass-treatment programmes upon the development of protective immunity, and the consequent effects on infection levels.

40|$|Prevalence of {{mutations}} and deregulated {{gene expression}} {{has resulted in}} a wide variety of tumor antigens which can be targeted for immunotherapy. NY-BR- 1 is a breast cancer associated differentiation antigen which is overexpressed in more than 60 % of breast cancers. In this study we established the first NY-BR- 1 expressing transplantable tumor model using the murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line EO 771 as parental cells for the generation of NY-BR- 1 -expressing transfectants (EONY cells) which are compatible for transplantation into HLA-DRB 1 * 0401 tg mice. Since NY-BR- 1 is not endogenously expressed in these mice, transplantation of NY-BR- 1 expressing tumors led to the induction of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells specific for HLA-DR* 0401 - and H 2 -Db-restcried NY-BR- 1 epitopes, respectively, previously identified in our lab. We also generated MHC I knockout cell lines with the aim of using them to study NK cell responses or as parental lines for transection of human MHC I molecules. Since several HLA-restricted NY-BR- 1 -specific T cell epitopes have been described, these cells could serve as an important tool to study the efficacy of using the epitopes as peptide vaccines and studying the synergistic effect of induced CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells in HLA-transgenic mice co-expressing human MHC I and MHC II molecules. Additionally, we also confirmed that previously identified H 2 -Db-restrcited epitope was indeed naturally processed based on detection of CD 8 + T cells which specifically recognized this epitope in mice following transplantation of NY-BR- 1 expressing tumors or upon immunization with global NY-BR- 1 antigen. We also observed that immunization with Ad. NY-BR- 1 was more suitable for generating a NY-BR- 1 specific CD 8 + T cell line compared to immunization with nonameric peptide. We also obtained evidence suggesting that the H 2 -Db-restricted CTL epitope might actually be identical to the core sequence of one of the previously identified HLA-DRB 1 * 0301 -restricted CD 4 + T cell epitopes. Thus binding of the CTL epitope to HLA-DRB 1 * 0301 molecules on feeder cells might have resulted in predominant restimulation of HLA-DR 3 B 1 * 0401 -restricted CD 4 + T cells in vitro. Cancer immunotherapy involving T cells have focused primarily on cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells. However, a body of evidence has emerged in the recent past that argues for including CD 4 + T cells because they not only eliminate tumor cells directly but also greatly enhance the outcome of cancer immunotherapy by various ways. One of the mechanisms by which CD 4 + T cells can contribute to successful immunotherapy is by repolarizing tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) into a less immunosuppressive phenotype in an antigen dependent fashion. In this study we could demonstrate that NY-BR- 1 specific CD 4 + T cells could repolarize M 2 -like macrophages towards an M 1 -like phenotype upon antigen specific interaction. However, the majority of the CD 4 + T cells infiltrating the EONY tumors appeared to have tumor promoting functions as depletion of CD 4 + T cells resulted in delayed tumor growth and was accompanied by switch in the polarization status of TAMs towards an M- 1 like phenotype. Though Ad. NY-BR- 1 immunization resulted in induction of NY-BR- 1 specific CD 4 + T cells and slight changes in polarization of intra-tumoral macrophages; it did not seem to drastically change the proportion of tumor-promoting CD 4 + T cells in the tumor since the <b>protective</b> effect and <b>switch</b> in TAM phenotype was observed in both control virus and Ad. NY-BR- 1 immunized mice. Therefore, antigen-specific instruction of TAMs by NY-BR- 1 -specific CD 4 + T cells could not be demonstrated in vivo, possibly due to the prevalence of tumor infiltrating CD 4 + T cells with a tumor promoting phenotype occurring in the EO 771 /NY-BR- 1 model established within this thesis...|$|R
