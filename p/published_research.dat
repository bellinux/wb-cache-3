5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of <b>published</b> <b>research</b> for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population {{studies that have been}} published. These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal <b>published</b> <b>research</b> finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{reputation}} was unsettled {{during the following}} centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania; {{while most of the}} Lithuanian Grand Dukes from Jogaila onward also reigned as Kings of Poland, the titles remained separate. Now generally considered the founder of the Lithuanian state, he is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization. In the 1990s the historian Edvardas Gudavičius <b>published</b> <b>research</b> supporting an exact coronation date – 6 July 1253. This day is now an official national holiday, Statehood Day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by <b>published</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are fifteen Scottish {{universities}}, some {{of which}} are amongst the oldest in the world. These include the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh—many of which are ranked amongst the best in the UK. Proportionally, Scotland had more universities in QS' World University Rankings' top 100 in 2012 than any other nation. The country produces 1% of the world's <b>published</b> <b>research</b> with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports. Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal <b>published</b> <b>research</b> {{in which}} women with {{long-term}} problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on {{the priority of}} the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the <b>published</b> <b>research</b> of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and <b>published</b> <b>research</b> into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently <b>published</b> <b>research</b> on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
