40|$|Protecting {{commodity}} systems running commercial Operating Systems (OSes) without significantly degrading {{performance or}} usability still {{remains an open}} problem. To make matters worse, the overall security depends on complex applications that perform multiple inter-dependent tasks with Internet-borne code. Recent research has shown the need for context-dependent trustworthy environments that can segregate different user activities to lower risk of cross-contamination and safeguard private information. In this paper, we introduce a novel BIOS-assisted mechanism for secure instantiation and management of trusted execution environments. A key design characteristic of our system is usability: the ability to quickly and securely switch between operating environments without requiring any specialized hardware or code modifications. Our aim is to eliminate any mutable, non-BIOS code sharing while securely reusing existing hardware: even when an untrusted environment is compromised, there is no potential for exfiltration or inference attacks. To safeguard against spoofing attacks, we can force the user to physically set a hardware switch, an action that cannot be reproduced by software. In addition, we provide visible indication to the user about the current running environment leveraging one of the front <b>panel</b> <b>Light</b> Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In our prototype, the entire switching process takes approximately six seconds on average. This empowers users to frequently and seamlessly alternate between trusted and untrusted environments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rats with {{combined}} lesions of the perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal (POR) cortices {{were trained}} on a complex {{discrimination in the}} simultaneous feature-positive and feature-negative discrimination task. In this task, a <b>panel</b> <b>light</b> (L) paired with an auditory stimulus determined whether a tone (T) or white noise (N) would be rewarded (1) or not rewarded (2). Thus, the light feature determined whether the target auditory stimuli were rewarded or not. In each session, trial types were LT 1, T 2, N 1, and LN 2. We had hypothesized that damage to the target regions would impair performance on this task. Acquisition was altered in the lesioned rats, {{but not in the}} predicted direction. Instead, lesioned rats exhibited significantly enhanced acquisition of the discrimination. Manipulation of intertrial intervals indicated that reduc-tion of proactive interference did not explain the enhancement. Lesioned rats were not different from controls on a multiple-cued inter-val timing task, providing evidence that the enhancement does not extend to all types of discriminations and is not due to a deficit in tim-ing. Other research shows that rats with PER lesions are impaired on similar tasks, thus the enhancement is likely due to the effects of POR damage. Normally in this task, context is thought to accrue inhibitory control over other cues. Without this inhibitory control, animals might be expected to learn the task more efficiently. Our conclusion is that deficits in processing contextual information underlie the enhanced acquisition observed in rats with combined PER and POR damage on this complex discrimination task.

40|$|Liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) {{light valve}} has {{recently}} been recognized as an alternative approach for the fabrication of active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD). The major advantage is matured silicon fabrication technology. Very advanced display drivers and fine pixels can be integrated together as a self-contained and high-resolution display. The aperture ratio of the silicon light valve can be higher than 90 % for good light efficiency and picture quality. As a result, the silicon light valve is very suitable for high-definition projection display, and has merits of high resolution, superior picture quality, high light efficiency and low power consumption. However, the silicon light valve used in projection display has a drawback in flicker. In this dissertation research, systematic approaches were used to study flicker mechanisms in silicon light valves. Four experiments were designed, {{and a variety of}} silicon light valve samples were prepared for the characterizations. It was found that there were five conduction mechanisms accounting for the flicker. They were residual DC charge on silicon surface, voltage holding capability of liquid crystal cell, voltage holding capability of silicon <b>panel,</b> <b>light</b> leakage and parasitic capacitor coupling. Through the systematic characterizations, major causes of flicker were identified. An empirical model of flicker was proposed with quantitative experimental data and theories. Solutions of flicker minimization were obtained. Among these solutions, offset of common voltage was found very useful to compensate for residual DC charge and parasitic capacitor coupling. Frame rate multiplication was found very useful for reducing the flicker due to low voltage holding capabilities of liquid crystal cell and silicon panel. Material and device optimization could also help minimize the flicker in different manners. With all these optimizations, flicker-free high-definition projection displays based on silicon light valve were demonstrated...|$|E
