It is shown, by focusing on the target position or within its close vicinity, that the narrow signal bandwidth permits the use of a moderate coherent integration time without range migration compensation. The multistatic nature, achieved through the use of multiple illumination sources, enables veloc-ity and acceleration estimation in two-dimensional horizontal directions on the ground. A cost function is developed based on the estimated motion parameters which, when three or more illuminators are available, allows rejection of ghost targets in a single-frequency network (SFN) and proper <b>parameter</b> <b>association</b> in the presence of multiple closely spaced moving targets.

40|$|AbstractA {{finite element}} {{parametric}} modeling method of aircraft wing structures is proposed {{in this paper}} because of time-consuming characteristics of finite element analysis pre-processing. The main research is positioned during the preliminary design phase of aircraft structures. A knowledge-driven system of fast finite element modeling is built. Based on this method, employing a template parametric technique, knowledge including design methods, rules, and expert experience {{in the process of}} modeling is encapsulated and a finite element model is established automatically, which greatly improves the speed, accuracy, and standardization degree of modeling. Skeleton model, geometric mesh model, and finite element model including finite element mesh and property data are established on parametric description and automatic update. The outcomes of research show that the method settles a series of problems of <b>parameter</b> <b>association</b> and model update in the process of finite element modeling which establishes a key technical basis for finite element parametric analysis and optimization design...|$|E
30|$|We further suggest Alu {{elements}} {{be a new}} complementary parameter to CI {{scores on}} the basis of the significantly positive correlation between the density of Alu elements and the score of chromatin interaction (Fig.  2). The Hi-C approach for knowing the genome-wide chromatin contact is undoubtedly remarkable, which makes the search for good ways to eliminate the bias and screen out high-quality pairs important. More than one model was raised to ensure the reliability of Hi-C data, which included procedures like reads quality and length controlling, epigenetic features testing, and controlling GC effects (Yaffe and Tanay 2011; Lu et al. 2013). Considering the significantly high correlation between Alu elements and Hi-C data, the Alu may also be involved in the Hi-C-normalization models as an important <b>parameter.</b> <b>Association</b> analysis between the amounts of Alu and distal regulatory DNA elements like enhancers demonstrated that enhancers are more abundant in regions not only with higher CI scores, but also higher Alu coverage (Fig.  4), which indicates that the density of Alu can act as an evAluator of CI analysis results.|$|E
40|$|Odds {{ratios and}} log-linear {{parameters}} are not collapsible, meaning that including a variable into the analysis or omitting one from it, {{may change the}} strength of association among the remaining variables. Even the direction of association may be reversed, a fact that is often discussed {{under the name of}} Simpson's paradox. A <b>parameter</b> of <b>association</b> is directionally collapsible, if this reversal cannot occur. The paper investigates the existence of <b>parameters</b> of <b>association</b> which are directionally collapsible. It is shown, that subject to two simple assumptions, no <b>parameter</b> of <b>association,</b> which depends only on the conditional distributions, like the odds ratio does, can be directionally collapsible. The main result is that every directionally collapsible <b>parameter</b> of <b>association</b> gives the same direction of association as a linear contrast of the cell probabilities does. The implication for dealing with Simpson's paradox is that there is exactly one way to associate direction with the association in any table, so that the paradox never occur...|$|R

A {{range of}} image intensity thresholds to define functional liver regions of interest, calculated {{as a percentage}} of maximum SC SPECT liver uptake from 20 to 70  % in increments of 2  %, were included in ROC analysis of FLV ratio, L/Smean ratio, and TLF ratio to maximize the ROC area under the curve (AUC). The maximum AUC image thresholds defined functional liver regions of interest and the SC SPECT metrics for all remaining statistical analysis. Significant differences in Wilcoxon rank sum of ROC-optimized SC SPECT parameters were tested between CTP classes. Spearman rank correlations between SC SPECT parameters and clinical liver function parameters were tabulated for the following categories: (1) composite liver function scoring systems (CTP score, ALBI grade), (2) individual quantitative liver function components (albumin, bilirubin, INR), and (3) individual qualitative clinical liver function components (encephalopathy, portal hypertension, ascites, and splenomegaly).

40|$|BACKGROUND Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is marked by}} high mortality rate. To date, no robust risk stratification by clinical or molecular prognosticators of cancer-specific survival (CSS) has been established for early stages. Transcriptional profiling of small non-coding RNA gene products (miRNAs) seems promising for prognostic stratification. The expression of miR- 21 and miR- 126 was analysed in a large cohort of RCC patients; a combined risk score (CRS) -model was constructed based on expression levels of both miRNAs. METHODS Expression of miR- 21 and miR- 126 was evaluated by qRT-PCR in tumour and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue in n = 139 clear cell RCC patients. Relation of miR- 21 and miR- 126 expression with various clinical parameters was assessed. Parameters were analysed by uni- and multivariate COX regression. A factor derived from the z-score resulting from the COX model was determined for both miRs separately and a combined risk score (CRS) was calculated multiplying the relative expression of miR- 21 and miR- 126 by this factor. The best fitting COX model was selected by relative goodness-of-fit with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). RESULTS RCC with and without miR- 21 up- and miR- 126 downregulation differed significantly in synchronous metastatic status and CSS. Upregulation of miR- 21 and downregulation of miR- 126 were independently prognostic. A combined risk score (CRS) based on the expression of both miRs showed high sensitivity and specificity in predicting CSS and prediction was independent from any other clinico-pathological <b>parameter.</b> <b>Association</b> of CRS with CSS was successfully validated in a testing cohort containing patients with high and low risk for progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS A combined expression level of miR- 21 and miR- 126 accurately predicted CSS in two independent RCC cohorts and seems feasible for clinical application in assessing prognosis...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} convincingly shown that {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in HFE and TMPRSS 6 are associated with iron parameters. It was commonly thought that these associations {{could be explained by}} the intermediate effect on hepcidin concentration. A recent study in an isolated Italian population, however, concluded that these associations were not exclusively dependent on hepcidin values. We report here the second study to investigate the role of hepcidin in the associations between common variants in HFE and TMPRSS 6 with iron parameters. METHODS: We extracted 101 SNPs in HFE and TMPRSS 6 from genome-wide imputed SNP data of 1832 individuals from the general population (Nijmegen Biomedical Study). Single locus and haplotype associations with serum iron parameters and hepcidin were studied using linear regression analyses. RESULTS: We found that HFE rs 1800562 and TMPRSS 6 rs 855791 are the main determinants of HFE and TMPRSS 6 related variation in serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and total iron binding capacity. These SNPs are associated with the ratios hepcidin/ferritin (p 0. 2). Adjustment for hepcidin or the ratio hepcidin/ferritin did not decrease the strength of the SNP-iron <b>parameter</b> <b>associations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support an intermediate role for hepcidin in the SNP-iron <b>parameter</b> <b>associations,</b> which confirms previous findings, and indicate a pleiotropic SNP effect on the hepcidin ratios and the iron parameters. Taken together, this suggests that there might be other, yet unknown, serum hepcidin independent mechanisms which {{play a role in the}} association of HFE and TMPRSS 6 variants with serum iron parameters...|$|R

In such studies, the failure time of interest is often not exactly observed, but known to fall within some interval. For multivariate interval-censored data, each subject may experience multiple events, each of which is interval-censored. This thesis studies four research problems related to regression analysis and association study of multivariate interval-censored data.
