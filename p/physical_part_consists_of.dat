On the one hand, the <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> {{a large number}} of subsystems which exhibit predominantly continuous dynamics, sometimes with (infrequent) discontinuities. On the other hand, the distributed computerised control systems constitute complex discretetime and discrete-event systems that require completely different modelling and simulation methods. For an evaluation of the behaviour and the performance of the overall system, both types of models have to be combined and simulated efficiently. This contribution presents the requirements for a modelling environment for such systems and discusses an approach that consists of object-oriented modelling and efficient simulation of the physical part using the physical systems modelling language MODELICA, a software environment for the definition of discrete-event models using various formalisms, and the integration of both parts of the system via model translation. The coordination of both parts is performed by the MODELICA simulator. The modelling environment called DES/M (discrete-event systems for Modelica) supports the interoperation of different domain specific discrete-event formalisms. To illustrate the usage of the environment, a laboratory batch plant model is presented. A more elaborate example is described in another contribution in this volume (Mosterman et al., 2002). ...|$|E

The second <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a settlement by denial of the defendant. The third <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a settlement by {{the silence of the}} defendant consequent upon the absence of any admission or denial. Release: The first <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> release by way of renunciation of a right. The second <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> release by admission of payment. This book includes chapters dealing with conclusion of a contract of settlement and release, the consideration and subject matter of the settlement, {{the subject matter of the}} settlement, and fundamental conditions governing settlement and release.|$|R
