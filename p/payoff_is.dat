25|$|In their model, {{a country}} starts as a nondemocratic {{society in which}} a small rich group {{controls}} most of the wealth and rules the poor majority. As the ruling class, the rich receive taxation from the economy's output and they decide on the taxation rate as {{the only means of}} extraction. The poor majority can either take what is offered to them by the rich after they tax the output (the economy's output after tax divided by the population size), or they can choose to revolutionize against the ruling class, which comes with a certain cost. In a revolution, the poor's ultimate <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> the benefit of the revolution minus the cost of the revolution. Under that circumstance, the payoff of the rich ruling class is split between, when the poor revolutionizes, the punishment for the ruling class and when the poor acquiesces, the taxation income.|$|E
40|$|We {{find the}} Nash equilibria for {{monotone}} n-player symmetric games where each player chooses whether to participate. Examples include market entry games, coordination games, and the bar-room game {{depicted in the}} movie 'A Beautiful Mind'. The symmetric Nash equilibrium involves excessive participation (a common property resource problem) if participants’ <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> decreasing (in the number of participants), and insufficient participation if <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> increasing. With decreasing <b>payoffs</b> there can <b>be</b> many equilibria, but with increasing <b>payoffs</b> there <b>are</b> only three. Some comparative static properties of changing one player’s participation <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> counter-intuitive, especially with more than two players. common property resource problem; comparative statics; coordination; market entry; mixed strategy equilibrium; Nash equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Risky {{strategies}} with payoff mean {{changed in}} 2 × 2 simulation-based game: a normal distribution case The authors investigate the Nash equilibrium payoff in the 2 × 2 simulation-based game {{where the two}} strategic <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> Normal distribution and the equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> realized after the decision-making. The researchers show that the risk premiums {{are a part of}} the means of equilibrium payoffs due to the compensation of the risky strategies. The authors also show that the equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> not necessary to be the same as normal distribution where it’s assumed the dominant strategic payoff, but will become normal distribution only when the distance between the means of two strategic <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> large enough. This is revealed by the skewed and kurtosis coefficients, which approach to 0 and 3 respectively, even though they are negatively related with the average of the equilibrium payoffs. The most important result is that there is no linear relationship between the means and standard deviations of the equilibrium payoffs, but the mean of the equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> a concave function with respect of the standard deviation of the equilibrium payoffs...|$|R

Usually the investor {{would be able}} to then trade both legs separately. Although the initial <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> similar to a plain vanilla one, the Packaged Convertibles would then have different dynamics and risks associated with them since at maturity the holder would not receive some cash or shares but some cash and potentially some share.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} anti-coordination games has been {{extended}} to multi-player situation. A crowding game {{is defined as a}} game where each player's <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> non-increasing over the number of other players choosing the same strategy (i.e., a game with negative network externalities). For instance, a driver could take U.S. Route 101 or Interstate 280 from San Francisco to San Jose. While 101 is shorter, 280 is considered more scenic, so drivers might have different preferences between the two independent of the traffic flow. But each additional car on either route will slightly increase the drive time on that route, so additional traffic creates negative network externalities, and even scenery-minded drivers might opt to take 101 if 280 becomes too crowded. A congestion game is a crowding game in networks. The [...] minority game is a game where the only objective for all players is to be part of smaller of two groups. A well-known example of the minority game is the El Farol Bar problem proposed by W. Brian Arthur.|$|E

This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, saying: [...] "This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot—it's mice on a treadmill, running and running and not getting anywhere."

30|$|Third, if the {{material}} payoffs of both games are sufficiently asymmetric (i.e., individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to themselves), {{the outcome in}} which the sum of {{the material}} <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it concludes that in the outcome where {{the sum of the}} material <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> being maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own material payoffs by doing it). The reason is that in this case, the emotional <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase their material payoffs by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional payoffs instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very nice).|$|R
2500|$|The leader {{wants to}} choose [...] to {{maximise}} its payoff [...] However, in equilibrium, it knows the follower will choose [...] as above. So {{in fact the}} leader wants to maximise its payoff [...] (by substituting [...] for the follower's best response function). By differentiation, the maximum <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> given by [...] Feeding this into the follower's best response function yields [...] Suppose marginal costs were equal for the firms (so the leader has no market advantage other than first move) and in particular [...] The leader would produce 2000 and the follower would produce 1000. This would give the leader a profit (payoff) of two million and the follower a profit of one million. Simply by moving first, the leader has accrued twice the profit of the follower. However, Cournot profits here are 1.78 million apiece (strictly, [...] apiece), so the leader has not gained much, but the follower has lost. However, this is example-specific. There may be cases where a Stackelberg leader has huge gains beyond Cournot profit that approach monopoly profits (for example, if the leader also had a large cost structure advantage, perhaps due to a better production function). There may also be cases where the follower actually enjoys higher profits than the leader, but only because it, say, has much lower costs. This behaviour consistently work on duopoly markets even if the firms are asymmetrical.|$|E

40|$|A price-setting {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate whether a proposed governmental subsidy system to reduce sales and production of environmentally harmful products would maintain competition, as required by EU regulations. Dyads of participants {{played the role of}} producers, independently setting unit prices for their products in a sequence of trials with feedback. In experimental conditions a subsidy was paid for unsold units, a system which had previously been found to raise prices and reduce the number of units sold. For half of the dyads in each condition the <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual, in the other half they were split equally to motivate cooperation. Substantiating that the subsidy did not eliminate competition, the prices were set lower and incomes were lower when the <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual than when they were split equally. The participants also adjusted their prices to increase their own payoff, taking into account the prices set by the others when the <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual—which they did not when the <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> split equally. The results support the claim that the proposed subsidy system is effective in raising prices so that sales and production of environmentally harmful products can be reduced without eliminating competition. ...|$|R
