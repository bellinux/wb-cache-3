40|$|We {{argue that}} some word order {{phenomena}} in Romanian and Sardinian {{are the result}} of a checking operation in the left periphery involving verum focus (i. e. focus on the polarity component of the sentence). In particular, this operation accounts for some word order patterns found in polar questions. In Romanian, polarity fronting is realized as head-movement of (V+) T to a higher <b>peripheral</b> <b>head</b> which bears a Focus-probe. This licenses VS orders for predications in which VS is not allowed as a neutral order (i-level predicates, iteratives, generics). In Sardinian, an entire phrase headed by the lexical predicate (verbal non-finite form or non-verbal predicate) is fronted before the auxiliary. We argue that this order is obtained by two movement operations, head-raising of Aux to Foc and movement of the predicate phrase to SpecFoc. We also present the semantics of polarity focus, distinguishing several types of focus (informational, emphatic, contrastive) ...|$|R

In addition, cells with similar morphology as described for dendritic cells in trout were abundant among the isolated leucocytes.

40|$|Normal snapper (Pagrus auratus Bloch and Schneider) serum was {{examined}} for natural IgM that binds to protease (bromelain) treated sheep erythrocytes (BrSRBC) {{in a model}} assay system {{that has been used}} to appraise natural IgM of various mammals. Normal snapper serum lysed BrSRBC while haemolysis was abrogated by heat inactivation of serum and in divalent cation-deficient conditions, indicative of classical complement mediated lysis. In addition, heat inactivated normal snapper serum agglutinated BrSRBC while phosphatidylcholine (PtC) liposomes partially inhibited both haemolysis and agglutination. Inhibition of haemolysis and agglutination may have been mediated by an interaction between immunoglobulin (Ig) and PtC as protein A purified snapper Ig bound to PtC liposomes. However it is not known if this binding was PtC specific nor if the binding was initiated by either the Fab and/or Fc domains of snapper Ig.

40|$|Six {{species of}} {{cardinalfishes}} (Pisces: Apogonidae) are found together in shallow marine waters of Hawaii day and night. All six species remain in holes and caves {{during the day}} and emerge at night when they feed. The centers of abundance, ecological ranges, and other requirements of the six species differ during their life histories. During the day, Foa brachygramma is found in crevices or rubble on shallow, calm reef flats and unlike the other species may enter areas of low salinity and poor circulation. Young Foa are found under ledges in deeper water than are adults. Apogon menesemus is most abundant in clear, relatively deep water, especially where the substrate is almost completely covered by live coral. It lives at the back of holes or caves. Apogon erythrinus frequently inhabits small, dark holes in either dead coral heads or basalt cliff caves. Apogonichthys waikiki is most often found in pairs in large, widely spaced living coral heads. Apogon maculiferus adults are found under ledges and in caves at depths of over 20 meters. Young A. maculiferus aggregations are found in shallow water under ledges or at cave entrances. Apogon snyderi has the widest habitat distribution, although it is restricted to substrates with some sand. It lives in the middle of caves close to the floor, and under rubble, coral <b>heads,</b> or <b>ledges.</b> Each species reacts differently to increasing or decreasing light levels. Generally, a species' response to a given amount of light in the laboratory is similar in the field. In shallow water, adult Apogonichthys waikiki is not seen outside holes unless light intensity is less than 1. 75 fc. Apogon erythrinus emerges or enters holes at about ± 5 fc, A. menesemus at about 16 fc, and A. snyderi at about 88 fc. Adult Foa brachygramma leaves or enters cover at about 2400 fc, young Foa at about 700 fc. Adult Apogon maculiferus emerge and enter cover at about 100 fc and young A. maculiferus at about 2700 fc. Diurnal predators remove more individuals of species living in brighter light intensities; cavedwelling predators remove those living in lower light intensities. At night all species are opportunistic carnivores on zooplankton and benthic invertebrates, but there are differences in their foraging locations. Apogon snyderi and A. maculiferus forage mostly over light-colored substrates, but A. maculiferus feeds nearer dawn, higher in the water, in aggregations, and closer to large objects than does A. snyderi. Apogon erythrinus is found no more than 3 cm from hard substrates, vertical and horizontal. The other three species are found near large underwater objects. Foa brachygramma remains near the bottom when there is a current, and groups of fish rise in the water column on quiet nights when there is a half to full moon. Apogon menesemus is most often found in midwater and is often located in the shadow of large underwater objects on moonlit nights. Apogonichthys waikiki hovers near holes in the isolated coral heads where it is found diurnally. Nocturnal predators take individuals of all species except A. waikiki...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} roles of {{prolactin}} (PRL) and GH in {{the control of the}} immune system, the effects of environmental salinity, hypophysectomy, and PRL and GH administration on several immune functions were examined in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Transfer from fresh water (FW) to seawater (SW) did not alter plasma levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and lysozyme. The superoxide anion (O 2) production in head kidney leucocytes accompanied by phagocytosis was elevated in SWacclimated fish over the levels observed in FW fish. Hypophysectomy of the fish in FW resulted in a reduction in O 2 production in leucocytes isolated from the head kidney, whereas there was no significant change in plasma levels of IgM or lysozyme. Treatment with tilapia GH and PRLs (PRL 177 and PRL 188) enhanced O 2 production in vitro in head kidney leucocytes in a dose-related manner. Extrapituitary expression of two PRLs, GH and IGF-I mRNA was detected in lymphoid tissues and cells such as head kidney, spleen, intestine and leucocytes from <b>peripheral</b> blood and <b>head</b> kidney. PRL-receptor mRNA was detected in head kidney leucocytes, and the level of expression was higher in SW-acclimated fish than that in FW fish.

The initial characterization of the patients participating in the phase Ib and phase II studies has previously been reported. After rhIL- 12 treatment, fewer secondary follicles with a broader outer region of the mantle zones and an increase in interfollicular B-blasts were seen in the enlarged lymph nodes compared with control HNSCC patients. The size of the germinal center (GC) was diminished, partly due to a {{decrease in the number of}} CD 57 + GC cells that have been associated with immune suppression. These changes did not correlate with signs of apoptosis or CXCR 5 expression by B cells. Strikingly, in 3 out of 4 IL- 12 treated patients, increased IFN-gamma mRNA expression by B cells was detected. In addition, a highly significant IgG subclass switch was seen in the plasma with more IgG 1, less IgG 2 and more IgG 4, indicating a switch to T helper 1 phenotype. Finally, peritumoral B cell infiltration was a positive prognostic sign for overall survival in the 30 HNSCC patients investigated, irrespective of IL- 12 treatment. In conclusion, these data indicate that after i. t. IL- 12 treatment in HNSCC, significant activation of the B cell and the B cell compartment occurred and that the presence of tumor infiltrating B cells correlated with overall survival of HNSCC patients...|$|R

In cancer, their frequency is increased; however, Tr 1 -mediated suppression mechanisms {{are not yet}} defined. Here, we evaluate the simultaneous involvement of ectonucleotidases (CD 39 /CD 73) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) in Tr 1 -mediated suppression. Human Tr 1 cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived, sorted CD 4 +CD 25 − T cells and incubated with autologous immature dendritic cells, irradiated COX- 2 + or COX- 2 − tumor cells, and IL- 2, IL- 10, and IL- 15 (each at 10 – 15 IU/ml) for 10 days as described (Bergmann, C., Strauss, L., Zeidler, R., Lang, S., and Whiteside, T. L. (2007) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56, 1429 – 1442). Tr 1 were phenotyped by multicolor flow cytometry, and suppression of proliferating responder cells was assessed in carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based assays. ATP hydrolysis was measured using a luciferase detection assay, and levels of adenosine or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in cell supernatants were analyzed by mass spectrometry or ELISA, respectively. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The COX- 2 + tumor induced {{a greater number of}} Tr 1 than COX- 2 − tumor (p < 0. 05). Tr 1 induced by COX- 2 + tumor were more suppressive, hydrolyzed more exogenous ATP (p < 0. 05), and produced higher levels of adenosine and PGE 2 (p < 0. 05) than Tr 1 induced by COX- 2 − tumor. Inhibitors of ectonucleotidase activity, A 2 A and EP 2 receptor antagonists, or an inhibitor of the PKA type I decreased Tr 1 -mediated suppression (p < 0. 05), whereas rolipram, a PDE 4 inhibitor, increased the intracellular cAMP level in responder cells and their susceptibility to Tr 1 -mediated suppression. Tr 1 present in tumors or the <b>peripheral</b> blood of <b>head</b> and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients co-expressed COX- 2, CD 39, and CD 73.

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} often {{successful}} and problematic {{because of their}} ability to persist in disturbed and undisturbed environments despite weed management practices. Understanding reproduction and dispersal strategies in these species can aid in developing management approaches to help control their spread. Centaurea melitensis, a nonnative invasive with European origins, is found in disturbed areas of southern California. It produces three different types of flower heads that develop at different times and at different locations on the plant during the growing season. The chasmogamous (CH) flower heads are located {{at the top of the}} plant, the initial cleistogamous (iCL) heads are located at the base of the plant and at some branch and axillary points, and the final cleistogamous (fCL) heads are located along the stem and at some branch points. This pattern differs from that in Centaurea solstitialis, its most closely related congener, which develops one type of flower head with two morphologically distinct achenes within each flower head: peripheral and center achenes. The overall objective of this study was to examine potential differences between peripheral and center achenes of Centaurea melitensis, including morphological differences in dispersal features, potential differences in response to temperature, tendency to disperse, dormancy and viability. The approach involved selecting whole plants from the field and separating peripheral and center achenes from each of the three head types. Morphological differences were assessed by measuring mass, fruit length, fruit width, pappus length, pappus width, and elaiosome features. Temperature response patterns were evaluated by exposing peripheral and center achenes to temperatures ranging from 5 C to 30 C and measuring germination. Tendency of different achene types to remain in the flower heads was assessed by comparing ratios of peripheral to center achenes in heads immediately after maturation (March to June) to the ratios remaining in heads in early fall (September). Viability and dormancy testing was performed using a cut test and tetrazolium chloride tests in conjunction with germination tests. Results of these studies indicate that peripheral achenes of Centaurea melitensis were lighter and narrower, with shorter pappi and smaller elaiosomes than center achenes. Peripheral achenes responded similarly to their center counterparts in germination response to temperature, but the pattern differed among head types. Broad temperature optima were observed within the fCL and CH heads and a narrow optimum was observed in iCL. There was no evidence that the peripheral achenes remained in the heads longer than the center achenes. Ratios of peripheral to center achenes were 3. 8 : 1 in CH heads, 2. 23 : 1 in iCL heads, and 1. 94 : 1 in fCL <b>heads.</b> <b>Peripheral</b> achenes were more likely to be dormant while maintaining viability than center achenes were. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that peripheral and center achenes of Centaurea melitensis differ morphologically. Dispersal features, such as pappi and elaiosomes, were more highly developed in center achenes than in peripheral achenes, but these differences were not reflected in differences in behavior to the extent we could measure it (i. e., the tendency to remain in heads or the germination responses to temperature). Differences between peripheral and center achenes of Centaurea melitensis trended in the same direction as differences seen in its closely related congener, Centaurea solstitialis, which has center achenes that disperse more readily than peripheral achenes. However, the differences observed in Centaurea melitensis were not as pronounced as those seen in Centaurea solstitialis...|$|R
