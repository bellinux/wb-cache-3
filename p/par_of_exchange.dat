60|$|When {{bills on}} foreign {{countries}} {{are at a}} premium, it is customary {{to say that the}} exchanges are against the country, or unfavorable to it. In order to understand these phrases, we must take notice of what “the exchange,” in the language of merchants, really means. It means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries. Supposing $4.86 to be the exact <b>par</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> then when it requires more than $1,000 to buy a bill of £205, $1,000 of American money are worth less than their real equivalent of English money: and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the United States. The only persons in the United States, however, to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in England, for they come into the bill market as buyers, and have to pay a premium; but to those who have money to receive in England the same state of things is favorable; for they come as sellers and receive the premium. The premium, however, indicates that a balance is due by the United States, which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals; and since, according to the old theory, the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country, this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive, and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay; and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice.|$|E

[81] These notes, {{estimated}} to amount to {{no less than}} six thousand million marks, are now a source of embarrassment and great potential loss to the Belgian Government, inasmuch as on their recovery of the country they took them over from their nationals in exchange for Belgian notes {{at the rate of}} Fr. 120 = Mk. 1. This rate of exchange, being substantially in excess {{of the value of the}} mark-notes at the rate of exchange current at the time (and enormously in excess of the rate to which the mark notes have since fallen, the Belgian franc being now worth more than three marks), was the occasion of the smuggling of mark-notes into Belgium on an enormous scale, to take advantage of the profit obtainable. The Belgian Government took this very imprudent step, partly because they hoped to persuade the Peace Conference to make the redemption of these bank-notes, at the <b>par</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> a first charge on German assets. The Peace Conference held, however, that Reparation proper must take precedence of the adjustment of improvident banking transactions effected at an excessive rate of exchange. The possession by the Belgian Government of this great mass of German currency, in addition to an amount of nearly two thousand million marks held by the French Government which they similarly exchanged for the benefit of the population of the invaded areas and of Alsace-Lorraine, is a serious aggravation of the exchange position of the mark. It will certainly be desirable for the Belgian and German Governments to come to some arrangement as to its disposal, though this is rendered difficult by the prior lien held by the Reparation Commission over all German assets available for such purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{volatility}} {{of the world}} economy since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods <b>par</b> value system <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rates has led many policymakers and economists to call for reform of the international monetary system. Many critics of the current "non-system" call for tighter international rules of the game in macroeconomic policy making. The proposed systems cover a wide spectrum of measures including maintaining the current flexible exchange rate system but with increased consultations between the major economies; a "target zone " system as advocated by John Williamson; or a full return to a system <b>of</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> rates as advocated by Ronald McKinnon This paper presents and applies a methodology useful for studying the operating characteristics of a number of alternative monetary arrangements using a large-scale simulation model {{of the world economy}}. We consider the performance of the regimes when policymakers do or do not observe the shocks, and when policymakers infer the shocks using an optimal filtering rule. Although the results are model specific and at best illustrative of the issues involved, the approach does have the advantage of providing a richer framework of analysis than is possible in simple models of international interdependence. ...|$|R

5000|$|This rate, {{known as}} the mint <b>par</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> did not {{necessarily}} coincide with the corresponding market exchange rates. The balance of trade between the countries determined the actual rate of exchange. If England has a negative balance of trade with France, for instance, currency of equal magnitude is remitted to France, which thus creates a demand for French currency. Procurement of that currency involves payment of a premium referred to as agio. It refers to exchange rate.|$|E

In this chapter, {{the use of a}} set of fixed permutations to improve the statistics <b>of</b> the <b>PAR</b> <b>of</b> a PC-OFDM signal is presented. For this technique, interleavers are used to produce K- 1 permuted sequences from the same information sequence. The sequence with the lowest PAR, among K sequences is chosen for the transmission. The <b>PAR</b> <b>of</b> a PC-OFDM signal can be further reduced by 3 - 4 dB by this technique.

40|$|The {{use of a}} set {{of fixed}} {{permutations}} has recently been proposed for peak-to-average power ratio (<b>PAR)</b> reduction <b>of</b> an OFDM signal. Sending the identity of the used permutation to the receiver reliably is critical in this method. This paper presents the use of data permutation with embedded side information (SI) to reduce the <b>PAR</b> <b>of</b> an OFDM signal. SI is coded using a simple forward-error-correction code and inserted into the information sequence. The <b>PARs</b> <b>of</b> the permuted sequences and the original information sequence are then computed using IDFTs. The sequence with the lowest PAR is chosen for the transmission. The PAR statistics do not degrade due to the inclusion of SI.
