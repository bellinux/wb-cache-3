40|$|During Phase I, we {{successfully}} processed air atomized aluminum powders via Dynamic Magnetic Compaction (DMC) pressing and subsequent sintering to produce parts with properties similar to wrought aluminum. We have also showed {{for the first}} time that aluminum powders can be processed without lubes via <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintering</b> to 100 % density. This will preclude a delube cycle in sintering and promote environmentally friendly P/M processing. Processing aluminum powders via <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintering</b> with minimum shrinkage will enable net shape fabrication. Aluminum powders processed via a conventional powder metallurgy process produce too large a shrinkage. Because of this, sinter parts have to be machined into specific net shape. This results in increased scrap and cost. Fully sintered aluminum alloy under this Phase I project has shown good particle-to-particle bonding and mechanical properties. We have also shown the feasibility of preparing nano composite powders and processing via pressing and sintering. This was accomplished by dispersing nano silicon carbide (SiC) powders into aluminum matrix comprising micron-sized powders (< 100 microns) using a proprietary process. These composite powders of Al with nano SiC were processed using DMC press and sinter process to sinter density of 85 - 90 %. The process optimization along with sintering needs to be carried out to produce full density composites...|$|E

Kaolinite, sinter magnesite, talc and pyrophyllite as natural raw materials and Al 2 O 3, MgO and SiO 2 as synthetic powders were used to obtain the synthetic cordierite. 6 different mixtures were prepared for the selected three target compositions in the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-SiO 2 quaternary diagram. Each mixture was milled in a planetary ball mill followed by pressing in an unaxial <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintering</b> in an electrical furnace at 1350 oC for 1, 3 and 5 hours. Sintered cordierite bodies were characterized using X-ray diffraction(XRD), Archimedes method and three point bending strength tests. It was shown that the cordierite ceramics produced from natural raw materials had denser structure, finer porosity, lower water absorption and better bending strength than those produced from synthetic powders...|$|E

While being biocompatible, antibacterial, and photo-catalyst, {{the presence of}} this bio-ceramic enhances corrosion resistance of implants (Cho et al. 2008). Also, it is able to absorb H 2 O and form titanium hydroxide (Ti–OH) groups on the surface, which is a factor in formation of apatite in simulated body fluid (SBF) (Beherei et al. 2009). There are reports of fabrication of Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 (Habibpanah et al. 2011), HA/TiO 2 (Enayati-Jazi et al. 2012), HA/Al 2 O 3 (Viswanath and Ravishankar 2006) composites for medical applications. However, there are no reports of fabrication HA–TiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 nanobiomaterial by cold-press and sintering method. Thus, in this study, two HA–TiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 nanobiomaterials with different weight percentage of ingredients fabricated by cold <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintering</b> method.

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{technical}} report for the Department of Energy NETL project NT 01931 Energy Efficient <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sinter</b> of Titanium Powder for Low-Cost Components in Vehicle Applications. Titanium {{has been identified as}} one of the key materials with the required strength that can reduce the weight of automotive components and thereby reduce fuel consumption. Working with newly developed sources of titanium powder, Webster-Hoff will develop the processing technology to manufacture low cost vehicle components using the single press/single sinter techniques developed for iron based powder metallurgy today. Working with an automotive or truck manufacturer, Webster-Hoff will demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing a <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinter</b> titanium component for a vehicle application. The project objective is two-fold, to develop the technology for manufacturing <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinter</b> titanium components, <b>and</b> to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle application. The lowest cost method for converting metal powder into a net shape part is the Powder Metallurgy <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sinter</b> Process. The method involves compaction of the metal powder in a tool (usually a die and punches, upper and lower) at a high pressure (up to 60 TSI or 827 MPa) to form a green compact with the net shape of the final component. The powder in the green compact is held together by the compression bonds between the powder particles. The sinter process then converts the green compact to a metallurgically bonded net shape part through the process of solid state diffusion. The goal of this project is to expand the understanding <b>and</b> application of <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinter</b> technology to Titanium Powder applications, developing techniques to manufacture net shape Titanium components via the <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinter</b> process. In addition, working with a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle. This is not a research program, but rather a project to develop a process for <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinter</b> of net shape Titanium components. All of these project objectives have been successfully completed...|$|R

The four types of rhenium included chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and three powder metallurgy (PM) types, i. e., rolled sheet <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintered</b> bars, with <b>and</b> without hot isostatic pressure (HIP) treatment.

A similar spread was also obtained for material tested at 1088 K and 1644 K. The wide variance observed with the different materials indicated that the rhenium manufacturing process, material composition and prior handling strongly dictated its properties.

40|$|Residue powders {{resulting}} from cutting and machining operations in slate quarries were processed by a <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>sintering</b> route to manufacture ceramic {{products such as}} flooring and roofing tiles. The {{first part of this}} work consisted of a laboratory study carried out by uniaxially pressing the powders to shape and sintering in air using a muffle type furnace. A plan of sintering experiments was followed in order to evaluate the effect of some processing parameters: particle size distribution of the rock waste powders, compacting pressure and sintering cycle (heating and cooling rates, sintering temperature). The sintering tests have shown that the density of the sintered specimens increased gradually up to 1150 - 1170  °C and then started decreasing. The second stage of this study was carried out at an industrial scale. Since particle size of the raw material was found to be an important parameter, atomisation was used to homogenise the particle dimensions and ensure proper feeding of the pressing systems. Moreover, atomisation {{is the best way to}} treat very fine wastes, both for economical and technical reasons. Tiles with the dimensions 200 mm× 100 mm× 7  mm were then uniaxially pressed at 40  MPa and subsequently sintered at temperatures close to 1150  °C.
