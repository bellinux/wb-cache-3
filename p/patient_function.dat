If UB is a symptom of an underlying disease or disorder, treatment of the disease itself can reduce the severity of UB and may eradicate it completely. This was seen in patients with Moyamoya disease who had bilateral frontal lobe infarctions which resulted in UB. Upon treatment, the UB was resolved due to 60-70% shrinkage of the anterior lobe hypodensities.

5000|$|Cancer {{rehabilitation}} providers {{focus on}} improving each patient’s functional status. Using an interdisciplinary model of care, professionals identify patients’ goals, improve their function, develop a patient and family centered plan {{of care that}} accounts for medical, physical, psychological and social components. The aim is helping patients improve their cancer-related symptoms and treatment side effects, while promoting optimal <b>patient</b> <b>function</b> at home, work and in the community. Additionally, cancer rehabilitation physicians work on identifying musculoskeletal and neurologic problems and treat them {{with a variety of}} treatments including medications, procedures and therapy. Some of those procedures include, but are not limited to, various types of injections and other procedures. Therapeutic exercises include those guided by physical, occupational and speech therapists to work on specific motor or cognitive impairments as well as difficulties performing activities of daily living (ADLs) (dressing, bathing, toileting etc) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as house cleaning, shopping, etc. However, patient-driven general exercise to maintain or improve endurance and overall functional status is also {{an important component of the}} rehabilitation process. Because cancer patients’ problems typically are complex and survivors have a high likelihood of developing physical, mental and functional issues, rehabilitation experts have recommended that cancer rehabilitation be integrated in oncology care early on. Several clinical articles have highlighted the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions before, during, and after cancer treatment to screen for, assess, and treat patients’ functional needs.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{functional}} outcome {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who tolerate second line drug therapy for five years. METHODS [...] We enrolled into prospective controlled trials, 190 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who tolerated 'disease modifying' antirheumatic drug therapy for five years. Demographic data were recorded. Disease activity was measured every six months {{for two years and}} annually thereafter, using clinical and laboratory variables. <b>Patient</b> <b>function</b> was measured using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire. The change in each variable was analysed using paired Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS [...] <b>Patient</b> <b>function</b> improved significantly compared with baseline. The improvement was maximal after one to two years, and thereafter function started to decline slowly. After five years of treatment the patients' function was still significantly better than before treatment had started. There were highly significant improvements in all variables measured to assess disease activity, which remained well controlled throughout the five year period.

40|$|Objectives. Type 1 Diabetes (T 1 D) is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} imposing strict treatment regimens, impacting both {{patients and their}} parents. Despite an extensive diabetes literature on specific intergenerational links, comprehensive models relating broader parental <b>functioning</b> to <b>patient</b> <b>functioning</b> are scarce. The present study investigated an intergenerational path model, in which parental functioning (illness intrusiveness and depressive symptoms) was expected to relate to <b>patient</b> <b>functioning</b> (depressive symptoms, treatment adherence, and glycemic control) through parenting practices (overprotection and psychological control). Methods. Selected through the Belgian Diabetes Registry, 316 patient-mother dyads and 277 patient-father dyads completed questionnaires. All patients were diagnosed with T 1 D, were aged 14 - 25, and were living with their parents. Patients indicated their depressive symptoms and treatment adherence; treating physicians provided patients’ HbA 1 c values. Parents reported on their experience of illness intrusiveness, their depressive symptoms, and the patient’s treatment adherence. Parenting, as operationalized by the dimensions of overprotection and psychological control, was assessed in both parents and patients. Results. Structural equation modelling favored our hypothesized path model to an alternative, child-driven model. An adequate fit was found for both patient-mother and patient-father dyads. Parental functioning seemed to predict <b>patient</b> <b>functioning</b> with parenting dimensions as intervening mechanisms. Parental illness intrusiveness was associated with parental depressive symptoms, both predicting overprotection and psychological control. Psychological control in particular predicted patient depressive symptoms, treatment adherence, and glycemic control. Conclusions. These findings underscore the relevance of including parental <b>functioning</b> when assessing <b>patient</b> outcomes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Clinically {{significant}} change refers to meaningful change in individual <b>patient</b> <b>functioning</b> dur-ing psychotherapy. Following the operational definition of clinically {{significant change}} offered by Jacobson, Follette, and Revenstorf (1984), several alternatives {{have been proposed}} because they {{were thought to be}} either more accurate or more sensitive to detecting meaningful change. In this study, we compared five methods using a sample of 386 outpatients who underwent treatment in routine clinical practice. Differences were found between methods, suggesting that the statistical method used to calculate clinical significance has an effect on estimates of meaningful change. The Jacobson method (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) provided a moderate esti-mate of treatment effects and was recommended for use in outcome studies and research on clinically significant change, but future research is needed to validate this statistical method. Clinically significant change refers to changes in <b>patient</b> <b>functioning</b> that are meaningful for individuals who undergo psychosocial or medical interventions.

The prevalence of persistent, unresolved symptoms and their contribution to patient functioning and disease progression {{emphasize the importance of}} finding the right treatment choice at the onset and the utility of switching medications based on suboptimal responses. Our primary goal as clinicians is to improve <b>patient</b> <b>function</b> and quality of life. In fact, feelings of well-being and the return to premorbid levels of functioning are frequently rated by patients as being more important than symptom relief. However, functional improvements often lag behind resolution of mood, attributed in large part to persistent and functionally impairing symptoms – namely, fatigue, sleep/wake disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Thus, patient outcomes can be optimized by deconstructing each patient’s depressive profile to its component symptoms and specifically targeting those domains that differentially limit <b>patient</b> <b>function.</b> This article will provide an evidence-based framework within which clinicians may tailor pharmacotherapy to patient symptomatology for improved treatment outcomes.
