40|$|European <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> causes {{financial}} penalties in many pear orchards. Honey dew exudations reduce qual-ity. Another {{problem is the}} transmission of pear decline. In years of high infestation chemical treatments are complicated. Neither cutisan- nor sugar-treatments showed an appreciable reduction of the pest in the year 2005. ...|$|E
40|$|Application of {{processed}} kaolin particle film repels insects without lethal effects; hence {{side effects}} on beneficial arthropods are low. Processed kaolin {{may be an}} alternative to broad-spectrum insecticides used against European <b>pear</b> <b>sucker,</b> Cacopsylla pyri (L.), in organic and conventional pear production. Trials showed that the processed kaolin showed a very high efficacy, and the population of C. pyri was kept under a damaging level over the whole season. In conclusion, kaolin shows promise as an alternative control for C. pyri in organic and orchards of Integreted Pest Management. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of different insecticides (neem, pyrethrin, spinosad, and rotenone) and a repellent (kaolin) applied with different strategies (single or repeated applications) against the over-wintering pear suckers (Cacopsylla pyri) and nymphs {{of the first}} generation was tested in a field trial in Switzerland in spring 2003. Rotenone, the only admitted product in Swiss organic agriculture, showed good effects. But, since Rotenone is toxic for non-target insects we looked for an alternative. The application of spinosad (Audienz) in combination with rape oil (Telmion) as well as the application of pyrethrum showed similar efficacy as rotenone. Neem had no or a very low impact on the <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> populations. The repellent kaolin (Surround® WP) showed the best efficacy against the European pear sucker: triple application of kaolin before blossom was most efficient. Since kaolin is not toxic for beneficials this product might be an alternative to rotenone...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pear</b> <b>suckers</b> (Cacopsylla sp. or pear psylla) {{are widely}} {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} pest in pear orchards. Sustainable control of pear psylla relies on their natural suppression by beneficial arthropods and a well-tuned integration of crop protection treatments. Predatory bugs (Anthocoris sp.) are efficient predators of <b>pear</b> <b>suckers,</b> playing a crucial role in the control of pear psylla summer generations. However, their poor presence early and late in the season and their high mobility makes it difficult for growers to build up persistent predatory bug populations in their orchards to efficiently control pear psylla the whole season. Therefore, we investigated alternative natural enemies which potentially play an important role in the suppression of pear psylla, especially during early spring and autumn. To this end, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in fourteen pear orchards, and comparing psylla as well as beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM pear orchards. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower pear psylla pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, in particularly velvet mite (Trombidiidae) and spider (Araneae) populations. In addition, predation of C. pyri was verified by PCR-based gut content analysis. The outcome was analyzed in light of different treatment schedules, providing insights in potential side-effects of crop protection treatments on the composition of beneficial fauna in pear orchards...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of C. pyri and its natural enemies was studied in both treated and untreated pear orchards in Serbia from 2005 to 2009. Five parasitoid and 21 predator species {{were identified as}} present on {{a considerable number of}} sites. The following parasitoid species were found: Prionomitus mitratus (Dalman),Psyllaephagus procerus Marcet,Syrphophagus ariantes (Walker,Syrphophagus taeniatus Förster) and Tamarixia sp. In the study, the species Psyllaephagus procerus,Syrphophagus ariantes and Tamarixia sp. were forthe first time identified as parasitoids of C. pyri and as new species in the Serbian fauna. Among the parasitoids determined, Prionomitus mitratus predominated. Of the predators, the following species in four orders were registered: Dermaptera [Forficula auricularia Linnaeus (Forficulidae) ], Heteroptera [Anthocoris nemoralis(Fabricius), Anthocoris nemorum (Linnaeus), Orius (Heterorius) minutus (Linnaeus), Orius (Heterorius) nigerWolff (Anthocoridae), Campylomma verbasci (Mayer-Dür), Deraeocoris (Deraeocoris) ruber(Linnaeus) and Deraeocoris(Knightocarsus) lutescens (Schilling) (Miridae) ],Neuroptera[Chrysopa pallens Rambur,Chrysoperla carnea(Stephens),Chrysopa sp. (Chrysopidae) ], and Coleoptera [Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus, Adalia bipunctata Linnaeus, Adalia decempunctata(Linnaeus), Hippodamia tredecimpunctata (Linnaeus),Hippodamia variegata(Goeze),Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Linnaeus), Calvia (Anisocalvia) quatuordecimguttata(Linnaeus) (Coccinellidae), Cantharis rustica Fallén, Rhagonycha fulva (Scopoli) and Rh. testacea(Linnaeus) (Cantharidae) ]. Of the predators determined, 12 species were registered {{for the first time as}} predators of C. pyri in Serbia, while C. rustica, Rhagonycha fulva and Rh. testacea have so far been known neither in Serbia nor in the world as predators of <b>pear</b> <b>suckers...</b>|$|R
50|$|These can {{be traced}} back to the {{mechanisms}} of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct lethality, excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species. In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of amitraz. Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes amitraz is primarily used to control the pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and eriophyid mites, <b>pear</b> <b>suckers,</b> scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae of lepidoptera.To apply amitraz, various techniques can be used such as an airblast and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in amitraz use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates of amitraz. Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes of amitraz have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate of amitraz per hectare.|$|R
40|$|In Belgium, two {{cultivation}} methods of pear are widely applied, namely organic farming and {{integrated pest management}} (IPM). Organic pear orchards are characterized {{by the use of}} green techniques such as natural fertilizers and the restricted use of crop protection products, whereas integrated pest management combines a well-tuned integration of biological pest control and crop protection treatments. It is generally considered that these two {{cultivation methods}} have different effects on the density of beneficial arthropods in the orchard and the occurrence of common pests as well. Therefore, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in 14 pear orchards and comparing beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM pear orchards. <b>Pear</b> <b>sucker</b> (Cacopsylla sp. or pear psylla) which is considered the major pest of pear in Belgium, was monitored as well. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower pear psylla pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, particularly velvet mites (Trombidiidae) and spiders (Araneae). IPM orchards showed higher numbers of Anthocoris spp. in summer. In addition, predation of C. pyri was verified by PCR-based gut content analysis. Regarding the results of this prey-predator PCR, Anthocoridae had the highest chance for detection of psyllid DNA in their gut. Velvet mites also scored particularly well for the PCR detections, indicating that other arthropods besides Anthocoridae could {{have an impact on the}} psyllid pressure in a pear orchard...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{innovative}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools is done onstation and on-farm in the PURE project. The {{idea is that}} IPM {{tools are}} tested under well-defined conditions in experimental orchards. Subsequently, they are tested in commercial orchards {{as part of a}} total IPM system where drawbacks and bottlenecks become clear. In subsequent on-station experiments the drawbacks or bottlenecks are solved and adjusted IPM tools are again tested in commercial orchards. We call this the "design - assessment - adjustment cycle". It is meant, together with co-innovation techniques, to promote uptake of innovative IPM tools by commercial farmers. For apple, new innovations are the use of exclusion netting against codling moth (Cydia pomonella), and the use of an antagonist against conidia of Venturia inaequalis. For pear, the overwintering inoculum of brown spot of pear (Stemphylium vesicarium) is reduced by antagonists and natural fertilisers, and the control of <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> (Cacopsylla pyricola) is promoted by natural enemies. For both apple and pear an innovative canopy adapted sprayer is used to reduce emissions and to further reduce pesticide use. Efficacy of these innovative IPM tools and IPM systems is assessed by the newly developed software for environmental effects: SYNOPS, for economic effects: PREMISE, and for overall sustainability, including economic, social and environmental aspects: DEXiPM-pomefruit. Results show that the overall sustainability of the conventional system is already high. Nevertheless, innovative IPM tools provided an improvement of environmental quality with an efficient control of diseases or pests. The cost for running the innovative IPM systems was often higher than the conventional system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Five years {{research}} of the biological and pomological characteristics of some pear varieties are presented in this paper. 18 pear varieties with diff erent ripening time {{were included in the}} research. Some of investigated varieties are new bred (Turandot, Norma, Karmen, Monica), some of them are famous as resistant to Fire Blight (‘Harrow Delight’, ‘Harvest Queen’, ‘Harrow Sweet’, ‘Honey Sweet’) and some of them belong to group of old varieties that have been less investigated in our conditions (‘Starking Delicious’, ‘Abbe Fetel’, ‘Packams Triumph’, ‘Conference’, ‘Magness Highland’, ‘Guyot’). All varieties were compared with standard varieties (‘Williams’, ‘Precoce Moretini’, ‘Bosc,s’). Demonstrative orchard was established in 1997 at the Faculty farm-Trubarevo near Skopje. Th e trees were graft ed on BA 29 quince rootstock and for those varieties that had not affi nity with quince, we used inter stock pear variety Cure. Research was conducted during the period of 2003 - 2007. Th e following parameters were investigated: blossom, ripening of the fruits, growth of the trees (TCSA, volume of the crowns), yield, pomological characteristics of the fruits and content of the soluble dry matters and acids. Th e results showed that some of the pear varieties are characterized with a good production attributes, resistant to Fire Blight, <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> and to some a biotical factors, with good quality of the fruits. In the fi rst group, the best characteristics gave variety Norma, from resistant variety group good results gave variety Harrow Sweet, and from old variety assortment for our conditions, good results gave ‘Packams Triumph’. Th ese varieties can be recommended for cultivation in our climatically conditions. Key words pear, variety, research, behavior, yiel...|$|E
40|$|The European <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> Cacopsylla pyri (L.) (Homoptera: Psyllidae) – one of {{the main}} pest insects in pear {{production}} – is commonly controlled by spraying broad-spectrum insecticides, which may have serious side-effects on beneficial arthropods. Recently, a new approach to fruit pest management has arisen in the form of processed-kaolin particle film technology (product name Surround® WP). The white kaolin particle film repels insects without killing them. Therefore, side effects on beneficial arthropods are expected to be low. This new approach triggered the present study to control C. pyri. In spring 2003 a small-plot field trial was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} pre-flowering kaolin treatments on the first generation of C. pyri. Multiple applications of kaolin after the beginning of the flying period of C. pyri were compared with an untreated control and the standard organic insecticide rotenone. Kaolin significantly reduced the number of nymphs compared to the untreated control and showed a higher efficacy than rotenone, with the triple application of kaolin the most effective. Due to the high mobility of the adult C. pyri the effects on the summer population could not be assessed in this small-plot trial. Therefore, a large-plot trial was conducted in 2004. Again, kaolin showed a very high efficacy. At the end of June 2004 few C. pyri were noticed in the kaolin treated plot but, the population density tended to be lower than in the plot treated by a standard IPM strategy (Envidor®, Evisect® S). C. pyri was kept under the economic threshold until harvest. Since kaolin repels insects, its effect on beneficials are low, and therefore might be an alternative control strategy for C. pyri in organic and IPM orchards...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{market has}} grown {{exponentially}} in Europe {{during the last}} ten years. However, the organic fruit industry has shown the lowest growth rates (1 - 5 % market share) compared to other commodities. One major reason is the high production risk due to high disease and pest pressure in humid climates. Key pests and diseases in apple and pear include scab, sooty blotch, and fire blight as well as rosy apple aphid, <b>pear</b> <b>sucker,</b> and codling moth. In cherry, damages due to brown rot (Monilinia) and the cherry fruit fly make organic production almost unfeasible. In an ideal organic system, all possible measures that lead to improved stability of the system must be implemented. In fruit production, such measures include (i) use of resistant varieties (scab), (ii) active promotion of predators (rosy apple aphid), (iii) sanitation (cherry monilinia), (iv) microclimate management (planting density, covering trees), and (v) strengthening the plant self-defence system (e. g. building up of soil fertility, bio-dynamic preparations). At present, most organic orchards have been designed for conventional production and, therefore, lack most stabilising components. In consequence, organic fruit production still depends largely on direct pest and disease control methods. These include traditional pesticides such as copper, sulphur, and lime sulphur, pyrethrin, oil and soap preparations. More recently, new pest control compounds and techniques have been developed including neem products, granulosis virus, and mating disruption. New tools for disease control are less spectacular {{and focus on the}} replacement of copper (e. g. with clay powders and resistance inducers). The introduction of new equipment, materials, and Decision Support Systems (DSS) will further improve yield stability. However, other limiting factors such as weed competition, crop load regulation, and conventional market demands need innovative solutions...|$|E
