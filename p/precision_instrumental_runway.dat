40|$|AbstractNucleotide sugars, the {{activated}} {{forms of}} monosaccharides, are important metabolites {{involved in a}} multitude of cellular processes including glycosylation of xenobiotics. Especially in plants, UDP-glucose {{is one of the}} most prominent members among these nucleotide-sugars, as it is involved in the formation of glucose conjugates of xenobiotics, including mycotoxins, but also holds a central role in the interconversion of energized sugars such as the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid required for cell wall biosynthesis. Here, we present the first HILIC–LC–ESI-TQ–MS/MS method for the quantification of UDP-glucose and UDP-glucuronic acid together with the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and its major plant detoxification product DON- 3 -O-glucoside (DON- 3 -Glc) utilizing a polymer-based column. For sample preparation a time-effective and straightforward ‘dilute and shoot’ protocol was applied. The chromatographic run time was minimized to 9 min including proper column re-equilibration. In-house validation of the method verified its linear range, intra- (1 – 7 %) and interday (8 – 20 %) <b>precision,</b> <b>instrumental</b> LODs between 0. 6 and 10 ngmL− 1, selectivity and moderate matrix effects with mean recoveries of 85 – 103 %.

The results clearly demonstrated the suitability of the developed method to quantify UDP-glucose, DON and its masked form D 3 G in diluted wheat extracts. We observed differing concentration levels of UDP-glucose in the two wheat cultivars showing different resistance to the severe plant disease Fusarium head blight. We propose that the higher ability to detoxify DON into DON- 3 -Glc might be a consequence of the higher cellular UDP-glucose pool in the resistant cultivar...|$|R
40|$|Enantioselective {{separation}} of the sunscreen agent 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) -camphor by electrokinetic chromatography: Quantitative analysis in cosmetic formulations 3 -(4 -Methylbenzylidene) -camphor (MBC) is a chiral sunscreen agent used in cosmetic products. In this work, the enantio{{separation of}} MBC has been performed by EKC and applied {{to the analysis of}} the MBC enantiomers in cosmetic creams. Different experi-mental conditions (type and concentration of the chiral selector, temperature, and sample solvent) have been optimized. Due to the neutral nature of this compound, anionic CD derivatives were investigated as chiral selectors. Carboxymethylated-b-CD (CM-b-CD) showed the highest chiral separation power, observing that a 15 mM con-centration of this CD at a working temperature of 157 C enabled to obtain the highest enantioresolution. However, under these conditions, tailing of peaks obtained for the enantiomers was observed. The addition of increasing concentrations of the neutral a-CD to CM-b-CD at a 15 mM concentration in a 100 mM borate buffer at pH 9. 0 improved the enantiomeric separation and decreased peak tailing. The use of DMF for the total dissolution of the cosmetic creams, and methanol:water (1 : 1 v/v) for appro-priate dilution enabled to observe good shape and size for the peaks of the MBC enantiomers. After optimizing a method for the preconditioning of the capillary, the analytical characteristics of the chiral separation method for the analysis of MBC were investigated.

40|$|Stellar {{activity}} {{is a potential}} important limitation to the detection of low mass extrasolar planets with indirect methods (RV, photometry, astrometry). In previous papers, using the Sun as a proxy, we investigated the impact of stellar activity (spots, plages, convection) on the detectability of an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-type stars with RV techniques. We extend here the detectability study {{to the case of}} astrometry. We used the sunspot and plages properties recorded over one solar cycle to infer the astrometric variations that a Sun-like star seen edge-on, 10 pc away, would exhibit, if covered by such spots/bright structures. We compare the signal to the one expected from the astrometric wobble (0. 3 μas) of such a star surrounded by a one Earth-mass planet in the HZ. We also briefly investigate higher levels of activity. The activity-induced astrometric signal along the equatorial plane has an amplitude of typ. less than 0. 2 μas (rms= 0. 07 μas), smaller than the one expected from an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU. Hence, for this level of activity, the detectability is governed by the <b>instrumental</b> <b>precision</b> rather than the activity. We show that for instance a one Earth-mass planet at 1 AU would be detected with a monthly visit during less than 5 years and an <b>instrumental</b> <b>precision</b> of 0. 8 μas. A level of activity 5 times higher would still allow such a detection with a precision of 0. 35 μas. We conclude that astrometry is an attractive approach to search for such planets around solar type stars with most levels of stellar activity. Comment: Letter accepted by A&...|$|R
