60|$|The {{turbines}} whistle reflectively. From the low-arched expansion-tanks {{on either}} side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbine-chests, and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a <b>power-saw.</b> Behind, is its own pressure held in leash or spurred on by the lift-shunts; before it, the vacuum where Fleury's Ray dances in violet-green bands and whirled turbillions of flame. The jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are pressure-tempered colloid (no glass would endure the strain for an instant) and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray intently. It is {{the very heart of}} the machine--a mystery to this day. Even Fleury who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multi-millionaire, could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube can, in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious blast of gas into a chill grayish-green liquid that drains (you can hear it trickle) from the far end of the vacuum through the eduction-pipes and the mains back to the bilges. Here it returns to its gaseous, one had almost written sagacious, state and climbs to work afresh. Bilge-tank, upper tank, dorsal-tank, expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a liquid), and bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury's Ray sees to that; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to Fleury's Ray. If a speck of oil, if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded terminals Fleury's Ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again. This means half a day's work for all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventy-odd pounds to the G. P. O. for radium-salts and such trifles.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a school}} and a kindergarten, some shops, a library, a club, a post office, an {{administrative}} building, a <b>power-saw</b> bench, and a logging enterprise in the village. Hunting and fishing are common. The majority of residents breed livestock and engage in gardening.|$|E

In 1967 the {{building}} of mechanized thrashing floor and warehouses at Tsentral'naya usad'ba ("Central farmstead") st. Since 1972 Sosnovka became a central farmstead of the sovkhoz. Sovkhoz specialize in production of grain, meat, milk and sugar beet. There were separator point, <b>power-saw</b> bench, forge workshop and repair workshop of agricultural machinery.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} chop or miter saw, which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut <b>power-saws</b> should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|R
5000|$|The ad {{expanded}} {{upon the}} first commercial, which featured two changes of location, {{and only one}} on camera (the bathroom [...] "set" [...] lifting away). In [...] "Questions", there were more frequent changes of location with more extravagant transitions. Mustafa begins at a shower station on the beach. The scenery splits in half (as do false legs and a towel) and pulls away to reveal Mustafa log rolling before he walks {{across the surface of}} a lake (catching a falling cake mid-stride) into a kitchen (<b>power-sawing</b> a countertop mid-stride) {{to the top of a}} waterfall, which he [...] "swan dives" [...] off into a hot tub, which then collapses to reveal that Mustafa is sitting on a motorcycle, his shorts having been replaced by jeans. He performs the entire commercial without breaking eye contact with the camera, while addressing female viewers and asking rhetorical questions on what they like, implying that if their man used Old Spice, then he could bring them these things.|$|R
50|$|A {{circular}} saw is a <b>power-saw</b> using a toothed or abrasive disc or blade to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a {{circular saw}}. Circular saws may also be loosely used for the blade itself. Circular saws were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States {{by the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} used in <b>power-saw</b> blades and drill bits. It is {{superior}} to the older high-carbon steel tools used extensively through the 1940s in that it can withstand higher temperatures without losing its temper (hardness). This property allows HSS to cut faster than high carbon steel, hence the name high-speed steel. At room temperature, in their generally recommended heat treatment, HSS grades generally display high hardness (above Rockwell hardness 60) and abrasion resistance (generally linked to tungsten and vanadium content often used in HSS) compared with common carbon and tool steels.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, Kolbe {{tried to}} settle in the U.S., but could not find {{suitable}} work. In 1951, he unsuccessfully applied {{to return to work}} for the German Foreign Office. Kolbe finally found a living as a representative of an American <b>power-saw</b> manufacturer. After the war, Kolbe was a despised and much hated figure in Germany, where he was widely viewed as a traitor. Der Stern magazine commented that: [...] "Kolbe's story demonstrates that ordinary Germans could do something to fight Hitler's madness - and post-war Germany treated him like a leper because of his actions." ...|$|E
40|$|Attachment for {{reciprocating}} <b>power-saw</b> maintains nearly constant {{cutting pressure}} even though kerf length varies. Attachment developed for wire saws used to slice cylindrical silicon ingots into wafers for semiconductor devices. By maintaining constant pressure, attachment helps to ensure smooth, flat, uniform wafers. Principle adaptable to straight, toothed saws {{as well as}} to wire saws...|$|E
