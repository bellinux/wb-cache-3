5000|$|The system {{therefore}} {{became increasingly}} complex {{and can be}} illustrated with an example. Mr Jones {{was a member of}} his occupational pension scheme between 1980 and 1995 and was entitled to a pension of £500 per month on his retirement. Because he was contracted out of SERPS, the government advised that he was entitled to a GMP of £110 per month, including £50 post 1988 GMP. The non-GMP element of his pension—in this case £390 per month—is usually known as the 'excess' and his <b>payment</b> <b>advice</b> would give a breakdown as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|EDI {{documents}} generally {{contain the}} same information that would normally {{be found in a}} paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as request for quotation (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and <b>payment</b> <b>advice.</b> However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged.|$|E

50|$|Often {{the cost}} of advice given by a {{stockbroker}} or financial adviser {{is built into the}} vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied {{at the start of the}} plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate <b>payment</b> for an <b>advice</b> service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.|$|R
50|$|Based at Caernarfon, the Chamberlain {{managed the}} Principality of Wales's {{finances}} for the North Wales counties {{under the control}} of the Justiciar of North Wales. The counties within his remit were Anglesey, Merionethshire, and Caernarfonshire and he accounted for the revenues of the provincial exchequer at Caernarfon to the Exchequer at Westminster. They also kept the Great Seal of North Wales, and when leases of land were needed to be sealed or the seal applied to documents authorizing <b>payments,</b> the Chamberlain's <b>advice</b> was sought. The Chamberlains used their office to enrich themselves: for example, Tomas Barneby, Chamberlain from 1406 to 1414 was dismissed by Henry V for embezzlement and extortion.|$|R
60|$|In {{this case}} {{there was no}} {{question}} of <b>payment.</b> The <b>advice</b> to be given was to a widowed woman from an experienced man of the world; but, nevertheless, he could only make his calculations as to her peculiar case {{in the way in which}} he ordinarily calculated. Could it be possible that anything had been kept back from him? Were there facts unknown to him, but known to her, which would be terrible, fatal, damning to his sweet friend if proved before all the world? He could not bring himself to ask her, but yet it was so material that he should know! Twenty years ago, at the time of the trial, he had at one time thought,--it hardly matters to tell what, but those thoughts had not been favourable to her cause. Then his mind had altered, and he had learned,--as lawyers do learn,--to believe in his own case. And when the day of triumph had come, he had triumphed loudly, commiserating his dear friend for the unjust suffering to which she had been subjected, and speaking in no low or modified tone as to the grasping, greedy cruelty of that man of Groby Park. Nevertheless, through it all, he had felt that Round and Crook had not made the most of their case.|$|R
5000|$|Whorwood {{was used}} both {{regularly}} and in emergency {{to enforce the}} law in his native county and elsewhere. He was a justice of the peace in Staffordshire. In April 1536 he was sent with John Hynde to help suppress a rising in Somerset and each received £50 [...] "for executing of rebels in the west". The following year he was sent to deal with the aftermath of the Lincolnshire Rising. He was also employed in the revenue courts, receiving very large <b>payments</b> for his <b>advice.</b> In 1540 he was made Attorney General, in succession to John Baker, although he and Baker continued to work together on many issues. In 1544 Whorwood was made a member of the court of surveyors at a salary of £6 13s.4d. It was probably this connection that allowed him to buy a series of properties in the West Midlands.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the impact of the carbon price package legislated in Australia’s Clean Energy Act 2011 on the profitability of Victoria’s brown coal generators. This analysis takes account of actual carbon market and electricity market outcomes since the commencement of the carbon price on 1 July 2012 until 31 December 2012. The context to this report is our client’s interest in obtaining a deeper understanding of the extent to which carbon price ‘compensation’ payments through the Energy Security Fund may deliver “windfall” profits to the Victorian generators that are eligible to receive payments from this fund. The Clean Energy Act 2011 legislated a package of carbon pricing reforms negotiated by the Multi-Party Committee on Climate Change (MPCCC) in 2011. The package adopted by the Government included significant assistance for industry to adapt to a price on carbon including, controversially, a fund to assist the most emissions-intensive generators adapt to a price on carbon, as well as to pay for the closure of 2, 000 MW of Australia’s most emissions intensive power stations via a process named Contracts for Closure. The fund established for these two purposes was called the Energy Security Fund. Energy Security Fund assistance for the most “strongly affected generators” was estimated at $ 5. 5 billion, with most of this accruing to the high emission brown coal generators in Victoria. The Government’s decision to make these <b>payments</b> reflected <b>advice</b> from the Australian Energy Market Commission that without these payments energy security would be at risk. Professor Garnaut disputed this advice. He suggested that the security risks were quite small, and hence that transitional assistance payments were unnecessary. Likewise the Australian Energy Regulator was skeptical that the emission reduction scheme presented a risk to energy security. We have analysed the change in operating profit to Victoria’s brown coal generators attributable to the carbon price, using half-hourly data on actual outcomes in the “spot” National Electricity Market (NEM) for the first two quarters since the implementation of the carbon price package...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{existing}} policy frameworks for mitigation of diffuse water pollution from agriculture (DWPA) in England and China. With {{reference to a}} conceptual model {{of the process of}} policy transfer or international lesson drawing, and possible constraints to this, it assesses whether and how China can draw lessons to improve current policy from the supra-national and national provisions of the EU and a member state that by 2016 had comprehensively implemented EU agricultural and environmental policy. DWPA is first analysed as a public policy challenge to inform specification of a generic framework for its mitigation. The current policy frameworks for mitigation of DWPA in England and China are evaluated, and their potential for improvement is assessed. A number of barriers to lesson drawing for regulation, incentive <b>payments</b> schemes and <b>advice</b> provision are diagnosed. These barriers are potentially least in relation to advice provision and its use to promote voluntary action by farmers. Given its structure and capabilities the public agricultural extension system in China is also recognised as a key resource. A focus on three policy approaches to mitigate DWPA in China is recommended: i) targeted regulation to a ‘reference level’ of large intensive livestock, and ultimately other large commercial farms; ii) strategic use of incentive payment schemes to protect water resources from DWPA; and iii) re-orientation of the ethos and modalities of operation of the extension system, informed by international lesson drawing, with the aim of rebalancing farm productivity and environmental protection...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa the {{pharmacy}} profession {{has experienced a}} number of changes {{around the turn of}} the century such as the introduction of the National Drug Policy (NDP), pharmacy ownership and price regulation. With this the role and earnings of {{the pharmacy}} profession, as well as to what extent the pharmacist adds value to the profession and society, are being questioned. Community pharmacists are thus faced with the challenge to prove that the value that they add to society is meaningful. Therefore, the aim of the study was to document community pharmacy availability and activities in South Africa and based on this to quantify the perceived value that the community pharmacist adds to society through the delivery of pharmaceutical services and pharmaceutical care. In order to determine the pharmacist’s true value added two surveys were conducted in 2006; an original pharmacist survey and a general public survey. The results obtained were verified by a follow–up pharmacist survey in 2009 to confirm or reject the results obtained in the original survey. The study was representative of both the community pharmacies and the general public in South Africa and was primarily quantitative in design and analysis. More than half of the responding pharmacies (63. 16 %) were open seven days a week. The average hours of service per day ranged from 10 hours (Monday to Friday) through to 6. 45 hours on Saturdays and 3 hours on Sundays. Pharmacists continuously upgraded their professional knowledge. More than three quarters of pharmacies had the necessary equipment available to perform the services investigated in the study. The general public was not aware of all the services provided by pharmacists and as a result, depending on the service, many people did not make use of these services. The general public that made use of services delivered by community pharmacies mainly perceived the services delivered to be of good quality. The main barrier to practicing pharmaceutical care was indicated by pharmacists as not receiving <b>payment</b> for the <b>advice</b> given followed by pharmaceutical care being time consuming, and that there was not enough time to talk to patients. The general public indicated that they found it difficult to ask questions in pharmacies because other patients could hear what was discussed, or other patients had to wait longer if they asked something, and pharmacy staff being too busy. The results of the original pharmacist and the general public survey were confirmed by the results of the follow-up survey with the exception of dispensing prescription medicine (8 minutes 28 seconds), OTC medicine (7 minutes 23 seconds), counselling of prescription medicine (8 minutes 51 seconds) and OTC medicine (8 minutes) which on average took longer to conduct than in the previous analysis. The study highlighted the value added to the wellness and quality of life of the community of South Africa through the delivery of pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical services by community pharmacy staff, and proved that pharmacists are committed to the provision of pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical service...|$|R
