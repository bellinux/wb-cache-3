40|$|Several studies {{emphasize}} that agriculture and food {{as a whole}} {{are responsible for the}} increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, as a central actor in the food supply chain, consumers play a very important role as their food behaviour can be highly polluting. However, few studies focus on the environmental impact of consumer behaviour or investigate which action has the greatest consequences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse consumer practices, from purchase to final waste. Fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were chosen as examples of general fruit and vegetables, and their environmental impact measured. Four impact categories were adopted: acidification, eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity. Results regarding fresh tomatoes clearly indicate that purchasing has the highest environmental impact for all 4 categories of impacts. Such an impact is mainly due to transport from supermarket to household (generally by car). Also in the case of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> purchasing is responsible for a great share of the impact, but cooking and end of life phases are also very important, namely for acidification and global warming the former, and human toxicity the latter. If we compare fresh <b>tomatoes</b> with <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> the latter have a greater impact in all 4 categories. GHG emissions at consumer level are 0. 07 kg CO 2 eq for fresh tomatoes and 0. 18 kg CO 2 eq for <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> while human toxicity levels are 25 times higher for the latter. However, if we take into consideration the fact that 6 kg of fresh tomatoes are needed for 1 kg of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> the results can be seen in a different light. In this case, the impact of fresh tomatoes (global warming potential) is 2. 3 times higher than that of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> Finally, if we calculate CO 2 emissions generated by making equal quantities of tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes or rather with tomato paste, results are equal...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood Science ProgramEdgar Chambers IVThree studies, using {{descriptive}} {{sensory analysis}} with highly trained panelists, {{were conducted to}} better understand the sensory characteristics of fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> A “green” note often has been described as part of tomato flavor and is noted in many fruits, vegetables, grains and processed products. Thus, the first study developed a sensory lexicon for green characteristics in foods. The lexicon, consisting of 17 sensory attributes, was used to characterize sensory properties of 22 chemicals potentially associated with green odor. Green characteristics can be differentiated as green-unripe, green-peapod, green-grassy/leafy, green-viney and green-fruity. Additional attributes that are important in various green characteristics included musty/earthy, pungent, bitter, sweet and floral. Various chemicals were described as green at different concentrations. Green-grassy/leafy was the most common characterizing green attribute of many of the chemicals studied. Changing the concentrations of the chemicals resulted not only in changing the intensity of the attributes, but it also altered the sensory profile of many of the chemicals. A sensory lexicon for describing tomatoes also was developed. A variety of fresh <b>tomatoes,</b> <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> and tomato-based products such as ketchup and pasta sauce were used to create the lexicon. The characteristics of tomatoes can be described using 33 aroma, flavor and texture attributes. Some characteristics were common across all or most fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> However, reducing the number of attributes may be possible for certain studies because some attributes were appropriate only for fresh or <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> not both. A third study determined the sensory characteristics of five tomato types, including newer and older cultivars that varied in their physical traits and primary use. The impacts of processing on the sensory quality of tomato products were investigated, with juice (minimal processing) and paste (higher level of processing) being made from the cultivars. Fresh tomatoes differed significantly because of cultivar and ripening stage differences. Fresh tomatoes differed considerably from <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> A low processing level intensified some key aroma and flavor attributes, but differences in flavor attributed to cultivar became minimal after a higher degree of processing. Textural differences among cultivars after processing were more pronounced than flavor differences...|$|R

One model is appropriate for perfect or defect-free tomatoes, and the second model is valid for the normal population of tomatoes obtained following mechanical harvesting. The ability to peel perfect tomatoes was significantly affected by exposure of tomatoes to temperatures greater than 100 F, by fruit weight and by pericarp wall thickness. The peelability of a normal population of tomatoes was influenced by tomato weight and width as well as degree-days and exposure to temperatures greater than 90 F. Thickness of the pericarp walls and red layer positively affected the peelability of normal tomatoes.

40|$|Tomatoes are {{important}} in human nutrition, as they {{are a source of}} carotenoids and phenolic compounds. However, transformation processes may alter the nutritional value of foods, decreasing the concentration of health-promoting compounds. This work aimed to explore the effects of industrial transformation on <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> (crushed pulp, puree and paste), as well as the effect of the different pre-processing technologies, rather than different manufacturing sites, in producing tomato paste. Results demonstrate that phenolics profiling can distinguish between different processed products as well as different paste pre-treatments (namely cold, warm and hot break), even though the latter underwent a final thermal treatment at > 100 °C. Analogously, the different processing sites could be discriminated thanks to their characteristic phenolic fingerprint. The greatest differences identified were between conjugated forms of flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and lignans. The latter were the most labile phenolics, followed by flavonoids and then phenylpropanoids. Results provide evidence for the potential of phenolic fingerprint to support traceability of transformation processes and to investigate their effect on the nutritional value of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes...</b>|$|R

The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and four treatments (compost, sheep manure, inorganic fertilizer and control). The effect on the weed was determined by the use of different diversity indices (Shannon- Weiner, Simpson, Pielou and Richness). It was found that Simpson index was higher in compost, while Shannon- Weiner index in control treatment. Pielou index had a similar trend with Shannon – Weiner index. The biodiversity of weed flora was similar for all the treatments and the number of species was greater by 44 % in the compost in relation to the control, and by 19 % in relation to manure and inorganic fertilization (k-dominance). It was observed that Amaranthus retroflexus was the dominant species in all treatments.
