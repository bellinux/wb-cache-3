2500|$|The {{period was}} marked by a great {{increase}} in patronage of sculpture by the state for public art and by the wealthy for their homes; especially in Italy, public sculpture remains a crucial element in the appearance of historic city centres. Church sculpture mostly moved inside just as outside public monuments became common. Portrait sculpture, usually in busts, became popular in Italy around 1450, with the Neapolitan Francesco Laurana specializing in young women in meditative poses, while Antonio Rossellino and others more often depicted knobbly-faced men of affairs, but also young children. [...] The portrait medal invented by Pisanello also often depicted women; relief <b>plaquettes</b> were another new small form of sculpture in cast metal.|$|E
2500|$|His family origins were at Arezzo, {{though he}} was {{probably}} born at Menaggio near Lake Como, and his early training, to judge from the finish of his medals, was with a medallist or goldsmith, as Vasari says. His earliest documentation finds him at Venice after 1533, {{with his wife and}} infant son, living under the protection of his Aretine compatriot (and possible kinsman), Pietro Aretino, who introduced him to the circle of Titian. [...] Taking advantage of his rival Benvenuto Cellini's being in prison at the time, he secured the role of designer for the Papal mint in Ferrara (1538–40) but was forced to withdraw under accusations of counterfeiting levelled by Pellegrino di Leuti, the jeweller of the Farnese Pope Paul III. [...] Leoni then attacked Pellegrino and was condemned to lose his right hand, a sentence commuted after the intercession of powerful friends to slavery in the galleys, from which the entreaties of Andrea Doria released him after a year: Leoni produced three <b>plaquettes</b> and five medals of Andrea Doria as tokens of his gratitude.|$|E

2500|$|Paxes with {{elaborate}} metalwork framing an image {{in a medium}} that would withstand kissing and wiping are the sort that have been most likely to survive. Other objects that might {{seem to have had}} another purpose, such as <b>plaquettes,</b> ivory panels or small painted enamel plaques, may have been made for a pax. [...] Equally other objects began life as serving some other purpose, and were turned into paxes. Some still have a metal fitting at the rear, either a handle or a slot for a long wooden handle to fit into (a few of these survive). Glass or rock crystal over an image below allowed the image to be kissed repeatedly but not damaged, and enamel also wore relatively well. [...] Carved shell and mother of pearl are sometimes used. [...] Even with a frame paxes are usually less than a foot high, and the images often 4 to 6 inches high. [...] The inventory of the royal treasure of King Richard II of England lists many paxes among its nearly 1,200 items, including two of plain ungilded silver with red crosses, which Jenny Stratford suggests were for use in Lent. [...] Several record who gave them, or from whom they were seized for offences.|$|E
2500|$|As a type {{of object}} that was not quite {{considered}} of top importance, the compositions in pax images were very often recycled from another medium such as prints or <b>plaquettes.</b> [...] Gilt-copper is more common than gold in the surrounds, and gems {{were likely to be}} glass-paste. [...] But this is also partly an accident of survival; many paxes were made purely of a single piece of silver, with the image in relief or engraved, but these have rarely survived. [...] If not melted down by the church for funds they were often confiscated by the civil authorities in the late Ancien Régime and Napoleonic period, when a distinction was often made between essential church plate such as chalices and candlesticks, which the church was allowed to keep, and inessential items such as paxes, by then probably no longer in use, which were confiscated. [...] Still more common were copper alloy (brass or bronze) pieces, which were mass-produced (in medieval terms) in late medieval England, though very few have survived. These were cast in one piece, with the image either in the mould or engraved later, and with very similar designs, suggesting the use of pattern books or other models. [...] Some paxes doubled as reliquaries, such as the Eberbach Pax, though this contained the lowest sort of [...] "contact relic", a medallion blessed by the pope.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analytical}} approach for studying lattice gauge theories within the <b>plaquette</b> representation where the <b>plaquette</b> matrices {{play the role}} of the fundamental degrees of freedom. We start from the original Batrouni formulation and show how it can be modified {{in such a way that}} each non-abelian Bianchi identity contains only two connectors instead of four. In addition, we include dynamical fermions in the <b>plaquette</b> formulation. Using this representation we construct the low-temperature perturbative expansion for U(1) and SU(N) models and discuss its uniformity in the volume. The final aim of this study is to give a mathematical background for working with non-abelian models in the <b>plaquette</b> formulation. Comment: Latex, 31 pages, 5 fig...|$|R

5000|$|The form {{began in}} the 1440s in Italy, but spread across Europe in the next century, {{especially}} to France, Germany and the Low Countries. By about 1550 it had fallen from fashion in Italy, but French <b>plaquettes</b> were entering their best period, and there and in Germany they continued to be popular into the 17th century. The form continued to be made at a low level, with something of a revival from about 1850.

40|$|The <b>plaquette</b> {{phase of}} the square lattice quantum dimer model is studied using a continuous-time {{reptation}} quantum Monte Carlo method for lattices of sizes up to 48 x 48 sites. We determine {{the location of the}} phase transition between the columnar and <b>plaquette</b> phases to occur at V_c/J= 0. 60 +- 0. 05 which is significantly larger than inferred from previous exact diagonalization studies on smaller lattices. Offdiagonal correlation functions are obtained. They exhibit long-range order in the <b>plaquette</b> phase but not at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. We also observe significant finite-size corrections to scaling for the transition between the <b>plaquette</b> phase and the critical resonating valence bond liquid. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding finite-size effects when considering critical properties of the square lattice quantum dimer model.

5000|$|<b>Plaquettes</b> {{grew from}} two rather {{different}} Italian origins. In Rome in the 1440s and 1450s they {{began as a}} way of reproducing the designs of classical engraved gems, by taking a wax impression of them. The Venetian Pietro Barbo (1417-1471) became a cardinal when his uncle was elected Pope Eugenius IV in 1431. He became an enthusiastic pioneer of this form, maintaining a foundry in his new Palazzo Venezia, and perhaps participating in the casting himself. These <b>plaquettes</b> had the same small size and classical subject matter as the gems they replicated.|$|E

5000|$|German {{production}} {{began in}} Nuremberg, around 1500, but by 1600 Augsburg {{was the main}} centre. German examples tended to draw their designs from prints, and were in turn frequently reused in other media, and perhaps more often produced primarily as models for other trades.
