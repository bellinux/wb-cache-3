Integration of the preventive strategies in the clinical practice has the potential to reduce the disability due to mental illnesses.

Therefore, the clinical encounter can be seen as an opportunity to implement <b>preventive</b> strategies. <b>Preventive</b> <b>efforts</b> in clinical practice must be guided by knowledge about the epidemiological data related to specific mental illnesses and about the evidence-based preventive strategies available for specific mental illnesses.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{applies the}} {{analytical}} tools of optimal taxation theory {{to the design}} of the optimal subsidy on preventive behaviours, in an economy where longevity varies across agents, and depends on preventive expenditures and on longevity genes. Public intervention can be here justified on three grounds: corrections for misperceptions of the survival process and for externalities related to individual preventive behaviour, and redistribution across both earnings and genetic dimensions. The optimal subsidy on preventive expenditures is shown to depend on the combined impacts of misperception, externalities and self-selection. It is generally optimal to subsidize <b>preventive</b> <b>efforts</b> to an extent depending on the degree of individual myopia, on how productivity and genes are correlated, and on the complementarity of genes and <b>preventive</b> <b>efforts</b> in the survival function.
