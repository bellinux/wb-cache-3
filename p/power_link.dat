There and then, he summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent toward Termina by holding it up with their arms. Now seeing the Skull Kid as a useless puppet, Majora's Mask drops his grip on him and flies up to possess the moon instead. With Tatl at his side, Link follows the Majora's Mask inside the moon and defeats him once and for all, {{returning}} the moon to its proper place in the sky. The Four Giants return to their sleep. Tatl and Tael reunite with the newly liberated Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, stating it has been purified of its evil <b>power.</b> <b>Link</b> rides away on Epona while the people of Termina celebrate the Carnival of Time and the dawn of a new day.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, the Harris Fire {{damaged and}} {{disabled}} the Southwest <b>Power</b> <b>Link,</b> a 500,000-volt power line from Arizona to San Diego. Power outages {{were reported in}} Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and other counties on October 22 to 333,500 Southern California Edison customers, most being restored within 24 hours. The power outage also affected the areas of Ojai, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks, Agoura Hills, Rialto, Fontana, San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga, Mira Loma, Hesperia, Corona, Bloomington, Irvine, Calimesa and Rubidoux. This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu. The California Independent System Operator Corp declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 people lost power, {{due to the lack}} of power from the power grid. During the crisis, Mexico provided power to help augment the electrical needs of the San Diego area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the power efficiency of the inductive links used for remote powering of the biomedical implants by considering the effect of the load resistance on the efficiency. The optimum load condition for the inductive links is calculated from the analysis and the coils are optimized accordingly. A remote <b>powering</b> <b>link</b> topology with a matching network between the inductive link and the rectifier has been proposed to operate the inductive link near its optimum load condition to improve overall efficiency. Simulation and measurement results are presented and compared for different configurations. It is shown that, the overall efficiency of the remote <b>powering</b> <b>link</b> can be increased from 9. 84 % to 20. 85 % for 6 mW and from 13. 16 % to 18. 85 % for 10 mW power delivered to the regulator, respectively.

30|$|Considering {{that the}} RF energy {{transmission}} efficiency {{is the main}} design parameter, the bottleneck of the remote <b>powering</b> <b>link</b> is generally at the inductive link because the coupling factor between the coils of the inductive link is usually very small. Therefore, these coils should be designed properly to achieve high power transfer efficiency [21, 22].|$|R

50|$|As {{with any}} {{satellite}} communication link, the data rate {{that can be}} achieved with a terminal is dependent on the gain of the parabolic antenna. Antenna gain increases with the square of the ratio of aperture width to wavelength. Therefore for a fixed antenna size the gain, and hence the achievable data rate increases with frequency. Thus X band provides data rates which are much higher than can be achieved with UHF, L band, or C band. The achievable data rates will approach those achievable with Ku band, the exact values will depend on other link parameters (satellite <b>power,</b> <b>link</b> margin, modulation scheme, etc.).|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of higher rated insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) and integrated gate-commutated thyristors (IGCTs), has made smaller HVDC systems economical.

They have extended {{the use of}} HVDC down to blocks {{as small as a}} few tens of megawatts and lines as short as a few score kilometres of overhead line. There are several different variants of VSC technology: most installations built until 2012 use pulse width modulation in a circuit that is effectively an ultra-high-voltage motor drive. Current installations, including HVDC PLUS and HVDC MaxSine, are based on variants of a converter called a Modular Multi-Level Converter (MMC).|$|E
