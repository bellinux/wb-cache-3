40|$|Aim: Cellulite {{treatment}} incorporates iso-slim {{complex to}} reload the skin with minerals and trace elements to achieve absolute effectiveness in treating cellulite condition. The revitalizing effect of anticellulite helps to refine and reshape the silhouette {{and give the}} body a more toned, defined and firmer appearance. Aim of present work was to develop and investigate a novel delivery system for the fatty skin {{in the form of}} liposome delivery system. Method: Phosphatidylcholine, Cholesterol and iso-slim complex were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) mixture and subsequently transferred into a <b>pear-shaped</b> <b>flask</b> connected to a Rotavapor (Buchitype). Rotary evaporation method was used for the formulation of liposomes. Result: Liposome prepared was evaluated for particle size measurement, percent drug entrapment, formulation of dosage forms, Stability Study and in vivo study. Optimized batch had particle size 18. 62 um, percent drug entrapment 96. 70 %. Hence, optimized was batch further evaluated for in viv...|$|E
30|$|To 20  mL of chloroform, 70  mg of lecithin, 20  mg of cholesterol, and 210  mg of DSPE-PEG 2000 -NH were added, and {{the mixture}} {{was placed in}} an {{ultrasonic}} cleaner to completely dissolve the substances (as indicated by a clear solution without granular substances). The solution was then placed in a <b>pear-shaped</b> <b>flask</b> for rotary evaporation in a 60  °C water bath until a honeycomb-like film (no liquid residue) was formed. Gd trichloride hexahydrate (10  mg) was precisely weighed and dissolved in carbonate buffer at pH  8.5 to obtain a clear solution, which was then mixed with the above honeycomb-like film for hydration at 50  °C for 1  h; this step was followed by dispersion and refinement through an ultrasonic probe in an ultrasonic liquid processor (VCX 750, Sonics, USA). Finally, the mixture was collected and passed through a 0.22 -μm filter and subjected to ultrafiltration with a 10 -kD ultrafiltration tube to remove free Gd trichloride and obtain liposomes carrying Gd trichloride, which were then stored at 4  °C.|$|E

30|$|The matrix blanks {{applied in}} this study {{comprised}} of a complex mixture of Lingzhi fermentation solution and collagen. Within this mixture, the Lingzhi fermentation solution represents > 95 % by weight. Methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile (MeCN) were of HPLC grade from Labscan. H 2 O was purified by passing through a Purelab Option-Q water purification system (Elga, UK). Raw materials of (C) and (G) were received in powdered form. Prior to use, individual stock solutions containing 100 mg mL- 1 of (C) and (G) were prepared by extracting 10 g of each reference materials using 100 mL of MeOH for 10 min in a <b>pear-shaped</b> separating <b>flask.</b> The extracts were then transferred into 50 mL tapered tubes and centrifuged at 3, 226 g for 6 min at 6 °C. The supernatants were allowed to warm {{to room temperature before}} being purified by passing through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter, and stored at 4 °C in a 100 mL round bottom flask. From these individual stock solutions, mixed calibrants of both (C) and (G) were freshly prepared, by dilution with MeOH, at levels of 2, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg mL- 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Schlenk flask is a round bottom, <b>pear-shaped,</b> or tubular <b>flask</b> with {{a ground}} glass joint and a side arm. The side arm contains a valve, usually a greased stopcock, {{used to control}} the flask's exposure to a manifold or the atmosphere. This allows a material {{to be added to}} a flask through the ground glass joint, which is then capped with a septum. This operation can, for example, be done in a glove box. The flask can then be removed from the glove box and taken to a Schlenk line. Once connected to the Schlenk line, the inert gas and/or vacuum {{can be applied to the}} flask as required. While the flask is connected to the line under a positive pressure of inert gas, the septum can be replaced with other apparatus, for example a reflux condenser. Once the manipulations are complete, the contents can be vacuum dried and placed under a static vacuum by closing the side arm valve. These evacuated flasks can be taken back into a glove box for further manipulation or storage of the flasks' contents.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aims of {{this study}} were to develop {{liposome}} enriched Dexibuprofen liposomal hydrogels for topical delivery, perform in vitro release studies and in vivo permeation studies through mice/rat skin, and evaluate the efficacy of liposomal gels against inflammation induced rats. The purpose was to provide the delivery of the topical drug at a sustained rate across intact skin to improve bioavailability and inflammation control for longer period from liposomal gels. Method: Phosphatidylcholine, Cholesterol and Dexibuprofen were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) mixture and subsequently transferred into a <b>pear-shaped</b> <b>flask</b> connected to a Rotavapor (Büchi- type). Rotary evaporation method was used for the formulation of liposomes. Result: liposome prepared was evaluated for particle size measurement, percent drug entrapment, diffusion study, skin permeation study and in vivo study. F- 7 batch found to be optimized batch having particle size 5. 40 µm, % drug entrapment 61. 70, % CDR 75. 35 %. Hence F- 7 batch further evaluated for skin permeation study, skin deposition study, in vivo study and stability study. Conclusion: The present study has been a satisfactory attempt to formulate and evaluate liposome of Dexibuprofen and liposomal gel with a providing sustained delivery of drug. From skin permeation study and in vivo study it was concluded that the prepared liposome of Dexibuprofen may prove to be potential candidate for safe and effective sustained drug delivery {{over an extended period of}} time which can reduce dosing frequency...|$|E
40|$|Procedure: A. (5 -Cyanopentyl) zinc(II) bromide (1). An oven-dried, 200 -mL <b>pear-shaped</b> Schlenk <b>flask</b> {{equipped}} with a magnetic stirbar (egg shaped, 25. 4 × 12. 7 mm) and an argon line connected to the standard taper outer joint is purged with argon for 5 min. Zinc powder (9. 80 g, 150 mmol, 1. 50 equiv) (Note 1) is added through the open neck, and then the flask is capped with a rubber septum and heated in an oil bath under high vacuum (0. 5 mmHg) at 70 °C for 30 min. Then, the flask is refilled with argon, and anhydrous 1, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -imidazolidinone (DMI; 100 mL) (Note 2) is added via syringe. Iodine (I 2) (634 mg, 2. 50 mmol, 0. 0250 equiv) (Note 3) is added in one portion through the neck. The neck is re-capped with a rubber septum, and the reaction mixture is stirred at 70 °C in an oil bath until the red color fades (~ 5 min). 6 -Bromohexanenitrile (13. 2 mL, 100 mmol, 1. 00 equiv) (Note 4) is added via syringe over 4 min, and the reaction mixture is stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. Then, the oil bath is removed, and the mixture is allowed to cool at rt for 1 h without stirring. During this time, the unreacted zinc powder settles {{at the bottom of}} the flask. The flask is {{equipped with}} a fritted filter tube of medium porosity capped with an oven-dried, 2 -necked 250 -mL round-bottom flask, and the supernatant solution is filtered under argon by inverting the set-up (Note 5). The resulting clear yellow solution is employed in the next step without further purification. 1 H NMR spectroscopy is used to determine that the concentration of the alkylzinc solution is 0. 72 M (Note 6). This organozinc solution can be stored under argon at 0 - 4 °C for up to 3 weeks without deterioration...|$|R
