50|$|For many years, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} an important part of Sokolac. For most inhabitants, agriculture is not only {{a way to make a}} living, but also a family tradition. Sokolac used to be known for its high quality potato; until recently, potato chip manufacturing was a <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> for the region. Livestock production is the second largest agricultural industry in the community. The area surrounding Sokolac is well known for its quality grasslands, due to the foggy, moist conditions that keep the grass green for much of the year and make it well suited for grazing dairy, cattle and sheep. Beef, cattle and mutton/lamb is the second largest export of the community. Although Sokolac has a small dairy factory, the milk market production is very small. Sokolac is surrounded by high quality woodlands, which have been largely cut down in last ten years. Although this industry generates the most revenue for the community, only a small percentage of people work in that industry. Sokolac is an important intersection for regional transport routes.|$|E
30|$|<b>Promising</b> <b>industry</b> and {{emerging}} technology have {{attracted much attention}} by government and companies because the innovation of industry and technology is being made with rapid progress under the globalization of world economy. For this reason, government and corporations should find the <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> and technology appropriate to the future demand by obtaining the competitiveness {{in order to maintain}} the sustainable growth. To achieve this purpose, the studies for innovation have been widely performed in recent years (Guan and Ma, 2003; Martensen et al., 2007; Tura et al., 2008; Forsman, 2009; Paalanen et al., 2009; Damanpour, 2010; Forsman and Rantanen, 2011; Oganisjana, 2015; Yusr, 2016; Yun et al., 2016). In addition, the effect of research and development (R&D) support has been studied with great attention (Belderbos et al., 2004; Cassiman and Veugelers, 2005; Czarnitzki et al., 2007; Aerts and Schmidt, 2008; Hussinger, 2008; Czarnitzki and Hottenrott, 2011; Takalo et al., 2013; Kang and Cho, 2016; Kim et al., 2016). In order to accomplish the innovation capability and the R&D support in the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for finding the prospective areas, they depends on the announcement of <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> and technology from government and public institutions. Since the SMEs have the limitations of manpower and resources, it is difficult for them to search for the promising fields autonomously. However, many fields of industry and technology which are not suitable to the SMEs are included in the prospective areas presented by government and public institutions. This is because the procedure to choose the <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> and technology by government and public institutions is mostly dependent on the opinion of experts (ex. Delphi method). Also, in Korea, the polarization between large corporations and SMEs has not been solved yet. It is induced by rapid expansion of business field for major companies. Therefore, for the survival of SMEs in present and future market, it is necessary to develop the basic methodology of finding the SMEs-recommendable areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{electronic}} devices has made the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs) a <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> over the last decades. As the demand for printed circuit boards increases, the industry becomes more dependent on highly automated assembly processes using Surface Mounting Devices (SMD). In this paper, after describing the overall optimization problem of assemblying a PCB type using a multi-head beam-type placement machine, this problem is decomposed into its sub-problems via a heirarchical approach. Then we formulate an integrated multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model considering the two main subproblems relating to {{the heads of the}} machine. Solving this nonlinear model directly is too complex and intractable. Therefore, the model is first linearized and then a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is developed to solve it.

40|$|Demand {{response}} {{is crucial for}} the incorporation of renew-able energy into the grid. In this paper, we focus on a partic-ularly <b>promising</b> <b>industry</b> for demand response: data centers. We use simulations to show that, not only are data centers large loads, but they can provide as much (or possibly more) flexibility as large-scale storage if given the proper incentives. However, due to the market power most data centers main-tain, {{it is difficult to}} design programs that are efficient for data center demand response. To that end, we propose that prediction-based pricing is an appealing market design, and show that it outperforms more traditional supply function bidding mechanisms in situations where market power is an issue. However, prediction-based pricing may be inefficient when predictions are inaccurate, and so we provide analytic, worst-case bounds on the impact of prediction error on the efficiency of prediction-based pricing. These bounds hold even when network constraints are considered, and highlight that prediction-based pricing is surprisingly robust to pre-diction error. 1...|$|E

40|$|It {{has often}} been asked whether today´s Japan {{will be able to}} move into new and <b>promising</b> <b>industries,</b> or whether it is locked into an {{innovation}} system with an inherent inability to give birth to new industries. One argument reasons that the thick institutional complementarities among labour, innovation, and finance among its enterprises and the public sector favour industrial development in sectors of intermediate uncertainty, while it is difficult to move into areas of major uncertainty. In this paper, we present the case of the silver industry or, somewhat more prosaically, the 60 + or even 50 + industry, for which most would agree that Japan has indeed become a lead market and lead producer on the global market. For an institutional economist, the case of the silver industry is particularly interesting, because Japan´s success is based on the cooperation of existing actors, the enterprise and public sector in particular, which helped overcome the information uncertainties and asymmetries involved in the new market by relying on several established mechanisms developed well before. In that sense, Japan´s silver industry presents a case of of what we propose to call successful institutional path activation with the effect of an innovative market creation, instead of the problematic lockin effects that are usually associated with the term path dependence...|$|R
