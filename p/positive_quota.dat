40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} impact of non-compliance and market power in a fishery regulated using individual transferable quotas (ITQs). The study analyses individual firm quota demands in the presence of non-compliance and/or market power and the resultant properties of the ITQ market. The analysis is static and set in a single-species fishery. The implications of non-compliance for a fishery composed entirely of competitive firms are examined first. Here the analysis departs from the convention in the literature on analogous pollution permit markets in that firms' expected penalties are modelled as a function of their relative violations of quotas. This has a significant effect upon the results, including the possibility of quota prices which are higher with non-compliance. The research then focuses on market power in the setting of a single dominant firm faced by a fringe of competitive firms. The dominant firm is allowed market power in the quota market alone and then in both quota and output markets simultaneously. In the latter case the results differ from those previously reported in the literature, including the possibility that the firm may be freely compliant, or if cheating, may have a <b>positive</b> <b>quota</b> demand even with a zero initial quota allocation. Finally, the effects of non-compliance by the dominant firm and the competitive fringe are explored...|$|E

It shows that <b>positive</b> <b>quotas</b> for specific occupations can be the political outcome, even when total welfare effects of immigration are negative. Two of the main findings are that the (unique) voting outcome on immigration <b>quotas</b> is i) <b>positive</b> if workers are immobile across occupations and ii) negative (positive) for occupations where the native labor supply is sufficiently large (small), if workers are mobile across occupations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} the decision process that leads destination countries to introduce selective immigration policies based on skills requirements. We {{show that in}} absence of policy implementation costs, preferences in destination countries are polarized between complete openness or complete closure. However, this result changes if we take into account policy implementation costs. In presence of enforcement costs, selective immigration policies consist in <b>positive</b> <b>quotas</b> both for skilled and unskilled workers. This result fits the current scenario. We also show that the resulting policy depends on the capital endowment of the median voter: the richer, the less restrictive the immigration policy. Moreover, under mild assumptions, the rich are more biased in favour of skilled immigration than the poor...|$|R

The paper describes the basic concepts of discrimination and affirmative action. In addition, it analyzes the principle of equality and the <b>positive</b> results of <b>quotas</b> systems in countries such as Argentina and Costa Rica.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} the optimal management of a joint-ownership fishing exploitation, where agents use different fishing gears. We consider a model in which the fishing activity may affect resource growth, not only through the harvest function but also through the natural growth rate of the resource. This allows us to capture the fact that some fishing gears alter the natural growth rate of the resource. We find that when the natural growth of the resource is altered by the fishing technology, the optimal stock is not independent of how harvest quotas are distribute among the agents. As a result, a fishing policy that firstly determines the optimum stock and, secondly, decides how to distribute the harvest among the different agents, will not be efficient. We also analyze the joint determination of optimal stock and harvest quotas and show that <b>positive</b> harvest <b>quotas</b> will only be optimal when countries are characterized by certain asymmetries.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{suggests}} {{an indicator of}} power in weighted majority games. An indicator of power determines {{the ability of a}} voter to influence the outcomes of the voting bodies he belongs to. In a weighted majority game each voter is assigned a certain nonnegative real number weight and there is a <b>positive</b> real number <b>quota</b> such that a group of voters can pass a resolution if the sum of the weights of the group members is at least as high as the given quota. The new index is shown to satisfy all the reasonable postulates for an index of voting power. If attention is restricted to weighted majority game only, then this index may be considered {{as an extension of the}} Banzhaf-Coleman power indices. Finally, the paper develops an axiomatic char-acterization of the new index...|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new {{millennium}} KVINFO had its funding increased and has become much more publicly outspoken. So has claims that the organization is not purely informational and objective, but quite biased. Notably, the organization has been accused of not wanting equal rights and accused of promoting positive discrimination in favor of women. Also the organization has been accused of having a left-wing political bias. An example viewed by some as documentation of this last criticism is their 2010 yearly report on how the gender debate is coming along. In 2010 there had been a trend of non-leftish, Danish, female gender issue debaters who questioned if <b>positive</b> discrimination and <b>quotas</b> on how many percent women there should be on a board were the right thing. This trend was mentioned only in a non-flattering comparison to Sarah Palin.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} five years, {{permitted}} quota of wolverine to be removed by depredation control have not been filled in the County of Västerbotten. Few hunting attempts have been successful. Because of this, issues regarding the depredation of reindeer may not be solved. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the successfulness of hunting of wolverines for depredation control in Västerbotten County. Results from this study show that interviewees viewed depredation control as a positive management tool, but that possibilities for hunting were rather limited. The critical factor for a successful outcome of wolverine hunting was to find fresh tracks. However, possibilities for finding tracks were limited by weather and snow conditions. All hunting methods used were looked upon as being effective if they were conducted when weather and snow conditions were suitable. Hunting with dogs worked well during fall when there was little snow. Hunting by helicopter and snowmobile were most preferred in January, which also was the month where most wolverines where shot. Five out of seven interviewees were <b>positive</b> towards implementing <b>quota</b> harvest of wolverine in the future, if the hunting would be executed by moose hunters during the regular hunting season...|$|R
40|$|In {{sea cage}} fish farming, {{production}} quotas aim to constrain {{the impact of}} fish farming on the surrounding ecosystem. It is unknown how these quotas affect economic profitability and environmental impact of genetic improvement. We combined bioeconomic modelling with life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate the economic (EV) and environmental (ENV) values of thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of sea bass reared in sea cages, given four types of quota commonly used in Europe: annual production (Qprod), annual feed distributed (Qannual_ feed), standing stock (Qstock), and daily feed distributed (Qdaily_ feed). ENV were calculated for LCA impact categories climate change, eutrophication and acidification. ENV were expressed per ton of fish produced per year (ENV(fish)) and {{per farm per year}} (ENV(farm)). Results show that irrespective of quota used, EV of FCR as well as ENV(fish) and ENV(farm) were always positive, meaning that improving FCR increased profit and decreased environmental impacts. However, the EV and the ENV(fish) of TGC were <b>positive</b> only when <b>quota</b> was Qstock or Qdaily_ feed. Moreover, the ENV(farm) of TGC was negative in Qstock and Qdaily_ feed quotas, meaning that improving TGC increased the environmental impact of the farm. We conclude that Qstock quota and Qdaily_ feed quota are economically favorable to a genetic improvement of TGC, a major trait for farmers. However, improving TGC increases the environmental impact of the farm. Improving FCR represents a good opportunity to balance out this increase but more information on its genetic background is needed to develop breeding programs improving FCR...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} under a {{commercial}} export milk program {{the market value}} of quota will be determined by the spread between the domestic market price and the export price rather than the conventional wisdom that it is determined by the spread between the domestic milk price and the marginal cost of production. Under this new economy it was argued that ultimately the market price of dairy quota will be priced independently of firm marginal costs, which implies that low cost (or high margin) producers will not hold an economic advantage in bidding for quota over higher cost producers. Regression results are consistent with the hypothesized <b>positive</b> relationship between <b>quota</b> value and the difference between domestic and export milk price. The average export price has generally increased over time and is approximately equal to the marginal cost for an average producer. The results have implications for the WTO challenge. New Zealand and US feel the domestic program acts as an export subsidy by cross-subsidizing production of commercial export milk. The results here suggest that the prices for the filled export contracts are approximately the marginal cost of production for the average producer, and not lower as suggested by the challenge. Export contracts were found to have higher price risk than domestically produced milk. The risk is compounded by the short-term nature of most export contracts. The increase in risk for the CEM implies that it is unlikely many farmers will greatly diversify into CEM contracts unless the uncertainty is reduced.

40|$|Institutional pre-school {{education}} {{is the first step}} in the system of education, which has a special role in ensuring equitable platform and equal opportunities for development and education to all children regardless of their social and/or cultural background. Purpose of the master thesis is to explore how the principle of fairness and ensuring equal educational opportunities for children of Roma origin claiming the views of practitioners at nursery school and other institutions on the area of Kočevje. The survey covered key leaders and practitioners of institutions that deal with children of Roma origin in the empirical work, we see which policies and strategies of ensuring an equitable treatment and improving their educational level of children of Roma origin (the system level and at the level of the institutions, or (nursery schools) are more and less desirable; further, what are the views of the respondents to the said issues. Data were obtained from the survey questionnaire submissions, preferences and priorities respondents. From the analysis of the documents we used to determine status of integration of Romani children in institutional {{pre-school education}} as well as their school success in later periods of involvement in primary school. Analysis of the data reveals a potential between practitioners in the field of Kočevje-in terms of achieving efficiency and equity for Roma children in education and training; and suggests options to improve the situation in the direction of greater involvement of children in the system of pre-school education and, consequently, the achievement of better learning and performance in elementary school. The survey's overall showed that the awareness of respondents on policies and strategies for the greater integration of Romani children in education and teaching (and thus to improve the education level, and social integration) that already exist in our society, at a relatively low level. Poor knowledge of official documents that relate to the integration of Roma children in education is poor; respondents were reluctant to change legislation by effective measures to promote a better and even earlier inclusion of Roma children in the existing kindergartens (<b>positive</b> discrimination, <b>quotas,</b> priority admission, adaptation of standards [...] .). Respondents often attach Romans themselves responsibility for changes in direction of improvement of the situation in the field of pre-school education of Romani children, less in favour of affirmative action (or action, positive discrimination). On the basis of case studies, it is possible to conclude that the school success of Romani children in elementary school is better if they are previously included in pre-school education and regularly attend kindergarten. Despite the above, at the level of the views is interesting and encouraging the fact that in the area of Kočevje in the past two years have started activities and practices that give a large measure of hope in the improvement of the situation in the direction of better integration of Roma children in education and training. We are convinced that in some extent, the present study has stimulated the debate and initiatives at the local level. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is {{primarily}} to investigate the possibility of and the rules concerning using quotas {{in the field of}} admission to university. Secondly, an investigation of whether the Swedish Police Academy has been conducting this method during the years of 2009 and 2010 is made. They are currently accused of having discriminated applicants due to their gender and ethnicity. In order to examine the legal arena as far as possible the laws of discrimination, both including the legislations and regulations assumed by the EU as well as the Swedish laws in this field, will be studied. The laws of discrimination will be put in relation to the legal possibilities of making exceptions from the principle of equal treatment. Positive actions in the field of gender equality and ethnicity, e. g. choosing a person of the underrepresented sex over another of the opposite sex with equal qualifications in an employment situation, are examples of these exceptions constituted but the EU. Sweden has implemented some of these rules, both concerning the labour market {{as well as in the}} field of university education, of which the majority is <b>positive</b> discrimination. Using <b>quotas</b> in universities is currently forbidden by the EU and therefore also in the Swedish legislation. Along with the legal investigation, a study of the admission process within the Swedish Police Academy is carried out by examining the current rules as well as other relevant material. The method used in this essay is the dogmatic approach. Also, a social science perspective is applied by putting the prevailing rules in a societal context through the empirical study. By interviewing both teachers and students in the Police Academy, values and attitudes towards the idea of using quotas in the admission process are explored. Thus, possible societal advantages and disadvantages are presented even though the use of quotas in the university field is forbidden. Finally, the results from this empirical study is compared with and analyzed in relation to other material presented in this essay...|$|R
40|$|The driving {{question}} of this compilation thesis is whether quotas for political assemblies represent an effective tool for breaking down gender inequality {{in the political}} sphere. To put it differently, {{focus is on the}} possibilities for policy-makers to engineer equality. As a response to persistent patterns of male dominance in political decision-making, approximately 100 countries, both democratic and authoritarian, have adopted these affirmative action measures. The introductory section presents an argument as to why we should focus on certain impacts {{in order to be able}} to answer the question about the effectiveness of quotas. It suggests that the point of departure for empirical assessments of quota policies should be the normative arguments for supporting the reform, and the effects that normative theorists and quota advocates expect from these measures. The three studies that make up the core of the thesis build on previous empirical research on quotas, and examine some of their possible effects at both the elite level and mass level. Study I theoretically scrutinizes how the procedures for selecting women to political office shape these women's legislative autonomy, and thereby their possibilities to substantively represent women. The study identifies mainly two factors as important: a large body selecting the candidates and a rule-bound and thus bureaucratized selection procedure. Study II empirically tests the claim that women elected through quotas are more likely to suffer from institutional constraints in the legislature, and thereby have a harder time working for the benefit of women, than other female representatives. By conducting a comparative case-study of two Mexican state legislatures, no support is found for this hypothesis. Quotas have also been justified because of their likely impacts on female citizens' perceptions about politics. Study III addresses this issue by performing a statistical analysis on the impacts of quotas on Latin American women's political attitudes and behavior. In contrast to previous research on the topic, the study finds little proof of <b>positive</b> impacts of <b>quotas</b> on women's political engagement. Taken together, the thesis does not provide a clear-cut answer to the question as to whether it is possible to engineer equality within politics. However, it sheds new light on the complexities of quota impacts, and it qualifies and nuances the picture for those who expect quotas to be an overall solution for problems of gender inequality...|$|R
