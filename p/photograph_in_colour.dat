5000|$|Until {{the end of}} the 1990s Goldblatt - in what {{he calls}} his {{personal}} work - rarely <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour.</b> It was only after working on a project involving blue asbestos in north-western Australia, and the resulting disease and death, that his interest <b>in</b> <b>photographing</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> increased. [...] "That’s when I got hooked on doing work in color," [...] he says. [...] "You can’t make it blue in black and white." [...] This was coupled with new developments in the field of digital scanning and printing. Only when Goldblatt was able to achieve the same [...] "depth" [...] <b>in</b> his <b>colour</b> work that he had previously achieved <b>in</b> his black-and-white <b>photographs,</b> did he choose to explore this field extensively. The result is a blend of Goldblatt’s expertise in the field of classic large-format photography combined with the latest techniques offered by high-end scanners and advanced ink-jet papers, producing images redolent of South Africa’s light and land.|$|R

This set of several hundred <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> and black-and-white is a valuable testimony of the kind of images of communist Albania that were emerging at that time. In this chapter, I take as a pretext the photographic collection of Wilfried Fiedler, in its content and in its conditions of production, to analyse the situation of Albanian photography in 1957. For this, I begin by presenting the collection and its context, i. e. Albania and its relations with the Communist world before 1961. I then turn to the situation of contemporary Albanian photography to highlight the specificities of Wilfried Fiedler’s photographs and dwell on a determining criterion: colour. I conclude with considerations on photography and modernity...|$|R

40|$|Isolating {{the impact}} of a colour, or a {{combination}} of colours, is extremely difficult to achieve because it is difficult to remove other environmental elements such as sound, odours, light, and occasion from the experience of being in a place. In order to ascertain {{the impact of}} colour on how we interpret the world in day to day situations, the current study records participant responses to achromatic scenes of the built environment prior to viewing the same scene <b>in</b> <b>colour.</b> A number of environments were <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> or copied from design books; and copies of the images saved as both colour and black/grey/white. An overview of the study will be introduced by firstly providing examples of studies which have linked colour to meaning and emotions. For example, yellow is said to be connected to happiness 1; or red evokes feelings of anger 2 or passion. A link between colour and the way we understand and/or feel is established however, there is a further need for knowledge of <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> context. In response to this need, the current achromatic/chromatic environmental study will be described and discussed in light of the findings. Finally, suggestions for future research are posed.

The grant was given through the Koori Oral History Program for King-Smith to make a picture book of hundred photographs for the nineteenth-century Aboriginal people, which were taken by European photographers. However, the project took a different turn as King-Smith felt so moved by the portraits, she {{felt the need to}} make it more personally engaging. King-Smith decided to go about this by creating [...] "photo-compositions", which are artworks that combine the photographs from the nineteenth century with her own <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> of the Victorian landscape and paint. This new turn in the project repositioned Aboriginal people to be seen in a more positive light and in a spiritual and living domain.

40|$|The {{experience}} of colour is a core element of human vision. Colours provide important symbolic and contextual information not conveyed by form alone. Moreover, the {{experience of}} colour can arise without external stimulation. For many people, visual memories are rich with <b>colour</b> imagery. <b>In</b> the unusual phenomenon of grapheme-colour synaesthesia, achromatic forms such as letters, words and numbers elicit vivid experiences of colour. Few studies, however, have examined the neural correlates of such internally generated colour experiences. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to compare patterns of cortical activity for the perception of external coloured stimuli and internally generated <b>colours</b> <b>in</b> a group of grapheme-colour synaesthetes and matched non-synaesthetic controls. <b>In</b> a voluntary <b>colour</b> imagery task, both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes made colour judgements on objects presented as grey scale <b>photographs.</b> <b>In</b> a synaesthetic <b>colour</b> task, we presented letters that elicited synaesthetic colours, and asked participants to perform a localisation task. We assessed the neural activity underpinning these two different forms of colour experience that occur in the absence of chromatic sensory input. In both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, voluntary colour imagery activated the colour-selective area, V 4, in the right hemisphere. In contrast, the synaesthetic <b>colour</b> task resulted <b>in</b> unique activity for synaesthetes in the left medial lingual gyrus, an area previously implicated <b>in</b> tasks involving <b>colour</b> knowledge. Our data suggest that internally generated colour experiences recruit brain regions specialised for colour perception, with striking differences between voluntary colour imagery and synaesthetically induced colours.

For over thirty years Thomas Ruff has approached every genre of photography and coolly reinvented it. One of the greatest artists to use photography in the 21 st century, Ruff {{came of age in the}} 1980 s alongside Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer and Thomas Struth, in what was to become known as the Düsseldorf School. Creating photographic images on the scale of history paintingbut with a cool hyperrealism, Ruff moves from the micro to the macro, from portraying friends to picturing the cosmos. He also oscillates between the laboratory and the archive, experimenting with digital technologies to create photograms with virtual objects and rescuing discarded press photographs to reveal lost histories. Unlike many other publications on his work which assess Ruff’s work series by series, this catalogue provides a thematic exploration of his output including portraits, disasters, sky and cityscapes, internet nudes, photograms, manga images, magnetically generated images and found <b>photographs.</b> Lavishly illustrated <b>in</b> <b>colour,</b> and with new essays by David Campany and Sarah E.
