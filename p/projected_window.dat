Most of previous studies on {{association rule}}s are on mining intra-transaction association, which consider only relationship among the item in the same transaction. However, intra-transaction association rules are not a suitable for trend prediction. Therefore, inter-transaction association is introduced, which consider the relationship among itemset of multiple time instants. In this paper, we present PROWL, an efficient algorithm for mining inter-transaction rules. By using <b>projected</b> <b>window</b> method and depth first enumeration approach, we can discover all frequent patterns quickly. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation {{on a number of}} real and synthetic database shows that PROWL significantly outperforms previous method. ...|$|E
40|$|Mining {{frequent}} patterns is {{a fundamental}} problem in data mining research. A continuity {{is a kind of}} causal relationship which describes a definite temporal factor with exact position between the records. Since continuities break the boundaries of records, the number of potential patterns will increase drastically. An alternative approach is to mine compressed or closed frequent continuities (CFC). Mining CFCs has the same power as mining the complete set of frequent patterns, while substantially reducing redundant rules to be generated and increasing the effectiveness of mining. In this paper, we propose a method called <b>projected</b> <b>window</b> list (PWL) technology for the mining of frequent continuities. We present a series of frequent continuity mining algorithms, including PROWL+, COCOA and ClosedPROWL. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm is more efficient than previously works...|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to assess {{the potential of the}} modulated louvered windows (ML W) to provide ventilation as a cooling source to achieve thermal comfort inside buildings. It presents an intensive analysis of the characteristics of airflow as function of the various MLW parameters in order to provide designers with practical information about the performance of MLW in the control of natural ventilation inside the room. Some initial studies suggested the significance of adjustable horizontal louvered windows, or the MLW as they are referred to in {{this research}}, as an effective technique for the control of natural ventilation beside the other Environmental issues. In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the shelter adaptation to the hot-humid climate was achieved by employing a number of passive solutions, one of which, the MLW constructed in the Rowshan, was considered a main elevation treatment. The Rowshan, a <b>projected</b> <b>window</b> bay, covered in this study is constructed with adjustable louvers in a number of sashes arranged in rows and columns to control and alter breeze to the desired level inside the room. The Rowshan is also credited with controlling other environmental factors and is supposed to reflect social necessities. This thesis has investigated the airflow characteristics of the MLW with reference to the Rowshan of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After reviewing the previous efforts and prediction techniques concerned, the research has conducted a series of experiments including laboratory and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) appraisal stages. The laboratory stage included the evaluation of the pressure drop (L 1 J') and the velocity drop (v/ve...|$|E
40|$|The model-based {{assessments}} of nominal Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) compositions {{suggest that a}} viable frit candidate {{does not appear to}} be a limiting factor as the Closure Business Unit (CBU) considers various tank blending options for SB 4 with or without the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) streams. This statement is based solely on the projected operating windows derived from model predictions and does not include experimental {{assessments of}} SO{sub 4 } solubility or melt rate issues. To assess the impact of the various ARP options on the projected operating windows, the 1100 canister SB 4 baseline options served as the technical baseline or reference point for the comparisons. With respect to the various ARP options being considered, the impacts to the projected operating windows were relatively consistent with the impacts being dependent upon the property limiting access to higher WLs. More specifically, for those 1100 canister SB 4 systems (without ARP) which were T{sub L}-limited, the general impact was an increase in the upper WL which was classified as acceptable resulting in an overall increase in the operating window size. The anticipated negative impact of TiO{sub 2 } (due to an assumed increase in T{sub L} which would further reduce the size of the operating window of such systems) was not observed. The hypothesis is that the negative impact was countered or compensated by a positive impact due to the additional Na{sub 2 }O from the ARP process. The overall result was a net increase in the size of the operating window for the SB 4 1100 canister options which were T{sub L}-limited. This trend was observed for all five ARP options with the only difference being the magnitude of the increase (ranging from a 1 %- 4 % increase) which was strictly based on the specific ARP composition and blending strategy. Another general observation for all five ARP options was a negative impact with their addition to a 1100 canister system that was initially low viscosity limited or durability limited. For these systems, addition of each ARP stream resulted in a negative impact to the upper WL defining the operating window as a result of the additional Na{sub 2 }O introduced which drove both viscosity and durability predictions lower at the same WL. The magnitude of the impact ranged from a 1 - 2 % reduction for low viscosity limited systems to complete elimination of the operating windows for durability limited systems. The latter situation (i. e., complete elimination of the operating window for a given SB 4 blending option with a specified frit) would require a change in frit to compositionally compensate for the ARP addition. One of the most interesting ARP options was the introduction of the ARP-K case. Model-based predictions and projected TiO{sub 2 } concentrations, would require an increase in the current PCCS TiO{sub 2 } limit from 1 wt% to 2 wt% (if WLs targeting 39 % or greater are desired). With this increase, there appears to be some potential advantages of this ARP stream relative to the other four ARP options. One potential advantage is based on the {approx} 4 % increase in the upper WL defining the <b>projected</b> <b>window</b> for most of the options being considered (which were initially T{sub L} limited). Although potentially advantageous for some systems, the addition of the ARP-K stream could be devastating to other systems if compositional adjustments are not made (i. e., a frit change). Frits could be selected that are robust to the inclusion of the ARP but they may not be optimized for other properties (e. g., melt rate). Although ARP-K has potential advantages on the projected operating windows, the other ARP options evaluated should not be dismissed as other criteria (e. g., melt rate and/or CPC processing issues) should be considered prior to pursuing a particular ARP processing scenario. More specifically, based on the assessments performed in this report, there are no show-stoppers for any of the ARP options being considered [...] although some options could require a frit change between a ''sludge-only'' flowsheet and its ''coupled'' (sludge plus ARP) counterpart. Based on the SB 4 -ARP blending strategies, the additions of TiO{sub 2 } and SO{sub 4 } from the ARP streams could result in these oxides exceeding some critical value that would give rise to uncertainties or questions associated with the applicability of select models or exceeding individual solubility limits. In general, establishing a PCCS SO{sub 4 } limit of 0. 5 or 0. 6 wt% (in glass) appears to be sufficient to avoid the SB 4 -ARP systems from being SO{sub 4 } limited at the upper WLs. With respect to model applicability issues, the primary PCCS model of concern was the T{sub L} model which was developed over TiO{sub 2 } concentrations ranging from 0. 0 - 1. 8549 wt% (in glass). Although the ARP-K option would require the TiO{sub 2 } limit to be raised to 2. 0 wt%, maximum TiO{sub 2 } concentrations in glass are well below the 2 wt% limit established by Lorier and Jantzen (2003) ...|$|E
