40|$|Modern {{impression}} {{techniques used}} in restorative dentistry require displacementof gingival tissue {{to expose the}} subgingival finish lines on the tooth preparation. Many different medications are used on gingival retraction cords {{in order to minimize}} hemorrhage from the gingival sulcus during impression making. A common method of accomplishing gingival displacement is by <b>packing</b> <b>cord</b> into the gingival crevice. This is especially critical when using hydrophobic impression materials such as polyvinyl siloxanes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether any of the commonly used gingival retraction medications could inhibit the polymerization of polyvinyl siloxane impression materials when they are in direct contact with the setting material and to evaluate the clinical performance of retraction cords. Many gingival retraction cords in various shapes, sizes and medications are available on the market. The literature is replete with reports on the effects of medicated and non-medicated cords on impression and gingival tissue. In this study, the number of the criteria of evaluation was increased and both in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted together by three prosthodontists...|$|E

60|$|The truth is, she had quitted the {{premises}} for many hours, and upon that permission {{which is called}} French leave among us After picking up the trinkets in the drawing-room, Mademoiselle had ascended to her own apartments, <b>packed</b> and <b>corded</b> her own boxes there, tripped out and called a cab for herself, brought down her trunks with her own hand, and without ever so much as asking the aid {{of any of the}} other servants, who would probably have refused it, as they hated her cordially, and without wishing any one of them good-bye, had made her exit from Curzon Street.|$|R
40|$|The {{rarity of}} adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} prompted us {{to report a}} case who came {{with a history of}} swelling in the left flank associated with pain, weakness and loss of appetite. Ultrasonography revealed a left retroperitoneal mass which was removed by radical surgery along with the left kidney and spleen. On histopathological examination, a diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma was made. (Hough criteria score 2. 97). The cells of the tumor were arranged in closely <b>packed</b> columns and <b>cords</b> supported by fibrovascular stroma. There was no evidence of metastasis...|$|R
60|$|When morning dawned {{he thought}} he must have dreamed this piece of ambiguity; but no, on going downstairs he found them <b>packing</b> trunks and <b>cording</b> boxes, and making other {{preparations}} for Miss Charity's departure, which lasted all day long. In good time for the evening coach, Miss Charity deposited her housekeeping keys with much ceremony upon the parlour table; took a gracious leave of all the house; and quitted her paternal roof--a blessing for which the Pecksniffian servant was observed by some profane persons to be particularly active in the thanksgiving at church next Sunday.|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{features of}} the regional lymph node draining a skin homograft have been examined in normal and tolerant recipients. The response of this node was morphologically identical in normal and specifically tolerant hosts, the most important feature being the appearance of medullary <b>cords</b> <b>packed</b> with intensely pyroninophilic cells. Furthermore, a similar response was observed in the regional lymph nodes of (DA×Lewis) F_ 1 hybrids bearing DA skin grafts of which they were ”genetically tolerant”. It was concluded that the failure of graft rejection in tolerant rats could not be attributed to an absence of reactivity to the grafts {{on the part of}} the lymphoid tissue of the host...|$|R
50|$|The {{marines and}} the king's guards assault the Great Houses' homes, while Roger, Pahner and several marines, {{take out the}} nobles' guards at a state dinner, {{allowing}} the king's guards to arrest them. The king then introduces the marines to D'Len Pah, {{the leader of a}} tribe of professional caravan drivers who own several pack animals called flar-ta. D'Len is impressed by the humans capabilities and agrees to join them, believing that they have the best chance of reopening the trade routes to Voitan.

5000|$|A legend is {{told about}} the old man under the moon. During the Tang Dynasty, {{there was a young}} man named Wei Gu (韋固 Wéi Gù). Once he was passing the city of Songcheng, where he saw an old man leaning on his pack reading a book in the moonlight. Being amazed at it, Wei Gu walked up and asked what he was doing. The old man answered: [...] "I am reading a book of {{marriage}} listing for who is going to marry whom. In my <b>pack</b> are red <b>cords</b> for tying the feet of husband and wife." [...] When Wei Gu and the old man came together to a marketplace, they saw a blind old woman carrying a three-year-old little girl in her arms. The old man said to Wei Gu: [...] "This little girl will be your wife in the future." [...] Wei Gu thought this was too strange to believe and he ordered his servant to stab the girl with his knife.|$|R

What are we human beings after all? Clay {{in the hands}} of the potter. Our bodies are merely an inheritance, <b>packed</b> tight and <b>corded</b> up. We have {{practically}} no control over their main functions. We can't even replace a little finger-nail. And look at the faces of us--what atrocious mockeries most of them are of any kind of image! But we know our bodies change--age, sickness, thought, passion, fatality. It proves they are amazingly plastic. And merely even as a theory it is not in the least untenable that by force of some violent convulsive effort from outside one's body might change. It answers with odd voluntariness to friend or foe, smile or snarl. As for what we call the laws of Nature, they are pure assumptions to-day, and may be nothing better than scrap-iron tomorrow. Good Heavens, Lawford, consider man's abysmal impudence.' He smoked on in silence for a moment. 'You say you fell asleep down there?' ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{retinopathy}} of prematurity (ROP) {{is associated}} with low birth weight and low gestational age. For ROP screening examination is recommended in infants weighing 1500 g (n = 149) and who required additional oxygen supplementation or underwent surgery with general anaesthesia before estimated term. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, three infants with birth weights between 2080 and 2325 g and a gestational age of 32 or 33 weeks developed stage 2 or 3 ROP. One of these underwent cryocoagulation. In three infants, preterm birth was induced by sudden placental abruption with severe prenatal blood loss followed by haemorrhagic shock. The umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>packed</b> cell volume was reduced to 0. 14 - 0. 19 (normal 0. 43 - 0. 63). All three infants underwent surgery with general anaesthesia within the first weeks of life. Of the remaining 449 infants none with a birth weight > 1650 g developed any stage of ROP. CONCLUSION: Severe prenatal blood loss requiring blood transfusions and surgery with general anaesthesia may induce higher stages of ROP even in infants with birth weights exceeding the usual screening criteria...|$|R
6000|$|The {{month of}} {{courtship}} had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered. There was no putting off {{the day that}} advanced--the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, <b>packed,</b> locked, <b>corded,</b> ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I (D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction, [...] "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," [...] on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: {{she would not be}} born till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. [...] "I will leave you by yourself, white dream," [...] I said. [...] "I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it." ...|$|R
6000|$|They both {{feared that}} he might be found on the next day to have {{departed}} from his intention; but no such idea seemed to have occurred to him. He gave instructions as to the notice to be served on the agent from the Hospital as to his house, and allowed Emily to go among his things and make preparations for the journey. He did not say much to her; and when she attempted, with a soft half-uttered word, to assure him that the threat of Italian interference, which had come from Stanbury, had not reached Stanbury from her, he simply shook his head sadly. She could not understand whether he did not believe her, or whether he simply wished that the subject should be dropped. She could elicit no sign of affection from him, nor would he willingly accept such from her;--but he allowed her to prepare for the journey, and never hinted that his purpose might again be liable to change. On the Friday, Emily with her child, and Hugh with all their baggage, travelled out on the road to Casalunga, thinking it better {{that there should be no}} halt in the town on their return. At Casalunga, Hugh went up the hill with the driver, leaving Mrs. Trevelyan in the carriage. He had been out at the house before in the morning, and had given all necessary orders;--but still at the last moment he thought that there might be failure. But Trevelyan was ready, having dressed himself up with a laced shirt, and changed his dressing-gown for a blue frock-coat, and his brocaded cap for a Paris hat, very pointed before and behind, and closely turned up at the sides. But Stanbury did not in the least care for his friend's dress. [...] "Take my arm," [...] he said, [...] "and we will go down, fair and easy. Emily would not come up because of the heat." [...] He suffered himself to be led, or almost carried down the hill; and three women, and the coachman, and an old countryman who worked on the farm, followed with the luggage. It took about an hour and a half to pack the things; but at last they were all <b>packed,</b> and <b>corded,</b> and bound together with sticks, as though it were intended that they should travel in that form to Moscow. Trevelyan the meanwhile sat on a chair which had been brought out for him from one of the cottages, and his wife stood beside him with her boy. [...] "Now then we are ready," [...] said Stanbury. And in that way they bade farewell to Casalunga. Trevelyan sat speechless in the carriage, and would not even notice the child. He seemed to be half dreaming and to fix his eyes on vacancy. [...] "He appears to think of nothing now," [...] Emily said that evening to Stanbury. But who can tell how busy and how troubled are the thoughts of a madman! ...|$|R
