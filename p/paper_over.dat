During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E

25|$|The {{validity}} of the ‘212’ patent hinged on the description given in the EMERALD paper. SRI argued the EMERALD paper was a “statement of intent” {{and could not be}} accomplished by a person with ordinary skill.

Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor.

25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues a piece of <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves {{the next day to}} catch a train.|$|E

Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle also gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Vikram Kumar has {{come out with a}} nice story and screenplay and created a classic masterpiece. Though there are past life regressions and rebirths, the director’s intelligent screenplay makes you to see more comfortably without any confusion. Manam is a good film to watch and a fitting tribute to Akkineni Nageswara Rao." ...|$|E
500|$|The Saraswathi Mahal Library, {{established}} around 1700 {{and located}} in the premises of the palace, contains over 30,000 Indian and European manuscripts written on palm leaf and <b>paper.</b> <b>Over</b> eighty per cent of its manuscripts are in Sanskrit {{and many of them}} are on palm leaves. The Tamil works include treatises on medicine, and commentaries on Sangam literature. The Rajaraja Chola art gallery is located inside the palace – it has a large collection of stone and bronze images from the ninth to 12th centuries. Most of the idols present in the gallery were collected from various temples in the Thanjavur district. The Sivaganga Park is situated to the east of the Brihadeeswarar Temple and encompasses the Sivaganga Tank believed to have been built by the king Raja Raja Chola. It was created as a people's park by the Tanjore municipality in 1871–72. It has a collection of plants, animals and birds and serves as a zoo for children within thecity.|$|E
500|$|Clearmountain {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{recording}} engineers to hang tissue <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> the tweeters of the NS-10 to tame the over-bright treble. Covering the tweeters with tissue paper {{was said to}} produce treble-deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi-fi. The phenomenon became the subject of hot debate. [...] Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper. He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. [...] Hodas derided the tissue practice as [...] "aberrant behaviour", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. [...] He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter.|$|E

500|$|The Herald re-emerged as a daily {{paper in}} March 1919. Under Lansbury's {{direction}} it maintained {{a strong and}} ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury [...] travelled to [...] Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. He published an account: What I Saw in Russia, but {{the impact of the}} visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: [...] "We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the Heralds financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the [...] <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.|$|E
500|$|The Petworth House globe, {{now in the}} North Gallery, is {{the only}} Molyneux {{terrestrial}} globe preserved in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's [...] "great globes", measuring [...] in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the British Museum the previous year. The northern hemisphere was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places, {{to the extent that}} it was hard to read. Parts of it, and large sections of the southern hemisphere, are missing altogether. The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of plaster about 1⁄8 inch (3mm) thick. On top of this is another layer of <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass meridian ring, but its hour circle and index are missing. Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997. The globe was exhibited at the Royal Geographical Society in 1951 and 1952.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, Evans {{designed}} book-covers known as yellow-backs, a [...] "book bound in yellow-glazed <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> boards". He perfected the method {{and became the}} printer of choice for many London publishers; by 1853 he was the chief yellow-back printer in the city. He developed the yellow-back as he disliked the white paper book-covers that became soiled and discoloured; {{as a result of}} this aversion he experimented with yellow paper by treating before adding the printed illustration. Often yellow-backs were used for unsold editions, so that they functioned as reprints or waste; typically [...] "enormous number of these covers" [...] were left behind for publishers. Other terms for the books were [...] "Penny dreadfuls", [...] "railway novels" [...] and [...] "mustard plaisters". For the illustrations, Evans commissioned artists such as George Cruikshank, Phiz, Randolph Caldecott and Walter Crane. Evans' first cover was brightly coloured, utilising only reds and blues, overprinting blue over black to create what appeared as a black background. He continued the practice of using red and blue, engraving [...] "in graduation" [...] for lighter tints of reds used for faces and hands, and engraving the blue blocks in a manner that created textures and patterns. Evans realised books that may have been unsuccessful in a first printing were easy to sell with well-designed cover art.|$|E
