5000|$|Amrinone (INN) or inamrinone (USAN, {{changed in}} 2000 to prevent {{confusion}} with amiodarone), trade name Inocor, is a pyridine phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor.

Amrinone {{has been shown to}} increase the contractions initiated in the heart by high gain calcium induced calcium release (CICR). The positive inotropic effect of amrinone is mediated by the selective enhancement of high gain CICR which contributes to the contraction of myocytes by phosphorylation through cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+ calmodulin kinase pathways.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Autologous {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (ASCT) is {{the gold standard}} therapy for suitable multiple myeloma (MM) patients after induction with high dose therapy.

Our aim was to evaluate appearance of unrelated atypical serum immunofixation patterns (ASIPs) as a marker of <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> MM <b>patients</b> submitted to ASCT. We retrospectively analysed data from 65 patients. Interestingly, we observed that presence of ASIPs was associated with longer progression-free survival and longer overall survival.

50|$|Although NOV {{inhibits}} {{the proliferation}} of cancer cells, it appears to promote metastasis. Nov overexpression results in reduced tumor size in glioma cells xenografts, but enhances metastatic potential in xenotransplanted melanoma cells. NOV expression {{is associated with a}} higher risk of metastasis and worse <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with cancers such as Ewing’s sarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), NOV is downregulated {{as a consequence of the}} kinase activity of BCR-ABL, a chimeric protein generated through the chromosomal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. Forced expression of NOV inhibits proliferation and restores growth control in CML cells, suggesting that NOV may be an alternate target for novel therapeutics against CML.|$|E
5000|$|Macrophages within tumor stroma, {{so called}} tumor-associated {{macrophage}}s (TAMs) promote tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor-associated macrophage infiltration correlates with poor <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with breast, cervix, bladder and brain cancers. Pathophysiological interaction between tumor-associated macrophages and surrounding cells, such as endothelial cells promote tumor progression. In 1971, Judah Folkman proposed that angiogenesis plays {{essential role in}} tumor growth. Macrophages secrete many pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TNF-α, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-1 and IL-6. Additionally {{it has been shown}} that adipose tissue surrounding certain tumors or metastases to the lymph nodes, which are embedded in adipose tissue, fuels tumor growth by serving as a depot for adipose tissue macrophages that stumulate angiogenesis and resemble TAMs.|$|E

5000|$|Expressed emotion (EE), is {{a measure}} of the family {{environment}} that is based on how the relatives of a psychiatric patient spontaneously talk about the patient. It is a psychological term specifically applied to psychiatric patients, and differs greatly from the daily use of the phrase [...] "emotion expression" [...] or another psychological concept [...] "family expressiveness"; frequent communication and natural expression of emotion among family members is a conducive, healthy habit.Theoretically, a high level of EE in the home can worsen the <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with mental illness, such as schizophrenia and social anxiety disorder) or act as a potential risk factor for the development of psychiatric disease. Typically it is determined whether a person or family has high expressed emotion or low expressed emotion through a taped interview known as the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI). Answers to questions and non-verbal cues are used to determine if someone has high expressed emotion. There is another measurement that is taken from the view of the patient. It rates the patient's perception of how his family feels about him and the disorder. If the patient feels that the parents are too protective or not caring the patient feels that his parents don't care of his independence or trust his judgement. This attitude may cause the patient to relapse and patients that rate their parents poorly in this test have a harder time coping with their illness if too much time is spent with the parent.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxia exists {{when there}} is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a {{reduction}} in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with COPD the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without alveolar hypoventilation, as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for LTOT. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale—right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure—in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by FEV1 is the best correlate with overall <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> with {{gastric cancer}} (GC), {{circulating}} microRNA- 21 (miR- 21) is overexpressed and {{may serve as}} a diagnostic biomarker. In the present study, it was hypothesized that the serum miR- 21 expression levels were associated with <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> the <b>patients</b> with GC. The expression levels of serum miR- 21 were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays <b>in</b> 103 GC <b>patients.</b> Survival and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to determine the correlation between serum miR- 21 expression levels and <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> the <b>patients.</b> The correlation between the serum miR- 21 levels and the clinicopathological factors of the patients was also analyzed. Survival curves were not significantly different between the groups exhibiting high and low levels of serum miR- 21 expression. High levels of miR- 21 in the serum were associated with an increased tumor size and an advanced pT stage. These findings suggest that serum miR- 21 could be exploited as a practical biomarker for moni-toring tumor burden <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with GC...|$|R
