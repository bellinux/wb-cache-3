This request by the DOJ was granted on September 17, 2012 when a single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold on the district court judge's permanent injunction ruling made by judge Katherine Forrest on September 12, 2012. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order by which he granted the Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. Judge Lohier's order further said that a Second Circuit motions <b>panel</b> <b>will</b> take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012.

The Lohier order basically a.) temporarily stayed Judge Forrest's 2012-09-12 ruling b.) puts the whole matter i.e. the permanent injunction on hold c.) allows enforcement of the blocked NDAA section pending appeal and d.) means that the interim stay will remain in effect until at least September 28, 2012 when a three judge panel of the Second Circuit {{is expected to begin}} addressing the issue of a longer-term stay(The September 28, 2012 hearing won't go over the merits of the case, but only deal with the U.S. government's motion to stay the permanent injunction throughout its appeal of the permanent injunction.).

2500|$|Traditionally, after {{defeating}} an enemy, players {{must move}} to the corpse to retrieve any loot reward from it. [...] Because combat in Rohan {{is intended to be}} on horseback, and because it is incredibly inconvenient to swing the war-steed around just to loot a corpse, Riders of Rohan introduced the concept of Remote Looting. [...] Instead of having to travel back to a defeated enemy's corpse, loot rewards are automatically placed into the Remote Loot panel. [...] An alert is then displayed to the player which, when clicked, will open the Remote Loot panel. [...] This <b>panel</b> <b>will</b> hold a maximum of 50 items for 1 hour (in game time, not real time). [...] If any subsequent items are added before 1 hour has expired, the oldest items will be purged first. [...] If the player waits more than an hour, items that have been in Remote Loot for that hour will be purged. [...] Each item has its own timer. [...] Once the Remote Loot panel is opened, the player can opt to retrieve the loot or discard it. [...] Loot rewards discarded from the Remote Loot panel are irretrievable. [...] Players are not able to place items from their inventory back into Remote Loot. [...] Stacks of items will be placed into Remote Loot, but subsequent items of the same type will not stack with each other; they count as separate items. [...] For example, if a player is awarded 3 Athelas Potions, the whole stack of 3 will be placed into Remote Loot as 1 item. [...] If the player is later awarded 2 more Athelas Potions, the new stack of 2 will not stack onto the existing stack of 3.
