To be awarded validation, Trinity was required to document and satisfy all quality assurance standards as outlined by the university, which includes QAA national standards related to the framework for higher education qualifications, program specifications, subject benchmark statements, and code of practice. A validation site visit of Trinity by a panel of assessors appointed by the university was also required for Trinity to demonstrate evidence of the attainment of said standards.|$|E

25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} the medical establishment. Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise {{would have to go}} to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E

500|$|When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Saëns {{took charge}} of piano studies and {{introduced}} contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. Fauré recalled in old age, [...] "After allowing the lessons to run over, {{he would go to}} the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known....

500|$|When Albert Victor {{was just}} short of {{seventeen}} months old, his brother, Prince George of Wales, was born on 3 June 1865. Given the closeness in age of the two royal brothers, they were educated together. In 1871, the Queen appointed John Neale Dalton as their tutor. The two princes were given a strict <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> which included games and military drills as well as academic subjects. Dalton complained that Albert Victor's mind was [...] "abnormally dormant". Though he learned to speak Danish, progress in other languages and subjects was slow. Sir Henry Ponsonby thought that Albert Victor might have inherited his mother's deafness. Albert Victor never excelled intellectually. Possible physical explanations for Albert Victor's inattention or indolence in class include absence seizures or his premature birth, which {{can be associated with}} learning difficulties, but Lady Geraldine Somerset blamed Albert Victor's poor education on Dalton, whom she considered uninspiring.|$|E
500|$|Conduct books {{integrated}} {{the styles}} and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers {{a description of}} (most often) the ideal woman {{while at the same}} time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined [...] "proper" [...] etiquette. Typical examples include Bluestocking Hester Chapone's Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773), which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the 18th century, and the classically educated historian Catharine Macaulay's Letters on Education (1790). Chapone's work, in particular, appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of Thoughts because it argued [...] "for a sustained <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> for women" [...] and was based on the idea that Christianity should be [...] "the chief instructor of our rational faculties". Moreover, it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism. When Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792, she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works.|$|E
