5000|$|They were {{delivered}} via the ALSIB (Alaska-Siberia) air ferry route. The aircraft had its baptism of {{fire at the}} end of June 1942. The Soviets were dissatisfied with the four [...]30-calibre Browning machine guns — themselves only capable of firing at a top rate of 600 rounds per gun per minute — and replaced them with the faster-firing, 7.62mm calibre ShKAS, capable of up to 1800 rounds per gun per minute. During the summer of 1942, the Bostons flew ultra-low-level raids against German convoys heavily protected by flak. Attacks were made from altitudes as low as 33 ft (10 metres) and the air regiments suffered heavy losses. By mid-1943 Soviet pilots were very familiar with the A-20B and A-20C. The general opinion was that the aircraft was overpowered and therefore fast and agile. It could make steep turns with an angle of up to 65°, while the tricycle landing gear made for easier take-offs and landings. The type could be flown even by crews with minimal training. The engines were reliable but sensitive to low temperatures, so the Soviet engineers developed special covers for keeping <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> from freezing up.|$|E

In this paper, a model was developed to study {{the influence of the}} taper on the interference fit between a propeller hub and a shaft. Using the classic elastic plane stress theory, the exact solutions of the radial stresses, tangential stresses and radial displacements of the propeller hub and shaft are derived. Then the calculation method of the magnitude of the tapered interference fit was presented. Finally taking a screw propeller system as an example, the above solutions were calculated by using the numerical method. The results show that the taper {{plays a key role in}} the interference fit. Improving the stress distribution of the propeller hub is an effective approach to increase the connection strength. The present analytical solutions are expected to be useful in the structure design of tapered interference fits for <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> and shafts...|$|E
40|$|The {{designed}} propellers with extinguishing {{structures of}} hub and winglets show great potential in saving energy {{by providing the}} strong thrust with a rotating speed. The dynamic performances are relying on the combination of geometries characteristics. This project {{is based on a}} cooperation with Nodin Innovation since August 2015 to study different <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> and winglets through FEM modelling. Hub structures in convex, concave, dome, and dome coping with a small Center propeller located {{on the front of the}} hub are tested with a rotating speed under the RPM of 100 rev/min in manipulation under the standard k - e turbulence model. The shear stress transport turbulence model is carried out to study the potential dynamic properties of four propellers (the Convex propeller, the Dome propeller, the Center propeller, and the Winglet propeller) under the RPM less than 3000 rev/min. The mass flow through the inlet, interfaces, and the outlet is applied to determine the stability of the fluid flow. The present study shows a relative mass flow of each propeller compared with the Convex propeller which is chosen to be the reference model in this dissertation. Through CFD simulations in ANSYS CFX, we evaluate the dynamic performances of the designed propellers. Some tables and figures containing the most important parameters, and the expecting future work are given to open up a specific avenue for improving the analysis process for the simulations...|$|E
50|$|Propeller Control - Used to set {{the desired}} {{propeller}} speed. Once the pilot has set the desired propeller speed, the propeller governor maintains that propeller speed by adjusting the {{pitch of the propeller}} blades, using the engine's oil pressure to move a hydraulic piston in the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|R
50|$|The H model had heavy {{armament}} {{to allow}} it to deal quickly with enemy aircraft.

40|$|The mold {{filling and}} {{solidification}} process of a marine <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> were simulated using ProCAST? Three casting processes ?gravity casting, centrifugal casting and {{low pressure casting}} ?were compared {{in order to get}} the best process. The heat transfer coefficient of the casting/mold interface was determined using a reverse method. The simulated results of velocity, temperature and shrinkage porosity distribution were discussed in detail for the three casting processes. A smooth filling was found in all three casting processes, especially the low pressure casting exhibiting a better filling performance than the other two, but the solidification processes were different. The casting did not experience the sequential solidification, and the feeding paths were blocked, leading to shrinkage porosity defects in the riser and the bottom of the casting in gravity casting and in the upper zone of the casting in low pressure casting. While, the sequential solidification was well controlled in the solidification process of centrifugal casting, and majority of the shrinkage porosity defects can only be observed in the riser. It could be concluded that the centrifugal casting process is the most suitable casting process for the production of <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> body. The casting experiments verified the simulation results, and a defect-free <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> was obtained by centrifugal casting with a rotational speed of 150 r. in- 1...|$|R
25|$|A spinner is an {{aircraft}} component, a streamlined fairing fitted over a <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> {{or at the}} centre of a turbofan engine. Spinners both make the aircraft overall more streamlined, reducing aerodynamic drag and also smooth the airflow so that it enters the air intakes more efficiently. Spinners also fulfill an aesthetic role on some aircraft designs.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1942, {{even before}} the {{prototype}} flew, the USAAF ordered it into production as the P-63A (Model 33).

50|$|Other {{solutions}} to avoiding the propeller arc include passing the gun's barrel through the <b>propeller's</b> <b>hub</b> or spinner (the {{nose of the}} aircraft) - first used in production military aircraft with the World War I French SPAD S.XII - or mounting guns in the wings.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an air-inlet system (10), and relates to an air-conditioning system (100, 101) and an {{internal combustion engine}} (200) comprising the air-inlet system. The air-inlet system comprises an air intake port (20), an air output port (30) and a turbine (40) for controlling air mass flow into a combustion chamber (202) of an internal combustion engine. The turbine is provided with a <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> (42) which comprises at least one blade (44). The <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> is arranged between the air intake port and the air output port for propelling the blade of the turbine. The turbine has an air-flow resistance for determining the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. The effect of the air-inlet system according to the invention is {{that the use of}} a turbine enables to use {{at least some of the}} pressure drop across the turbine to drive the blade of the turbine for generating rotational energy...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicle propulsion has been primarily driven by conventional thruster arrangements and control fins. The {{development of a}} collective and cyclic pitch propeller system provides a highly maneuverable alternative to these conventional designs. Therefore, a computer controlled and fully actuated collective and cyclic pitch propeller was designed and fabricated to fulfill this need. [...] The new propeller was designed using a helicopter like linkage system. The swash plates mounted inside of the propeller housing, as opposed to <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> like a helicopter. Locating the linkages in the housing provided a more maintainable system of linkages, due to space limitations in the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub.</b> The swash plate was positioned using three ball screw electric actuators using absolute positioning feedback. The swash plate position was transmitted to the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> {{by a set of}} four control rods, one for each blade. Four blades were chosen for the propeller to reduce pulsing of the propeller when operating in cyclic mode. [...] Initial testing of the prototype demonstrates the propeller's potential ability to control the {{underwater vehicle}} at little or no forward speed. While operating in the 50 % ahead, 100 % to port condition, a thrust value of 26. 7 N (6 lbf) with a turning moment of 18. 9 Nm (168 in-lb) was measured. The turning moment generated at a forward speed of 1. 6 m/s was sufficient to turn the C-SCOUT vehicle in 38 % of the present required turning circle using a conventional thruster and control fins...|$|R
