40|$|Optimization of the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) {{dry etching}} process {{parameters}} {{has been carried}} out. Seven main etching characteristics were considered {{in order to produce}} good etching quality. These characteristics are glass etching rates, selectivity of chromium to glass etching rate, channel side wall roughness, channel side wall vertical profile, channel cleanliness, critical dimension and resolution. Several ICP parameters that are affecting the etching characteristic were optimized in this work. These optimised ICP parameters obtained from this work are ICP power (880 W), bias power (45 W), operating chamber pressure (10 mtorr), reactant gas composition, reactant gas flow rate (35 sccm of C 2 F 6 and 9 sccm of H 2), and working distance (5 cm from reference point). Following the above, the dry etching process showed significant improvement from the original etching process. The etching rate was increased to 255 nm/min (equivalent to 13 %improvement) with selectivity of 45 (equivalent to 80 % increment). Moreover, there are clear improvements in cleanliness and no polymerization was observed as compared to non-optimised samples. Furthermore, comparison between Scaning Elelctro Microscope(SEM) images of the etched surface before and after the optimization process, showing major improvements in the reduction of plasma induced surface damage also know as <b>pin</b> <b>hold</b> effect...|$|E
5000|$|An {{effective}} <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> is {{a winning}} condition in many styles of wrestling, {{and is known}} as simply a [...] "pin". <b>Pinning</b> <b>holds</b> maintained for 20 seconds are also a winning condition in Judo. <b>Pinning</b> <b>holds</b> are also used in submission wrestling and mixed martial arts, even though the <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> itself is not a winning condition. The holds {{can be used to}} rest while the opponent tries to escape, to control the opponent while striking, a tactic known as ground and pound, or to control an opponent from striking by pinning them to the ground, also known as lay and pray.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> (also {{known as}} a hold down and in Japanese as osaekomi-waza, 抑え込み技, [...] "pinning technique") is a general {{grappling}} hold used in ground fighting which is aimed to subdue by exerting superior control over an opponent and pinning the opponent to the ground. <b>Pinning</b> <b>holds</b> where both the opponent's shoulders touch the ground are considered winning conditions in several combat sports.|$|R
25|$|The {{techniques}} {{utilized in}} mixed martial arts competition generally {{fall into two}} categories: striking techniques (such as kicks, knees, punches and elbows) and grappling techniques (such as clinch <b>holds,</b> <b>pinning</b> <b>holds,</b> submission holds, sweeps, takedowns and throws).|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pinning</b> <b>holds</b> in budō {{from the}} mount include tate shiho gatame (縦四方固, [...] "horizontal four {{quarters}} hold", also called hon-tate-shiho-gatame, 本縦四方固), {{which is similar}} to kata-gatame except that it is performed from the mount. The opponent's arm is pinned against his or her neck, and the head and arm are held tightly. This may result in a potent arm triangle choke. In its variations kuzure-tate-shiho-gatame (崩縦四方固, [...] "modified horizontal four quarters hold"), the arm is not held against the neck, but rather, one of the arms may be held. The stability of these <b>pinning</b> <b>holds</b> or the mount in general, can be increased by entangling the opponents legs with the own legs, a technique known as grapevining.|$|R

50|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} is a conventional firearm trigger, but functions only {{to control the}} release mechanism for either the bolt (submachine gun) or firing <b>pin</b> <b>holding</b> mechanism (semi-auto) since the Uzi does not incorporate an internal cocking or hammer mechanism. While the open-bolt system is mechanically simpler than a closed-bolt design (e.g. Heckler & Koch MP5), it creates a noticeable delay between when the trigger is pulled and when the gun fires.|$|R
5000|$|Pincushions are {{typically}} filled tightly with stuffing, {{so as to}} <b>hold</b> <b>pins</b> rigidly in place. Magnetic pin cushions are also sometimes used; though technically they are not [...] "cushions", they serve the same basic function of <b>holding</b> <b>pins</b> neatly.|$|R
50|$|Lanechanger {{differed}} from the SpeedTrack or Powertrack sets as the cars {{did not have a}} <b>pin</b> <b>holding</b> them to the track. The track itself consisted of three rails which enabled the cars to slide from lane to lane at a press of a button located on the hand controller. Cars could easily co-exist on the same rails, this also allowed chicanes to be placed on the circuit as this would not cause the cars to crash.|$|R
50|$|The other variation, {{which usually}} {{results from a}} hurricanrana, sees the one {{performing}} the hurricanrana sit on the opponent's chest and hook the opponent's legs behind him whilst hooking the opponent's arms with his legs. This variation is the same hold just with the attacking wrestler on top. This interchangeability often sees a spot where the wrestlers change their weight distribution {{to move from one}} <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> to the other for a succession of near falls.|$|R

5000|$|The camera's {{film gate}} is also {{different}} from that of a regular motion picture camera, in that fixed <b>pins</b> <b>hold</b> each film frame in place while it is being exposed. This [...] "pin-registered" [...] gate means that the film can be wound backwards and forwards through the camera head many times, but will always return to exactly the same place without any shifts of the film frame. Such precise repeatability is required for multiple exposures, traveling mattes, title superimposition, and a range of other techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Chest {{compression}} is {{also featured}} in various grappling combat sports, {{where it is}} sometimes called wringing. Such techniques are used either to tire the opponent or as complementary or distractive moves in combination with <b>pinning</b> <b>holds,</b> or sometimes even as submission holds. Examples of chest compression include the knee-on-stomach position; or techniques such as leg scissors (also referred to as body scissors and in budō referred to as do-jime; 胴絞, [...] "trunk strangle" [...] or [...] "body triangle") where a participant wraps his or her legs around the opponent's midsection and squeezes them together.|$|R

5000|$|The kata gatame (肩固, [...] "shoulder hold") is a <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> {{where the}} {{opponent}} is hugged around the head, {{with one of}} the opponent's arms pinned against his or her neck. It can be done from kesa-gatame in response to an opponent's escape attempt, during which the arm is pinned against his or her neck, and the hold around the neck is put in place. The kata-gatame is often seen as a chokehold, since it is easy to compress the opponent's neck from the hold by squeezing, in which case it is known as an arm triangle choke or side choke.|$|R
25|$|Good {{single crystal}} {{diffraction}} experiments in diamond anvil cells require sample stage to rotate on the vertical axis, omega.

50|$|The Ho-Ru {{was a light}} tank {{destroyer}} {{similar to}} the German Hetzer, but armed with the weaker 47 mm main gun (Type 1 47 mm tank gun). The Type 5 Ho-Ru utilized the chassis of the Type 95 Ha-Go, but its suspension was enlarged to 350 mm track link width. There were two set rows of wheel guide <b>pins,</b> <b>holding</b> a road wheel between them. The sprocket of the driving wheel was the grating type to gear with the wheel guide pins like on the Soviet T-34. The development of the Type 5 Ho-Ru started in February 1945 with only a single prototype being completed {{before the end of}} the war.|$|R

5000|$|Kesa gatame (袈裟固, also {{referred}} to as hon-kesa-gatame, 本袈裟固) or [...] "scarf hold" [...] is a <b>pinning</b> <b>hold</b> that is performed from side control by turning slightly sideways, spreading the legs for stability, and encircling the opponent's head with one arm and holding the other arm close to the chest. Transitions and submission holds are comparatively difficult to perform effectively from this position, instead a variation of this hold is used called kuzure-kesa-gatame (崩袈裟固) or [...] "modified scarf hold". This hold is similar to the kesa-gatame, except that instead of encircling the head, the opponent's arm is encircled. Kodokan Judo also classifies the commonly used techniques ushiro-kesa-gatame and makura-kesa-gatame as kuzure-kesa-gatame.|$|R
5000|$|Kami shiho gatame (上四方固, [...] "upper four quarter hold down"), and its {{variations}} kuzure kami shiho gatame (崩上四方固, [...] "broken upper four quarter hold down"), are {{the most}} common <b>pinning</b> <b>holds</b> applied from the north-south position in combat sports using a gi. Kami shiho gatame involves pinning the opponent's arms to his or her side, typically by grabbing the opponent's belt and using the arms to press the arms of the opponent inwards. Kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame is similar, except that one or both arms of the opponent aren't pinned to the side, but can be controlled by for instance pinning them in between an upper arm and a knee.|$|R
