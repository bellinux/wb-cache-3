5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series. Ubisoft France's managing director Xavier Poix and his team felt the Wii Remote and Nunchuck would work well for music games; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 featured a music minigame that IGN compared to Guitar Hero—where players shook the Wii Remote or Nunchuck when prompted to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument.</b> For , the concept was iterated into a pose-based dance game. Proving popular in demonstrations, the concept was refined and re-developed into a stand-alone game.|$|E

Portsmouth Guildhall, another theatrical venue, {{is one of}} the largest events venue in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2500. For many years a series of symphony concerts has been presented at the Guildhall by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In the 1970s the Portsmouth Sinfonia approached classical music from a different angle: the Sinfonia often recruited players that had no musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> that was entirely new to them. The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at King George's Fields. The 2016 event was held in the last weekend of April, and featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports that <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> musical <b>instrument</b> may benefit cognitive development and health at young ages. Whether <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> provides protection against dementia {{has not been}} established. In a population-based cotwin control study, we examined the association between <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> musical <b>instrument</b> {{and whether or not}} the twins developed dementia or cognitive impairment. Participation in <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> was taken from informant-based reports of twins’ leisure activities. Dementia diagnoses were based on a complete clinical workup using standard diagnostic criteria. Among 157 twin pairs discordant for dementia and cognitive impairment, 27 pairs were discordant for <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument.</b> Controlling for sex, education, and physical activity, <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> musical <b>instrument</b> was significantly associated with less likelihood of dementia and cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 36 [95 % confidence interval 0. 13 – 0. 99]). These findings support further consideration of music as a modifiable protective factor against dementia and cognitive impairment...|$|R
40|$|Background:Music {{education}} {{affects the}} mathematical and visuo-spatial skills of school-age children. Visuo-spatial abil-ities {{have a significant}} effect on laparoscopic suturing per-formance. We hypothesize that prior music experience in-fluences the performance of laparoscopic suturing tasks. Methods: Thirty novices observed a laparoscopic sutur-ing task video. Each performed 3 timed suturing task trials. Demographics were recorded. A repeated measures linear mixed model was used to examine the effects of prior music experience on suturing task time. Results: Twelve women and 18 men completed the tasks. When adjusted for video game experience, participants who currently <b>played</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> performed signifi-cantly faster than those who did not (P 0. 001). The model showed a significant sex by instrument interaction. Men who had never <b>played</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> or were cur-rently <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> performed better than women in the same group (P 0. 002 and P 0. 001). There was no sex difference in the performance of participants who had <b>played</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> in the past (P 0. 29). Conclusion: This study attempted to investigate the ef-fect of music experience on the laparoscopic suturing abilities of surgical novices. The visuo-spatial abilities used in laparoscopic suturing may be enhanced in those involved in <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument...</b>|$|R

They soon branched out into listening to diverse genres from the last 40 years of music, including Motown and soul. Potter has treated their conception of Fantasy Black Channel as a reaction to [...] "mediocre, complacent indie-schmindie bands who find a sound and stick to it; whose songs sound exactly the same", while lead writer and composer Eastgate has pointed out that they wanted to [...] "take people past their own limits". The nascent recording stages took place in Eastgate's bedroom, where unconventional time signatures and experimental chords were performed because, at the time, no band member could <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> properly.|$|E

2500|$|Lynott {{then left}} the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf, where he briefly joined 'Kama Sutra'. It was in this band that he learned his {{frontman}} skills, and worked out how to interact with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist Brendan 'Brush' Shiels to form Skid Row. Shiels also wanted Brian Downey to play drums in the band, but Downey wasn't interested in the band's style, so the job went to Noel Bridgeman instead. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers including [...] "Eight Miles High", [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and several numbers by Jimi Hendrix. Because Lynott did not <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> {{at this point in}} his career, he instead manipulated his voice through an echo box during instrumental sections. He also took to smearing boot polish under his eyes on stage, which he would continue to do throughout Lizzy's career later on, and regularly performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd. In mid 1968, guitarist Bernard Cheevers quit to work full-time at the Guinness factory in Dublin, and was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Gary Moore.|$|E
2500|$|At four, Seeger {{was sent}} away to {{boarding}} school but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted scarlet fever. He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York, where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument.</b> On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut, from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun, the George E. Jonas Foundation's international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling {{with his father and}} stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo {{for the first time at}} the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles Seeger had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects. The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people [...] "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park." [...] For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a [...] "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo. The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [...] "Cindy" [...] and [...] "Old Joe Clark" [...] with his students Charlie and Jackson Pollock; friends from the [...] "hillbilly" [...] recording industry; as well as avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell.
