40|$|The LHCb Outer Tracker straw tubes {{have shown}} {{to suffer from}} gain loss after {{irradiation}} in the laboratory at moderate intensities. Under irradiation an insulating layer is formed on the anode wire. The ageing is caused by contamination of the counting gas due to outgassing of the <b>plastifier</b> diisopropyl-naphthalene in araldite AY 103 - 1 used at construction. This paper presents irradiation results with and without the <b>plastifier,</b> together with the mass spectra of the glue samples. In addition, the effects of wire heating and large currents are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The modules of the LHCb Outer Tracker {{have shown}} {{to suffer from}} gain loss under {{irradiation}} at moderate intensities, {{a process known as}} ageing. The <b>plastifier</b> in the glue with which the detector modules were constructed, Araldite AY 103 - 1, {{has been shown to be}} the culprit. In this thesis this is confirmed by irradiating a module constructed with Araldite AY 105 - 1, which does not contain the harmful <b>plastifier.</b> Several methods to prevent and repair the gain loss exist. One preventive measure is the addition of oxygen. However, because of its electronegative nature, oxygen can capture some of the drifting electrons, thereby lowering the gain of the OT. Simulations have been done to investigate the effect of oxygen on the gain and efficiency. One method to remove the ageing is HV training. In this procedure the applied voltage is increased such, that the OT enters the discharge regime. These discharges mostly remove the ageing, but can take place anywhere in the straw tube, not necessarily at the location of the ageing. Curing the module while putting a source near the location of the ageing is shown to always cure the gain loss. Finally, a method has been devised to quantify the amount of gain loss in the OT with the standard OT readout electronics. By performing a threshold scan it is possible to accurately determine the average gain loss of the straws...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{immobilization}} of lipase in matrices produced with gelatin with different Bloom values {{and with the}} addition of plastifiers was investigated to evaluate the influence of the Bloom value, as well as the capacity of the plastifiers to maintain the enzyme immobilized and the immobilization yield. The results indicated the need for crosslinking of the matrices with glutaraldehyde due to the high solubility in water, explained by the amino acid profile, which confirms the solubility of gelatin. Mannitol showed greater efficiency in the lipase immobilization, since it led to more porous structures and more uniform pores. These structures were also influenced by the gelatin concentration; greater concentrations associated with intermediate concentrations of <b>plastifier</b> led to matrices with a greater immobilization yield (87. 92 %). The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the structure of the immobilization matrices was partially crystalline...|$|E
40|$|Using {{vegetable}} oils {{has become an}} excellent option for petrochemical product substitution. The epoxides obtained from such oils have wide applications as <b>plastifiers</b> and PVC stabilisers and as raw material in polyol synthesis for the polyurethane industry. This paper presents soybean oil epoxidation using a homogeneous catalyst in a well-mixed, stirred reactor being operated in iso- thermal conditions. The best result achieved was a 6. 4 % oxyrane oxygen content using hydrogen peroxide (25 % molar excess), a- cetic acid (5 % p/p) and sulphuric acid (2 % p/p) concentrations at 80 °C...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{provided}} {{for a study}} of the effect of Termoplast series <b>plastifiers</b> on structure formation for specimens based on chamotte and fired bauxite under laboratory and industrial conditions. A favorable effect is demonstrated for test additions both on compaction during pressing, and also on object strength properties after firing. With introduction of Termoplast T 3 into commercial mixes in an amount of 0. 5 % total object porosity is reduced from 256 - 30 to 10 - 15 %, and ultimate strength in compression increases from 30 - 35 to 40 - 50 MPa. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
30|$|As {{the sample}} volume {{requirements}} are steadily decreasing within the clinical chemistry departments in hospitals around the world, blood sample handling from patients becomes {{a critical part}} in the healthcare logistics. We recently presented a 384 high density solution [17] that is currently being implemented as an efficient and cheap solution to Biobank archiving in clinical hospitals. The 384 -rack is confined with a hard polymeric frame where the tubes (384) are mounted. Manual or robotic picking and sorting {{can be made for}} all of the tubes within the 384 biobank sample plate (10). The plates and foils have been pre-tested for the used conditions {{to make sure that there}} is no release of, e.g., <b>plastifiers</b> to contaminate the samples.|$|R
40|$|While {{investigating}} the possible occurrence of neutral plasmalogens in human blood, we isolated a substance {{which had the}} same chromatographic characteristics on thin-layer chromatoplates as those of alkyl diglycerides. This substance was identified (1) as di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), {{and we were able}} to demonstrate (2) that this <b>plastifier</b> originated from the plastic transfusion packs which had contained the blood and that its concentration increased with the time of storage up to a level of about 11. 5 mg/ 100 ml of plasma after 21 days. These observations were confirmed by Jaeger and Rubin (3), who have also shown that DEPH accumulates in liver cells during the perfusion of rat liver. These authors also found that liver, spleen, lung, and abdominal fat in two patients who had received blood transfusions contained significant quantities of DEHP. In the present report, we describe a direct method of determination of DEHP by gasliquid chromatography. With this method, we have been able to demonstrate that the leaching out of DEHP from plastic transufsion packs was correlated with the plasma concentration of triglycerides. Also the DEHP levels in cryoprecipitates, which ar...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleation}} of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by codiols and olefinic segments was studied. The codiols 1, 5 -pentanediol, 1, 8 -octanediol, 2, 5 -hexanediol, and 1, 3 -dihydroxymethyl benzene were copolymerized into PET in {{a concentration}} range of 0 - 10 mol %. The melting (Tm), crystallization (Tc), and glass-transition (Tg) temperatures were studied. These codiols {{were found to}} be able to nucleate PET at low concentrations, probably by lowering the surface free energy of the chain fold. However, the codiols also disturbed the structural order of the polymer, resulting in a decrease in both the Tm and Tc values. The optimum codiol concentration was found to be at around 1 mol %, which is lower than previously reported. A diamide segment N,N-bis(p-carbo-methoxybenzoyl) ethanediamine (T 2 T) was found to be a more effective nucleator than the codiols; however, no synergy was observed between the nucleating effect of the diamide segment T 2 T and that of the codiol. An olefinic diol (C 36 -diol) with a molecular weight of 540 g/mol was also copolymerized into PET in a concentration range of 0 - 21 wt %. Only one Tg was observed in the resulting copolymers, suggesting that the amorphous phases of PET and the C 36 -diol are miscible. The main effect of incorporating the C 36 -diol into PET was the lowering of the Tg; thus, the C 36 -diol is an internal <b>plastifier</b> for PET. The C 36 -diol had little effect on the Tm value; however, the Tc value actually increased in the 11. 5 wt % copolymer. As the Tg decreased and the Tc increased, the crystallization window also increased and thereby the likelihood of crystallization. Therefore, the thermally stable C 36 -diol appears to be an interesting compound that may be useful in improving the crystallization of PET...|$|E
