5|$|Nighthawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. Each train has six cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 24 riders. Riders are restrained by an over the shoulder restraint and a lap bar. Riders can put on the over the shoulder restraint but a ride operator will <b>push</b> <b>down</b> the lap bar. While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence <b>push</b> <b>down</b> its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20â€“30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will <b>push</b> <b>down</b> out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E

25|$|Between 1997 and 2007, {{foreign investors}} made $50.3 billion profit, 68% of which went overseas. The Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa (CAFCA) says {{this has a}} {{negative}} impact on the economy arguing that when foreign investors buy up New Zealand companies, they tend to cut staff and <b>push</b> <b>down</b> wages. Foreign ownership has also done nothing to improve New Zealand's foreign debt. In 1984, private and public foreign debt was $16 billion ($50 billion in March 2013 dollars) which was less than half New Zealand's Gross Domestic Product at the time. By March 2013, total foreign debt stood at $251 billion, well over 100% of New Zealand's Gross Domestic Product.|$|E
25|$|Species {{vary greatly}} in visual and {{vibratory}} components of courtship. Many species have patches of UV reflectance, which are exhibited in mature males. This visual component {{is used by}} some female jumping spiders for mate choice. Body size dimorphism seems {{to play a role}} in male-male competition, where the larger bodied males will have a fitness advantage to hook the competitor and <b>push</b> <b>down</b> its legs into a vulnerable state, thus impairing the competitor's ability to fight back. Since larger spiders have a better chance of winning the fight, they also have a greater chance to successfully mate and will be favored by sexual selection.|$|E
25|$|Joy (Yellow Heart) - Peach {{becomes very}} happy as if walking on air, which {{allows her to}} slowly ascend in a small tornado, gust fogs and clouds, turn windmills, <b>push</b> <b>down</b> fountains, hit blocks above her and blow enemies away. With this power, she can float in the wind in some stages. She can also use it to break open flying bags that contain mostly coins and {{sometimes}} hearts and vibe crystals, splash bits of Blooper's ink thrown in the air, spin Kamek's head and slow down her falls as an easy use. However, some areas feature spores that stop her flying abilities, requiring more traditional platform methods to reach, but she can go up platforms that are vertically close.|$|E

25|$|Many insects can hover, or stay in {{one spot}} in the air, doing so by beating their wings rapidly. The ability to do so, though, is complex; {{requiring}} the use of sideways stabilization {{as well as the}} lift necessary to overcome the force of gravity. The lifting force is caused by the downward stroke of the wings. As the wings <b>push</b> <b>down</b> on the surrounding air, the result reaction force of the air on the wings force the insect up. The wings of most insects are evolved so that, during the upward stroke, the force on the wing is small. Due {{to the fact that the}} upbeat and downbeat force the insect down and up respectively, the insect oscillates and winds up staying in the same position.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} WBO Heavyweight Champion Sultan Ibragimov at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 23 February 2008 {{to unify}} the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov {{proved to be a}} huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov into a corner and proceeded to <b>push</b> <b>down</b> Ibragimov's glove with his left hand so he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round, the crowd in New York City began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give their man any meaningful advice. Klitschko did not fight again in the United States until 2015 where he defeated Bryant Jennings.|$|E
25|$|Hattusili's son, Tudhaliya IV, was {{the last}} strong Hittite king {{able to keep the}} Assyrians out of the Hittite heartland to some degree at least, though he too lost much {{territory}} to them, and was heavily defeated by Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria in the Battle of Nihriya. He even temporarily annexed the Greek island of Cyprus, before that too fell to Assyria. The very last king, Suppiluliuma II also managed to win some victories, including a naval battle against Alashiya off the coast of Cyprus. But the Assyrians, under Ashur-resh-ishi I had by this time annexed much Hittite territory in Asia Minor and Syria, driving out and defeating the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I in the process, who also had eyes on Hittite lands. The Sea Peoples had already begun their <b>push</b> <b>down</b> the Mediterranean coastline, starting from the Aegean, and continuing all the way to Canaan, founding the state of Philistiaâ€”taking Cilicia and Cyprus away from the Hittites en route and cutting off their coveted trade routes. This left the Hittite homelands vulnerable to attack from all directions, and Hattusa was burnt to the ground sometime around 1180 BC following a combined onslaught from new waves of invaders, the Kaskas, Phrygians and Bryges. The Hittite Kingdom thus vanished from historical records, much of the territory being seized by Assyria. The end of the kingdom was part of the larger Bronze Age Collapse.|$|E

500|$|The Queen rejoices in her victory, but is soon {{discovered}} by the angry Seven Dwarfs, who grab pickaxes and chase her deep into the forest as a great storm begins. She climbs up into the mountains, where she gets trapped upon a precipice that overlooks a seemingly bottomless canyon. She tries to <b>push</b> <b>down</b> a large boulder to crush the approaching Dwarfs. Before she can do so, a lightning bolt strikes {{between her and the}} boulder, destroying the precipice and sending the Queen (along with the boulder) down the cliff to her death, screaming while she falls to the jagged rocks below (this scream was reused in Sleeping Beauty when Maleficent is stabbed in the heart by the Sword of Truth). As the Dwarfs look wide-eyed over the cliff's edge, they cannot see her, but the vultures descend into the chasm. The Queen's dark reign is over, and her castle is then taken over and the revived Snow White and the Prince who broke the spell. (A 1936 pre-release Good Housekeeping novelization by Dorothy Ann Blank, a member of the film's story team, affirms that the Queen in fact dies: [...] "Far below, in a chasm as dark as her own wicked soul, lay the body of the hateful Queen. No magic would ever bring her to life again.") ...|$|E
