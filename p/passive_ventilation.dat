2500|$|Langer {{typically}} exploited passive {{lighting and}} ventilation in intelligent and uncomplicated ways {{and for the}} MRD building he included simple methods to achieve this. Parallel to the street, the long, narrow plan form (approximately 71m by 16m) was oriented with its long sides facing north-east and south-west. These elevations were highly glazed, comprising a grid of large, double-glazed, operable windows. A critical requirement for the drafting work of the department, this created interiors that were naturally well lit and well insulated, and allowed <b>passive</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The glazing was sheltered by a projecting [...] "egg-crate" [...] of concrete. The northern side had a deeper projection to block direct sun, reducing heat gain and glare. The west and east elevations were predominantly windowless to occlude the harsh, low sun and were built of concrete to provide a thermal mass quality. In contrast, the photographic and computational spaces that required highly controlled light and ventilation conditions were located in the basement levels, which had deep floor plans and limited fenestration.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{data show}} {{respiratory}} variables in 108 critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure placed on proportional assist ventilation with load adjustable gain factors (PAV+) after at least 36 h on <b>passive</b> mechanical <b>ventilation.</b> PAV+ was continued for 48 h until the patients met pre-defined criteria either for switching to controlled modes or for breathing without ventilator assistance. Data during <b>passive</b> mechanical <b>ventilation</b> and during PAV+ are reported. Data are acquired {{from the whole}} population, {{as well as from}} patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome. The reported variables are tidal volume, driving pressure (ΔP, the difference between static end-inspiratory plateau pressure and positive end-expiratory airway pressure), respiratory system compliance and resistance, and arterial blood gasses. The data are supplemental to our original research article, which described individual ΔP in these patients and examined how it related to ΔP when the same patients were ventilated with <b>passive</b> mechanical <b>ventilation</b> using the currently accepted lung-protective strategy “Driving pressure during assisted mechanical ventilation. Is it controlled by patient brain?” [1]...|$|R

30|$|During <b>passive</b> {{mechanical}} <b>ventilation,</b> {{the driving}} {{pressure of the}} respiratory system is an important mediator of ventilator-induced lung injury. Monitoring of driving pressure during assisted ventilation, similar to controlled ventilation, could be a tool to identify patients at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe driving pressure over time and to identify whether and when high driving pressure occurs in critically ill patients during assisted ventilation.|$|R

50|$|Langer's {{design for}} the Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College was in a modernist style and typical of his {{architectural}} concepts. Langer's exploration of modernism was heavily influenced by context. He studied the local fauna and flora in Queensland and the climate and his work interprets this in a Modernist manner. Dr Langer integrated native planting into his schemes; at St Peter's he proposed hedges of lemon scented tea trees for the plaza.

50|$|The tunnel {{was made}} {{as long as}} {{possible}} without having to add forced ventilation to dilute carbon monoxide from automobile exhaust, and a 24 by 24 ft shaft was built mid-way along the tunnel to provide <b>passive</b> <b>ventilation,</b> with the capacity to add a fan later for forced exhaust through the shaft, if necessary. The steel arch forms had previously been used during the construction of the Bartlett Dam in Arizona. Construction of the tunnel began in October 1938 and was complete by January 1940; the Funston Avenue approach was dedicated for service on April 21, 1940.|$|E

In particular, the standard designs represented at Bowen are Block C (C/T2), the residence (D/R3), and Block F (E/T3). Significant elements or features include; high-set timber framed and clad structures, verandahs, <b>passive</b> <b>ventilation</b> techniques (hinged wall flap, operable windows and fanlights, ceiling and wall vents), and passive day lighting consideration (large areas of windows, one room wide floor plans).|$|E
40|$|A new {{bioclimatic}} building, featuring {{an integrated}} solar chimney roof, provided the ideal prototype for {{design and construction}} o a 1 / 12 th scale model building and its micro-climate.

Experimental results also provided the necessary feedback to develop the numerical model, offering a worthwhile alternative to expensive, time consuming full-scale tests...|$|R
30|$|Alternative {{measures}} of assessing cardiac preload are available, although many have limitations, {{and there is}} no clinically available gold standard. In the contemporary ICU, it is exceedingly uncommon to place pulmonary artery catheters in septic patients to assess preload. Dynamic parameters such as pulse pressure variation, aortic velocity variation, or vena cava variation depend on <b>passive</b> mechanical <b>ventilation,</b> which is also uncommon in contemporary ICUs [62]. The response to a passive leg raise (or similar provocative maneuvers like the expiratory occlusion test) [63] may have been informative, but was unfortunately not performed {{at the time of the}} echocardiogram in study patients.|$|R
40|$|Closed accessMore recent UK {{climatic data}} {{for use in}} the design of {{naturally}} ventilated buildings show that <b>passive</b> stack <b>ventilation</b> alone is unlikely to maintain summertime comfort in a new University College London building within the London city heat island. A stack ventilation strategy developed by the design team was evolved by the introduction of passive downdraught cooling (PDC). PDC enables cooled air to be distributed throughout the building without fan assistance. The underlying principles of the technique were explored using computational and physical models. The architectural integration and seasonal control modes are described. Predicted performance of PDC is compared with actual measurements...|$|R
50|$|The {{greenhouse}} on {{the barge}} is approximately 1200 ft2, purchased new from Nexus, Inc and constructed {{in place on}} the barge. The structure is aluminum and secured to the barge deck via bolts and custom-made welded steel brackets. The walls of the greenhouse are glass and the roof is a rigid, doubled walled polycarbonate plastic. Ventilation is achieved via four mechanical fans, a padwall evaporative cooling system, and a large, automatically controlled atrium roof vent to maximize <b>passive</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Rainwater is harvested from the greenhouse roof and stored in tanks with a 1200-gallon aggregate capacity before being used to irrigate hydroponic crops in a broad and constantly evolving variety of different growing systems and media. The barge has also hosted a number of aquaponic and marine science experiments, including cultivation of tilapia, catfish, crayfish, clams, and oysters, among others.|$|E

50|$|As solutions, {{automatic}} loaders and unloaders may {{be useful}} for the poultry industry (although this topic is under debate due to high level of noise from those machines). Personnel training for humane catching by closing the wings, instead of grabbing birds by legs, is under review. It is thought that reduction of bruises, pain and fear (of humans or machinery) can {{have a positive effect}} on meat quality and welfare. Following transportation and unloading, animals should be given an extensive rest period before stunning (referred to as lairage) to allow animals to recover homeostasis, especially regarding lactic acid removal from tissues and glycogen reserves reestablishment. Stunning methods can play a large role in meat quality. Current research suggests that a two phase gas chamber may be best for minimizing stress. During summer time or in hot countries, the truck design should be taken into consideration, and <b>passive</b> <b>ventilation</b> and water shower before leaving the farm can have a positive effect and reduce the occurrence of PSE by up to 66.3%, which can be done by costless modifications.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a means of studying neuronal circuits that control respiratory muscles in humans with better spatial and temporal resolution than in previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Whole brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) changes determined by fMRI were used to identify areas of neuronal activation associated with volitional inspiration in five healthy men. Four series of scans of each subject were acquired during voluntary breathing (active task) and mechanical <b>ventilation</b> (<b>passive</b> task). <b>Ventilation</b> and end-tidal PCO 2 were similar between tasks. Scan data were re-aligned to correct for movement artefacts and cross-referenced breath by breath to respiratory data for selective averaging of inspiratory and expiratory images. Group analysis identified significant increases in the fMRI signal with volitional inspiration in the superior motor cortex, premotor cortex and supplementary motor area at loci similar to those detected in earlier studies that used PET. Additional regions activated by volitional inspiration included inferolateral sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal cortex and striatum (these foci were only revealed by PET under significant inspiratory load). This study represents the first synchronised breath-by-breath analysis of respiratory-related neuronal activity with whole brain imaging in humans. Temporal resolution is sufficient to distinguish individual breaths at a normal breathing frequency...|$|R
