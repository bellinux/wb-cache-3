40|$|Mergers, {{institutional}} reorganisation and {{the establishment}} of a network of multi-campus colleges in South Africa has served as a major policy trajectory to transform the <b>post-schooling</b> <b>education</b> and training sub-system under the current democratic dispensation. The changes have had a fundamental impact on the leadership capabilities of college principals and their management teams. This article draws upon findings of the training needs assessment study conducted in 2012 in the Further Education and Training colleges. From a systems thinking approach, the study tries to locate leadership development within the context of policies that undergird transformation. The study used the mixed method of inquiry and data were collected through questionnaires, focus group discussions and document analysis. A purposive sampling procedure was followed. The findings reveal an urgent need to equip managers with essential competences to lead effectively in a complex environment of constant change. The article concludes by suggesting integrating continuing professional development in the overall strategy of change and transformation, using learning communities as a mechanism to sustain effective leadership in the long-term.

Although, Latvia {{does not seem to have}} high scores on governmental support or cultural-social norms, a combination of basic and <b>post-school</b> <b>educations</b> seem to be cohesive with a high nascent entrepreneurship rate. This finding is consistent with the previous researches in this field, which suggest that the rate of schools that involve entrepreneurial orientation is high in Latvia. Bikse and Riemere (2013) have suggested that the courses’ content and methodological materials provide the potential to develop the entrepreneurial competences of students in Latvia. Varblane and Mets (2010) have also indicated that 71 percent of schools have entrepreneurship-oriented courses in Latvia. Baltrušaityte-Axelson et al. (2008) have reported that Latvian business environment has considerably improved after 2004, on which Latvia became a member of the European Union (EU). They have highlighted the impact of the EU requirements for economic and social improvements on the increase of entrepreneurship rate. However Dombrovsky et al.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in “Literature review” section, {{in this study}} we will investigate the performances of countries with respect to their nascent entrepreneurship rate, and three environmental incentives of entrepreneurship: governmental support, entrepreneurial education and cultural-social norms. In our analyses, we use the data obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor study. For the governmental support performances of countries, we use the data under the title “Governmental Support and Policies”, which measures to what extend the individuals have agreed with the statement that “in their country, public policies support entrepreneurship”. The entrepreneurial education incentive is measured by two variables, “Basic-School Entrepreneurial Education and Training” and “Post-School Entrepreneurial Education and Training”, which reflect the participants’ answers {{to the question of whether}} “training in creating or managing SMEs is incorporated within the education system at primary and secondary levels (higher levels for <b>Post-School</b> Entrepreneurial <b>Education</b> and Training)”. The analyses for socio-cultural norms are carried by using the data titled “Cultural and Social Norms” in the study. The data demonstrates the responses to the question whether “social and cultural norms encourage or allow actions leading to new business methods or activities that can potentially increase personal wealth”. Finally, we also measured the “Nascent Entrepreneurship Rate” as the percentage of 18 - 64 population who are currently involved in setting up a business they will own or co-own.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the selection of}} research methods for an evaluation of Curtin University’s courses in vocational education and training (VET) teacher education. The evaluation {{will be carried out}} by an outside research body. As the courses were newly upgraded and rewritten for distance and online delivery just over three years ago, the lecturing staff are still too close to the material to undertake a new evaluation. The selection of a research body from a technical and further education (TAFE) college, in this instance, will provide impartiality towards the material and a more valid assessment of market need. Methods will include a review of the literature, including State and Federal government policy directives, interviews with TAFE and industry management, and with Curtin lecturers and surveys of past and present students. It is a requirement at Curtin University, as at many other educational institutions, to review courses every five years. The review process is an accountability procedure to ensure that courses are regularly updated and their relevance evaluated against the needs of the students and changing practices in society and industry. Curtin University’s courses in <b>post-school</b> teacher <b>education,</b> designed for trainers in TAFE colleges, industry and government, were reviewed and extensively restructured three years ago.

40|$|Poor {{post-school}} {{outcomes for}} youth with disabilities have consistently been reported internationally. Interagency collaboration between school systems and post-school services is critical and key to improving post-school life for these youth. An initial Queensland study that benchmarked the teacher practice of 104 transition teachers and associated personnel indicated that interagency collaboration practices {{had the lowest}} levels of implementation. These results were the motivation behind a second study which investigated the hypothesis that lack of teacher control over interagency collaboration practice formed a roadblock for effective transitioning of youth with disabilities. Results generally confirmed the hypothesis and provide further understanding about the multi-faceted nature of interagency collaboration and the stakeholders involved in this process. Three interconnected actions are proposed to bypass identified roadblocks. If these actions are put in place, schools should improve their connections with post-school services, teachers should enhance their practice, and students should achieve improved <b>post-school</b> outcomes.

5000|$|As {{the nature}} and {{interests}} of <b>post-school</b> <b>education</b> and the student body began to change, so too did students’ unions. Increasing student activism and a desire for more democratic forms of student involvement in the late 1960s led to a {{moving away from the}} model of Student Representative Councils (SRCs) as a system of governance towards the creation of students’ unions and more participatory [...] "general meetings", accessible to all students. Students’ unions also took on a more campaigning role and inspired by the experience of American student organisations, Northern Irish student activists such as Michael Farrell, Eamonn McCann and Bernadette Devlin (now McAliskey) spearheaded campaigns for [...] "civil rights" [...] in Northern Ireland generating what some commentators believe is a negative cultural image of students' unions. This is held by sections of the Unionist Community in Northern Ireland who tended to blame the student movement at the time for starting the troubles/conflict in Northern Ireland.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the role that}} post-school/non-university education occupies, and highlights the decisions that have set recent policy changes in motion. Introduction Technical and further education (TAFE) {{is important for the}} development of an economy. Hector Sala and Jose Silva, in their 2011 research paper Labour Productivity and Vocational Training: Evidence from Europe, write that: the more dynamic is the technological pace of an economy, the more human capital is required relative to physical capital... Our central finding is that 1 extra hour of vocational training per employee... generates 0. 55 additional percentage points of productivity growth. In the particular case of Australia, Innes Willox (chief executive of the Australian Industry Group) has written that TAFE institutes “are {{more than the sum of}} their courses – they are an important part of our economic... infrastructure. ” The Centre for the Economics of Education and Training (CEET), based at Monash University, estimated that: In the 10 year period from 2006 to 2016 a total of four million people will need to acquire higher education or vocational education and training qualifications to meet expected skill needs arising from employment growth, retirements and skill deepening... primarily due to an overall rise in the level of skill and qualifications within occupations... Of the four million... 2. 474 million will be vocational education and training qualifications... That is, on average, each year there will be a need for... 247, 000 vocational education and training completions... The introduction of the new Smart and Skilled policy has elicited a considerable degree of commentary about the nature of training delivery in the years to come, and about the changes to the fee structure that the new approach will introduce. At the heart of the debate over the new policy is the evolving change in delivery mode for technical and further education. In the second half of the twentieth century, <b>post-school</b> non-university <b>education</b> was delivered by the public sector. By the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, delivery has increasingly become the province of commercial providers.
