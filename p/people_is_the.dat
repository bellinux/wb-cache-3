5|$|Life Is <b>People</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth studio album by English singer, {{pianist and}} {{songwriter}} Bill Fay, released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. Fay had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following {{the release of}} his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. In order to support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Standard Swedish, used by most Swedish <b>people,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} language that {{evolved from the}} Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized. Some dialects differ considerably from the standard language in grammar and vocabulary and are not always mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish. These dialects are confined to rural areas and are spoken primarily by small numbers of people with low social mobility. Though not facing imminent extinction, such dialects have been in decline during the past century, despite the fact that they are well researched and their use is often encouraged by local authorities.|$|E
25|$|The Amores is a {{collection}} in three books of love poetry in elegiac meter, following the conventions of the elegiac genre developed by Tibullus and Propertius. Elegy originates with Propertius and Tibullus; however, Ovid is an innovator in the genre. Ovid changes the leader of his elegies from the poet, to Amor (love). This switch in focus from the triumphs of the poet, to the triumphs of love over <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first of its kind}} for this genre of poetry. This Ovidian innovation can be summarized as the use of love as a metaphor for poetry. The books describe the many aspects of love and focus on the poet's relationship with a mistress called Corinna. Within the various poems, several describe events in the relationship, thus presenting the reader with some vignettes and a loose narrative.|$|E
