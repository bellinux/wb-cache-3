Experience of FY 2007 was unique in the history of Bangladesh {{in the sense that it}} saw three consecutive governments and declaration of a state of emergency. The new caretaker governments (CTGs) first six months coincided with the second half of FY 2007. Despite the challenging scenario, political turmoil and disruption in the economy in the early months of FY 2007 (particularly in November- December, 2006) and the uncertainties afflicting the economy during the period following the takeover by the current CTG in January 2007, FY 2007 saw a number of positive developments. These included moderately high growth of manufacturing industries (10. 01 per cent), robust performance of the export sector (15. 69 per cent growth), revitalized capital market (121 per cent growth in DSE market-capitalisation) and high growth of remittance flow (24. 5 per cent). However, some disturbing signs were already discernible as FY 2007 was drawing to a close : a deteriorating trade balance, weak implementation of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programmes,</b> stagnating food grains production and a fall in agricultural credit disbursement. Creeping inflation throughout the year, particularly, rising prices of cereals and fuel originating from increasing world prices of cereals and oil, was already emerging as causes for concern.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} resurgence of interest in the effects of public capital on the economic fortunes of the private sector of late. This renewed concern was sparked by the research of Aschauer on US infrastructure and the ensuing debate between himself, Munnell and Holtz-Eakin. This debate and much of the subsequent work in the US and elsewhere has been conducted utilising production functions. There is, however, another potentially more rewarding strand in the infrastructure literature that is based on duality theory and cost function analysis. This approach has been thought of as overcoming some of the methodological problems inherent in the use of production functions in this research context. This paper, using cost functions, attempts to estimate the impact of the productive categories of the <b>Public</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Programme</b> of Greece on regional development, and especially on large scale manufacturing activities. The results demonstrate that public capital has a significant positive impact on the performance of the private sector, and reduces private costs of production.

One of its main objectives is {{to open up the}} dialogue on the policy content of Poverty Reduction Strategies and promote greater policy choice for national policymakers. With regard to fiscal policies, it argues for an increased emphasis on raising domestic revenue—along with a renewed stress on achieving vertical equity—and financing extensive <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programmes,</b> which, contrary to obstructing private investment, are essential to raise its productivity. The paper also counters the view that a large influx of Official Development Assistance will necessarily appreciate a country’s exchange rate and make its exports less competitive. If countries lack the ‘absorptive capacity ’ to effectively disburse development assistance, the paper claims that resources should be directed, early on, towards developing such public sector capacity. Also, the paper contends that monetary policies should accommodate expansionary, investment-focused fiscal policies and thus be targeted to real variables, such as economic growth, not just inflation. With regard to financial policies, the paper maintains that because of the failures of unfettered liberalization to stimulate growth or reduce poverty, the public sector should provide support to specialized institutions, such as rural banks and development banks, which can promote long-term investment and provide equitable access to financial services. In addition, the paper contends that although privatization has been given unqualified donor support, it has a mixed record, and is particularly unsuccessful in providing equitable and affordable access to essential public services. The paper concludes that if ‘Second-Generation ’ Poverty Reduction Strategies are based on MDGs, they should have economic policies that are less fixated on macroeconomic stabilization and more geared to accelerating growth with equity and promoting long-term human development...|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{policy in}} the Euro area is still {{dominated}} by austerity measures implemented under the institutional setting of the 'reformed' stability and growth pact, and the even stricter 'fiscal compact'. At the same time, calls for a more expansionary fiscal policy to overcome the economic crisis have recently become more frequent. In his Jackson Hole speech Mario Draghi, {{the president of the}} ECB, called for a more expansionary fiscal stance for the Euro area as a whole and a <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programme</b> on the European level insisting, however, that the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact be respected.

Recently, the EU-Commission in this spirit has launched the Juncker-Plan to stimulate (<b>public)</b> <b>investment</b> and is using a less strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to provide more fiscal leeway for countries under unfavourable economic circumstances.

This paper is about some draft thoughts concerning the implementation of urban planning projects (about the rejuvination of existing urban areas of great density), combined with recent discussions on factors that give shape to Greece's urban environment (for example withdrawal of semi-open spaces, basements added at total sq. m measurements, backyards etc.) to be regulated. The urban regeneration and the upgrade of the cities' environmental standards remain a main objective.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{economic development and}} public infrastructure capital has puzzled economists, economic geographers, planners, and other social scientists, for many years. This thesis presents an attempt to theorise and conduct empirical research on this field {{in the context of}} a developing economy within the European Union - Greece. Key to understanding the work undertaken in this thesis is the wider theoretical and applied research, which has flourished in the US and other countries during the last decade. The thesis examines the effects of <b>public</b> capital <b>investment</b> on Greek economic development viewed at different spatial scales. More specifically, it explores the role of infrastructure spending at national, regional, and urban (metropolitan area of Athens) levels. The empirical presentation begins with a description of the <b>Public</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Programme</b> from 1976 onwards. This is the main channel for <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> in infrastructure capital in Greece. Its various public capital sub-categories have been aggregated into two basic types, 'productive' and 'social' infrastructure. The next step was to utilise a production function analytical framework and panel data analysis to explore the direct and network effects of infrastructure investment on manufacturing industry. Positive effects of infrastructure spending are apparent. An alternative approach, cost function analysis, is deployed in the second major empirical section. Using various spatial levels, the role of public capital on the private costs of production can be examined by the calibration of a cost function for industrial sectors. The results show that infrastructure investment reduces private costs in manufacturing at most spatial levels. Finally, the thesis investigates other direct and indirect channels by which public capital can affect the non-manufacturing and manufacturing sectors of the private economy. The empirical findings show that there is no significant infrastructure impact on the former sector, whereas there are mixed results for the indirect channels on manufacturing. It can be safely argued that the public capital and regional development relationship is a complex one, especially as infrastructure effects can be different at different spatial levels...|$|R

It uses time-series data on different types of development aid (project aid, programme aid, technical assistance and food aid) for Uganda, an important aid recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of aid which combines aid heterogeneity and endogenous aid. The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues since different aid categories have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed.

Out of a potential lecturer complement of 200 at the 10 Regional Centres and National Centre, a stratified sample of 100 lecturers was selected.

The study established that ODL institutions face a number challenges in an attempt to meet the quality standards set by ZIMCHE, the higher and tertiary regulatory body. The challenges include the lack of support in terms of financial, material and physical infrastructure from central government, extra functional and operational activities undertaken by ODL lecturers which affect the quality of service offered, inadequate ICT gadgets for information dissemination as a handicap and staff and student competence in the use of ICTs, among other findings.

40|$|The Bali Action Plan (UNFCCC, 2007 a) {{acknowledges}} the central roles {{of finance and}} technology in the successful implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘the Convention’). They form {{two of the four}} building blocks for a post- 2012 international climate change agreement. For developing countries, the conclusion of negotiations for an acceptable and successful agreement hinges upon the provision of financial and technology sup-port from developed countries, commensurate with the identified needs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and reflecting the full agreed incremental costs of meeting the objectives of the Convention. This dissertation presents research undertaken in support of these negotiations and the design of new financing and technology development and transfer policies to underpin the mitigation and adaptation efforts of the post- 2012 agreement, as mandated by decision 3 /CP. 13 of the Conference of the Parties. The research contained within this dissertation draws and builds upon the re-ports of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (UNFCCC, 2008 a; 2009 a;b) which were pre-pared in response to the mandate of the Conference of the Parties. Financing for technology will need to be scaled up by an order of magnitude, across all technologies and in all nations (UNFCCC, 2009 b). In the order of USD 1 trillion in <b>investment,</b> both <b>public</b> and private, needs to be mobilized each year (IEA, 2008 a). Using estimates of the incremental costs for developing countries, the cost for Annex II Parties is estimated at an additional USD 262 – 670 billion per year for mitigation technologies and USD 33 – 163 billion per year to adapt to climate change (see UNFCCC, 2009 a, pp 31 – 33). A wide range of financing options and technology development and transfer policies are avail-able, some with greater potential than others to mobilise the necessary financial resources. Effectiveness varies across policy instruments. Combining policy options so as to exploit synergies, and matching of policy responses to local and national circumstances can be significant determinants of a successful regime. This dissertation attempts to assess and compare the possible public and private financing needs, based on the policy concept of ‘leveraging the private sector’, which is commonly touted within the negotiations by many national governments as an essential policy objective for finance and technology. Available options are described and proposals are analysed according to their effectiveness. Scenarios of public and private financing for technology development and transfer are developed based on the average leveraging ratios achieved by a wide range of policies and programmes at the national, regional and international level. Policies under consideration both at the international and national levels are included where estimates of their leveraging potential can be made. The assessment is made for each stage of the technology innovation cycle (research and development, demonstration, deployment, diffusion) and estimates are made of the amounts of public financing required. The results of this dissertation point to the significant role that public finance will play in achieving the objectives of the Convention. Scenarios that involve {{a significant increase in the}} leveraging effect of <b>public</b> policies and <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> on the private sector will still require substantial <b>public</b> <b>investment,</b> in the order of USD 30 – 160 billion per annum. It is estimated that, under this scenario, the private sector share of total investment would be increased from the current levels of approximately 60 per cent to 75 – 80 per cent. The results also suggest that the financial mechanism of the Convention needs to take a more prominent role in coordinating the overall delivery of financing and to help optimize the potential for private sector financing. Integrated design of <b>public</b> policies and <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> will be important and a wide range of innovative financing instruments and types of finance will need to be deployed in a targeted way to address qualitative and quantitative gaps in the existing financial arrangements...|$|R

The results suggest that the short-run and long-run contribution to economic growth of private investment in Zimbabwe can be improved by cutting back on non-infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to necessary minimum level while stimulating the growth in infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment.</b> Colleges of Economic and Management Science...|$|R
40|$|<b>Public</b> {{and private}} <b>investment</b> and {{economic}} growth in Zambia: A dynamic approachThis paper investigates the dynamic contributions of <b>public</b> and private <b>investment</b> to economic growth in Zambia {{during the period from}} 1970 to 2014. In the analysis, the paper also estimated the important indirect contribution of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to economic growth through its crowding effect on private investment. The study employs the newly proposed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) -bounds testing approach in estimating the economic growth and private investment models. The empirical evidence from the study shows that private investment contributes more to economic growth than <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> in Zambia in the short run and the long run. In addition, gross <b>public</b> <b>investment,</b> infrastructural and non-infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> were found to crowd out private investment in the short run; while non-infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> also had a crowding out effect on private investment in the long run. The results imply that the long-run contributions of both private and <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to economic growth in Zambia can be improved by raising the infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to a threshold level that stimulates private investment growth while reducing non-infrastructural <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to the basic minimum level.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> policy (mainly {{from the}} 1980 s onwards) with a political-economic approach. The points {{of this paper}} are as follows. First, at the macro level, it is {{possible}} that the short-term fluctuation of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> has been controlled by the government party’s political incentive to win an election rather than in order to dampen economic fluctuations. Second, as for regional allocation, up to 1993 when the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) stepped down from government, the LDP had had a great influence on <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> allocation; however, following such a government alternation the influence of local special interest groups may have become stronger. Focusing on the local side, empirical analysis of the <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> function considering political-economic factors clarifies that local <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> policy has been deeply affected by the construction industry as a local interest group (which is heavily dependent on <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> in general), and that levels of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> have not been determined in the way the median voter theorem implies. <b>investment</b> policy, <b>public</b> <b>investment,</b> Japan, voter theorem, Liberal Democratic Party of Japan...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} an increase in <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> on output in Europe against the background of a sharp drop of <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> in a number of EU countries during the crisis and subsequent policy discussions on the need to stimulate <b>public</b> <b>investments.</b> We start with a brief overview of recent developments in <b>public</b> <b>investments,</b> including some methodological issues, and provide a literature overview of the effect of <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> on growth. On the basis of updated estimates of the public capital stock, we estimate the output response to a public capital impulse, using VAR models. In addition, using a structural model, we investigate the sensitivity of the macroeconomic impact {{of an increase in}} <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> to alternative assumptions about economic structures and policy implementations...|$|R
