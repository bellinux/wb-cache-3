Image pre-processing procedures, which are crucial to improving {{the accuracy of the}} location, were carried out to remove noise and smooth the edges of apples. The moment of inertia method has the disadvantage of high computational complexity, which should be solved, so convex hull was used to improve this problem. To verify the validity of this algorithm, a test was conducted using four types of apple images containing 107 apple targets. These images were single and unblocked apple images, single and blocked apple images, images containing adjacent apples, and apples in panoramas. The root mean square error values of these four types of apple images were 6. 3, 15. 0, 21. 6 and 18. 4, respec-tively, and the average location errors were 4. 9 °, 10. 2 °, 16. 3 ° and 13. 8 °, respectively. Furthermore, the improved algorithm was effective in terms of average runtime, with 3. 7 ms and 9. 2 ms for single and unblocked and single and blocked apple images, re-spectively. For the other two types of apple images, the runtime was determined by the number of apples and blocked apples contained in the images. The results showed that the improved algorithm could extract symmetry axes and locate the <b>picking</b> <b>points</b> of apples more efficiently. In conclusion, the improved algorithm is feasible for extracting symmetry axes and locating the <b>picking</b> <b>points</b> of apples.

From some paradoxes that stand out the waste valorisation, their very definition, and {{the change in the}} production paradigm that involves the reuse, as well as the criticalities emerged from some experiences of international and national case studies; this contribution identifies the ICTs that use the GPS as a fundamental tool for the optimization of the reuse practice, especially in a grass root and gaming dimension.

The ASRS developed consists of control hardware and software communicating over a Fieldbus network. A simulation model of the WIT ASRS (capable of modelling any similar hi-bay storage system) and an order generator were also developed and these are linked to a database and a results spreadsheet. This ASRS allows for a range of control strategies and order types to be investigated utilising the order generator and the database. There was also a facility developed which allows this mathematical model to run the actual requirements that the ASRS physical model works with, this allows for complete correlation between both models. The development of a mathematical model plus a physical model ensures better understanding of ASRS making the sequence of operations obvious and helping to clarify the broad range of strategies to interested parties. The best recorded performance was with current dwell point, simultaneous travel, dual control, free-nearest storage and nearest retrieval strategies selected in combination. In general, dual control improved performance (in terms of throughput), simultaneous travel was found to be better than rectilinear travel, dwell point at origin gave very poor results, and a dwell point at current, <b>pick</b> <b>point</b> or deposit point appears best.

40|$|Seafloor Massive Sulfide (SMS) {{contains}} {{high levels}} of metals such as copper and gold. Water depths of 2000 up to 3000 meter make mining of SMS a challenge. Despite this, mining industry encourages research into feasible extraction methods of SMS, pushed by the high metal prices nowadays. This research focuses {{on the influence of}} hydrostatic pressure on the cutting process of hard rock. A 2 D numerical model of the cutting process is created using discrete element modelling (DEM). The software package Particle Flow Code 2 D (PFC 2 D) from Itasca Consulting Group is used. The rock material creation in PFC 2 D consists of reproducing numerically the physical UCS, biaxial and Brazilian tests executed on the benchmark material. SMS is the rock of interest for deep-sea mining, nevertheless Langmeil Sandstone is chosen as benchmark material. This consideration is taken because SMS samples are rare and no strength test results obtained on SMS samples are published. In addition the high heterogeneity of SMS makes their numerical modelling difficult. It was not possible {{to come up with a}} singular numerical rock sample matching the mechanical properties of the Sandstone for a large range of confining pressures (0 to 40 MPa). Therefore two samples were created: the first sample is valid for unconfined tests, the second sample is valid for confining pressures between 20 and 40 MPa. It appeared that the material unconfined compressive strength and elastic constants are independent of the particle size. The transition point from brittle to ductile failure is simulated successfully for the second rock sample. Three different cutting scenarios are studied: cutting of dry rock without hydrostatic pressure, cutting of dry rock under hydrostatic pressure and cutting of saturated rock. The boundary particle method is an algorithm capable of simulating hydrostatic pressure. This method applies a force similar to the hydrostatic load on each boundary particle of the sample. The method simulates the transition between brittle and ductile rock cutting successfully, by increasing the effective stress, while fluid and pore pressures are absent. The transition from brittle to ductile cutting is reached at a hydrostatic load of 20 MPa for the Langmeil sandstone. The cutting force (450 kN) obtained by the numerical model for the unconfined calibrated rock is compared with existing semi-empirical models. Goktan’s (1995) model (300 kN) provides the best match, Evans’ (1961) model (75 kN) underestimates the required cutting force. The horizontal cutting force increases with increasing hydrostatic pressure. The increase of hydrostatic load is mainly transferred into an extra load on the cutting tool in horizontal direction. The specific energy calculated from the cutting force obtained by the numerical model (4. 9 MJ/m 3) is in good accordance to the values for sandstone found in literature (5. 5 MJ/m 3). The influence of the tool shape, the cutting velocity and depth of cut on the cutting process of dry rock is modelled. The chisel pick tool shows to be more efficient than the <b>pick</b> <b>point</b> tool for shallow water depths. The difference in efficiency between these tools becomes smaller with increasing hydrostatic pressures. Measurement circles in PFC 2 D are able to register porosity changes during the cutting process. These measurements are used to estimate pressure differences in the crushed zone. This method provides a good qualitative insight in the development of pore pressures during the cutting process. Useful quantitative values were not obtained. The measurement circle method indicates that cavitation will not occur for high hydrostatic loads such as 20 or 30 MPa, which implies that the required cutting force will continuously increase for an increasing cutting velocity. The main recommendations are introducing the Biot poroelastic equations and heterogeneity into a 3 D discrete element model. Quantitative estimations for the specific energy and pore pressures during the cutting processes should be obtained. Execution of laboratory tests of rock cutting under varying hydrostatic pressures is of most importance to check the performance of the numerical rock cutting models.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{worldwide}} population and welfare growth, the demand for energy (oil, gas and renewable sources) and raw materials increases. In the last decades, oil and gas are produced from more and more offshore sites and deeper waters. Besides energy, the demand for diverse metals and rare earth elements increases as well. These raw materials are often at the basis of new sustainable technologies e. g. permanent magnets for wind energy and battery packs for electric cars. The availability of these raw materials is essential for a stable development of the world economy. Unfortunately, for some of the crucial raw materials, the availability is sometimes very local and in various cases there is a monopoly forming. To reduce this economic risk, investments are needed to search and extract minerals from new locations. Large, metal-rich fields are found {{at the bottom of the}} sea, such as phosphate nodules, manganese nodules, cobalt-rich crusts and vulcanic sulphide deposits (often referred to as Seafloor Massive Sulphide, SMS). These deposits are mainly located in the deep sea, at depths ranging from several hundreds of meters to several kilometers. One of the technical challenges to enable production from these locations is the cutting or excavation process. Experiments have shown that the energy needed to excavate the material increases with water depth. Besides that, it is demonstrated that rock that fails brittle in atmospheric conditions can fail more or less in a plastic fashion when present in a high pressure environment, as would be the case at large water depths. The goal of this research is to identify the physics of the cutting process and to develop this into a model in which the effect of hydrostatic and pore pressures is included. The cutting of rock is initiated by pressing a tool into the rock. As a result, at the tip of the tool a high compressive pressure occurs, which leads to the formation of a crushed zone. Depending on the shape of the tool and the cutting depth, shear failures might emanate from the crushed zone, which will eventually expand as tensile fractures that can reach to the free rock surface. Through this process intact rock will be disintegrated to a granular medium. Additionally, the presence of water in the pores of and surrounding the rock influences the cutting process through drainage effects. The most relevant effects are weakening when compaction and hardening when dilation occurs in shearing and tension. Deformation of the rock causes the pore volume to change, resulting in a under or over pressure. As a result, the pore fluid needs to flow. The magnitude of the potential under pressure is limited through cavitation of the pore fluid, limiting further reduction of the pore pressure. The drainage effects cause the rock cutting process in a submerged environment to show a stronger dependency of both the hydrostatic pressure as well as the deformation rate. The numerical simulations are performed with a 2 D DEM (Discrete Element Method). In DEM, the mechanical behavior of a rock is mimicked by gluing loose particles together with brittle bonds. Such a method shows strong resemblance with sedimentary rock. In order to include the effect of an ambient pressure as {{a result of}} the water depth and to include the presence of a fluid in the pores of the rock, a pore pressure diffusion equation is added to the model. The discontinuous results obtained with DEM are interpolated to a continuum field through the use of a SP-method (Smoothed Particles). Additionally, SP is used to solve the pore pressure diffusion equation. For that reason, the methodology used in this dissertation is referred to as DEM-SP. Thus far no direct coupling has been found between the input microscopic parameters, that define the properties of and interactions between the particles in DEM, and the resulting bulk properties of the particle assembly. For that reason, a sensitivity analysis is performed in which the effect of the micro-properties on the macroscopic behavior is investigated. Additionally it is proven that the addition of the pore pressure diffusion process to the DEM-SP model corresponds with the effective stress theory. It is also proven that when air is used as a medium in the pores, no significant changes compared to simulations without pore pressure coupling occur. Comparison of the numerical model with a set of tri-axial experiments on shale, in which the deformation rate is varied, shows that the model is well capable to describe both compaction weakening and dilatant hardening. In order to further validate DEM-SP, several experiments from literature are simulated. A comparison of 2 D cutting experiments on tiles shows a good match for the chip size, chip shape and the required cutting force. DEM-SP is used to simulated drilling experiments on marble, in which the hydrostatic pressure is varied. These results show that the simulated behavior of the cutting process matches qualitatively with the experiments, i. e. the trend of increasing cutting force with increasing hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore a series of cutting experiments for the purpose of deep sea mining has been simulated. These results match both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, both the experiments and simulations show the existence of a hyperbaric effect. This means that at a hydrostatic pressure which is significantly larger than the tensile strength of the rock the cutting process shear and cataclastic failure are more dominant, while at hydrostatic pressures significantly smaller than the tensile strength the cutting process is dominated by tensile failure and chipforming. Finally, DEM-SP is used to simulate the full cutting motion of a <b>pick</b> <b>point</b> on a rotating cutterhead, in order to investigate the applicability of the method to shallow water depths (< 30 m) and to investigate the use of the method for the dredging practice. Even at shallow water depths the effect of an increased hydrostatic pressure shows significant differences. Furthermore, the simulations show a transition from cataclastic towards ductile cutting process based on the cutting depth. Additionally a transition between stick-slip friction of the cut material along the tool is observed, which is an indication for different wear processes. It is proven that DEM-SP is capable of solving drainage related effects in deformation of saturated rock. A range of rock cutting experiments are simulated and the results match well both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to cutting force and hydrostatic pressure. Further improvement of the model can be achieved by extending the model towards 3 D. Offshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|E

At {{the present}} day, time {{statement}} {{which has a}} meaning in every discipline is getting far from it’s known and received certain meanings when it is disputed the relationship in between the city and city-dweller. The time statement which is defined by human with his individual experiences; holds a danger that {{can not have a}} definition that leaves a meaningfull trace by standing in a deadspace as a result of city-dweller’s precipitation of trying to go parallel with fast city flows and dynamics. Before mentioning general approaches of the thesis chapters, it is need to underline some time statements which is important in general view of thesis configuration. Guy Debord tries to define his own time statement over the simulated time loop of metropol city. According to him, this simulated time loop has its own rhythm and it is regulated by some survivol challenges. These challenges make human to re-define his own time and adapt it to time of city. Industrial revolutions and technological un-controlled developments changes the rhythm of the specific time regulation day by day. Because of these fast and undefinable changes, some problems occures in-between city deweller’s adaptation in the city routine life. Natural time loop has a specific regulation and it is available to be re-arranged by human’s natural time perception. According to Debord, simulated time loop of metropol city tries to use remains of natural time loop for producing temporal simulated creations. The simulated time loop which is created by industrial revolutions, advanced by dailiy routine work life, day - night, weekend – weekdays, holidays, semesters, etc. These linked faces of time definitions organizes the city time. At that point, we should focus on the lack of human adaptation to dailiy city routine. He starts to miss city flows and not to experiencing city life. The routin flows of the city life, adaptes the perception of no-time, to it’s routin configuration. In this case human, who tries to settle himself within the limits of city time statements, falls apart from real and definable experience moments by reason of losing his own individual time statements and then becomes stranger to himself. In first chapters of thesis, the general construction is mentioned by defining the problem. Especially by highlighting Debord’s simulated time loop definition, the problem of thesis is stabilized intensively. In this chapter, purpose of the thesis and main construction of general approaches are explained. This part is trying to draw outline of the thesis to make clear of some subjective comments which are really widespread in general view of thesis. The methodology of the thesis, which is explained by fragmantal approaches, is defined more detailed in second chapters. In these chapters, history of fragment and fragmentation are stabilized the reason why methodolgy of the thesis is developed by standing in these coordinates. Fragments provide several conditions and active standing points which have potential to make effective joints among the relevant subjects. They makes people to change their position and generate another view of judgement. Fragments overrate pieces apart from whole. That is why, details, remains and parts of the wholes are obtain more value and potential to recognize meaninful sides of the apparent. Fragments and approaches which are generated related with fragmentation are important in the general view of thesis. Because time statements and temporal creations are changing their positions day by day in the city. That is why defining and understanding of these statements and creations are getting confusing. Parts of the whole are being missed by human and they starting to loose their own individual time loop. Piece – whole, individual time statement - city time which human tries to adapt are being related each other under the fragments and creations of fragmentation. Time statements which belongs to human and city life are associated by mentioning the known and received time statements so far. In the forth chapters, it is aimed to make people change their positions and partake in different view points out of several productions in different disciplines. In that part that is aimed to evaluating a fragmantal viewpoint, some comments,which are about how they constructed their individual time statements, are improved. In that part also people think about the possibilities of producing new time statements while noticing the importance of time construction in producing process in every discipline especially architecture. Cinema, fashion, experimental projects, art works, materiality, urban focal points, architecture are prefered to examine and generate observations to make clear staple position of the thesis. Every example projects which belongs to prefered disciplines have their individual time approaches in different ways. Because of that reason, these example projects have potential to make human dispute his condition. For example, Shindler’s List has it’s own time expression. We can recognize the historical time statements easily during the film until red colored specific scenes which have potential to summarize whole main subject of the film, are come into view after blach-white scenes. And we can say that defined time expressions of the film have different meanings after that transitions. Another exapmle is art work of Gordon Matta Clark. He interested in ruins and buildings which are near to being demolished. General approaches of his works are making visible the potential of the space just before being lost. That is why he defines a new time expression for a ruin or building. Traces and injured pieces of the whole could have different meaning apart from the what whole says. And we can say that according to Gordon Matta Clark’s approaches, a building or a whole regain another meaning which is available being commented after getting injured or being demolished. Eiffel tower is another important example in the thesis main structure. It could be defined a monument in Paris. But it has a potential which creates an active social platform in the city. This platform could regenerate the city life. After these explanations, we could say that the time which is organized by a monument can transformed the city time loop. City flows and perceptional routes in the city are organized by being in relation with Eiffel. That means, city time loop has a <b>pick</b> <b>point</b> which leads the general time routine of the city.  The other preferred example projects are also available to being commented according to the main structure of thesis. All of them highlight that known and seen sides of the whole could be transformed in to different faces if the pieces get apperent individually. Time statments are defined like these wholes and pieces that belong to specific time expressions are got apperant by fragmentational approaches. At the conclusion of thesis, several emphasises are put on about losing individual time statements while making comments about productions in different disciplines with in the related notions. These example productions and matrix of related notions are commented by diagramatic expressions and then some expansions,which are linked with ‘no-time’ or ‘timeless’, are created. Main purpose of the thesis is make people to recognize their lost experiences of individual time statements and make them to define their own time statements,which do not have a lost translations. Maybe then it could be possible to generate new time definitions which can adapt to any time expression, flow or dynamics. These new time definitions also could embrace individual approaches while existing in city life with a meaningful adaptation. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

At the moment, JogloSemar only pick up in one route, but they are {{planning}} to find the route dynamically. In this research, {{we will try to}} simulate it using 8 <b>pick</b> up <b>points,</b> that is Hotel Novotel, Hotel Graha Santika, Hotel Queen, Hotel Telomoyo, Hotel Ciputra, Hotel Siranda, Hotel Patra Jasa, Hotel Candi and the last point is Gombel street. The scopes of this research, pick up passengers will be done in 8 <b>pick</b> up <b>points</b> in semarang, but if one of the <b>pick</b> up <b>point</b> does’t have any passenger, that point would be passed routes will be looked for the shortest path visiting each <b>pick</b> up <b>points</b> that passenger to pick up. Based on the problem, Branch and Bound algorithm and tree data structure are used. Branch and Bound is method for searching systematic solution, in this case the solution would be organize to tree. Tree from at Branch and Bound algorithm build with scheme searching widely (BFS). Branch searching by see depend on smallest value or shortest path and then will explore to another branch from the point. This strategy called least cost searching. In conclusion, using Branch and Bound could give us the shortest path using all <b>picked</b> up <b>points</b> that has passengers. The route will have the least cost path...|$|R
50|$|We <b>pick</b> two <b>points,</b> say B1 and B2, {{with their}} {{corresponding}} normals and interpolate a curve c between them. Now we <b>pick</b> a <b>point</b> B12 and its normal on c. A ray r1 coming from R1 and refracted at B12 defines a new point T01 and its normal between T0 and T1 {{on the top}} surface, by applying the same constant optical path length S11 between S1 and R1. Now a ray r2 coming from S2 and refracted at T01 defines a new point and normal on the bottom surface, by applying the same constant optical path length S22 between S2 and R2. The process continues with rays r3 and r4 building a new SMS chain filling the gaps between <b>points.</b> <b>Picking</b> other <b>points</b> and corresponding normals on curve c gives us more points in between the other SMS points calculated originally.|$|R
