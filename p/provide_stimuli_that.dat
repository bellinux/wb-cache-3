They are ideals in the Platonic sense of a circle being an ideal whereas a drawn circle is flawed and real. The study of theoretically best or “mathematically ideal” tasks (Green & Swets, 1966), has been {{the basis of the}} branch of stimulus control in psychology called Psychophysics as well as being part of Artificial Intelligence (e. g. Goel & Chandrasekaran, 1992). Such studies include the instantiation of such ideal tasks in the real world. The notion of the ideal task has also {{played an important role in}} information theory. Tasks are defined as sequences of contingencies, each presenting stimuli and requiring an action or a sequence of actions to occur in some non-arbitrary fashion. These contingencies may not only <b>provide</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> require the discrimination of relations among actions and events but among task actions themselves. Again, Task actions, E, are actions that are required to complete tasks. Properties of tasks (usually the stimuli, or the relationship among stimuli and actions) are varied, and responses to them can be measured and analyzed.|$|E

Nonetheless, randomized controlled trials have not provided definitive evidence of ES causing nonunions to heal more often than sham devices. This impediment is probably formed by small sample sizes, lack of consistency regarding the definition of union and nonunion, and variability in ES current used...|$|E
40|$|The Hygiene Hypothesis and Old Friends Hypothesis focus {{attention}} on the coevolutionary relationship between humans and pathogens, positing that reduced pathogen exposure in economically developed nations is responsible for immune dysregulation and associated increases in chronic inflammation, allergy, and autoimmunity. Despite progress in testing these ideas, few studies have examined these relationships among populations undergoing the transition from traditional to more market-based lifestyles. The present study tests relationships between economic development and social change, altered infectious disease exposure, and immune function among the Shuar forager-horticulturalists of Amazonian Ecuador, a population undergoing rapid economic change associated with increased market participation. Using stool samples to assess soil-transmitted helminth (STHs; parasitic intestinal worms) burden, dried blood spot measurement of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), and interviews to evaluate level of market integration (MI; the suite of social and cultural changes associated with rapid economic development) and disgust sensitivity, this dissertation tests the Hygiene and Old Friends Hypotheses. The first study tests relationships between STH exposure and MI, using geographic location in relation to the regional market center as a proxy for MI. This study documents lower rates of STHs in people living in more market integrated regions. The second study tests the coevolutionary role that STHs and other pathogens have played in shaping human psychology and behavior. Findings suggest that pathogen exposure has acted as a selective pressure, resulting in evolved disgust sensitivity toward pathogen related stimuli. This study provides evidence that disgust sensitivity is calibrated to local environments, acting to decrease STH exposure. The third study tests the role of STHs in immune function. CRP was positively related to age in uninfected individuals. No relationships existed for more traditionally living or infected individuals. These findings suggest that STH exposure may decrease the risk of developing chronic inflammation and associated diseases with advancing age. These studies provide support for the idea that STHs <b>provide</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> decrease chronic inflammation, suggesting that altered intestinal microflora in developed nations may be partially responsible for the development of chronic inflammatory disorders like allergy and autoimmunity.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} retina develops from {{stem cells}} that are of neuroectodermal origin and derive from bilateral evaginations of the neuroepithelium, the optic vesicles. In rats, the differentiation of the six neuronal and the one glial cell types is terminated around postnatal day 12. The retina of adult mammals is a non-neurogenic region and the diseased retina is devoid of any spontaneous regeneration, while in poikilothermic vertebrates, cells at the ciliary margin of the eye proliferate throughout {{the life of the}} animals and generate new retinal {{cells that are}} integrated into functional retinal circuits. This knowledge initialized the search for such pools of stem and progenitor cells in the mammalian ciliary body (CB) from which neural stem cells (NSCs) have been isolated and characterized. These cells are capable to differentiate into glia and neurons, including retina-specific cell types like photoreceptors. In course of the present study, cell culture protocols for NSCs from the neurogenic regions subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus (HC) of the adult CNS were optimized. Furthermore, optimal conditions for differentiation of SVZ and HC cells into the three major cell classes of the CNS, namely neurons, astroglia and oligodendroglia, were established. Artificial constitutive expression of Notch 1 in adult SVZ and HC derived stem cells resulted in upregulation of glial differentiation and downregulation of neuronal differentiation, suggesting that adult CNS derived stem cells are subject to plasticity in terms of their fate determination. Therefore, these cells could provide a promising source for cellular replacement strategies in neurodegenerative models. The results of the NSC culture optimization were the basis for analyses of retinal progenitor cells. The presence and neurogenic potential of mammalian progenitors of the postnatal sensory retina were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. The results demonstrate that postnatal rodent retina derived cells proliferate in vitro and display some characteristics of NSCs, such as the expression of specific progenitor markers or the ability to incorporate BrdU. On the other hand, self-renewal as determined by clonal assays was not observed, indicating that postnatal cells are restricted in their stem cell potential. Furthermore, postnatal retinal cells grown under the optimized differentiation condition only differentiated along two neural lineages, neurons and astroglia. Stem cell capacities have been demonstrated for pigmented cells of the adult mammalian CB. RPE based neuronal regeneration in adult mammals has not been reported so far. This is surprising, since RPE cells are of neuroectodermal origin. A comparative study of adult rodent CB and RPE cells revealed that both cell types share characteristics, which are reminiscent of NSCs. Growth as neurospheres, proliferation and self-renewal capacities were all comparable to NSCs. Furthermore, both cell types expressed a set of specific retinal stem and progenitor cell markers, such as the proneural homeobox transcription factor Pax 6 or the bHLH transcription factor neuroD. Differentiation in the optimized media indicated that CB and RPE cells can differentiate along neuronal and glial lineages, but are devoid of oligodendroglial differentiation. Trans- or de-differentiation processes induce changes in phenotypes and expression profiles of CB and RPE cells. Therefore, one further focus of this study was the analysis of adult mammalian RPE cells with respect to de- and trans-differentiation under the optimized conditions. Differentiated RPE cells acquired neuronal and glial phenotypes in vitro, although the RPE is devoid of such phenotypes in vivo. Furthermore, detection of doublecortin, a transient marker for neuronal precursors, identified de-differentiating RPE cells that not only expressed beta III tubulin, but also acquired a neuronal morphology. Similar results were also obtained for human derived RPE cells. The presented results eventually aim at the comprehension of the basic biological mechanisms, which regulate the restrictions that stem or progenitor cells experience during cessation of development in the mammalian retina. An intriguing idea is to <b>provide</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> alter the gene expression from a quiescent somatic cell in the adult retina towards a retinal stem cell and activate its developmental program to generate new neurons in a diseased or injured retina...|$|E

Here, we critically examine the role of peripheral metabolic hormones as potential internal entrainment stimuli or outputs for FEOs controlling food anticipatory rhythms in rats and mice.

40|$|Autoreactive T {{cells can}} {{infiltrate}} the CNS to cause {{disorders such as}} multiple sclerosis. In order to visualize T cell activation in the CNS, we introduced a truncated fluorescent derivative of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) as a real-time T cell activation indicator. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a rat model of multiple sclerosis, we tracked T cells interacting with structures of the vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB). 2 -photon imaging documented the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of fluorescent NFAT, indicative of calcium-dependent activation of the T cells in the perivascular space, but not within the vascular lumen. The activation was related to contacts with the local antigen-presenting phagocytes and was noted only in T cells with a high pathogenic potential. T cell activation implied the presentation of an autoantigen, as the weakly pathogenic T cells, which remained silent in the untreated hosts, were activated upon instillation of exogenous autoantigen. Activation did not cogently signal long-lasting arrest, as individual T cells were able to sequentially contact fresh APCs. We propose that the presentation of local autoantigen by BBB-associated APCs <b>provides</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> guide autoimmune T cells to the CNS destination, enabling them to attack the target tissue...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Both {{physical}} activity and diet stimulate processes that, over time, alter the morphologic composition and biochemical function of the body. Physical activity <b>provides</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> promote very specific and varied adaptations accord-ing to the type, intensity, and duration of exercise performed. There is further interest in {{the extent to which}} diet or supple-mentation can enhance the positive stimuli. Prolonged walking at low intensity presents little metabolic, hormonal, or cardio-vascular stress, and the greatest perturbation from rest appears to be from increased fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid mobi-lization resulting from a combination of increased lipolysis and decreased reesterification. More intense jogging or running largely stimulates increased oxidation of glycogen and triacyl-glycerol, both of which are stored directly within the muscle fibers. Furthermore, these intramuscular stores of carbohydrate and fat appear to be the primary substrates for the enhanced oxidative and performance ability derived from endurance train-ing–induced increases in muscle mitochondrial density. Weight-lifting that produces fatigue in brief periods (ie, in 15 – 90 s and after 15 repetitive contractions) elicits a high degree of motor unit recruitment and muscle fiber stimulation. This is a remark-ably potent stimulus for altering protein synthesis in muscle and increasing neuromuscular function. The metabolic stress of {{physical activity}} can be measured by substrate turnover and depletion, cardiovascular response, hormonal perturbation, accumulation of metabolites, or even {{the extent to which the}} synthesis and degradation of specific proteins are altered, either acutely or by chronic exercise training.

30|$|Ghajar et al. {{reported}} {{that there are two}} distinct sub-vascular niches when DTCs extravasate at the target metastatic sites. The mature microvascular niche provides suppressive cues to inhibit cell proliferation and induces the sustained quiescence of DTCs, whereas the sprouting neovasculature niche <b>provides</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> activate DTCs and promote micrometastatic outgrowth. Among these dormancy-promoting and -inhibiting niches, several matricellular proteins, including thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) and periostin (POSTN), play crucial roles in regulating DTC dormancy. TSP- 1 is enriched in the basement membrane of mature microvessel stalks and maintains DTCs in a dormant state; however, TSP- 1 levels are markedly decreased at the sprouting neovascular tips of newly forming vessels. Interestingly, they also found an increased distribution of matricellular proteins, such as POSTN, tenascin-C and SPARC, together with fibronectin and TGF-β 1, around these growing tips. The authors further provided evidence that high POSTN and active TGF-β 1 expression surrounding neovascular tip cells enables DTCs to exit from dormancy and triggers metastatic relapse (Ghajar et al., 2013) (Fig.  1). At nearly the same time, Boyerinas and colleagues demonstrated that osteoblast-derived osteopontin (OPN) assists acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in anchoring to the bone marrow endosteal niche and promotes tumor dormancy (Fig.  1). OPN neutralization increases leukemia burden by decreasing dormant ALL cells in mice, but reduces minimal residual disease in leukemic mice when synergizes with Ara-C-based chemotherapy (Boyerinas et al., 2013). These results suggest that matricellular proteins TSP- 1, POSTN, tenascin-C, SPARC and OPN exhibit critical roles in regulating tumor dormancy.|$|R

It is a place that influences state of mind and productivity of those within it. On the doorstep of adaptive architecture that exhibits life like qualities, we use virtual reality to investigate if it might be a pleasant and productive place to be; without incurring the expense of building. Thus this work has a methodological contribution of investigating the use of aspects of virtual reality to answer this question and the substantive contribution of providing initial answers. It is motivated by juxtaposing 1) responsive architecture, 2) simulation in architectural design 3) adaptive computer mediated environments, and 4) use of VR to study user responses to both architecture and interactive scenarios.

40|$|Migration toward {{pathology}} is {{the first}} critical step in stem cell engagement during regeneration. Neural stem cells (NSCs) migrate through the parenchyma along nonstereotypical routes in a precise directed manner across great distances to injury sites in the CNS, where they might engage niches harboring local transiently expressed reparative signals. The molecular mechanisms for NSC mobilization have not been identified. Because NSCs seem to home similarly to pathologic sites derived from disparate etiologies, we hypothesized that the inflammatory response itself, a characteristic common to all, guides the behavior of potentially reparative cells. As proof of concept, we show that human NSCs migrate in vivo (including from the contralateral hemisphere) toward an infarcted area (a representative CNS injury), where local astrocytes and endothelium up-regulate the inflammatory chemoattractant stromal cell-derived factor 1 α (SDF- 1 α). NSCs express CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR 4), the cognate receptor for SDF- 1 α. Exposure of SDF- 1 α to quiescent NSCs enhances proliferation, promotes chain migration and transmigration, and activates intracellular molecular pathways mediating engagement. CXCR 4 blockade abrogates their pathology-directed chain migration, a developmentally relevant mode of tangential migration that, if recapitulated, could explain homing along nonstereotypical paths. Our data implicate SDF- 1 α/CXCR 4, representative of the inflammatory milieu characterizing many pathologies, as a pathway that activates NSC molecular programs during injury and suggest that inflammation may be viewed not simply as playing an adverse role but also as <b>providing</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> recruit cells with a regenerative homeostasis-promoting capacity. CXCR 4 expression within germinal zones suggests that NSC homing after injury and migration during development may invoke similar mechanisms...|$|R

After glucocorticoid treatment, the virus is reactivated from neural fibers and reinfects epithelial cells. The findings show that HMPV persists in neural fibers and suggest a mechanism for disease chronicity that has important implications for HMPV disease intervention strategies. Full Tex...|$|R

Com o objetivo de analisar o ambiente domiciliar de crianças de 2 anos de idade, quanto à oferta de estímulos e à sua relação com suspeitas de atrasos de desenvolvimento, realizou-se estudo transversal, em comunidade de baixa renda na periferia de São Luis. Calculou-se amostra aleatória de 176 crianças de 2 anos de idade cadastradas em unidades de saúde da comunidade. Utilizaram-se dois instrumentos validados: o Inventory Home (medida de estímulos domiciliares) e a Gesell Scale (medida de desenvolvimento). Os dados foram coletados nas próprias casas. Foram realizadas regressões logísticas tendo como variáveis resposta o HOME (baixo ou médio/alto) e Gesell (com suspeita de atraso ou s/atraso). Renda familiar baixa, baixa escolaridade materna e paterna, nº de residentes, nº de filhos The main {{bonds of}} infants {{in early childhood}} are established in the home environment. The home is fundamental for <b>providing</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> can influence {{the development of the}} child. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a low income community in {{the outskirts of the city}} of São Luís to analyze the provision of stimuli in the home environment of 2 -year-old children and the potential association with retardation in child development. A random sample of 176 2 -year-old children registered in community outpatient healthcare departments was assessed. Two validated instruments were used, namely the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory and the Gesell Measurement of Development Scale. Data were gathered in the homes. Logistic regressions were carried out taking the Home Inventory (low or average/high) and the Gesell Scale (suspicion of delay/normal) as outcome variables. Low family income, low maternal and paternal schooling, number of residents, number of children < 5 years old and small number of rooms in the house were considered risk factors for low Home scores, which were associated with the suspicion of development delay. The quality and quantity of environmental stimuli in the family context proved to be essential for the development of the children evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{integral}} to the healthy and whole functioning of an organism, mediating interactions with and responses to an organism’s surroundings. Environmental enrichment (EE) <b>provides</b> <b>stimuli</b> above <b>that</b> usually experienced within the laboratory environment, and {{has been shown to}} greatly impact the nervous system. The maturation of inhibitory circuitry controls the level of neuroplasticity and functional maturity present within neural systems. This thesis investigates the effect of EE upon the development of inhibitory circuitry within the striatum. The striatum is the entry nucleus to the basal ganglia, and as such mediates various cognitive and sensorimotor behaviours. This thesis investigates the effect of EE upon striatally-mediated behaviours of both juvenile and adult animals. This thesis demonstrates that exposure to an enriched environment accelerates maturation of inhibitory circuitry within the striatum and increases the number of active inhibitory interneurons within the adult striatum; improves problem solving and goal-orientated learning; and influences animal behaviours within automated testing apparatus. This work sheds light on the mechanisms by which EE impacts an important nucleus within the brain, and has implications for potential treatments of neurological disorders. Determining the optimum environment for healthy brain development may also aid in early education and intervention programs targeted at young children...|$|R

40|$|The Cassini-Huygens {{mission is}} a joint NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) mission to collect {{scientific}} data of the Saturnian system and is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). After having arrived in Saturn orbit and releasing the ESA's Huygens probe for a highly successful descent and landing mission on Saturn's moon Titan, the Cassini orbiter continues on its tour of Saturn, its satellites, and the Saturnian environment. JPL's Cassini Integrated Test laboratory (ITL) is a dedicated high fidelity test bed that verifies and validates command sequences and flight software before upload to the Cassini spacecraft. The ITL <b>provides</b> artificial <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> allow a highly accurate hardware-in-the-loop test bed model that tests {{the operation of the}} Cassini spacecraft on the ground. This enables accurate prediction and recreation of mission events and flight software and hardware behavior. As we discovered more about the Saturnian environment, a combination of creative test methods and simulation changes were necessary to simulate the harmful effect that the optical and physical environment has on the pointing performance of Cassini. This paper presents the challenges experienced and overcome in that endeavor to simulate and test the post Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) and Probe Relay tour phase of the Cassini mission...|$|R
40|$|Mononuclear phagocytes {{directly}} {{mediate the}} destruction of pathogens through ingestion, and can also be stimulated to produce potent immunoregulatory molecules, including IL- 1 a, IL- 1 (i, andTNF. These diverse functions of phagocytic cells are modulated by a large set of cell surface receptors that probe the extracellular milieu. Priming of tissue macrophages by T cell-derived IFN-y results in increased hydrogen peroxide production, increased killing of intracellular pathogens, and increased expression of class II cell surface glycoproteins (1 - 4). A second activating <b>stimulus,</b> for example <b>that</b> <b>provided</b> by bacterial LPS, augments the tumoricidal activity of primed macrophages and provokes the expression of TNF and IL- 1 (5 - 8). Although LPS by itself can trigger release of these cytokines, LPS and IFN-y administered together <b>provide</b> a synergistic <b>stimulus</b> <b>that</b> is believed to mimic physiologic activation (2, 9, 10). To better understand the regulation of macrophage activity, considerable effort has been directed towards characterizing changes in gene expression subsequent to LPS or IFN-y treatment of phagocytic cells. LPS stimulation ofmacrophages result...|$|R
40|$|Offspring {{signalling}} {{can serve}} to communicate need to the parents and thus influence parental readiness to <b>provide</b> care. Offspring <b>stimuli</b> <b>that</b> affect parental care have been investigated extensively. Yet much less {{is known about the}} mechanisms leading to a decline in maternal motivation when conflicts of provisioning current and future offspring may arise. Here we tested responses by pregnant and non-pregnant female guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus) to playback of pup calls during their period of lactation for dependent offspring. Most concurrently pregnant and lactating females did not respond to pup calls, whereas non-pregnant lactating females responded strongly. Our findings expand on previous studies by showing that female behavioural responsiveness to pup stimuli is strongly reduced by concurrent pregnancy and lactation. These instantaneous measurements of female responsiveness to young show more directly than standard measures like nursing performance or time to weaning how female motivation to care for current offspring is diminished by simultaneous gestation. ...|$|R
