5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland – {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development – no one <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles. He predicted {{that it would not}} be long before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from previous titles in the Myst series, End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> making the game more accessible to new players {{by the addition of}} multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game's characters as a gift to Myst fans.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain {{in the area of}} Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E

5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> northeastern {{portion of the}} state, {{especially}} the increasing need {{for the creation of}} new counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write a new state constitution, but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals for the creation of three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were not passed.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began {{regarding}} Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.|$|E

5|$|In the 680s, Justinian II (685–695 and 705–711) <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{the needs}} of the navy, {{strengthening}} it by the resettlement of over 18,500 Mardaites along the southern coasts of the Empire, where they were employed as marines and rowers. Nevertheless, the Arab naval threat intensified as they gradually took control of North Africa in the 680s and 690s. The last Byzantine stronghold, Carthage, fell in 698, although a Byzantine naval expedition managed to briefly retake it. The Arab governor Musa bin Nusair built a new city and naval base at Tunis, and 1,000 Coptic shipwrights were brought to construct a new fleet, which would challenge Byzantine control of the western Mediterranean. Thus, from the early 8th century on, Muslim raids unfolded unceasingly against Byzantine holdings in the Western Mediterranean, especially Sicily. In addition, the new fleet would allow the Muslims to complete their conquest of the Maghreb and to successfully invade and capture most of the Visigoth-controlled Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals {{it was just a}} drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E

25|$|Some people, {{who have}} <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the {{governmental}} regulation on the Internet, mentioned {{another aspect of}} the ruling. April Glaser, a staff activist at the EFF, noted that the ruling had an aspect of a bar against the FCC's approach to network neutrality. Various commentators pointed to the possibility that by invoking the court's interpretation of Section 706, the FCC could expand its regulative power to the Internet thereby threatening its freedom.|$|E

No one <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Carson's advice about a rescue attempt, and Mrs. White was found dead with an arrow in her heart. She had been horribly abused, and may have been passed among her captors as a camp prostitute. Her child had been carried away, and was never found.|$|E
25|$|Niikuni {{started to}} write poetry {{on the side}} while {{attending}} school, and until {{he was in his}} twenties he would write not experimental poetry but lyrical poetry. The effect of Sakutarō Hagiwara could be seen in these works, and Niikuni also admitted himself that Hagiwara was his starting point. Niikuni also wrote that he <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the works of Shirō Murano and Junzaburō Nishiwaki. In addition, he was fascinated by surrealism, new objectivity and existentialism among others.|$|E
25|$|During his African {{years he}} not only worked on insects and his {{favourite}} snails, but also <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the two other groups that had his firm interest: mammals and birds. He made many contacts with managers and rangers of National Parks, and became actively involved in nature conservation. His stay amidst the African wildlife also further stimulated his interest in zoos. In 1963, at the 125th anniversary of Artis Zoo in Amsterdam, Dolf sent a number of rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) off by plane, as a gift from Dutch biologists working in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that most early peoples which have left records knew {{something}} of numeration and mechanics, and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying. In particular, the Egyptians <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and land-surveying. The results attained by these people seem to have been accessible, under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of observation and measurement, and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.|$|E
25|$|Nima’s poetry transgressed these limitations. It {{relied on}} the natural {{function}} inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet’s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai’ poetry is {{to move away from}} the rhythms it employed. Nima Youshij <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the history}} commences {{with that of}} the Ionian schools, {{there is no doubt that}} those Ancient Greeks who <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it were largely indebted to the {{previous}} investigations of the Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Phoenicians. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values (arithmetic), implies a state of civilization at the period of its invention. Our knowledge of the mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.|$|E
