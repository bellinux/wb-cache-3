40|$|In {{recent times}} {{there has been}} a growing {{awareness}} of the importance of nutrition and the nutritional aspects of various foods. Products are now marketed by emphasizing their nutritional properties, and new products are often designed to serve a <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>purpose.</b> Nutrition concern has become an important force in successfully shaping food marketing. Nevertheless, obesity and other nutrition-related health problems have not abated, and in fact have worsened. A possible explanation for these disparate trends is that a subset of nutritionally-concerned consumers - consumers in less need of improved nutrition- is responsible for the majority of healthy food purchases, with most others ignoring the nutritional message. Thus, an important question is who buys foods with salient nutritional features? We investigate this question using the case of calcium-enriched orange juice. We find that, on balance, most calcium enriched juice is purchased by households who generally purchase more nutritious foods. This suggest they are demanding "nutrition," rather than the specific nutrient "calcium. "Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

40|$|The term "nutritional supplements" {{for animals}} is found {{first in the}} "Proposal for the European Parliament and of the Board {{amending}} Directive 93 / 74 /EEC on feedingstuffs intended for <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>purposes</b> and amending Directives 74 / 63 /EEC, 79 / 373 /EEC and 82 / 471 /EEC”, submitted by the European Commission to the European Parliament and Council Director for approval on July 28, 1997. The proposal was not approved, for the reasons that this category of "supplement animal nutrition” is already regulated at EU level onlegislation to feed, supplementary feed, feed premixes, food for <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>purposes.</b> In order to harmonize the conditions for the marketing and use of feed, to clarify of divergences anduncertainties due existing legislative vacuum, {{in order to ensure}} a high level of protection of public health and to provide adequate information to users and consumers, The Regulation (EC) No 767 / 2009 of the European Parliament and the Council on the marketing and use of feed, amending Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003 and repealing Council Directive 79 / 373 /EEC, Council Directive 80 / 511 /EEC, Directives 82 / 471 /CEE, 83 / 228 /EEC, 93 / 74 /EEC, 93 / 113 /EC and 96 / 25 /EC and Commission Decision 2004 / 217 /EC (1) aproved.

40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} of feed are spread over several Directives according {{to the type of}} feed concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation of this feed in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles for feedingstuffs intended for <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>purposes</b> (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use of feed materials. Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down the marketing conditions for certain products, belonging to the category feed materials, used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as of feed materials, dietetic feed, feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might not be used for food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between feed materials, feed additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On feed intended for <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>purposes,</b> the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication of feed materials incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw materials in compound feed that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further labelling particulars can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|R

A wide variety of PARNUTs exist on the European market. Currently, PARNUTs are regulated by a Framework Directive (2009 / 39 /EC) and specific pieces of related legislation (five Directives and one Regulation) which set out specific rules for certain categories of PARNUTs. To simplify the regulation of PARNUTs, the European Commission proposed changes to the legislation governing PARNUTs in November 2011. These changes involved repealing the Framework Directive (2009 / 39 /EC) and regulating PARNUTs under various pieces of food legislation. It was proposed that three specific Directives (Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula, Food Intended for Infants and Young Children and Foods for Special Medical Purposes (FSMPs)) would be combined into a single new Regulation called Food Intended for Infants and Young Children and Food for Special Medical Purposes...|$|R
