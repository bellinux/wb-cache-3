The notion of robustness asserts that an active attacker, who can modify program code in some fixed points (holes), is not able to disclose more private information than a passive attacker, who merely observes public data.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} complexity of information management computer systems, security becomes a real concern. E-government, web-based financial transactions or military {{and health care}} information systems {{are only a few}} examples where large amount of information can reside on different hosts distributed worldwide. It is clear that any disclosure or corruption of confidential information in these contexts can result fatal. Information flow controls constitute an appealing and promising technology to protect both data confidentiality and data integrity. The certification of the security degree of a program that runs in untrusted environments still remains an open problem in the area of language-based security. Robustness asserts that an active attacker, who can modify program code in some fixed points (holes), is unable to disclose more private information than a passive attacker, who merely observes unclassified data. In this paper, we extend a method recently proposed for checking declassified non-interference in presence of <b>passive</b> attackers <b>only,</b> in <b>order</b> to check robustness by means of weakest precondition semantics. In particular, this semantics simulates the kind of analysis that can be performed by an attacker, i. e., from public output towards private input. The choice of semantics allows us to distinguish between different attacks models and to characterize the security of applications in different scenarios. Our results are sound to address confidentiality and integrity of software running in untrusted environments where different actors can distrust one another. For instance, a web server can be attacked by a third party in order to steal a session cookie or hijack clients to a fake web page...|$|R

40|$|In ([10], JCP 227 No. 6, 2008, pp. 3101 – 3211), {{the authors}} have {{designed}} a new fifth order WENO finite-difference scheme by adding a higher <b>order</b> smoothness <b>indicator</b> which is obtained as a simple and inexpensive linear combination of the already existing low <b>order</b> smoothness <b>indicators.</b> Moreover, this new scheme, dubbed as WENO-Z, has a CPU cost which {{is equivalent to the}} one of the classical WENO-JS ([2],JCP 126, pp. 202 – 228 (1996)) and significantly lower than that of the mapped WENO-M,([5],JCP 207, pp. 542 – 567 (2005)), since it involves no mapping of the nonlinear weights. In this article, we {{take a closer look at}} Taylor expansions of the Lagrangian polynomials of the WENO substencils and the related inherited symmetries of the classical lower <b>order</b> smoothness <b>indicators</b> to obtain a general formula for the higher <b>order</b> smoothness <b>indicators</b> that allows the extension of the WENO-Z scheme to all (odd) orders of accuracy. We further investigate the improved accuracy of the WENO-Z schemes at critical points of smooth solutions as well as their distinct dissipative features as a result of the new sets of nonlinear weights. Some standard numerical experiments such as the one dimensional Riemann initial values problems for the Euler equations and the Mach 3 shock density-wave interaction and the two dimensional double-Mach shock reflection problems are presented...|$|R
