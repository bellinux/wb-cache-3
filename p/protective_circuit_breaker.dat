These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow accumulation of gas, or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a <b>protective</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the Buchholz relay.|$|E

50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, breaker panel, or electric panel) is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a <b>protective</b> fuse or <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> for each <b>circuit</b> in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more residual-current devices (RCD) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBO), are also incorporated.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{analytic}} {{models for}} power system fault diagnosis are usually formulated as an unconstrained 0 – 1 integer programming problem. The key {{issue of the}} models is to seek the fault hypothesis that minimizes {{the discrepancy between the}} actual and the expected states of the concerned <b>protective</b> relays and <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> The temporal information of alarm messages has not been well utilized in these methods, and as a result, the diagnosis results may be not unique and hence indefinite, especially when complicated and multiple faults occur. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a novel analytic model employing the temporal information of alarm messages along with the concept of related path. The temporal relationship among the actions of <b>protective</b> relays and <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> and the different protection configurations in a modern power system can be reasonably represented by the developed model, and therefore, the diagnosed results will be more definite under different circumstances of faults. Finally, an actual power system fault was served to verify the proposed method...|$|R

For the purpose of speedy repair work and maintenance, it is important to find the exact fault location and type of fault.

25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the <b>protective</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPN) {{is used as}} a mod-eling tool {{to build}} fault {{diagnosis}} models aimed to accurately diag-nose faults when some incomplete and uncertain alarm informa-tion of <b>protective</b> relays and <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> is detected. In order to understand the significance of fault diagnosis models more con-veniently, the definition and structure of FPNs are necessarily in-troduced at first. Then, models of fault diagnosis based on FPN are built, and their corresponding logical testifications are carried out. Finally, the validity and feasibility of this method is illustrated by simulation examples. It is shown from seven cases that the faulted system elements can be diagnosed correctly by use of these models, and a satisfying result can also be achieved even in the situation with large amount of incomplete and uncertain alarm information.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{uncertainties}} of the causalities from fault sources to fault symptoms in fault diagnosis for substation, a fault diagnosis method based on optimizing the combination of fault-masses is proposed.

A fitness function is presented to evaluate the feasibility that the combination of fault-masses acts as the optimal answer to the known fault symptoms, and the genetic algorithm is employed to search out the optimal answer.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} weighted fuzzy reasoning spiking neu-ral P systems (WFRSN P systems) to fault diagnosis in traction power supply systems (TPSSs) of China high-speed railways.

40|$|In recent years, {{some models}} have been {{proposed}} for the fault section estimation and state identification of unobserved protective relays (FSE-SIUPR) under the condition of incomplete state information of protective relays. In these models, the temporal alarm information from a faulted power system is not well explored although it is very helpful in compensating the incomplete state information of protective relays, quickly achieving definite fault diagnosis results and evaluating the operating status of <b>protective</b> relays and <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> in complicated fault scenarios. In order to solve this problem, an integrated optimization mathematical model for the FSE-SIUPR, which takes {{full advantage of the}} temporal characteristics of alarm messages, is developed in the framework of the well-established temporal constraint network. With this model, the fault evolution procedure can be explained and some states of unobserved protective relays identified.
