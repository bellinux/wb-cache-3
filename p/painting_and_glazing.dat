50|$|Camacho Quiroz {{works with}} red and yellow clays mined from {{the nearby town of}} Ocotitlán. He cleans the masses and along with others in this town, engages in the {{tradition}} of laying the clays on the street to be pulverized by passing cars. The final grinding to a powder is done by hand with a heavy stone in small quantities. To work the clay into forms, it is first wetted and then “plumilla” cattail fluff is added as a temper. Certain pieces, such as flowerpots are made using molds, pressing thin “pancakes” of clay into shape. Then pieces are dried in the sun before being smoothed with stones and other tools. Firing is done in a circular kiln. The first time is done terra cotta and the second is done after <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> <b>glazing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S., {{the musical}} previewed {{beginning}} in Los Angeles with Edwin Lester's L.A (and San Francisco) Civic Light Opera Association, as a 1962 national tour. The Sean Kenny sets were duplicated. The sets built in London were shipped by sea and {{delivered to the}} Port of San Pedro, with the actual stage brick wall London mural painted as a scenic backing. Sean Kenny's design concept eliminated a house curtain, exposing the turntable stage set, the open lighting pipes rigged with lamp fixtures, electric cables, and an open loft to the arriving audience. The turntable, scenic set and elements duplicated the original garish stylistic [...] "wood grained" [...] painted finish. With lighting, the set was intended to take on each specific color mood and change atmosphere. Edwin Lester hated the set's paint job, [...] ordering his scenic shop manager Phil Raiguel to send scenic artists to glaze down the red, green, blue, yellow, orange grain finish. During the companies rehearsal prior to that evenings' 8 pm premiere audience, the two scenic artists (Wally Reid and Hub Braden) glazed over the scenery while the cast rehearsed on the turntable stair platform and bridge units. [...] The scenic artists continued painting/glazing while the cast took their meal break prior to the overture. As the audience was seated, the open-to-view stage set painting continued, with the two scenic artists still <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> <b>glazing</b> as the musical was performed; continuing during the intermission, through the second act performance, and taking curtain calls with the company. [...] Remaining on stage afterwards, the two continued their glazing throughout the night, finishing the set's repainting the following day at noon. [...] Reviews noted that the stage direction included [...] "two London house painters" [...] atmosphere performance, later questioning where and why the house painters had been eliminated after the show's opening night [...]|$|E

Plaster work can be done with tinted plasters, or washed over with earth pigments, and is generally applied with a trowel or spatula.
