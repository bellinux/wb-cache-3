5000|$|At {{the main}} entrance, an oak paneled door with {{original}} beveled glass opens {{into a wide}} center hallway, floored in wide oak strips, with a large oak staircase. A paneled door on the north leads to a small parlor, with large double pocket doors leading to a larger parlor and another small single <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> opening into a large mourning room. In both of these rooms the oak strips on the floor are arranged in a pattern of [...] rectangles. A double <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> separates them.

50|$|A <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> is {{a sliding}} door that slides along its length and disappears, when open, into a {{compartment}} {{in the adjacent}} wall, or as in terms of vehicles, into the vehicle's bodywork. Pocket doors were used in some vans, including Renault Estafette and Morris J4 and train carriages such as the London Underground 1973 Stock, but rarely in cars.|$|E

The second-story rooms follow a similar layout but are more restrained in scale and decoration.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> is {{a sliding}} door that disappears, when fully open, into a {{compartment}} {{in the adjacent}} wall. Pocket doors are used for architectural effect, or {{when there is no}} room for the swing of a hinged door. They can travel on rollers suspended from an overhead track or also feature tracks or guides along the floor. Both single- and double-door versions are used, depending on how wide an entry is desired.|$|E

50|$|Behind {{the diner}} {{body is a}} wood frame single story {{structure}}, which houses the kitchen and restrooms. Unlike many New England diners, this structure has a gable roof. The diner's interior is unusual for its custom configuration. The right six bays have a typical interior setup, with four booths and fourteen counter stools, while the left three bays have a dining room arrangement. This area is separated from the counter area by a <b>pocket</b> <b>door,</b> and has six booths, three each lining {{the front and back}} walls.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{installing}} a <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> {{rather than a}} hinged door can add an average of ten square feet of floor space, according to building expert Tim Carter, who considers the <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> [...] "one of the top ten most overlooked items when many architects and builders plan a home". The doors were particularly common in Victorian homes to close off such areas as sitting rooms or dens; however, as architectural tastes changed, many of the hardware manufacturers went out of business. With improvement in the hardware {{and the growth of}} the market for condominiums and town homes, there has been a resurgence of interest in this space-saving feature. Modern residential uses include bathrooms, closets, laundry or utility rooms, or home offices. A wall-hung variation called an [...] "open pocket door" [...] may be used where in-wall installation is impractical; this version is recommended for homes with disabled residents due to greater ease of opening compared to traditional hinged, pull-open doors. One downside to pocket doors is hidden parts and hardware, which can make them difficult to replace or repair when something goes wrong. Fixing the problem might require removing the door and trim and opening up the wall. [...] The 1953-'54 Kaiser Motors Darrin sports car used pocket doors.|$|E
50|$|A {{sliding glass}} door or patio door, {{is a type of}} sliding door in {{architecture}} and construction, is a large glass window opening in a structure that provide door access from a room to the outdoors, fresh air, and copious natural light. A {{sliding glass door}} is usually considered a single unit consisting of two panel sections, one being fixed and one a being mobile to slide open. Another design, a wall sized glass <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> has one or more panels movable and sliding into wall pockets, completely disappearing for a 'wide open' indoor-outdoor room experience.|$|E

50|$|Duffy’s current {{endeavor}} is {{the curved}} door. “Normal” flat doors continue and complete a flat plane (the wall). But a radius entry door, {{or any other}} radius or curved door, usually continues a curved wall. A curved door is best visualized as one section of a large cylinder. Radius doors must be built with extreme care in order to precisely match {{the curve of the}} walls they will be embedded in - thus the assistance of laser technology. Duffy uses a Kern CO2 laser to cut patterns that he either creates himself or receives from a client. With the 100 watts of energy generated by the laser, he focuses on a point the size of a pinhead, allowing for intricate cuts in sometimes delicate materials, and for a degree of precision not afforded him by the use of regular power tools. Almost all varieties of wood lend themselves to laser-work.The final product may be a hinged or “swing” door, a <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> that will slide into a wall when opened, or a door that slides along the face of a wall. Duffy has created curved doors for the Prettyman Courthouse in Washington, D.C. and for residences throughout the U.S., with commissions recently in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|A {{sliding door}} {{is a type}} of door which opens {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. Sliding doors can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of sliding <b>doors</b> such as <b>pocket</b> <b>doors,</b> Arcadia doors, and bypass doors. Sliding doors are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
