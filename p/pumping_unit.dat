2500|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the Lost Hills {{operations is}} the pronounced subsidence {{of the ground}} surface as it collapses into the area vacated by the petroleum after being pumped out. Portions of the hills overlying the oil field have subsided up to [...] in the central region of operations, and subsidence occurs field-wide {{at a rate of}} about [...] per year. The dropping land surface causes operational problems, including fractures of well casings, and sometimes complete well failures. Waterflooding – the practice of filling the reservoir with water to push petroleum to recovery wells, and thereby also reoccupying the space vacated by oil and gas – has partially mitigated the problem. Some wells have actually disappeared into craters: in 1976, a Getty Oil well blew out, and quickly collapsed into a crater over [...] deep and , taking with it the concrete pad, casing, and <b>pumping</b> <b>unit.</b> Yet another Getty well suffered the same fate in 1978.|$|E

30|$|Phased <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> was a beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{with high}} performance, {{developing}} in recent several decades such as CYJY in China and Mark/Mark II in USA. Phased <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> had two differences against to conventional pump units: the first {{difference was that}} its gearbox was deviated from the holder, the second difference {{was that there was}} a balance phase angle in the center of gravity of counterbalance, the crank always fall behind with phase angle in clockwise. Therefore, in the upstroke, the acceleration and dynamic load of phase <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> decreased, and the peak torque of gearbox decreased (Feng et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|The beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{applied in}} {{oilfield}} {{for more than}} 150  years, because it had the advantages of simple structure, reliable and durable.

Due to the inherent structure of the beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> the balanced torque curve of gearbox has a bigger fluctuation ratio and negative torque that results low motor efficiency and load impact. Because the motor efficiency is directly proportional to the fluctuation ratio of gearbox torque, many researchers designed many types of energy-saving devices to improve the system efficiency. Therefore, based on the balance theory of gearbox torque, we introduced and discussed some significant energy-saving technologies, such as phased <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> dual-horsehead <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> shock absorber device, load reducer device, lower barbell <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, variable speed drive device.
