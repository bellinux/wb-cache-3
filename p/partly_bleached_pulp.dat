The results showed that microwave treatment could increase {{the brightness of the}} hydrogen peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp.</b> The fiber coarseness of microwave enhancing peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was higher than that of the peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp.</b> However, the arithmetic average fiber length, the length weighted average fiber length and weight weighted average fiber length of the former was lower than that of the latter. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra showed that CrI(%) crystallinity of microwave enhancing peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was similar as that of the peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> but all higher than that of the Soda-AQ wheat-straw pulp.

However, {{there is still a}} lack of data on the application of Mg(OH) 2 in peroxide bleaching of non-wood fibres. In this work, our purpose was to study the effect of Mg(OH) 2 on peroxide bleaching of wheat straw soda-AQ pulp. The results showed that Mg(OH) 2 significantly improved peroxide bleaching efficiency (expressed as the ratio between the brightness gain and the H 2 O 2 consumption) and selectivity (expressed as the ratio between the brightness gain and the viscosity losses) of wheat straw soda-AQ pulp. The brightness, viscosity, and yield of <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> can be significantly enhanced by increasing the replacement ratio of Mg(OH) 2.

When 24 to 73 % of the NaOH was replaced with Mg(OH) 2, the COD of the bleaching filtrate was 11 to 38 % lower than that of the NaOH as the sole alkaline source.

40|$|Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) nanofibers were {{isolated}} from unbleached and <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> {{by a combination}} of chemical and mechanical treatments. The chemical methods were based on NaOH-AQ (anthraquinone) and three-stage bleaching (DEpD) processes, whereas the mechanical techniques involved refining, cryo-crushing, and high-pressure homogenization. The size and morphology of the obtained fibers were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the studies showed that the isolated nanofibers from unbleached and <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> had diameters between 10 - 90 nm, while their length was in the micrometer range. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the content of lignin and hemicellulose decreased in the pulping process and that lignin was almost completely removed during bleaching. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that both pulp types as well as the nanofibers displayed a superior thermal stability as compared to the raw kenaf.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of process conditions (time, pH, temperature and consistency) on the optical properties of mechanical pulps during storage in a clean system as a reference for further work. Laboratory storage trials were performed with unbleached and hydrogen-peroxide bleached well-washed Norway spruce pulps. In general, the pulp darkened during storage due {{to an increase in}} light absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths. After long storage times, the light absorption coefficient, k had increased also at longer wavelengths. No specific peaks were seen in Delta k-spectra. The increase in light absorption was most rapid initially, during the first four hours, for all pulps when stored at high temperature (80 degrees C), and then proceeded more slowly. The corresponding change in colour, measured as a* and b*, was shifted towards red and somewhat towards yellow, and over longer periods of storage, the shift towards yellow became greater. Time and temperature were found to have the largest impact. The effects were similar regardless of the starting pH (4. 3 - 9. 7) and pulp consistency (5 %- 25 %). The hydrogen-peroxide <b>bleached</b> <b>pulps</b> were more sensitive to storage compared to the unbleached pulp at temperatures above 50 degrees C. At storage times of up to four hours, the unbleached pulp showed no loss of brightness at either of the storage temperatures. A slightly less <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> darkened more than a highly <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> at all wavelengths.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Most metal ions have {{negative}} impacts on pulp mill operations. The concentrations of metal ions on pulp fibers and in washwaters rise significantly with increased wastewater recycling. The development {{of technology to}} remove these metal ions requires {{an understanding of how}} metal ions are bound to pulp components. It is also desirable to predict distribution of metal ions between the pulp fibers and the washwaters. The adsorption isotherms for eight metal ions (Ca, Ba, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Na) were measured on bleached and unbleached (brownstock) kraft pulps at neutral pH and temperatures ranging from 25 to 75 °C. On <b>bleached</b> <b>pulps,</b> the metal ion adsorption increased rapidly with increasing metal ion concentration in solution and then leveled off. At neutral pH, the adsorption on <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was stoichiometric to the carboxylate sites, whereas the adsorption on unbleached pulp was not, especially at high metal ion concentration in solution and low temperature. The pH isotherms specify the adsorption isotherms of sodium and calcium on wood pulps as pH ranging from 2. 5 to 11. 0. The pH isotherms on <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> with only COOH functional groups (pK[subscript a] of 3. 77) were saturated at pH 4 and above, whereas those on brownstock pulp with both COOH and PhOH (pK[subscript a] of 10) functional groups increased in two steps, at pH 4 and 8. The brownstock pulp is heterogeneous material. Therefore, only the empirical Freundlich model was applied to the data. To predict the metal ion adsorption on <b>bleached</b> <b>pulps,</b> two fundamental equilibrium models were developed: the multi-component ion exchange and the Donnan equilibrium models. The ion-exchange model better predicts the metal adsorption at neutral pH, whereas the Donnan equilibrium model more accurately predicts the pH isotherms.
