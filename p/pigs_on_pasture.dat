40|$|Nutrient {{load and}} {{distribution}} on pasture were investigated with fattening pigs that: 1) spend {{a proportion of}} or their entire life on pasture, 2) were fed either restrictively or ad libitum, and 3) were weaned {{at different times of}} the year. The N and P retention in pigs decreased the longer they were kept on pasture. The contents of soil inorganic N and exchangeable K were significantly raised compared to the soil outside the enclosures but with no differences between treatments. Pig grazing did not affect extractable soil P. Regular moving of huts, feeding and water troughs was effective in ensuring that nutrients were more evenly distributed on the paddocks. Grass cover, as determined by spectral reflectance, was not related to the experimental treatments but only to time of year. During spring and summer, grass was present in parts of the paddocks, whereas during autumn and winter the pigs kept grass cover below 10 %. Fattening <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> carries a high risk of nutrient loss and it is concluded that the most environmentally acceptable way of keeping fattening <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> involves a combination of reduced dietary N intake, reduced stocking rate and seasonal rather than all year production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Risk {{factors for}} Toxoplasma gondii {{infection}} in workers and residents of swine farms were studied on 43 farms in Illinois. Blood {{samples were collected}} from 174 adults in 1993. The T. gondii seroprevalence was 31 %. An interview was conducted with each participant, obtaining information on demographic characteristics and behav-iors suspected to affect the risk of T. gondii infection. Factors associated with increased risk of T. gondii seropositivity were a higher number of seropositive cats trapped on the farm, male sex, rearing <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture,</b> and gardening. Factors associated with a decreased risk were handling of pig feed and presence of cats inside the pig facilities. Thus, infection of cats with T. gondii increased the risk of human infection, and contact with soil was a likely mechanism for transmission. The increased risk of seropositivity in males is attributed to less attention paid to cleanliness in food preparation and eating. Human infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is common worldwide. 1 Serologic surveys in the United States have produced a range of estimates (10 – 60 %) of the prevalence of infection in adults. 1 – 4 There can be se-rious health consequences due to infection with T. gondii.

40|$|Among {{consumers}} in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world there is an increasing interest in high-value pork positioned with regard to animal welfare (Krystallis et al., 2012). Free-range pork production is considered more animal friendly because the system enables the animals to express their natural behaviour to a large degree. However, outdoor production of growing-finishing <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pastures</b> as described by Halberg et al. (2010) has a major drawback in terms of high risk of nitrate leaching (Eriksen et al., 2006 ab; Salomon et al., 2007). This is to a large extent related to high stocking densities combined with large input of nutrients from the supplementary feed (Eriksen et al., 2006 ab). The use of supplementary feed is often higher in free-range compared to indoor systems for growing pigs due to a poorer feed conversion.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{of age and}} housing location to single antibiotic resistance, multiple antibiotic resistance, and resistance patterns of fecal coliforms obtained during a 20 -month period from pigs in a herd that was not exposed to antibiotics for 126 months was determined. Bacteria resistant to single and multiple antibiotics were isolated more frequently (P less than 0. 01) from pigs under 7 months of age. A greater proportion of isolates from pigs over 6 months of age was sensitive to the 13 antimicrobial agents tested (P less than 0. 01), while a smaller proportion showed resistance to single (P less than 0. 05) and multiple (P less than 0. 01) antibiotics. More than 80 % of the resistant isolates were resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, or sulfisoxazole. Resistance was greater (P less than 0. 01) for pigs in the finishing unit than for those on pasture. Resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, and tetracycline was greater (P less than 0. 05) for pigs in the finishing unit than {{for those in the}} farrowing house. More isolates from <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> were sensitive to all antimicrobial agents tested (P less than 0. 01). A greater proportion of isolates from pigs in the finishing unit showed resistance to a single antibiotic (P less than 0. 01).

40|$|The EU {{regulations}} for organic farming require outdoor access for pigs, {{as one of}} the main organic principles is to establish sustainable farming systems including harmonious relationships between animals, plants and environment. Outdoor access for pigs provides benefits in terms of animal welfare as pigs are able to express their natural and social behaviour. However, it is still common to keep organic growing pigs indoors with access to outdoor concrete yards. Main reasons for not keeping growing <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> are high nutrient inputs to the free-range area and high feed costs due to an increased energy demand in outdoor pigs. Reasons for the high nutrient loads on free range areas are the not-random excretory behaviour as well as the high input of supplemental feed. The reduction and better distribution of nutrients on the field can be achieved by different strategies. Considering the excretory behaviour and foraging activity of pigs the main focus in this study was to identify suitable environmental friendly paddock management systems for organic growing pigs with high animal welfare standards. For identifying those, an experiment with growing pigs was conducted in Denmark. Within this experiment growing pigs got access to two strategies of land allocation. They got either access to 3 x 12 m of new land right away (allocation strategy 3) or to 1 x 12 m of new land on three days in a row (allocation strategy 1). In combination with new land they got one of the forage crops alfalfa or grass-clover and access to either high or low protein content in the supplemental feed. During the experiment behavioural observations were performed. Rooting, grazing, urinating and defecating were recorded to investigate the effect of management system on the pig’s behaviour. It was shown that pigs are rooting and grazing significantly more often in new land. However, urinating in this study is performed to a significantly lower extent in new land compared to old land. The allocation strategy affects foraging activity and excretory behaviour when the three observation days are regarded separately. From the present study it became clear that paddock management strategies should be based on mobile systems including frequent allocation of new land, e. g. strip grazing or pasture rotations and mobile huts, feeders and drinkers. An interesting approach is to establish mobile paddock systems such as the mobile organic piggery (MOP). Nevertheless, more research in the field of paddock management systems is required. In particular more knowledge on mobile fence systems is necessary to make these systems common on farms...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY An {{interdisciplinary}} research program on organic pig production, EKOPIG, was financed by FORMAS and by SLU. Part IV of EKOPIG {{was carried out}} at SLU-Alnarp and emphasis was on housing systems for organic growing-finishing pigs. In this part, an animal house for organic growing-finishing pigs was built. The planning and construction of the building is described in this report. When planning {{the design of the}} animal house, a number of principles were taken into consideration. Among others, the pigs should be easy to control and monitor. It should also be easy to control feeding and production, to weigh the pigs, and to send them to slaughter. The labour requirement should be minimized by using automatic manure and feeding systems. The building construction should be simple, uninsulated, and self-ventilating, and to a major extent be constructed of locally available wooden material. In addition, dung contact between the animal groups should be avoided [...] The house had room for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed into 8 pens of 16 pigs each (Figure 8). There were two different pen types, of which one had deep straw bedding (Figure 15), and the other had slanted floors and the “straw-flow” system (Figures 12 and 16). The pens were designed according to the EU and KRAV regulations (with or without letting the animals go outside). The total pen area was 1. 5 m 2 per pig inside and 1 m 2 per pig outside on the concrete area. The building was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies at Odarslöv, and had bearing outer walls and framework roof trusses. The animal house was located near the existing manure container (Figures 1 and 2). The concrete floor was poured on location (Figure 3) upon which walls were built up of cavity cement blocks. The sides of the dung channel and the wall towards the animal area were also built of cavity cement blocks (Figure 4). The lower section of the wall was built of lightclinker blocks which were plastered on both sides, and above this section the wall was made of a wooden frame covered with wood panels (Figure 5). The roof consisted of cement fiber plates (Figure 6). There was natural ventilation due to the wooden slats on the walls and an open roof ridge with transparent covering. The roof ridge was furnished with a wind shield and was solid the first 4 m from each gable. The pen with the straw flow system had a lying area which was covered and a floor profile slanting to the dung channel (Figure 16). All the pens were placed in a row with openings towards the north (Figure 13) facing the concrete area and pasturage. An inspection passage was placed along one of the outside walls (Figure 9). The concrete outside lying area had the same design for all of the pens (Figure 14). The floor profile for the pens and concrete areas are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The pigs were fed using an automatic dry feed system (Figure 18) in transverse troughs (Figure 17), and over the troughs water pipes with nose valves were placed so the pigs had the possibility of wetting the feed. Roughage was distributed in containers placed in the concrete area on the stable walls (Figures 19 and 20). The pigs had free access to water via a water cup located in the dung alley (Figure 21). The water installations were protected from frost using an electric heating cable inserted in the water pipes in the animal house. Ordinary straw was used as bedding and it was handled in the form of big bales transported into the house using a tractor with a front loader (Figure 22). The dung from the animal house was managed both as solid and liquid manure. The pens with deep straw bedding were cleaned using a front loader once per batch, and the dung transported to an area for solid dung located near the animal house. The pens which had slanted floors were kept clean via the activity of the animals. Straw was distributed to the lying area and much of the straw carried out to the pen floor. Due to the animals’ activity it ended up in the dung area (10 % slant) {{at the lower end of}} the pen. There it was mixed with the dung and pressed down by the pigs through an opening between the floor and the pen wall (Figure 23). A dung alley/channel with concrete slats connected all the pens (Figure 24), and it was scraped daily using a cable driven scraper (Figure 25). The dung was moved to a pump well and then pumped over to a storage container. The manure was mixed before pumping by pumping it around (Figure 7) the dung channel on the outside area. During the planning phase for the animal house, many calculations for the use of feed, water, straw and as well as the quantities of dung and urine which would be produced were carried out (Table 1) An estimation of the building costs was carried out with the help of the data for cost estimation for farm production buildings obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Table 8). The present calculation was based on the prices for 2002, and the estimated cost for the animal house was 1, 465, 000 SKK, or 11, 450 SKK per pig place. The building area per pig was 3. 9 m 2 including the service areas. The cost of the manure containers and straw storage was not included in this estimation. The size of the pasture areas was calculated and consideration was taken to the recommendations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus loading (Tables 2 – 5) per ha for <b>pigs</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> An estimation was made of the amount of the produced manure which would remain in the house or be on the outside areas. For 4 of the 8 pens (Figure 26) fenced lots were made (Figure 28) which the pigs had access to in the summer months. Special transport alleys (Figure 27) out to these lots were also built to maintain a good longevity for these hard used areas. The pasture lots were established with a wide range of grasses (Table 6) which were completed later with more diverse species (Table 7) ...|$|E

Seven treatments were imposed: 1) fall-born calves put directly into the feedlot on May 7, 1996; 2) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30, 3) fall born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>on</b> May 7 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30; 4) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>on</b> May 7 and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; 5) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>on</b> May 7 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; 6) spring-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>on</b> October 1 and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; and 7) spring-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>on</b> October 1 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to feedlot on October 22. Performance data showed that cattle <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> receiving an ionophore had higher gains than those not receiving an ionophore <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> This trend was reversed in the feedlot period. Yield grades were not greatly influenced by treatment, although quality grades tended to be higher for older cattle and those cattle that were in drylot for a longer period of time...|$|R

The feeding managements were the following: <b>on</b> natural <b>pastures</b> as yearlings and during pregnancy, post-calving period and breeding season; <b>on</b> natural <b>pastures</b> with protein supplement as yearlings and only natural pasture during pregnancy, post-calving and breeding season; <b>on</b> natural <b>pastures</b> as yearlings and during pregnancy and <b>on</b> improved natural <b>pastures</b> (Lolium multiflorum L., Trifolium repens cv.

40|$|This {{progress}} report presents {{the findings of}} {{the first two years of}} a multi-year study. Each year 84 fall-born and 28 spring-born calves of similar genetic background were used to evaluate the incorporation of rotational pasturing systems into cattle finishing programs. The fall-born calves were started on test on May 7, 1996, and May 8, 1997, whereas the spring-born calves were started on test on October 1, 1996, and September 13, 1997. A total of seven treatments were imposed: 1) fall-born calves directly into the feedlot; 2) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30, 1996, and July 29, 1997 in the first and second years, respectively; 3) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> without an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30, 1996 and July 29, 1997, in the first and second years, respectively; 4) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22, 1996, and October 21, 1997, in the first and second years, respectively; 5) fall-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> without an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22, 1996, and October 21, 1997, in the first and second years, respectively; 6) spring-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22, 1996, and October 21, 1997, in the first and second years, respectively; and 7) spring-born calves put <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> without an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22, 1996, and October 21, 1997, in the first and second years, respectively. Cattle receiving an ionophore <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> gained more rapidly; however, cattle without access to an ionophore gained more rapidly in drylot thus negating the advantage obtained <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> Overall daily gains and feed conversions in drylot only, improved with increasing numbers of days fed in drylot; however, this may not be very cost effective. At similar end weights no real differences were observed in yield grades among the treatments; however, for fall-born calves the percentage grading Prime and Choice was higher for cattle fed longer in drylot...|$|R
