5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his <b>public</b> <b>role</b> in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Stone {{began reading}} {{newspaper}} {{reports of a}} controversy raging throughout Massachusetts that some {{referred to as the}} “woman question” – what was woman’s proper role in society; should she assume an active and <b>public</b> <b>role</b> in the reform movements of the day? Developments within that controversy {{over the next several years}} shaped her evolving philosophy on women’s rights.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more <b>public</b> <b>role.</b>|$|E
30|$|The main {{difference}} between the two research questions is that the first brings up different network functions without asking directly about <b>public</b> <b>roles,</b> while the second one is a direct question about the timing of <b>public</b> <b>roles</b> in promoting innovation. To answer these questions, data from participants in five networks has been collected. Since the network cases are in varying life cycle stages and drawn from three different industries, it is of interest to investigate the impact of such differences on the perception of the <b>public</b> actors’ <b>roles.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very <b>public</b> <b>role</b> in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} turning point in Eleanor and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's <b>public</b> <b>role</b> grew, she {{increasingly}} broke from Sara's control. Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose {{to the point that the}} family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which Eleanor and her guests lived when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park. Eleanor herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as waterfall-stream from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. Franklin encouraged Eleanor to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Eleanor held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted her. She was close to Eleanor throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Eleanor began and supported.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her <b>public</b> <b>role.</b> She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E

In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that the chances of a full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between performance barriers and competency, and implementation of an expanded <b>public</b> health <b>role</b> for community pharmacists. METHODS: A validated questionnaire was utilised for this study whereby three variables of the study (performance barriers, competency and <b>public</b> health <b>role)</b> were measured using a 5 -point Likert scale. Three hundred questionnaires were distributed to target respondents of registered community pharmacies in five states (Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak and Penang) in Malaysia. The data were analysed utilising the principles of structural equation modelling. KEY FINDINGS: There were 191 completed and usable responses received, which represented a 66. 7 % response rate. This study showed perceived competency had a direct relationship with delivering a general <b>public</b> health <b>role.</b> A perceived lack of competency was shown to be a barrier to fulfilling a <b>public</b> health <b>role.</b> However, other factors, such as design of premises, IT infrastructure and pay, were not viewed as barriers to carrying out a <b>public</b> health <b>role.</b> CONCLUSION: Perceived competency is an obstacle for community pharmacists to undertake a <b>public</b> health <b>role</b> in Malaysia. Adequate training programmes in pharmaceutical public health have to be put in place to address this concern and this should therefore be a priority...|$|R
