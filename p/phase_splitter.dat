2500|$|The {{name of this}} {{partnership}} {{was changed}} to Musitek, Inc. by 1973 and in January 1974 the final name, Music Man, appeared. Leo Fender {{did not like the}} name Tri-Sonix, so the name evolved under Leo Fender's suggestion to call the new company Music Man. In 1974, the company started producing its first product, an amplifier designed by Leo Fender and Tom Walker called the [...] "Sixty Five". It was a hybrid of tube and solid state technology. The preamps used the then burgeoning solid state [...] "op-amp" [...] integrated circuits embodying traditional Fender preamp time constants and architecture, while the power amps typically featured a Cathode Driven Tube power amp stage, much as were used in the radio broadcast industry in AM Transmitters. There were a few models with a tube <b>phase</b> <b>splitter</b> in them, {{but for the most part}} Music Man amplifiers used the faster responding common Grid, Cathode Coupled drive from a solid state front end that players characterized as [...] "loud as hell". The number of designs rapidly increased. 15 of the 28 pages from 1976 catalogue were dedicated to amplification. In 1975, Fender's legal restriction had expired and after a vote of the board he was named the president of Music Man.|$|E

Note that as shown, the Williamson topology concertina <b>phase</b> <b>splitter</b> is direct coupled (with a resistor) to the input stage. This requires careful design of the input stage since the nominal voltage of the input valve anode will define the operating point of the concertina as well.

We also demonstrate that a proper architecture design, with phase and amplitude modulators, largely increases the constellation size.

50|$|With two {{inputs and}} two outputs, this forms a {{differential}} amplifier stage (Figure 2). The two bases (or grids or gates) are inputs which are differentially amplified (subtracted and multiplied) by the pair; {{they can be}} fed with a differential (balanced) input signal, or one input could be grounded to form a <b>phase</b> <b>splitter</b> circuit.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{constructive}} method to translate small quantum circuits into their optical analogues, using linear components of present-day quantum optics technology only. These optical circuits perform precisely the computation that the quantum circuits are designed for, and {{can thus be}} {{used to test the}} performance of quantum algorithms. The method relies on the representation of several quantum bits by a single photon, and on the implementation of universal quantum gates using simple optical components (beam <b>splitters,</b> <b>phase</b> shifters, etc.). The optical implementation of Brassard et al. ’s teleportation circuit, a non-trivial 3 -bit quantum computation, is presented as an illustration. ...|$|R

50|$|As an {{alternate}} to the long-tail pair, the concertina uses a single triode as a variable resistance within a potential divider formed by Ra and Rk {{either side of}} the valve. The result is that the voltage at the anode swings exactly and opposite to the voltage at the cathode, giving a perfectly balanced phase split. the disadvantage of this stage (cf the differential long-tail pair) {{is that it does not}} give any gain. Using a double triode (typically octal or noval) to form a SET input buffer (giving gain) to then feed a concertina <b>phase</b> <b>splitter</b> is a classic push-pull front end, typically followed by a driver (triode) and (triode or pentode) output stage (in ultra linear in many cases) to form the classic push-pull amplifier circuit.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in a {{push-pull}} {{power amplifier}} using vacuum tubes, the signal {{is most often}} split by a <b>phase</b> <b>splitter</b> (aka phase inverter) stage which produces two signals, one in phase, and the other out of phase, that is, phase inverted. These two complementary signals then drive {{the two halves of}} the first push-pull stage, which may be either the output stage or the driver stage. The other common arrangements for driving a push-pull stage are by using an isolation transformer to produce the split signals, or by using the in-phase half of the first push-pull stage to drive the other half. A common circuit using this last technique is the long-tailed pair, often seen in television sets and oscilloscopes. In solid state electronics all of these techniques can be used, and phase inversion can also be produced by the use of NPN/PNP complementary circuitry, which has no corresponding technique in vacuum tube designs.|$|E
