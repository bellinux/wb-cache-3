40|$|Abstract. Fibrocalculous {{pancreatitis}} diabetes (FCPD), a late {{stage of}} tropical chronic pancreatitis (TCP), {{is classified as}} a secondary cause of diabetes mellitus resulting from <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> The distinctive features of FCPD and TCP are young age at onset, presence of large intraductal pancreatic calculi, and reported mainly in tropical developing countries. Their etiology is still obscure, but the autodigestion due to aberrant intraductal activation of zymogens by trypsin {{is thought to be}} a primary common event. Recently, mutations in SPINK 1 gene encoding a pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor have been reported in association with an increased risk of pancreatitis. We describe a heterozygous mutation, IVS 3 + 2 T>C, of SPINK 1 gene in a young Thai female patient with typical presentation of FCPD.

40|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in PEM {{has been}} a {{frequent}} observation in many past records. The enzyme synthesis by the pancreas {{is affected by the}} nutritional deprivation. This study was designed to determine the pancreatic exocrine function, namely serum amylase, lipase and stool fat in PEM and its types. An important aim was to correlate the defect present to some clinical and biochemical data with special emphasis on the effect of nutritional rehabilitation. The study was a prospective hospital based case and control study. Fifty children with severe Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and fifteen healthy age and sex matched group were enrolled in the study. The cases, including 21 with marasmus, 19 with kwashiorkor (KWO) and 10 with marasmic kwashiorkor (MKWO) were recruited from Gaafar Ibn Auf Specialized Children Hospital. Full history and thorough clinical examination including anthropometric measurements were performed in all cases and controls. Serum amylase, lipase and stool fat were estimated together with other biochemical investigations namely serum albumin and globulin and hemoglobin, on presentation and two weeks later. The mean age of presentation in cases was 18. 88 + 6. 6 months with slight female preponderance (52 %). The bulk of cases were from Western states (58 %). v Illiteracy, inappropriate weaning practices and inadequate nutrition were the major risk factors. The most frequent presenting symptoms were diarrhoea in 88 % and vomiting in 78 % with hair depigmentation (98 %), sparsity (90 %) and pallor (94 %) as major clinical signs. All anthropometric measurements were significantly lower in cases when compared to controls. Regarding pancreatic exocrine function, serum amylase and lipase levels were low in all subtypes of malnutrition, being remarkably low in oedematous cases. The indices improved after nutritional rehabilitation. Hypoalbuminaemia, frequent diarrhoea and oedema were the major determining factors for pancreatic enzyme level. Non survivors had even more declining indices especially for serum amylase. The presence of stool fat in cases augmented pancreatic dysfunction but still could be due to other pathologies. In conclusion, <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in PEM may be an overlooked factor contributing to ongoing malnutrition in Sudanese children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To further define {{clinical}} features {{associated with the}} syndrome of diabetes and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> due to mutations in the carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) gene and to assess the effects of pancreatic enzyme substitution therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Nine patients with CEL gene mutation, exocrine deficiency, and diabetes were treated and followed for 30 months. RESULTS — Treatment improved symptoms in seven of nine patients. Exocrine and endo-crine function assessed by fecal elastase and A 1 C were not affected, although fecal lipid excretion was reduced. Vitamin E was low in all patients but increased with treatment (P 0. 001 at 30 months) and improved in five subjects. A predominantly demyelinating neuropathy was seen in a majority of patients, and carpal tunnel syndrome was common.

We have recently identified a syndrome of diabetes and exocrine pancreas dysfunction due to mutations in the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) gene. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in MODY 3 patients. Research Design and Methods: All 119 MODY 3 patients in the Norwegian MODY Registry were invited to participate, and 70 (60. 5 %) responded, among them 63 adults.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of a pancreatic function test utilizing a synthetic peptide(PFT) and the pancreozymin secretin test (PS test) was performed to evaluate the validity and limitations of PFT. PFT {{was found to be}} less sensitive than the PS test in detecting <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> PFT values were always abnormal when the <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was moderate to severe; i. e., the amylase output 40, 000 units, maximal bicarbonate concentration 70 mEg/l and secretory volume 55 ml. When the pancreatic dysfunction was of a milder degree, PFT values were abnormal only half of the time. Consequently, a normal PFT value does not necessarily rule out pancreatic disease. PFT can give a false positive result in cases of cirrhosis of the liver, irritable bowel syndrome and renal insufficiency. When renal insufficiency is ruled out, a PFT value of less than 65 percent is diagnostic of pancreatic dysfunction. A PFT value of 65 - 70 percent can be obtained in diseases of other organs such as cirrhosis of the liver and irritable bowel syndrome. PFT is not as sensitive as the PS test, but it is a simple and useful <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> function test. It is an especially good screening test for pancreatic diseases...|$|R

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 51 suspected CP patients, who had both secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) and an intraductal secretin stimulation test (IDST). There were 29 patients in normal and 22 patients in the low bicarbonate group. Bicarbonate level, total pancreatic juice volume, and excretory flow rate were recorded during IDST. Signal intensity ratio of pancreas (SIR), fat signal fraction, pancreatograms findings, and grade of duodenal filling were recorded on S-MRCP by two blinded radiologists. Results There was {{a significant difference in the}} signal intensity ratio of the pancreas to spleen (SIRp/s) between the normal and low bicarbonate groups (p < 0. 0001). A significant positive correlation was found between pancreatic fluid bicarbonate level and SIRp/s (p < 0. 0001). SIRp/s of 1. 2 yielded sensitivity of 77 % and specificity of 83 % for detection of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (AUC: 0. 89).

40|$|Carboxyl ester lipase is a {{digestive}} {{pancreatic enzyme}} encoded by the CEL gene. Mutations in CEL cause maturity-onset diabetes {{of the young}} as well as <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Here we describe a hybrid allele (CEL-HYB) originating from a crossover between CEL and its neighboring pseudogene, CELP. In a discovery series of familial chronic pancreatitis cases, we observed CEL-HYB in 14. 1 % (10 / 71) of cases compared to 1. 0 % (5 / 478) of controls (odds ratio (OR) = 15. 5; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5. 1 - 46. 9; P = 1. 3 × 10 - 6 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test). In three replication studies of nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis, we identified CEL-HYB {{in a total of}} 3. 7 % (42 / 1, 122) cases and 0. 7 % (30 / 4, 152) controls (OR = 5. 2; 95 % CI = 3. 2 - 8. 5; P = 1. 2 × 10 - 11; formal meta-analysis). The allele was also enriched in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Expression of CEL-HYB in cellular models showed reduced lipolytic activity, impaired secretion, prominent intracellular accumulation and induced autophagy. These findings implicate a new pathway distinct from the protease-antiprotease system of pancreatic acinar cells in chronic pancreatitis. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{has been}} {{frequently}} recorded in protein-energy malnutrition in underdeveloped countries. In addition, the pancreas requires optimal nutrition for enzyme synthesis and potentially correctable pancreatic enzyme insufficiency {{may play a}} role in the continuation of protein-energy malnutrition. This problem has not been previously evaluated in Australian Aborigines. We have applied a screening test for pancreatic dysfunction (human immunoreactive trypsinogen [IRT] assay) to the study of 398 infants (6 - 36 months) admitted to the Alice Springs Hospital over a 20 -month period. All infants were assessed by anthropometric measures and were assigned to three nutritional groups (normal, moderate or severely malnourished) and two growth groups (stunted or not stunted). Of the 198 infants who had at least a single serum cationic trypsinogen measurement taken, normal values for serum IRT (with confidence limits) were obtained from 57 children, who were normally nourished. IRT levels were significantly correlated with the degree of underweight but there was no correlation with the degree of stunting or age. Mean IRT levels for the moderate and severely underweight groups were significantly greater than the mean for the normal group (P < 0. 01). Seventeen children (8. 6 %) had trypsinogen levels in excess of the 95 th percentile for the normally nourished group, reflecting acinar cell damage or ductal obstruction.

40|$|In fibrocalculous {{pancreatic}} diabetes (FCPD), {{manifestations of}} <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> deficiency are variable and clinical presentation with steatorrhoea is uncommon. However objective tests of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> functions are generally abnormal in FCPD, which represents a late {{stage of the}} disease. Though {{considered to be the}} gold standard, direct pancreatic function tests such as secretin-pancreozymin (CCK) test and Lundh meal test are time consuming, invasive, expensive and hence beyond the reach of non-specialized centers. Stool fat estimation is cumbersome and difficult to set up and perform routinely. Most of the centers now perform simple tests such as faecal chymotrypsin. Fecal elastase is being more commonly used in many centers. Though this is very specific, it is sensitive only in advanced stages of the disease. With the wide availability of imaging of the pancreas by ultrasound, computerized tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and magnetic resonance pancreatography, early and noncalcific stages of the disease can be diagnosed with reasonable certainty.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} disease severity and necrosis on organ dysfunctions in acute pancreatitis (AP). METHODS: One hundred and nine patients treated as AP between March 2003 and September 2007 with at least 6 mo follow-up were included. Patients were classified according to severity of the disease, necrosis ratio and localization. Subjective clinical evaluation and fecal pancreatic elastase-I (FPE-I) were used for <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> evaluation, and oral glucose tolerance test was completed for endocrine dysfunction. The correlation of disease severity, necrosis ratio and localization with <b>exocrine</b> and endocrine <b>dysfunction</b> were investigated. RESULTS: There were 58 male and 51 female patients, and mean age was 56. 5 1; 15. 7. Of the patients, 35. 8 % had severe AP (SAP) and 27. 5 % had <b>pancreatic</b> necrosis. <b>Exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was identified in 13. 7 % of the patients [17. 9 % were in SAP, 11. 4 % were in mild AP (MAP) ] and 34. 7 % {{of all of the}} patients had endocrine dysfunction (56. 4 % in SAP and 23. 2 % in MAP). In patients with SAP and necrotizing AP (NAP), FPE-Ilevels were lower than the others (P < 0. 05 and 0. 001 respectively) and in patients having pancreatic head necrosis or near total necrosis, FPE- 1 levels were lower than 200 &#x 3 BC;g/g stool.

METHODS: Twenty-one piglets underwent pancreatic duct ligation and subsequent longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy after 3 weeks (early drainage) or 6 weeks (late drainage), and drainage continued for 6 weeks. In controls with CP pancreatic duct ligation was continued for 12 weeks without a drainage procedure. RESULTS: Histological pancreatitis scores decreased with early drainage (P = 0. 005), but not with late drainage. Pancreatic secretion of amylase and lipase was restored after early but not late drainage (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 048 respectively).

40|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} functions {{by means}} of pancreozymin secretin test were investigated in 21 human control subjects and in 30 patients with diabetes mellitus. Next exocrine pancreatic function with pancreozymin or secretin loading test and changes of insulin and glucagon levels were studied in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Significant decreases of volume, maximal bicarborate concentration and amylase output of pancreatic juice were observed in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. 2. These decreases were not related to sex, the age, and the conditions of diabetic control, duration and complications of diabetes mellitus. 3. Administration of insulin was {{closely related to the}} amelioration of amylase output, indicating that insulin would accelerate the synthesis or the secretion of the pancreatic amylase. 4. A remarkable and significant decrease of amylase output was observed in diabetic rats. An improvement of amylase output was achieved by the administration of insulin. 5. A moderate decrease of immunoreactive insulin (I) level was indicated in diabetic rats, however, immunoreactive glucagon (G) level revealed no changes. The molar ratio in G/I was higher in diabetic rats than in control rats. A significant elevation of glucagon level, on the other hand, was shown after intravenous injection of arginine to diabetic rats. In conclusion, the most important factor of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in diabetes mellitus was attributed to a lack of insulin action and a concomitant elevation of glucagon.

40|$|Background: {{neonatal}} {{diabetes mellitus}} (NDM), {{is a rare}} form of monogenic diabetes, and usually presents in the first 6 months of life. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and molecular genetics of a large Turkish cohort of NDM patients from a single centre and estimate an annual incidence rate of NDM in South-Eastern Anatolian region of Turkey. Design and Methods: NDM patients presenting to Diyarbakir Children State Hospital between 2010 and 2013, and patients under follow up with presumed type 1 diabetes mellitus, with onset before 6 months of age were recruited. Molecular genetic analysis performed. Results: twenty-two patients(59 % males) were diagnosed with NDM(TNDM- 5;PNDM- 17). Molecular genetic analysis identified a mutation in 20 (95 %) patients who a mutation analysis was undertaken. In TNDM patients, the genetic cause included chromosome 6 q 24 abnormalities(n= 3), ABCC 8 (n= 1) and homozygous INS(n= 1). In PNDM patients, homozygous GCK(n= 6), EIF 2 AK 3 (n= 3), PTF 1 A(n= 3), and INS(n= 1) and heterozygous KCNJ 11 (n= 2) mutations were identified. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was observed in patients with mutations in the distal PTF 1 A enhancer.

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{mechanism}} of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in diabetes mellitus were evaluated in vitro using isolated pancreatic acini prepared from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The content of amylase and ribonuclease in diabetic acini was ∼ 0. 5 and 50 % of the normal content, respectively. Further, reduced amounts of both enzymes were secreted by diabetic acini in response to both cholecystokinin (CCK) and carbamylcholine. However, when enzyme secretion was normalized relative to initial acinar contents, both normal and diabetic acini released enzymes at a comparable maximal rate. The time course of the release of these enzymes, and newly synthesized protein were similar in both acini. In normal acini, the effect of CCK was maximal at a concentration of 100 pM; higher concentrations led to submaximal enzyme release. The dose-response curve in diabetic acini was similarly shaped, but shifted three-fold towards higher concentration. The mobilization of cellular Ca 2 + in response to CCK was also shifted. In contrast to these results with CCK, the dose-response curve to carbamylcholine was unaltered by diabetes. The observed effects were confirmed {{to be due to}} insulin deficiency and not due to direct toxic effect of streptozotocin on acinar cells or malnutrition. Streptozotocin had no acute effect on acini when measured 24 h after administration, and alloxan, another beta cell toxin, induced similar changes in acinar enzyme content and secretory response. Moreover, the administration of exogenous insulin to diabetic rats returned the content of pancreatic amylase and the secretory response to CCK towards normal. Starvation for 48 h, although inducing a significant weight loss, did not mimic the effects of diabetes. The present studies demonstrate two major abnormalities in pancreatic exocrine secretion in the diabetic rat: (a) the content of certain digestive enzymes is markedly altered, leading to an altered amount of zymogen secretion, (b) the sensitivity to CCK is selectively reduced, most likely related to a defect in receptor activated transmembrane signaling...|$|E
40|$|A causal {{relation}} between infection with mumps virus and <b>pancreatic</b> endocrine and <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{is suggested by}} the occurrence of severe diabetic ketoacidosis and serum pancreatic amylase elevation in a patient with a significantly elevated mumps antigen titer. Sequential studies of beta cell secretion in the presence of exogenous insulin and insulin antibodies was accomplished by monitoring levels of C-peptide immunoreactivity. Secretion of proinsulin, C-peptide, and, presumably, insulin resumed after the acute episode and was associated with complete recovery of carbohydrate tolerance and cessation of insulin therapy. Serum amylase levels were persistently elevated, and a macroamylase was shown in the serum. However, the amylase released from the macroamylase complex by acidification presented different patterns at various stages of the patient's illness. Pancreatic-type amylase predominated during the acute phase, whereas the distribution of pancreatic-type and salivary-type amylase was essentially normal in samples taken several months later. DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS is commonly precipitated by infection, trauma, stress, or drugs in patients with genetically determined diminished beta cell reserve. These conditions are associated with peripheral in-sulin resistance, and enhanced insulin secretion is necessary to maintain euglycemia. If the beta cells are unable to meet this increased demand for insulin, hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis may result. Notwith-standing these generalizations, there are many cases of ketoacidosis where no precipitating factors are identified and a family history is negative. One fac-tor that may be operative in such cases is an infec-tious agent, such as mumps virus. Ketoacidosis de-veloping in this setting has been noted in children (1, 2), but no comparable situation in adults has been described.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: As {{the major}} {{metabolic}} complications of chronic pancreatitis are <b>exocrine</b> and endocrine <b>dysfunction,</b> leading to malabsorption and diabetes, {{the aims of}} this study were to screen patients with chronic pancreatitis for <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> to correlate the prevalence of such dysfunction with the etiology and severity of pancreatitis, and to evaluate the effect of dysfunction on weight loss. METHODS: Sixty patients were studied. In 44 patients, pancreatitis was alcoholic, and in 16, idiopathic. Patients' age, sex, alcohol consumption and smoking habits, duration of the disease, body mass index, and the presence of steatorrhea were recorded. The severity of pancreatitis was assessed by imaging procedures, including secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and patients were classified according to the Cambridge system. Exocrine function was evaluated by the triolein breath test and acid steatocrit. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between breath test and steatocrit values. As a screening test for <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> the sensitivity of clinical steatorrhea was insufficient (38 %). Of the 60 patients, 38 (63 %) developed <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> within 5 yr of the onset of the pancreatitis and 56 (94 %) after 10 yr. Moreover, undetected or untreated malabsorption had a harmful effect on weight, {{even in the absence of}} overt clinical steatorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: To avoid nutritional deterioration, early screening for fat malabsorption should be recommended in chronic pancreatitis, whatever its etiology, using the acid steatocrit, a reliable, easy, and inexpensive test.

Aims: In the present study we wanted to evaluate two novel methods for measuring <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> function; a rapid endoscopic secretin test and a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based protocol. We further wanted to use these two methods to assess the degree and nature of <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in CELMODY and HNF 1 B-MODY. Materials and methods: We recruited 52 consecutive patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis, 23 patients with CEL-MODY and 8 patients with HNF 1 B-MODY. Suspected chronic pancreatitis patients underwent the endoscopic procedure only, while MODY patients were offered endoscopy and MRI procedure. In addition, 25 healthy controls underwent endoscopy and 20 healthy controls underwent the MRI protocol. In patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis, a renowned multimodal clinical score was used as reference standard. In MODY patients results from the examinations were compared to nutritional status as achieved from patient records before any treatment with pancreatic enzyme supplements. The endoscopic procedure started 30 minutes after secretin stimulation, with 15 minutes collection of duodenal juice. Duodenal juice was analyzed for bicarbonate in chronic pancreatitis patients, and for bicarbonate and digestive enzyme activities in MODY-patients and healthy controls. The MRI protocol consisted of anatomical imaging, followed by dynamic imaging before and after secretin stimulation. The dynamic series consisted of repeated duodenal fluid volume quantification with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) and measuring apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in pancreatic tissue using diffusion-weighted imaging. Results: Using bicarbonate as diagnostic marker, the rapid endoscopic secretin test had acceptable diagnostic value in detecting chronic pancreatitis, and performed significantly better than fecal elastase 1. In healthy controls, increase in secretin stimulated duodenal fluid volumes correlated well with changes in ADC after secretin stimulation. In CEL-MODY patients we found moderately low bicarbonate levels and reduced pancreatic fluid output, and severely reduced digestive enzyme activity levels compared to controls. With exception from low levels of vitamin E, CEL-MODY patients revealed no signs of malnutrition. In HNF 1 B-MODY patients we found moderately reduced bicarbonate levels, reduced pancreatic fluid output and moderately reduced levels of digestive enzyme activities compared to controls. Pancreatic gland volumes were small in all but one HNF 1 B-MODY patients, but pancreatic volume output per gland size was increased. Conclusions: Both rapid endoscopic secretin test and the MRI protocol are feasible and well tolerated examination modalities reflecting <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> function. CEL-MODY patients have moderately reduced ductal and severely reduced acinar pancreatic function, but compensated nutritional status. HNF 1 B-MODY patients have moderately reduced ductal and acinar pancreatic function, partly compensated by hypersecretion from a hypoplastic pancreas. </p...|$|R

Gov'tThis is an {{open access}} article {{available}} at [URL] Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes and usually presents in the first 6 months of life. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and molecular genetics of a large Turkish cohort of NDM patients from a single centre and estimate an annual incidence rate of NDM in South-Eastern Anatolian region of Turkey. DESIGN AND METHODS: NDM patients presenting to Diyarbakir Children State Hospital between 2010 and 2013, and patients under follow-up with presumed type 1 diabetes mellitus, with onset before 6 months of age were recruited. Molecular genetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (59 % males) were diagnosed with NDM (TNDM- 5; PNDM- 17). Molecular genetic analysis identified a mutation in 20 (95 %) patients who had undergone a mutation analysis. In transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM) patients, the genetic cause included chromosome 6 q 24 abnormalities (n= 3), ABCC 8 (n= 1) and homozygous INS (n= 1). In permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) patients, homozygous GCK (n= 6), EIF 2 AK 3 (n= 3), PTF 1 A (n= 3), and INS (n= 1) and heterozygous KCNJ 11 (n= 2) mutations were identified. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was observed in patients with mutations in the distal PTF 1 A enhancer. Both patients with a KCNJ 11 mutation responded to oral sulphonylurea. A variable phenotype {{was associated with the}} homozygous c. - 331 C>A INS mutation, which was identified in both a PNDM and TNDM patient. The annual incidence of PNDM in South-East Anatolian region of Turkey was one in 48   000 live births. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous mutations in GCK, EIF 2 AK 3 and the distal enhancer region of PTF 1 A were the commonest causes of NDM in our cohort. The high rate of detection of a mutation likely reflects the contribution of new genetic techniques (targeted next-generation sequencing) and increased consanguinity within our cohort. The genetic testing was funded by the Wellcome Trust (Senior Investigator Award to Profs S Ellard and A T Hattersley), and by Diabetes UK (Project funding to Dr D J Mackay). H Demirbilek was funded by European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for his 1 year clinical fellowship at University College London (UCL), Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Trust, Department of Paediatric Endocrinology...|$|E
40|$|Exocrine and {{endocrine}} {{pancreatic disease}} is often observed to occur together. The close colocalization of the endocrine and exocrine tissues within one organ, {{as well as}} their common embryological ancestry, have given rise to hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of such diseases. However, often two questions remain: Which cell type is the origin of the disease? And what is the fundamental pathological process? Principally, there are three possible sites of action in combined exocrine and endocrine pancreatic disease: The exocrine cells, the endocrine cells, or the common progenitor cells. In order to investigate the association between exocrine function and diabetes further, we studied exocrine and endocrine function as well as pancreatic structure in three different contexts: HNF 1 A-MODY, HNF 1 B-MODY and CEL-MODY. Exocrine dysfunction and a striking association with pancreatic atrophy have been reported in HNF 1 B mutation carriers. Mouse studies have revealed an essential function of Hnf 1 b in pancreatic development and mouse embryos deficient of Hnf 1 b exhibit a rudimentary dorsal pancreatic bud. In Paper III, we describe exocrine dysfunction and absence of tissue corresponding to the pancreatic body and tail as evaluated by CT and MRCP in five individuals from two families with HNF 1 B mutations. Our observations strengthen the evidence for a critical role of HNF 1 B in the normal development and differentiation of the pancreas and support the notion that HNF 1 B mutations cause diabetes and exocrine dysfunction based on congenital malformation. HNF 1 A and HNF 1 B encode closely related transcription factors, and a similar phenotype for exocrine dysfunction and pancreas structure could be expected. Furthermore, exocrine dysfunction has been observed in 10 - 30 % of type 1 and 2 diabetes patients, and reduced pancreatic volume has been well described in type 1 diabetes and to some degree in type 2 diabetes. In Paper I we describe {{for the first time the}} prevalence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in a cohort of patients with HNF 1 A-MODY. The data in Paper I indicate that 13 % of adult HNF 1 A-MODY patients had exocrine dysfunction. This was similar to results from the type 1 diabetes control group (19 %) and in line with previous findings in type 1 and 2 diabetic patients, but three times higher than that in nondiabetic controls (4 %). The strong association between endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions as that observed in HNF 1 BMODY was not paralleled in HNF 1 A-MODY. In Paper II, we showed that HNF 1 A-MODY patients had reduced pancreatic volume compared to non-diabetic controls, mimicking the pancreatic volume reduction in type 1 diabetes. Taken together, the findings in Papers I and II indicate that the prevalence of exocrine dysfunction and the structural changes of the pancreas in HNF 1 A-MODY are different from that characterizing HNF 1 B-MODY, but similar to that observed in type 1 diabetes, and likely due to insulinopenia. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>exocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> as expressed by fecal elastase deficiency in subjects with diabetes has been claimed to be moderate and clinically irrelevant. This is contradicted by our finding of pathologically high fat excretion in all of the available six patients with fecal elastase deficiency and HNF 1 A-MODY, 14 out of 17 type 1 diabetes subjects, one of three available type 2 diabetes subjects (Papers I and II), and in seven out of nine subjects with CEL-MODY (Paper IV). Our results support previous observations of a high prevalence of steatorrhea in subjects with diabetes and fecal elastase deficiency. All of our CEL-MODY patients had pathologically low vitamin E levels. Osteopenia or osteoporosis was frequently found, possibly as sequela of undiagnosed exocrine dysfunction. Pancreatic enzyme supplements constitute the main treatment of maldigestion in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but the effect on glycemic control in the presence of diabetes has been debated. We studied the effects of enzyme replacement therapy in nine subjects with diabetes and exocrine dysfunction due to mutations in the carboxyl-ester lipase gene (CEL). They experienced immediate alleviation of symptoms, fecal fat excretion was reduced, and vitamin E levels increased. We found no effect of pancreatic enzyme supplements on glycemic control, suggesting that such treatment is safe in a context of diabetes. CEL-MODY is a syndrome of monogenic diabetes and pancreatic dysfunction due to CEL mutations. Diabetes is believed to arise secondary to exocrine dysfunction in CEL-MODY, but the pathogenetic processes are unclear. Investigating a loss-of-function mechanism, we studied the global knockout model (CELKO; Paper V). Female CELKO mice developed mild random fed hyperglycemia and islet hyperplasia; however, no clear phenotype resembling CEL-MODY was demonstrated. In order to explore the hypothesis that disease develop due to an altered cellular function of the mutant protein, we created and studied the TgCEL mouse line expressing the Del 1 disease-associated human CEL allele (Paper VI). The mice did not exhibit any endocrine or exocrine dysfunction, however. Further studies remain to be done, particularly to explore the effects of mutant human CEL in a transgenic mouse line...|$|E
40|$|The exocrine {{pancreas}} is functionally immature at birth. Protease {{function is}} probably adequate, but lipase activity approximates 5 % to 10 % of adult {{values in the}} newborn and remains low in infancy. Pancreatic amylase secretion is essentially absent at birth and remains low through {{the first years of}} life. Functional disturbances of the exocrine pancreas are less frequent in childhood than in adult life. Causes of pancreatic dysfunction in childhood can be divided in two general categories: hereditary conditions, which directly affect the pancreas; and acquired disorders, in which loss of pancreatic function is a secondary phenomenon. Most inherited causes of pancreatic dysfunction are due to a generalized disorder. Cystic fibrosis is, by far, the most common inherited cause of disturbed pancreatic function among Caucasian children. All other inherited causes of <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (eg, Johanson-Blizzard syndrome) are uncommon or rare...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> function test employing a new synthetic peptide, N-Benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (BT-PABA), studies were performed on 18 control subjects, 14 patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis and 32 patients with chronic pancreatitis, comparing three oral doses: 0. 5 g BT-PABA, 1. 0 g BT-PABA and combined use of 0. 5 g BT-PABA and 50 g of test meal (Sustagen). Patients with chronic pancreatitis showed signigicantly lower PFD values than control subjects regardless of the dose. Administration of 0. 5 g BT-PABA gave not only the best result in detecting <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> but also the highest correlation with the results of the PS test, followed by the 1. 0 g BT-PABA administration and then by the combined use of 0. 5 g BT-PABA and 50 g Sustagen. The highest correlation coefficient was noted between the first two methods, whereas only a poor correlation was noted between the combined method and the other two methods. No improvement in sensitivity was attained by administering 1. 0 g BT-PABA or 0. 5 g BT-PABA in combination with test meal...|$|R
50|$|Initially, the {{clinical}} presentation of SDS may appear similar to cystic fibrosis. However, CF can be excluded with a normal chloride in sweat test but faecal elastase as a marker of pancreatic function will be reduced. The variation, intermittent nature, and potential for long-term improvement of some clinical features make this syndrome difficult to diagnose. SDS may present with either malabsorption, or hematological problems. Rarely, SDS may present with skeletal defects, including severe rib cage abnormalities that lead to difficulty in breathing. Diagnosis is generally based on evidence of <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and neutropenia. Skeletal abnormalities and short stature are characteristics {{that can be used}} to support the diagnosis. The gene responsible for the disease has been identified and genetic testing is now available. Though useful in diagnostics, a genetic test does not surmount the need for careful clinical assessment and monitoring of all patients.|$|R
40|$|AIMS: In chronic calcific {{pancreatitis}} of the tropics, etiology {{and relationship}} to developing diabetes mellitus are unknown. Some consider these cases a straightforward secondary type of diabetes, while others suggest selective beta-cell impairment. Testing pancreatic function, we investigated whether selective beta-cell impairment triggers diabetes associated with tropical pancreatitis. METHODS: At a Bangladeshi research institute, 8 chronic tropical pancreatitis and no diabetes mellitus subjects, 14 fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetics and 27 matched healthy controls underwent arginine (endocrine pancreatic function) and secretin (<b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> function assessment) stimulation tests. RESULTS: All patients with clinically-diagnosed, chronic pancreatitis demonstrated pronounced <b>exocrine</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>dysfunction</b> with beta-cell functioning differing significantly {{between the two}} groups. Compared to controls, patients having tropical pancreatitis and no diabetes showed normal plasma C-peptide values at baseline and after arginine stimulation, while fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetics demonstrated a typical diabetic pattern for plasma C-peptide levels. In contrast, pancreatic alpha-cell functioning (glucagon response to arginine) was preserved in both pancreatitis groups. CONCLUSION: A preserved pancreatic alpha-cell function in diabetics with advanced chronic pancreatitis of the tropics supports the concept of two different pathogenic mechanisms, one eliciting chronic pancreatitis and the other selective pancreatic beta-cell impairment and subsequent diabetes mellitus...|$|R
