40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{economic}} loss rule states that a plaintiff cannot recover damages for a <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss.</b> The comparative study of the pure {{economic loss}} rule reveals that in different jurisdictions, the legal definitions of the rule frequently lump together diverse situations. The actual significance {{of the notion of}} “economic loss ” varies considerably across Western legal systems. Legal doctrines provide little insight as to why liability should, or should not, be denied. On the other hand, economic models of liability provide some valuable guidance for classifying different categories of economic loss, and identifying cases in which denial of recovery for economic loss would lead to inefficient outcomes. A law and economics analysis shows that a key factor in determining the optimal scope of the {{economic loss rule}} is in the relationship between pure economic loss and social loss. Economic loss should be compensable in torts {{only to the extent that}} it corresponds to socially relevant loss. After identifying several factual categories, this paper characterizes the optimal level of liability with reference to the relevant economic and social loss components and the resulting optimal incentives to reduce risk. In a few situations, the application of the optimal liability rule finds obstacles in entrenched principles of civil liability. Generally, however, the legal applications of the economic loss rule are consistent with the ideal liability rule identified by the economic model. As generally understood in the law and economics literature, the economic loss rule states that a plaintiff cannot recover damages for a <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss.</b> The comparative study of the pure economic loss rule reveals that the recognition and significance attributed to such rule and to the notion...|$|E
40|$|Though its seeds {{may have}} been planted long before, the {{economic}} loss rule in products liability tort law emerged in full force {{at the very same}} moment as the doctrine of strict products liability in the mid- 1960 s. This moment, fueled by the fall of privity and the rise of implied warranty earlier in the century, was of great doctrinal import — a moment when strict liability threatened to erase altogether the boundary between tort and contract in the context of defective products cases and move those cases firmly into the tort realm. The economic loss rule emerged as a crucial new levee against a flood of potentially limitless tort liability. It forged a new dividing line, keeping cases involving <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>losses</b> within the domain of con-tract by denying recovery for such losses under any theory of tort. Seen in this light, the economic loss rule emerged to protect the “remains” of the citadel of privity. William Prosser, so intently focused on the dramatic siege on the citadel of privity, overlooked a few, highly significant cases, where courts continued to require privity in order for the plaintiff to recover for negligently inflicted economic losses by defective products. Over the two decades that followed Prosser’s The Fall of the Citadel, the debate over the economic loss rule in products cases continued to unfold, culminating in the U. S. Supreme Court’s embrace in East River Steamship. That case ensured the economic loss rule would keep contract from “drowning in a sea of tort” and that the wall between the “separate spheres” of tort and contract law could not be breached. After an exploration of the evolution of, and rationales for, the economic loss rule in products cases, this Article examines whether the citadel’s last bastion should be preserved. It con-cludes that the economic loss rule in products cases may be best justified as a means to induce the putative victims — here, the parties with superior information regarding risk of <b>financial</b> <b>loss</b> — to protect themselves...|$|R

40|$|A wrong audit {{can cause}} damages to shareholders. This happens {{especially}} if outside shareholders base their investment {{decision on the}} audit and buy overpriced company shares. If such damages are recoverable under an implied contract between auditor and shareholder, the auditor is usually liable for simple negligence. In that case he has negligently violated a contractual duty to the shareholder, even though the explicit contract was {{between him and the}} corporation. If however these damages are only recoverable under tort law, simple negligence will not lead to compensation because they are pure economic losses and because most legal orders restrict or exclude liability for pure economic loss. For such damages, most legal orders grant compensation under tort law only if it is proven that the tortfeasor was willful, disloyal, reckless or grossly negligent. In most cases this excludes compensation. The economic literature on civil liability for economic loss has underlined the rationale for such restrictions. However, this literature remains silent with respect to the borderline between contract law and tort law. There is a general agreement that pure economic loss has to be compensated under contract law as the cost of this protection is internalized in the contract. If a wrong audit and a wrong and published balance sheet causes a <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss</b> to a shareholder, should this be regarded as a violation of contractual duties between the auditor and the shareholder, or just as a tort? Obviously, in most cases this question is decisive for whether the plaintiff receives compensation or not. We argue that this question should be answered in the affirmative, if the victim has an ex-ante willingness to pay for the costs associated with performing such a duty. In this article we argue that a wrong audit that causes damages to shareholders should generally be strictly regarded as a tort case. We also argue that a rule of gross negligence or of gross violation of professional standards in tort law can avoid the problems of underdeterrence as well as of overdeterrence in the compensation of <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss</b> in tort. However, we also argue that a wrong audit should lead to contractual liability, if it was made to prepare the sale of a company or parts of it from inside investors to outside investors or to prepare an initial public offering. Under this condition we argue that the economic rationale for restricting compensation for <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss</b> is not given. The paper first analyses the social value of an audit. Then several liability rules with precise and vague levels of professional care are treated with respect to their incentive effects. This leads to the proposal of a rule of gross negligence in tort law. In the last part we analyse the special conditions, under which the legal order should assume a contract with protective consequences for buyers of company shares, which leads to liability for simple negligence. The legal form of a contract with protective consequences for third parties (Vertrag mit Schutzwirkung für Dritte) is borrowed from German dogmatic scholarship, but may be interesting in this respect for an international audience as well. This article draws from the literature on pure financial losses and from the literature on precise and vague negligence norms {{as well as from the}} literature on the tort contract boundary. The article does however not discuss the problem of joint and several liability and the strategic problems involved, which have been broadly discussed in the literature. The victim of a wrong audit might have a claim against the inside investor, the management, the firm and/or the auditor. This causes strategic interactions, which influence the level of care of all actors as well as the price of auditing. These problems have been extensively dealt with in the literature and are left out here completely. The focus is exclusively on the question, under which conditions the victim should be highly protected by contract law or get a lower level of protection under tort law. ...|$|E
40|$|The fear {{of crime}} {{is one of the}} most widely {{researched}} phenomena in criminology. Traditionally, researchers have relied upon the 'sociological staples' of sex, race, age and social class to explain the {{fear of crime}}. However, it has been shown that the relationships between fear and these factors are both uncertain and unreliable. In this thesis, I suggest by analysing the fear of crime within an explanatory framework of well-being, we move towards a better understanding of fear at an individual level. I demonstrate that, by interpreting crime as a violation of autonomy and well-being, individual levels of fear are more easily understood. The thesis is driven by a critical analysis of the traditional approaches to the study of fear of crime. From a contextual perspective, I argue that, in order to understand fear in a modem, evolving society, one must look to the future and explore the changing nature of crime. Thus, I aim to force a reconsideration of the concept of 'crime' within the paradigm of the victimisation survey. In recognising the imminent increase in fraudulent crimes, I challenge the traditional exclusion of fraud from victimisation surveys. I demonstrate that the victims of plastic card fraud are worthy subjects for study. The thesis is informed by empirical work carried out during the period of doctoral research. Having been commissioned by the Research Development and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office to review the survey measurement of the fear of crime, I was given the opportunity to design questions about plastic card fraud for the British Crime Survey 2000. Analysis of the data suggests that plastic card fraud prompts different reactions than do other crimes. I conclude that the harm suffered by the victims of card fraud may extend beyond <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss</b> to a violation of identity...|$|E
40|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, a {{prospectus}} aims to ensure investors that they are provided with reliable information about the securities which they are invited to purchase. Two mechanisms exist to enforce the publication of reliable information in the prospectus: the public enforcement mechanism and civil liability claims. The liability of issuers and its directors for the prospectus {{is an example of}} the latter. Given the international nature of the securities market, the question has to be answered which law is applicable to a prospectus liability claim? The Rome II Regulation provides from 11 January 2009 the rules to decide which law applies to claims arising from non-contractual obligations. From the above analysis it is clear that the Rome II Regulation is applicable to prospectus liability claims against the issuing company and its directors or officers, which are brought before a Member State court by investors. Consequently the law applicable to this prospectus liability claim is the law of the country in which the damage occurs: the lex loci damni. The country in which the damage occurs has to be determined in accordance with the respective case-law of the ECJ on the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and its predecessor. The damage arising from false or incomplete information in the prospectus is a <b>pure</b> <b>financial</b> <b>loss.</b> According to the ECJ in Kronhoferthe place where the investor holds his investment account is the place where the direct financial loss is sustained by the investor. Given the universal scope of application of the Rome II Regulation as laid down in Article 3, investors holding an investment account outside the European Union may bring proceedings against the issuer and its directors before a court in a Member State and have their domestic prospectus liability laws applied. Since the securities market has internationalised, issuers and its directors may be confronted with many laws applicable to liability claims arising from the issue of securities through the publication of a prospectus. In my opinion this outcome is not desirable and impedes the objective of the PD 2003 to achieve an internal market for capital by granting a single passport to issuers. I have therefore recommended that the European Commission should either use its power to lay down a proposal to amend the Rome II Regulation, or adopt a Directive which harmonises the national laws with respect to the civil responsibility of the issuing company and its directors. With respect to the adaptation of the Rome II Regulation, I propose a new provision which stipulates that the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false and/or incomplete information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market where the actual transaction took place. When securities are not admitted to trading the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the prospectus is published (the place where the event giving rise to liability in tort occurred). If the Rome II Regulation is amended so as to achieve the aforementioned result, I could adhere to the proverb: ‘all roads lead to Rome’...|$|E
