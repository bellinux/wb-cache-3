25|$|Protein {{purification}} {{is either}} preparative or analytical. Preparative purifications aim {{to produce a}} relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes (e.g. lactase), nutritional proteins (e.g. soy <b>protein</b> <b>isolate),</b> and certain biopharmaceuticals (e.g. insulin). Analytical purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein {{for a variety of}} research or analytical purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the protein's structure, post-translational modifications and function.

2500|$|Protein {{purification}} is {{a series}} of processes intended to isolate one or a few proteins from a complex mixture, usually cells, tissues or whole organisms. [...] Protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The purification process may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and biological activity.

The <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> were subjected to tryptic hydrolysis at various time intervals, {{and the effect of}} hydrolysis on the functional properties of the <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> was studied, using bovine casein as control. Reversed phase HPLC with UV detection was used to generate peptide maps of the tryptic hydrolysates, and electrospray mass spectrometry was used to characterize the peptide profile of the protein hydrolysates. There was no difference between the susceptibility of the crystalline and amorphous <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> to tryptic hydrolysis, however, the hydrolytic products of the crystalline isolates showed higher solubility and functional properties compared with those of the amorphous isolates. Limited hydrolysis markedly improved the functional properties of both crystalline and amorphous <b>protein</b> <b>isolates.</b> The effect of hydrolysis on the functionality of the bean <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> was higher compared with casein. In general the hydrolysates of the bean <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> showed higher functional properties than casein and its hydrolysates. Reversed phase HPLC peptide mapping of the tryptic digests and ESI/MS of the RP-HPLC fractions showed structural and compositional difference between crystalline and amorphous <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> prepared from the same bean variety.

In the first study, flour, starch and <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> from six chickpea cultivars (three Kabuli and three Desi) from two harvests (2005 and 2006) were evaluated for their physico-chemical, functional and thermal properties. Chickpea flour was made by grinding seed to pass through a 0. 1 mm screen, whereas <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> and starch were prepared by a wet milling process. <b>Protein</b> <b>isolates</b> were prepared from chickpea flour (23. 2 % protein on average) by alkaline extraction (pH 8. 0) and isoelectric precipitation (pH 4. 3). <b>Protein</b> <b>isolates</b> contained 72. 8 - 85. 3 % protein; the starch fraction contained 93. 0 - 98. 0 % starch. On SDS-PAGE, the chickpea flours and <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> contained similar polypeptide bands in the range of 30 to 55 kDa, with three major bands at approximately 50 - 55, 40 and 30 kDa. Least gelation concentration (LGC) for chickpea flours ranged from 6 - 14 %; LGC for chickpea <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> ranged from 10 - 14 %. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of chickpea flour slurries revealed two endothermic peaks. One corresponded to starch gelatinization at approximately 64 °C, which was slightly higher than for the starch fraction (~ 60 °C). The second broad peak at approximately 96 °C corresponded to the denaturation of the globulin protein fraction, which was also slightly higher than for the <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> (~ 91 °C). Chickpea flour exhibited nitrogen solubility index values higher than those of chickpea <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> and soy and pea <b>protein</b> <b>isolates.</b> Chickpea <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> exhibited water holding capacities, oil absorption capacities, emulsion activity indeces and emulsion stability indeces higher than those of the chickpea flours.

Pretreatment of suspensions of <b>protein</b> <b>isolates</b> at 60, 90 and 120 °C for 30 min led to protein denaturation and aggregation, which was enhanced at higher treatment temperatures. The in vitro gastric digestibility measured during 6 h was lower for protein extracts pre-treated at 90 and 120 °C compared to 60 °C.
