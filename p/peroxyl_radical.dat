40|$|Coumarins are {{secondary}} metabolites {{that are}} widely distributed within the plant kingdom, {{some of which}} have been extensively studied for their antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activity of coumarins assayed {{in the present study was}} measured by different methods, namely the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH•) method, cyclic voltammetry and the antioxidant capacity against <b>peroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> (ACAP) method. The 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin (LaSOM 78), 5 -carboxy- 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin (LaSOM 79), and 6, 7 -dihydroxycoumarin (Esculetin) compounds proved to be the most active, showing the highest capacity to deplete the DPPH radicals, the highest antioxidant capacity against <b>peroxyl</b> <b>radicals,</b> and the lowest values of potential oxidation...|$|R
