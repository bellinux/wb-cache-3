5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, <b>Portuguese</b> sources tell {{of how the}} <b>Portuguese</b> were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the <b>Portuguese</b> embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The <b>Portuguese</b> embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering <b>Portuguese</b> so that their king could be reinstalled there. The <b>Portuguese</b> also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the <b>Portuguese</b> conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the <b>Portuguese</b> were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the {{mainland}} south of Elephant Pass was {{claimed by the}} King of Kandy, Senerat; he and his troops were consistently harassing the <b>Portuguese</b> in the Jaffna Peninsula. His wife's two sons, Vijayapala and Kumarasinghe, were also married to princesses from Jaffna. After the fall of Jaffna to the <b>Portuguese,</b> Senarat dispatched a 10,000 strong army to Jaffna {{under the command of}} Mudaliyar Attapattu. The <b>Portuguese</b> withdrew and the Kandyan army occupied Jaffna. The <b>Portuguese</b> General Constantino de Sá de Noronha later attacked with reinforcements from Colombo and defeated Mudaliyar Attapattu's army and seized Jaffna. According to <b>Portuguese</b> and Dutch publications, the last battle for Jaffna was fought between the King of Kandyan kingdom and the <b>Portuguese,</b> and the Europeans seized Jaffna from the Kandyan king. Following <b>Portuguese</b> defeat by the Dutch, the Jaffna Mannar islands and most of Jaffna's Vannimai lands had been reincoporated into the Tamil Coylot Wannees Country by the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial hostilities, good {{relations}} between the <b>Portuguese</b> and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual <b>Portuguese</b> trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the <b>Portuguese</b> helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa—a later Governor of Macau— established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authorities and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official <b>Portuguese</b> trade base at Macau. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade and his <b>Portuguese</b> comrades {{were the first to}} open up China to the West, another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (15521610) ventured there in 1598.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, the <b>Portuguese</b> {{explorer}} Pedro Álvares Cabral {{arrived at}} Anjediva in North Canara with eight Franciscan missionaries {{under the leadership}} of Frei Henrique Soares de Coimbra. On arrival they converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region. In 1526, during the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, the <b>Portuguese</b> took possession of Mangalore whereupon <b>Portuguese</b> Franciscans began slowly spreading Christianity in Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against <b>Portuguese</b> rule on several fronts. The <b>Portuguese</b> Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the <b>Portuguese</b> regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic <b>Portuguese</b> Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The <b>Portuguese</b> that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began to sink into depression.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after <b>Portuguese</b> traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the <b>Portuguese</b> in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made peace with them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> {{first arrived}} in Timor in the 16th century, and in 1702 East Timor came under <b>Portuguese</b> colonial administration. <b>Portuguese</b> rule was tenuous until the island was divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860. A {{significant}} battleground during the Pacific War, East Timor was occupied by 20,000 Japanese troops. The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 East Timorese deaths.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> {{sought to}} expand {{the power of the}} priests, as from the {{beginning}} of their empire, priests had accompanied <b>Portuguese</b> delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of the priests over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to the priests in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations. The <b>Portuguese</b> promised to refrain from slaughtering cows and to halt forcible conversions in their factories. The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the <b>Portuguese,</b> with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the <b>Portuguese,</b> the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several <b>Portuguese</b> officers during their regime. The <b>Portuguese</b> Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The <b>Portuguese</b> also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant struggle with the <b>Portuguese</b> vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the <b>Portuguese</b> {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the <b>Portuguese</b> a bad reputation for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by <b>Portuguese</b> authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all <b>Portuguese)</b> no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the <b>Portuguese</b> for this and other reasons.|$|E

5|$|With the {{invasion}} of Portugal by Napoleon's imperial army in 1807, the <b>Portuguese</b> Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing {{the capital of the}} <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the <b>Portuguese</b> state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves. The whole of the <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy became then the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change of the status of the <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the <b>Portuguese</b> shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the <b>Portuguese</b> flags.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the <b>Portuguese</b> under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the <b>Portuguese</b> then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty <b>Portuguese</b> survivors of this settlement fled to the <b>Portuguese</b> settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E

The subsequent rule by the <b>Portuguese</b> saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E
