40|$|Abstract: Laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) {{in combination}} with a con-ventional mine <b>prodder</b> is applied for remote detection of explosives and mine housing materials as there are plastics, wood or metals. High power subnanosecond laser pulses (pulse power of Ep = 10 µJ) with a typical repe-tition rate of 10 kHz at 1064 nm are generated by using a passively Q-switched Cr 4 +:Nd 3 +:YAG microchiplaser as seedlaser for an Yb-fiber ampli-fier. When pumping the fiber amplifier with a cw diode laser at 976 nm and 50 W of power an amplification factor of up to 100 is obtained. In this way pulses {{with a duration of}} 500 ps and a power of Ep = 1 mJ are generated. Such high power laser pulses allow drilling a hole through mine casing ma-terials as well as applying LIBS spectroscopy for the characterization of en-ergetic and non-energetic materials. Fiber optics are used for guiding the laser pulses {{to the end of a}} modified conventional mine <b>prodder</b> and the LIBS signal back to the detector.

Discussion Not only is this ground pressure measurement device valuable in the process of designing a vehicle for demining, it could also be used to test whether existing vehicles are siutable for the task. Many new detection technologies are simply outfitted onto an readily available platform such as an ATV or a small backhoe. The ground pressure of these vehicles would be tested, and as customizations are made, the ground pressure will be modified as well. Other applications of this device could include testing of detection technologies. Those technologies such as mechanical <b>prodders,</b> waterjet, or the air spade, which all disturb the ground in some way. These make detonation of the land mine they are detecting a possibility. This measurement device could be used to test the dangers involved with each detection method. Also, {{at the same time the}} device is measuring the ground pressure effects of the detec-tion system, the mine could easily fulfill a role as a dummy anti-tank mine. It is roughly the same size as many anti-tank mines and will present some challenge to detection systems because it is primarily plastic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some of {{the most}} perfidious {{remnants}} of war are mines threatening not only combating parties but also innocent civilian lives. Moreover, they make large areas inaccessible that otherwise could be used economically. This threat exists even long after cessation of hostile actions. Up to now, the range of tools for humanitarian demining is confined to mine detection dogs, metal detectors, <b>prodders,</b> manual excavation tools and mechanical clearance machines (flails and tillers). In 1999, this gave rise for the Board of Directors of the EFNDT to suggest whether detection methods commonly applied may also be helpful in detecting mines and the like. It was proposed to transfer existing NDT technology to these areas. As a consequence, Working Group 5 “Antipersonnel Landmine Detection (APLD) ” was founded to support this concept. As soon as the group {{became aware of the}} fact that mines were encountered not only in the soil but also elsewhere the name was changed to “Antipersonnel Mine Detection (APMD) ”. It now is becoming more and more obvious that vicious devises such as mines and bombs threatening lives everywhere represent an increasing risk to everybody. In contrast, the particular interest in antipersonnel mine detection is decreasing in favour of general security and safety. However, all these problems have in common that such devices need to be detected in time, i. e. before they become effective. This gives reason to extend the scope of the existing Working Group 5 accordingly. It is of advantage to exchange existing knowledge and there is a chance to keep the awareness of the mine problem alive by this way...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the technology used for {{tools and equipment}} for humanitarian landmine clearance. The main {{focus is on the}} removal of mine and unxeploded ordnance contamination in the poor, heavily mined countries, particularly Afghanistan and Cambodia. Initially, the process of humanitarian demining in these countries was examined and described, and the relevant literature reviewed. Three studies were undertaken with a dual purpose of (a) providing relevant contributions to the science of mine clearance and (b) evaluating some of the methods commonly used in humanitarian demining research. (i) A statistical analysis of the evaluation of mine detection systems in trials was undertaken. This demonstrated that (a) this statistical analysis is straightforward, and (b) feasible sized trials do not yield useful results from analysis of the crude minedetection rate. An enhancement to the evaluation process, "Margin of Detection," was suggested. (ii) Research into improved "prodders" for detecting mines was undertaken with as much consultation with deminers as possible early in the research cycle. "Sensing prodders" were shown to function technically but not to improve the overall demining process. Measurements showed that many deminers prod in hard soils with suÆcient force to detonate some mines; rotary <b>prodders</b> were developed to reduce the force required for excavation, but success in the laboratory could not be duplicated in eld conditions. From this work a potentially useful tool for deminer training was developed, which might reduce the risks of accidental detonation. (iii) The limits of a high-tech detection technique (neutron irradiation and detection of prompt gamma rays) were examined (a) to advance understanding of this method and (b) to demonstrate the feasibility of early evaluation of technologies before extensive research is started. This neutron technology was shown to oer potential benets to military demining, but to be unlikely to have general application when the higher clearance standards and lower equipment budgets of humanitarian demining were applied. The thesis ends with conclusions and suggestions for some further work. Throughout the thesis, the research is focussed on investigating practical problems which deminers have suggested as important constraints on their work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent developments}} in low-cost, comfortable protective clothing and equipment for deminers, and some methods being used to reduce accidents. The principal design threat is accidental explosion of an anti-personnel blast mine near the deminer’s hand during prodding or probing operations. This type of accident is relatively common in Afghanistan, but not necessarily in other regions. Analysis of accident records from Afghanistan provides useful data for design of head protection and body armour. Hand protection {{is an essential part}} of any <b>prodder</b> or probe. Several accidents also occur due to deminers stepping or falling on AP blast mines, but cost-effective protection for these incidents is not yet feasible. Blast mine protection also provides useful protection from other threats: skin lesions from thorns, metal and sharp rocks; falling rocks and masonry; eye damage from thorns or barbed wire; and even sunburn...|$|E
40|$|Manual prodding {{is still}} one of the most {{utilized}} procedures for identifying buried landmines during humanitarian demining activities.

With the aim of contributing to reduce the number of demining accidents, this paper presents an intelligent multisensory system for training operators in the use of prodders. The proposed tool is able to provide to deminers useful information in two critical issues: (a) the amount of force exerted on the target and if it is greater than the safe limit and, (b) to alert them when the angle of insertion of the <b>prodder</b> is approaching or exceeding a certain dangerous limit.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} by physiological means the characteristics {{and organization of}} the mechanoreceptors in {{the skin of the}} salamander hind limb. A controlled mechanical stimulator with a tip diameter of a few microns was used to activate single mechanoreceptors, and afferent impulses were recorded from whole spinal nerves. 2. The mechanoreceptors of the skin are rapidly adapting. When random spots on the skin were tested, the stimulus strength needed to evoke an impulse varied from one location to another. The histogram of percentage occurrence of these critical stimuli in a given skin has the same form whether the sampled spots are 50 mum apart and are all included in a small area, or whether the spots are sampled as much as 1 mm apart across the entire limb. The histogram is skewed, with the highest-percentage occurrence in the low-threshold range. 3. One interpretation of the findings {{is that there is a}} single population of mechanoreceptors, of uniform threshold, spaced far enough apart for a stimulator of small diameter to be situated between them. By locating a low-threshold spot, and then determining the increase in stimulus required to excite it at a known distance away, it was possible to estimate the relationship between the strength of the stimulus and the receptive field size of such a population of receptors; we were then able to infer the average receptor spacing and receptive field size. The values are approximately 250 and 75 mum respectively. 4. From appropriate maps of detailed systematic surveys of the skin sensitivity to touch it was possible to define discrete low-threshold areas. These areas had approximate radii in the range 50 - 75 mum, and their centres were about 200 - 250 mum apart; these values are consistant with those predicted above. We conclude that the experimentally determined sensitive areas represent the receptive fields (at threshold) of individual mechanosensory endings. There are approximately twenty to thirty of them per square millimetre. 5. Receptive fields of single mechanosensory axons (i. e. of sensory 'units') were measured by an occlusion technique using two <b>prodders.</b> These fields vary from 0 - 05 to 2 - 5 mm 2, and are generally organized as discrete areas with only a little overlap among them. Individual axons supply from five to seventy-five mechanoreceptors. 6. The findings provide a basis for quantitative studies of plasticity involving the mechanosensory system of the salamander skin...|$|R

40|$|In {{salamander}} {{skin the}} Merkel cell-neurite complexes {{located near the}} base of the epidermis are the morphological correlates of the rapidly adapting touch receptors (Parducz, Leslie, Cooper, Turner & Diamond, 1977). The present electron microscopic studies revealed that these complexes contain reciprocal synapses polarized in the direction Merkel cell to neurite, and in the opposite direction, neurite to Merkel cell. The possible involvement of chemical transmission in the initiation of the mechanosensory response, was studied in vitro {{with the aid of a}} stable skin-nerve preparation in which single mechanoreceptors were activated under controlled conditions. Mechanosensitivity was measured with a calibrated <b>prodder</b> (tip diameter 10 - 30 micron) applied to random or selected points on the surface of the skin while the afferent impulse was recorded in the attached nerve twig. In some experiments the (tungsten) <b>prodder</b> was also used as a surface electrode, allowing the same mechanosensory axon to be excited mechanically (i. e. physiologically), and/or electrically. When applied at a single 'touch spot', suitably timed subthreshold mechanical and subthreshold electrical stimuli could summate to produce a single action potential. The temperature coefficient (Q 10) between 5 and 15 degrees C for the latency of the afferent spike was small, in the range 1. 3 - 2, whether it was evoked by mechanical or electrical stimulation. The latency following the mechanical stimulus, which included the transduction step, was longer than that following the electrical stimulus by 0. 5 - 2. 5 ms, and this additional delay was also relatively insensitive to temperature. In several cases removal of the epidermis with its Merkel cells (and presumably the most distal portions of the afferent nerve terminations) did not render the remaining skin totally insensitive to mechanical stimulation; however, the remaining receptive elements, though still rapidly adapting, generally had increased mechanosensory thresholds. The mechanosensitivity of the skin was unaffected by bath application of several aminergic (e. g. noradrenaline, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, octopamine) and purinergic (e. g. ATP, quinacrine) compounds at concentrations in the range 0. 2 - 2 mM. Removal of extracellular Ca 2 + combined with elevation of extracellular Mg 2 + (10 - 40 mM) had relatively little effect on the mechanosensitivity over periods of up to 1 h. In contrast, application of Co 2 + (2 - 10 mM) produced a decrease or blockade of the mechanosensitivity that was not associated with any obvious alterations in the ultrastructure of the Merkel cell-neurite complex.

40|$|Background: The {{impact and}} {{consequences}} of social media adoption on society are only just being realised and studied in detail; consequently, there is no universal agreement as to {{the reasons for the}} adoption of these services. Even understanding why some social media services are popular remains to some extent elusive. The practical use of Web 2. 0 does not provide any answers either with, for example, a noticeable difference in the way social media was strategically used by Barack Obama and Mitch Romney in the lead-up to the 2009 American elections. However, recent studies that have focused on social media adoption within specific sectors have begun to shed some light on these emerging adoption patterns; two studies in particular are illustrative: a 2012 study on the newspaper sector and a study on social media adoption and e-government. Objectives: This study investigates why South African civil society organisations (CSOs) adopt Web 2. 0 services and the perceived and actual benefits of such adoption. Method: A survey questionnaire was sent to 1712 South African CSOs listed in the <b>Prodder</b> database to explore why certain social media services were adopted and the perceived benefits thereof. Results: Internal reasons for the adoption of social media services by South African CSOs coalesce around organisational visibility and access to information. External reasons focus on organisations needing to become more relevant and more connected to like-minded organisations and initiatives. Conclusion: The pervasiveness of Web 2. 0 technologies makes it inevitable that CSOs will have to restructure themselves to remain relevant. </p...|$|E

40|$|Back pain {{is known}} to change motor {{patterns}} of the trunk. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the motor output of the erector spinae (ES) muscles during pain in the lumbar region. First, their voluntary activation was assessed during flexion and re-extension of the trunk. Second, effects of cutaneous and muscle pain on the ES stretch reflex were measured, since increased stretch reflex gain has been suggested to underlie increased muscle tone in painful muscles. The trunk movement and electromyographical (EMG) signals from the right and left ES during pain were compared with values before pain. Controlled muscle pain was induced by infusion of 5 % saline into the right lumbar ES. Cutaneous pain was elicited by mechanical or electrical stimulation of the dorsal lumbar skin. The stretch reflex was evoked by rapidly indenting the right lumbar ES with a servo-motor <b>prodder.</b> The results from the voluntary task show that muscle pain decreased the modulation depth of ES EMG activity. This pattern was associated with a decreased range and velocity of motion of the painful body segment, which would normally serve to avoid further injury. Interestingly, when subjects overcame this guarding tendency and made exactly the same movements during pain as before pain, the EMG modulation depth was still reduced. The results seem to reconcile the controversy of previous studies, in which both hyper- and hypoactivity of back muscles in pain have been reported. In the tapped muscle, the EMG response consisted of two peaks (latency 19. 3 ± 2. 1 and 44. 6 ± 2. 5 ms, respectively) followed by a trough. On the contralateral side the first response was a trough (26. 2 ± 3. 2 ms) while the second (46. 4 ± 4. 3 ms) was a peak, similar to the second peak on the tapped side. Cutaneous pain had no effect on the short-latency response but significantly increased the second response on the tapped side. Surprisingly, deep muscle pain had no effect on the stretch reflex. A short-latency reciprocal inhibition exists between the right and left human ES. It is concluded that deep back pain does not influence the stretch reflexes in the back muscles but modulates the voluntary activation of these muscles...|$|E
