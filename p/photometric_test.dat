MODULAR ANALYTICS allows customised configurations for various laboratory workloads. The performance and practicability of MODULAR ANALYTICS were evaluated in an international multicentre study at 16 sites. Studies included precision, accuracy, analytical range, carry-over, and workflow assessment. More than 700 000 results were obtained {{during the course of the}} study. Median between-day CVs were typically less than 3 % for clinical chemistries and less than 6 % for homogeneous immunoassays. Median recoveries for nearly all standardised reference materials were within 5 % of assigned values. Method comparisons versus current existing routine instrumentation were clinically acceptable in all cases. During the workflow studies, the work from three to four single workstations was transferred to MODULAR ANALYTICS, which offered over 100 possible methods, with reduction in sample splitting, handling errors, and turnaround time. Typical sample processing time on MODULAR ANALYTICS was less than 30 minutes, an improvement from the current laboratory systems.

40|$|Summary: Methods {{employing}} chromogenic substrates for the photometric {{determination of}} prothrombin time have several advantages over conventional coagulometric methods. We evaluated the analytical qualities of two recently introduced reagents for the photometric determination of prothrombin time. The assays {{were performed on}} a centrifugal analyser. Both reagents showed good precision, even with sample volumes of 10 μΐ or 12 μΐ. The stability of the reagents during storage was investigated at 4 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C. The chromogenic reagent, which contains thromboplastin from human placenta, was compared with a coagulometric method, which includes ox-brain thromboplastin: coagulation activities calculated from International Normalized Ratio values showed good correlation and conformity over the whole test range. The other chromogenic reagent contains thromboplastin from rabbit brain; outside the therapeutic range for oral anticoagulation the results obtained with this reagent showed poor agreement with those obtained with the coagulometric method. Both chromogenic reagents were sensitive to reduced concentrations of coagulation factors of the extrinsic pathway and nearly insensitive to low factor IX concentrations.

Changes in physiological parameters related to photosynthesis were studied in five macroalgal species from Spitsbergen(Monostroma arcticum, Laminaria solidungula, Alaria esculenta, Palmaria palmata, Phycodrys rubens) during a 72 -h exposure to UVradiation. Maximal quantum yield of photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax) were measured with apulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer; {{the activity of}} the Calvin cycle enzymes ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 3 PDH) were estimated using a <b>photometric</b> <b>test.</b> Proteins of crude extracts were separatedby SDS gel electrophoresis and changes in cellular concentrations of Rubisco were determined. Moreover, the concentration of chlorophylla (Chl a), and protein content, were measured photometrically. In all species, Chl a content, maximal quantum yield as well as ETRmaxdecreased during the UV treatment. Changes in ETRmax were related to the changes in the overall activity of Rubisco. Analysis of SDS gelsshowed that in P. rubens, L. solidungula, M. arcticum and A. esculenta decreasing Rubisco activity partly resulted from a degradationof the enzyme. However, in A. esculenta, the formation of a high-molecular-weight polypeptide was observed. In all species, the activity ofRubisco was more strongly impaired than that of G 3 PDH.

This process can happen if the initial mass of the cluster exceeds a threshold above which ejecta are retained and a second generation is formed. A determination of this mass threshold is mandatory {{in order to understand}} how GCs form. We analyzed nine red giant branch stars belonging to the cluster Ruprecht 106. Targets were observed with the UVES@VLT 2 spectrograph. Spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measure abundances for light (O, Na, Mg, Al), α (Si, Ca, Ti), iron-peak (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), and neutron-capture (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy, Pb) elements. Based on these abundances, we show that Ruprecht 106 is the first convincing example of a single-population GC (i. e., a true simple stellar population), although the sample is relatively small. This result is supported also by an independent <b>photometric</b> <b>test</b> and by the horizontal branch morphology and the dynamical state.

Materials and Methods: The authors conducted this case-control study of 42 preeclamptic and 41 normotensive overweight pregnant women. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gestational age, and body mass index. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia, after 14 hour fasting to determine plasma lipid concentrations.

40|$|AbstractPatients with {{malignant}} gliomas have a {{poor prognosis}} with average survival {{of less than}} one year. Whereas in other tumor entities the characteristics of tumor metabolism are successfully used for therapeutic approaches, such developments are very rare in brain tumors, notably in gliomas. One metabolic feature characteristic of gliomas, in particular diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors, is the variable content of D- 2 -hydroxyglutarate (D 2 HG), a metabolite, which was discovered first in this tumor entity. D 2 HG is generated in large amounts due to various gain-of–function mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH- 1 and IDH- 2. Meanwhile, D 2 HG has been detected in several other tumor entities including intrahepatic bile-duct cancer, chondrosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. D 2 HG is barely detectable in healthy tissue (< 0. 1 mM), but its concentration increases up to 35 mM in malignant tumor tissues. Consequently, the oncometabolite D 2 HG has gained increasing interest {{in the field of}} tumor metabolism. To facilitate its quantitative measurement without loss of spatial resolution at a microscopical level, we have developed a novel bioluminescence assay for determining D 2 HG in sections of snap-frozen tissue. The assay was verified independently by <b>photometric</b> <b>tests</b> and liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The novel technique allows the microscopically resolved determination of D 2 HG in a concentration range of 0 – 10 µmol/g tissue (wet weight). In combination with the already established bioluminescence imaging techniques for ATP, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate, the novel D 2 HG assay enables a comparative characterization of the metabolic profile of individual tumors in a further dimension...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Interdisciplinary Higher Degrees {{project was}} the {{development}} of a high-speed method of photometrically testing vehicle headlamps, based on the use of image processing techniques, for Lucas Electrical Limited. <b>Photometric</b> <b>testing</b> involves measuring the illuminance produced by a lamp at certain points in its beam distribution. Headlamp performance is best represented by an iso-lux diagram, showing illuminance contours, produced from a two-dimensional array of data. Conventionally, {{the tens of thousands of}} measurements required are made using a single stationary photodetector and a two-dimensional mechanical scanning system which enables a lamp's horizontal and vertical orientation relative to the photodetector to be changed. Even using motorised scanning and computerised data-logging, the data acquisition time for a typical iso-lux test is about twenty minutes. A detailed study was made of the concept of using a video camera and a digital image processing system to scan and measure a lamp's beam without the need for the time-consuming mechanical movement. Although the concept was shown to be theoretically feasible, and a prototype system designed, it could not be implemented because of the technical limitations of commercially-available equipment. An alternative high-speed approach was developed, however, and a second prototype syqtem designed. The proposed arrangement again uses an image processing system, but in conjunction with a one-dimensional array of photodetectors and a one-dimensional mechanical scanning system in place of a video camera. This system can be implemented using commercially-available equipment and, although not entirely eliminating the need for mechanical movement, greatly reduces the amount required, resulting in a predicted data acquisiton time of about twenty seconds for a typical iso-lux test. As a consequence of the work undertaken, the company initiated an 80, 000 programme to implement the system proposed by the author...|$|R
40|$|Surgical luminaires are an {{important}} tool for the surgeon, yet highlighting the wound of a patient is not trivial and surgical luminaires must meet stringent regulatory requirements. Optical equirements and performance indicators are described in the European Standard for surgical luminaires {{and they must be}} measured after construction. Surgeons and hospital managers often use these performance indicators to compare different surgical luminaires. The introduction of solid-state lighting and high-power light emitting diodes (LEDs) has initiated a new generation of surgical luminaires. When designing a virtual prototype of a surgical luminaire it would be beneficial to have a cost- and time-effective method to test luminaires for compliance with the European Standard. Unfortunately, far-field intensities do not allow an evaluation of these luminaires with respect to the standard and near-field ray-data must be used. To validate this near-field approach, we used angular- and spatially-resolved ray-data of a luminaire and modeled a virtual setup that corresponds to the setup used in the European Standard. This paper compares illuminances obtained from simulations and photometric measurements of various <b>photometric</b> <b>tests.</b> Good agreement was found: relative differences between simulations and measurements for the central illuminances deviate maximally 0. 4 percent (+ 3. 2 percent, - 0. 4 percent), while the maximum difference for the various scenarios amounts to 5. 6 percent (+/- 2. 2 percent). The technique can be applied to virtual prototypes of surgical luminaires that are composed of optical components such as reflectors and lenses and use spatially- and angular-resolved luminance-data of individual LEDs. This permits us to check compliance with the European Standard before assembly. This method will allow for more economical and time-effective development of new luminaires that maintain the quality requirements. status: publishe...|$|R

Previous <b>photometric</b> calibrations are <b>tested</b> with available spectroscopic measurements and their application to stars without high-resolution spectroscopy allowed the determination of metal abundances for 12 additional stars with planets.

40|$|Biocompatibility of six {{different}} compression stockings and cytotoxic effects were determined using HaCaT keratinocytes, L 929 mouse fibroblasts, primary adult and juvenile keratinocytes Cells were quantified using a luminometric ATP assay and the <b>photometric</b> BCA <b>test.</b> Cytotoxic effects {{were determined by}} LDH release. An area-based extraction ratio of 1. 25 Â cm 2 :mL could {{be shown to be}} superior to the weight-based extraction of test material. Extraction medium should be an acidic sweat solution as this helps to recreate in vivo conditions. Monolayer cultures of HaCaT keratinocytes or L 929 mouse fibroblasts should be used for testing. Primary adult keratinocytes or primary juvenile keratinocytes can also be used. For the latter, testing under DMEM with FCS is recommended to achieve comparable results. It was found that the compression stockings tested exhibited no negative influence on cell viability in vitro and no direct cytotoxic effects measured as release of LDH. Henc e, good biocompatibility could be asserted...|$|R
