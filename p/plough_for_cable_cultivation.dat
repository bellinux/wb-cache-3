40|$|The {{network of}} {{submarine}} cables circling the globe connects {{most of the}} major population centres. This network is growing, driven by increasing international telecommunications and the internet. For reliability of service, geotechnics form an important consideration. Clearly hazards such as submarine landslides must be avoided, but also consideration is given to burial and the degree of protection afforded by burial. This paper discusses the threats to a cable and the use of <b>ploughs</b> <b>for</b> burial. Investigation techniques <b>for</b> <b>cable</b> routes are discussed and soils which prove hardest to plough are tentatively identified from cone penetration tests. 1...|$|R
