5|$|One <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> is {{to admit}} more {{permanent}} members. The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise {{the group of}} G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for Consensus group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), Pakistan (opposing India), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy {{and other members of}} the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.|$|E

The junta started to split in 1983, with Doe telling Quiwonkpa that he was planning to move Quiwonkpa from command of the army to a position as secretary-general of the People's Redemption Council. Unhappy with this <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> Quiwonkpa fled into exile in late 1983, along with his aide-de-camp Prince Johnson.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
500|$|Jurisdictions {{may seek}} preclearance through either an [...] "administrative preclearance" [...] process or a [...] "judicial preclearance" [...] process. If a {{jurisdiction}} seeks administrative preclearance, the Attorney General will consider whether the <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> the Attorney General has 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the Attorney General interposes an objection, then {{the change is}} not precleared {{and may not be}} implemented. The Attorney General's decision is not subject to judicial review, but if the Attorney General interposes an objection, the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance, and the court may disregard the Attorney General's objection at its discretion. If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance, it must file a declaratory judgment action against the Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for D.C. A three-judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect, and the losing party may appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits.|$|E
