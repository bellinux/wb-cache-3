Before the earthquake occurrence this region was classified as not hazardous, according to the former Italian seismic code. After the main-shocks, felt in many towns of the Molise and Puglia regions, a strong motion and a seismic temporary network were installed in the epicentral area and surrounding regions. This allowed the collection of a large data set, useful to characterize this area. The joint velocity-acceleration data set has been used to derive ground motion models for peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response spectra for both maximum horizontal and vertical components of the motion. The results obtained for the Molise area have been compared with the attenuation pattern of the Umbria-Marche region (central Italy) and the Italian territory.

40|$|The time-evolution {{equation}} of a one-dimensional quantum walker is exactly mapped to the three-dimensional Weyl equation for a zero-mass particle with spin 1 / 2, {{in which each}} wave number k of walker's wave function is mapped to a point q⃗(k) in the three-dimensional momentum space and q⃗(k) makes a planar orbit as k changes its value in [-π, π). The integration over k providing the real-space wave function for a quantum walker corresponds to considering an orbital state of a Weyl particle, which {{is defined as a}} superposition (curvilinear integration) of the energy-momentum eigenstates of a free Weyl equation along the orbit.

Analyses were conducted on both peak ground acceleration a d <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response spec-tra. Because of {{a positive correlation between}} magnitude and distance, a two-step regression technique was employed. Results show that, compared with surface ground motion, peak accelerations at underground sites are lower by a factor anging from 1. 5 to 4 according to the depth. In the case of response spectra, differences between ground surface and underground spectra re dependent on geological con-ditions. For the three sites considered in the study, underground <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response spectra show amplitudes lower by a factor anging from 1. 5 to 10 according to the depth or the period considered. Ratios between the receiver esponses obtained at different depths provided av-erage transfer functions. Those were compared with transfer functions calculated by averaging ratios of observed response spectra between different depths. A good agreement between the two techniques was found.

Remarkably large elastic <b>pseudo-velocity</b> responses exceeding 300  cm/s at 5  % critical damping were calculated for the horizontal components of the mainshock recordings at peak periods of 4 – 5  s. Conversely, the short-period ground motions of the mainshock were relatively weak despite {{the proximity of the}} site to the source fault. The horizontal components of all large-magnitude (Mw ≥  6.3) aftershock recordings showed peak <b>pseudo-velocity</b> responses at periods of 3 – 4  s. Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) describing the Nepal Himalaya region have not yet been developed. A comparison of the observational data with GMPEs for Japan showed that {{with the exception of the}} peak ground acceleration (PGA) of the mainshock, the observed PGAs and peak ground velocities at the KATNP site are generally well described by the GMPEs for crustal and plate interface events. A comparison of the horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios for the S-waves of the mainshock and aftershock recordings suggested that the KATNP site experienced a considerable nonlinear site response, which resulted in the reduced amplitudes of short-period ground motions. The GMPEs were found to underestimate the response values at the peak periods (approximately 4 – 5  s) of the large-magnitude events. The deep subsurface velocity model of the Kathmandu basin has not been well investigated. Therefore, a one-dimensional velocity model was constructed for the deep sediments beneath the recording station based on an analysis of the H/V spectral ratios for S-wave coda from aftershock recordings, and it was revealed that the basin sediments strongly amplified the long-period components of the ground motions of the mainshock and large-magnitude aftershocks.|$|E

The second analysis modelled the response of a model of an isolated structure with a flexible superstructure to study the effect of isolation damping on the performance of different isolation systems under near-fault motion. The results show that there exists a value of isolation system damping for which the superstructure acceleration for a given structural system attains a minimum value under near-fault motion. Therefore, although increasing the bearing damping beyond a certain value may decrease the bearing displacement, it may transmit higher accelerations into the superstructure. Finally, the behaviour of four isolation systems subjected to the normal component of each of the near-fault motions were studied, showing that EDF type isolation systems may be the optimum choice for the design of isolated structures in near-fault locations.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{efficacy}} of various ground motion intensity measures for the seismic response of pile foundations embedded in liquefiable and non-liquefiable soils is investigated. A soil-pile-structure model consisting of a two layer soil deposit with a single pile and a single-degree of freedom superstructure is used in a parametric study to determine the salient features of the seismic response of the soil-pile-structure system. A suite of ground motion records scaled to various levels of intensity are used to investigate {{the full range of}} pile behaviour, from elastic response to failure. Various intensity measures are used to inspect their efficiency in predicting the seismic demand on the pile foundation for a given level of ground motion intensity.

In particular, velocity spectrum intensity (VSI), which represents the integral of the <b>pseudo-velocity</b> spectrum over a wide period range, is found to be the most efficient intensity measure in predicting the seismic demands on the pile foundation.

40|$|A multi-scale {{asymptotic}} {{theory is}} derived for the evolution and interaction of currents and surface gravity waves in water of finite depth, under conditions typical of coastal shelf waters outside the surf zone. The theory provides a practical and useful model with which wave-current coupling may be explored without {{the necessity of}} resolving features of the flow on space and time scales of the primary gravity-wave oscillations. The essential nature of the dynamical interaction is currents modulating the slowly evolving phase of the wave field and waves providing both phase-averaged forcing of long, infra-gravity waves and wave-averaged vortex forces for the low-frequency current and sea-level evolution equations. Analogous relations are derived for material tracers and density stratification that include phase-averaged, Stokes-drift advection, including by a vertical Stokes <b>pseudo-velocity</b> that is the incompressible companion to the horizontal Stokes velocity.

30|$|An inland crustal {{earthquake}} (Mj 6.1) {{occurred on}} December 14, 2004 {{in the northern}} part of Hokkaido, Japan. A large ground acceleration of 1127 cm/s 2 and a large <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response of over 100 cm/s were recorded at the nearest strong-motion station, HKD 020, about 10 km from the hypocenter. This large ground motion is considered to be attributable to the source effect and the site effect. The site effect is investigated using the traditional spectral ratio technique and the theoretical evaluation based on the subsurface structure model. The results imply that the site effect has an insignificant effect on the large ground motion at HKD 020. The source effect is investigated by constructing the source model that explains the broad-band strong-motion records at four stations around the epicenter using the empirical Green’s function method. The estimated source model satisfies the empirical relationship between the strong motion generation areas and the seismic moment for inland crustal earthquakes. The high-frequency level of the acceleration source spectrum is also consistent with the empirical relationship. These results suggest that this earthquake is a normal crustal event and that the large ground motion at HKD 020 is mainly attributable to the source effect, short distance from the strong motion generation area and the forward directivity effect. Finally, the temporal change of the site response at HKD 020 is examined using long duration records including the main shock and several aftershocks. The site response based on the S-wave horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio method shows the nonlinearity for the main shock and an aftershock occurring about 20 s after the main shock. However, the site response shows linearity for other later aftershocks. This site response change is attributed to the difference in ground motion amplitude.|$|E

Using a large dataset and robust modeling methods, this study aims to describe growth from birth to adulthood among the indigenous Shuar of Amazonian Ecuador. MethodsMixed-longitudinal measures of height, weight, and BMI were collected from Shuar participants (n = 2, 463; age 022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 29 years). Centile growth curves and tables were created for each anthropometric variable of interest using GAMLSS. <b>Pseudo-velocity</b> and LMS curves were generated to further investigate Shuar patterns of growth and to facilitate comparison with U. S. CDC and multinational WHO growth references. ResultsThe Shuar are small throughout life and exhibit complex patterns of growth that differ substantially from those of international references. Similar to other Amazonians, Shuar growth in weight compares more favorably to references than growth in height, resulting in BMI curves that approximate international medians. Several additional characteristics of Shuar development are noteworthy, including large observed variation in body size early in life, significant infant growth faltering, extended male growth into adulthood, and a markedly early female pubertal growth spurt in height. Phenotypic plasticity and genetic selection in response to local environmental factors may explain many of these patterns.

In {{the development of this}} method, a CVFEM for steady, quasi-one-dimensional, viscous compressible flows was also formulated. The proposed method is a colocated shock capturing formulation. Polygonal control volumes are constructed around each node in the finite-element mesh, and discretized forms of the governing equations are obtained by deriving algebraic approximations to integral conservation equations for each control volume. [...] The proposed methods are formulated using the velocity components, pressure, and temperature as the dependent variables: density is calculated from an equation of state. Linear interpolation is applied to pressure and diffused scalars, and a mass weighted upwind function is applied to the convected scalars. An interpolation function incorporating a <b>pseudo-velocity</b> and a pressure gradient is used to represent mass conserving velocities; this allows the development of a colocated method valid for compressible flows. The discretized forms of the governing equations are solved using an iterative algorithm. In this algorithm, linearized forms of the discretized momentum and continuity equations are solved in a segregated manner by using a tridiagonal matrix algorithm. [...] The proposed quasi-one- and two-dimensional CVFEM's are applied to several inviscid and viscous compressible fluid flow problems, and the solutions generated are compared with theoretical, numerical, and experimental results available in the literature. This comparison shows that the proposed CVFEM's can generate solutions that are in agreement with the expected physical behaviour of some compressible flows and with the available results. The results suggest further research is required in the evaluation and enhancement of the mass-weighted interpolation functions currently used, however, as the shock smearing in the proposed method is excessive, and the accuracy of solution is not satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} the possible range of long-period ground motion for sites {{located on a}} soft sedimentary basin {{in the immediate vicinity}} of a large earthquake. Since many large cities in the world (e. g., Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tokyo) where many large structures have been recently constructed are located in this type of environment, a better understanding of long-period ground motion is becoming increasingly important. Our objective is to estimate the possible range of long-period ground motion, rather than ground motion for a specific fault model. We computed ground-motion time series and <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response spectra (PVS) for more than 5, 000 models for the 1923 Kanto, Japan, earthquake (M_W = 7. 9) using 180 slip distributions, eight rupture geometry, and rupture velocities ranging from 1. 5 to 3. 0 km/sec. Two seismograms recorded in Tokyo during the 1923 Kanto earthquake are used for comparison. The response spectra computed using seismologically reasonable sets of source parameters for the 1923 Kanto earthquake vary by more than an order of magnitude. At periods of 10 to 13 sec, they range from 25 to 170 cm/sec in Tokyo. For some combinations of model parameters, the response spectra exhibit peaks in the range of 10 to 13 sec. Many of the computed response spectra have peaks at periods longer than 10 sec, which is considerably longer than the dominant period (6 to 8 sec) estimated from studies of small earthquakes and microtremor measurements. Thus, the dominant period of the subsurface structure determined locally may not be representative of the dominant period of ground motion from a nearby large earthquake, which is controlled by rupture directivity and source depth. We performed a similar simulation for a hypothetical M_W = 7. 5 earthquake located beneath the Los Angeles basin. For a site just above the center of the fault, the ground-motion spectral amplitude at a period of 10 sec can vary from 50 to 350 cm/sec.

Geological Survey editorial standards (and stratigraphic nomenclature) We have developed empirical equations for predicting earthquake response spectra in terms of magnitude, distance, and site conditions, using a two-stage regression method similar to the one we used previously for peak horizontal acceleration and velocity. We analyzed horizontal <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response at 5 percent damping for 64 records of 12 shallow earthquakes-in Western North America, including the recent Coyote Lake and Imperial Valley, California, earthquakes. We developed predictive equations for 12 different periods between 0. 1 and 4. 0 s, both for the larger of two horizontal components and for the random horizontal component. The resulting spectra show amplification at soil sites compared to rock sites for periods {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 3 s, with maximum amplification exceeding a factor of 2 at 2. 0 s. For periods less than 0. 3 s there is slight deamplification at the soil sites. These results are generally consistent with those of several earlier studies. A particularly significant aspect of the predicted spectra is the change of shape with magnitude (confirming earlier results by McGuire and by Trifunac and Anderson). This result indicates that the conventional practice of scaling a constant spectral shape by peak acceleration will not give accurate answers. The Newmark and Hall method of spectral scaling, using both peak acceleration and peak velocity, largely avoids this error. Comparison of our spectra with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 1. 60 spectrum anchored at the same value at 0. 1 s shows that the Regulatory Guide 1. 60 spectrum is exceeded at soil sites for a magnitude of 7. 5 at all distances for periods greater than about 0. 5 s. Comparison of our spectra for soil sites with the corresponding ATC- 3 curve of lateral design force coefficient for the highest seismic zone indicates that the ATC- 3 curve is exceeded within about 7 km of a magnitude 6. 5 earthquake and within about 15 km of a magnitude 7. 5 event. The amount by which it is exceeded for the 7. 5 event is largest in the period range from 0. 5 to 2. 0 s...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} turbulence {{and vertical}} transport at the “Tommeliten” {{site in the}} Norwegian sector of the central North Sea during the R/V Celtic Explorer (CE 0913) cruise from 8 - 11 August 2009. The sediments at this site are rather flat, sandy and non-permeable, with the presence methane seeps, as well bacterial mats and seep-related fauna. The hydrography of the 70 m deep water column was characterized by a mixed surface layer extending to about 20 m depth and a well-mixed 30 m thick bottom layer that was separated by a stratified interior layer (Figure 1). Amplitudes of tidal velocities were as large as 0. 3 m s- 1 in the bottom boundary layer. Dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (ε) etermined from microstructure shear profiles was weak (10 - 9 W kg- 1 - the detection limit of the profiler) in the thermocline but increased to 10 - 7 - 10 - 6 W kg- 1 approaching the sea floor and the surface (Figure 1). Vertical turbulent eddy diffusivities (KZ, Figure 2) ranged from 10 - 6 m 2 s- 1 in the stratified interior to 10 - 3 m 2 s- 1 and 10 - 4 m 2 s- 1 in surface and bottom boundary layers respectively; the <b>pseudo-velocity,</b> defined as t =L 2 / 2 Kz with L= 1 m (Figure 2) was {{on the order of}} hours to several weeks/months in the stratified interior. High-resolution dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles were measured with a fast galvanic AMT oxygen sensor (response time 0. 2 s) mounted on the microstructure probe. The sensor is capable of resolving oxygen fine structures (1 cm scale), i. e. the structures in the stratified interior, that are completely overlooked by standard slow DO sensors (Figure 1). Vertical turbulent DO fluxes were calculated using the gradient method with locally-measured dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy. The average downward turbulent DO flux from the thermocline to the bottom water was estimated to be 4. 4 ± 1. 4 mmol m- 2 d- 1. The AMT sensor now allows us to resolve the before unrealized steep gradient in DO, and to properly characterize the downward fluxes. With benthic DO fluxes from chambers on the order of 7 mmol m- 2 d- 1, the water column depletion should therefore be about 3 - 4 mmol m- 2 d- 1. This agrees with the observed DO concentrations of about 200 μmol L- 1 (67...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{interpolation}} of along-track Sea-Level Anomalies (SLA) data {{to produce}} gridded map has numerous applications in oceanography (model validation, data assimilation, eddy tracking, [...] .). Optimal Interpolation (OI) {{is often the}} preferred method for this task, as it {{leads to the lowest}} expected error and provides an error field associated to the analyzed field. However, the method suffers from limitations such as the numerical cost (due to the inversion of covariance matrices) as well as the isotropic covariance function, generally employed in altimetry. The Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) is a gridding method based on the minimization of a cost function using a finite-element technique. The cost function penalizes the departures from observations, the smoothness of the gridded field and physical constraints (advection, diffusion, [...] .). It has been shown that DIVA and OI are equivalent (provided some assumptions on the covariances are made), the main difference is that in DIVA, the covariance function is not explicitly formulated. The technique has been previously applied for the creation of regional hydrographic climatologies, which required the processing {{of a large number of}} data points. In this work we present the application and adaptation of Diva to the analysis of SLA in the Mediterranean Sea and the production of weekly maps of SLA in this region. The peculiarities of SLA along-track data are addressed: • number of observations: the finite-element technique coupled to improvements in the matrix inversion (parallel or iterative solvers) lead to a decrease of the computational time, meaning that sub-sampling of the initial data set is not required. • quality of the different missions: the weight attributed to each data point can be easily set according to the satellite that provided the observations, so that different measurement noise variances are considered. • spatial correlation scale: it varies spatially in the domain according to the value of the Rossby radius of deformation. • long-wavelength errors: each data point is associated a class, and a detrending technique allows the determination of the trend for each class, leading to a reduction of the inconsistencies between missions. • anisotropy of physical coastal features: a <b>pseudo-velocity</b> field derived from regional bathymetry enhances the correlations along the main currents. Particular attention will be paid to the influence of this constraint in the coastal area. The analysis and error fields obtained over the Mediterranean Sea are compared with the available gridded products from AVISO. Different ways to compute the error field are compared. The impact of the use of multiple missions to prepare the gridded fields is also examined. In situ measurements from an intensive multi-sensor experiment carried out north of the Balearic Islands in May 2009 serve to assess the quality of the gridded fields in the coastal area...|$|E

The data come from all INGV strong-motion stations installed in Northern Italy (i. e. Strong-Motion Network of Northern Italy, RAIS, [URL] Augliera et al., 2011; strong-motion stations of the National Seismic Network, RSN, [URL] and selected with a minimum latitude of 43. 5 °N. The earthquake locations reported in the web site come from the National Earthquake Center of INGV (preliminary location form: [URL] An automatic procedure was developed in order to publish in the web site both metadata (processed by an automatic system) and downloadable waveforms in ascii format (uncorrected version). After each earthquake occurrence, the procedure downloads 5 minutes (starting from the event origin time) of MINI-Seed waveforms from EIDA ([URL] archive and applies a fast processing and data analysis tool. The automatic data processing includes: i) a first-order baseline operator applied to the entire record, in order to have a zero-mean of the signal; ii) a baseline correction, in order to remove the linear trend, computed with a least square method; iii) tapering of the signal through a cosine function (0. 01 %) at the beginning and at the end of each selected window; iv) the application of a 4 th order Butterworth band-pass acausal (Boore and Akkar, 2003; Boore and Bommer, 2005) filter in order to remove the high and low-frequency noise: the filter cut-off thresholds were automatically selected on the basis of the event magnitude (i. e., 0. 1 - 40 Hz with ML ≥ 5. 5; 0. 2 - 35 Hz with 4. 5 ≤ ML < 5. 5; 0. 3 - 35 with 3. 5 ≤ ML < 4. 5). Considering the available digital instrumentation (i. e. 24 bits Kinemetrics Episensor with a flat response up to 200 Hz) the deconvolution for the instrument response was not applied. At the end velocity waveforms were obtained through integration of the processed accelerometric data. For each component of the automatically processed signals the following GM parameters are evaluated: PGA (peak ground acceleration), PGV (peak ground velocity) and SA (5 %-damped acceleration response spectra) for periods up to 4 s were calculated. Moreover, the automatic system provides PSV (5 %-damped <b>pseudo-velocity</b> response spectra), Sd (5 %-damped displacement response spectra), Ia (Arias Intensity; Arias 1970) and Ih (Housner intensity; Housner 1952). In correspondence of each recording site the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) was automatically performed considering 5 s and 10 s of S phase (starting from 1 s before the S-phase onset). At the end of the automatic procedure, for each single event, a web page is generated. On each web page the results are published in terms of tables (text format) containing main strong-motion parameters and generic plots (e. g., location of recording stations, HVSRs, response spectra, accelerograms, comparison between recorded data and Italian Ground Motion Prediction Equations, Bindi et al., 2011).
