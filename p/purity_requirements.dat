5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting <b>purity</b> <b>requirement</b> could be met.|$|R

Optimizing the preparative chromatography to receive higher yields and/or productivity can either be done by experimental work or by using mathematical models. This thesis uses a nonlinear chromatography model to simulate and find a robust operation point for an ion exchange column that separates Immunoglobulin G from BSA and myoglobin with a salt gradient. The decision variables used are the column length, load time and elution gradient with productivity as the objective function. A method for calculating the sensitivity of the model is presented and is used to define the robustness of the system. The sensitivity definition includes both the model error and the process variations effect on the model performance, in this case purity. The sensitivity definition will be used to test if an operation point is robust with regard to the <b>purity</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A wood {{gasifier}} takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber {{or similar}} materials as fuel and burns these incompletely {{in a fire}} box, producing wood gas, solid ash and soot, the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{simulated}} moving bed technology {{has proven to be}} a powerful concept to separate isomers, in particular enantiomers. Due to the complex multicolumn arrangement, the design and optimization of this process is not a trivial task. The concept is often applied to achieve high purity outlet streams. Based on the assumption that the phase equilibria are established there is a powerful concept available to evaluate the feasibility of the process for highly efficient columns. However, in practice often lower purities are acceptable and cheaper columns can be applied. Rather than performing a complete optimization study, in such cases it is attractive to have in early development stages information available purpose of this paper to present a novel apporach to address this feasibility question based on discrete optimization, which permits the derivation of global infeasibility statements in conjunction with local feasible solutions. In order to achieve this, a mixed-integer linear program is constructed in such a way that its solution set contains all feasible solutions of the underlying non-linear optimization model. If the mixed-integer linear relaxation is infeasible, then it is guaranteed that the nonlinear model has no solution. In addition, an optimal solution of the mixed-integer linear relaxation can provide a feasible solution or a useful starting point for local optimization tools. Our approach for tackling the feasibility question is presented using capacity and separation factors for the separation of mixtures of fructose-dextran T 9 and fructose-raffinose. A conventional 4 zone True Moving Bed (TMB) model is considered in conjunction with technically meaningful restrictions on the operating parameters. The apporach allows to prove lower bounds on the number of plates necessary to separate the mixtures for a specified <b>purity</b> <b>requirement</b> (e. g. 90 or 98 percent). It turns out, for instance, that for separating the mixture fructose-raffinose with a <b>purity</b> <b>requirement</b> of 98 percent (for both extract and raffinate outlets) twenty plates for each of the zones are provably not sufficient, whereas for twenty five plates per zone a solution is given which guarantees a purity of 94. 5 percent for the fructose outlet. Several similar statements for other conditions or processes under consideration can be given as well...|$|R
40|$|Purification is {{a process}} in which {{decoherence}} is partially reversed by using several input systems which have been subject to the same noise. The purity of the outputs generally increases with the number of input systems, and decreases with the number of required output systems. We construct the optimal quantum operations for this task, and discuss their asymptotic behaviour as the number of inputs goes to infinity. The rate at which output systems may be generated depends crucially on the type of <b>purity</b> <b>requirement.</b> If one tests the purity of the outputs systems one at a time, the rate is infinite: this fidelity may be made to approach 1, {{while at the same time}} the number of outputs goes to infinity arbitrarily fast. On the other hand, if one also requires the correlations between outputs to decrease, the rate is zero: if fidelity with the pure product state is to go to 1, the number of outputs per input goes to zero. However, if only a fidelity close to 1 is required, the optimal purifier achieves a positive rate, which we compute. ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{usage of}} {{catalytic}} chemistry calls for efficient removal of metal traces. This paper describes {{the development and}} optimization of a scavenger-based extraction in flow to remove metal catalysts. It enables liquid-liquid extraction with slug flow and phase separation with a porous fluoropolymer membrane. The use of this unit for copper scavenging of various copper sources from organic solvent was studied. The effects of scavenger type (EDTA, DTPA, EDDS), concentration and pH were also investigated. Such analysis allowed to achieve extraction performance as high as 99 % at pH of the scavenger solution adjusted to 9. 4 and molar ratio of scavenger to copper of 10. Process integration is achieved by coupling this unit downstream to a flow reaction using homogeneous metal-based catalysis, i. e. presenting a continuous uninterrupted metal scavenging unit. The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction is studied in one-pot eliminating the need to isolate and handle potentially explosive azide. The triazole product is attained in flow with high yield of up to 92 % with 30 minute residence time.
