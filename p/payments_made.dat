5|$|Lack of {{evidence}} in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E

The contract expired on 30 June 1946, {{and was replaced}} by a new contract, which ended on 31 December 1946. A further $2,756,730.54 was paid under this contract, of which $161,636.10 was spent on construction and remodeling. An additional $49,509.83 was paid to the University of Chicago for the restoration of its facilities.|$|E

5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, although there was a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled.

At {{the end of a}} fiscal year, the National Assembly must review the budget for the next fiscal year within five months. After the review and passing of the national budget, it is published for public viewing. Local budgets follow the same procedures. The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus is the state bank of Belarus and is the office responsible for issuing the national currency, the Belarusian ruble.|$|E
5|$|The {{example of}} the royal exchequer's records {{eventually}} influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls {{are those of the}} Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and <b>payments</b> <b>made,</b> in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.|$|E

5|$|Under the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a City Controller {{to sit at}} {{the head}} of an {{independent}} auditing department. The Controller approves all <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> out of the city treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently elected official, the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the Democratic-led reform coalition of 1951. The Controller is required to audit the city finances annually and to have his work verified by a private accounting firm every three years.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

50|$|Payments to the lessor {{typically}} {{take three}} forms: bonus, rental, and royalties, as negotiated between the parties. The bonus is an up-front <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> {{at the time}} the lease takes effect. The rental is an annual <b>payment,</b> usually <b>made</b> until such time as the property begins producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.|$|R
5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage <b>payments,</b> <b>made</b> by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} {{officials}} in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti {{was the chief}} scholar among the ulama (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years {{at a time in}} contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who {{in the last years of}} his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.|$|E
5|$|They {{were the}} records of the yearly audits {{performed}} by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.|$|E

5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E
