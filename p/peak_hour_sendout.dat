30|$|DRM is {{the process}} of {{adjusting}} consumer’s demand in response to the price of energy and incentives from grid side. The generation unit sends their energy cost pattern of different time periods. The time in which power cost is high is called high <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> and the time in which power cost is low is called off <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> So during high <b>peak</b> <b>hour,</b> consumers can keep their flexible appliances off and run at low <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R

30|$|Morning and {{afternoon}} <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> {{are associated with}} an increased number of pedestrian transgressions [14]. Nevertheless, while Edquist, Hughes [7] observed more transgressions in afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> Metaxatos and Sriraj [1] demonstrated that transgressions in different times of the day correspond to pedestrian traffic volumes particularly high in the morning and more widely distributed in the evening <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R

40|$|As Vancouver’s ports become busier so too does local {{container}} truck traffic. Additional trucking exacerbates {{local road}} congestion during <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> a problem projected {{to increase in}} the future. The increased time spent in congestion also creates environmental concern as diesel trucks emit large amounts of pollutants. This study develops and assesses four policy options aimed at reducing container truck traffic in Vancouver during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> by using a longitudinal case study of Los Angeles. Data from Los Angeles indicate extending gate hours and charging container trucks fees during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> significantly shifted container truck traffic out of <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> Generated policy options considered in this study include: (1) continuing with the status quo; (2) initiating short-sea shipping; (3) extending terminal hours with and (4) without <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> fees.

50|$|Around {{the end of}} 2016, two-car trains started being {{deployed}} on both directions of the West Loop during the weekday <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> due to {{the increasing number of}} commuters living in new HDB flats located near Thanggam, Kupang and Farmway LRT Stations.

30|$|This {{intersection}} is signalized {{and operates}} {{at a fixed}} cycle length of 200  s. The phasing scheme is similar to Fig.  2. The queue length at the intersection along the flyover usually remains within 200  m. Sometimes, on rare occasions, it extends beyond 300  m and impacts the through movements on the expressway. During morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> the heavy traffic movements are {{in the direction of}} the central business district of Mumbai (i.e., south of the intersection) and the reverse trend prevails during afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> Hence, the westbound left-turn movements and eastbound right-turn movements are heavy during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> On the other hand, the northbound right-turn and left-turn movements are heavy during afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> The heavy movements during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> are served by two different phases, but in the afternoon, heavy movements are served by one phase. Moreover, any impact to the northbound right-turn and left-turn movements can affect the through movement on the expressway. Therefore, the period of afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> is considered as critical in evaluating the proposed layout.|$|R

40|$|<b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance is a {{relatively}} new Dutch mobility management measure. To reduce congestion frequent car drivers are given a financial reward for reducing the proportion of trips that they make during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> on a specific motorway section. Although previous studies show that employers are not eager to support mobility management measures, employers are nevertheless an important stakeholder. They can provide their employees with alternatives such as other travel times, work locations or travel modes and encourage their use. This paper investigates the attitudes of Dutch employers towards <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance. Exploring the factors that influence these attitudes may help to fully utilise employer support. The data from 103 employers were collected through a web questionnaire. A structural equation model on the employer support for <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance was estimated. The results demonstrate that the size of the organisation and sector only have an indirect effect on the support for <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance. Results reveal that most support for <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance can be expected from organisations who feel responsible for influencing the commuting behaviour of employees, that have human resource managers with a positive attitude towards <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance, with flexible working times and that have already implemented mobility management measures. The largest contribution to PHA that can be expected from employers is providing employees with flexible working times and encouraging employees to fully utilise this option as an alternative for driving in <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> This would not only be beneficial for PHA but {{for a wide range of}} mobility management initiatives as well.

In order to consider infrastructure planning parameters two different methods have been used, all based in the historical data of year 2007 : the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> movements and the airplane distribution, determined from the six peak hours; and the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> passenger distribution, determined from a FAA index.
