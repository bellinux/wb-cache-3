Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E

500|$|For centuries the Chinese {{approximated}} pi as 3; Liu Xin (d. AD23) {{made the}} first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.1457, {{but there is no}} record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure. In his work around 130, Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, <b>proportioning</b> the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724. In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 42:32. In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=D3; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio. Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional D3, hence V=D3 + D3 = D3. With the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is √8:√5. From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 (or approximately 3.162). Zhang also calculated pi as [...] = 3.1466 in his book Ling Xian (靈憲). In the 3rdcentury, Liu Hui made the calculation more accurate with his π algorithm, which allowed him to obtain the value 3.14159. Later, Zu Chongzhi (429–500) approximated pi as [...] or 3.141592, the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{example of}} a {{binomial}} distribution is the set of various possible outcomes, and their probabilities, {{for the number of}} heads observed when a (not necessarily fair) coin is flipped ten times. The observed binomial <b>proportion</b> is the fraction of the flips which turn out to be heads. Given this observed <b>proportion,</b> the confidence interval for the true <b>proportion</b> innate in that coin is a range of possible <b>proportions</b> which may contain the true <b>proportion.</b> A 95% confidence interval for the <b>proportion,</b> for instance, will contain the true <b>proportion</b> 95% of the times that the procedure for constructing the confidence interval is employed. Note that {{this does not mean that}} a calculated 95% confidence interval will contain the true <b>proportion</b> with 95% probability. Instead, one should interpret it as follows: the process of drawing a random sample and calculating an accompanying 95% confidence interval will generate a confidence interval that contains the true <b>proportion</b> in 95% of all cases. If we were to take 100 different samples and compute a 95% confidence interval for each sample, then (approximately) 95 of the 100 confidence intervals will contain the true <b>proportion.</b> In practice, however, we select one random sample and generate one confidence interval, which may or may not contain the true <b>proportion.</b> Each observed interval may over- or underestimate the true <b>proportion.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Pi {{calculated}} as : The ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Indians, and Greeks had long made approximations for π {{by the time}} the Chinese mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (c. 46 BC23 AD) improved the old Chinese approximation of simply 3 as π to 3.1547 as π (with evidence on vessels dating to the Wang Mang reign period, 923 AD, of other approximations of 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.1679). Next, Zhang Heng (78139 AD) made two approximations for π, by <b>proportioning</b> the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth as [...] = 3.1724 and using (after a long algorithm) the square root of 10, or 3.162. In his commentary on the Han Dynasty mathematical work The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) used various algorithms to render multiple approximations for pi at 3.142704, 3.1428, and 3.14159. Finally, the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429500) approximated pi to an even greater degree of accuracy, rendering it , a value known in Chinese as Milü ("detailed ratio"). This was the best rational approximation for pi with a denominator of up to four digits; the next rational number is , which is the best rational approximation. Zu ultimately determined the value for π to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927. Zu's approximation was the most accurate in the world, and would not be achieved elsewhere for another millennium, until Madhava of Sangamagrama and Jamshīd al-Kāshī in the early 15th century.|$|E
