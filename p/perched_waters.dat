40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1974. Bibliography: leaves 156 - 160. x, 160 leaves ill., mapsBasal groundwaters in the Honolulu {{area were}} studied by a {{combination}} of three methods: radiocarbon age dating, tritium tracing, and examination of chemical data. Basic data used in this effort consisted of isotopic and chemical data on water samples. Isotope data included radiocarbon, carbon 13, and tritium; chemical data were primarily chloride, bicarbonate and silica. Water samples were mostly from groundwater sources in the Honolulu area, Pearl Harbor area, and Windward Oahu. Method of collection as well as procedures and equipment used for the analyses were described. The main objective of the study was the determination of basal water radiocarbon ages; how they were obtained and how they related to other parameters such as tritium, chloride, location or depth of sampling. A general objective was to show that studies such as this one, based largely on isotopic analysis of water samples, can yield hydrologic and geohydrologic information that enhances the understanding of the dynamics of groundwater systems in general and that of basal groundwater systems in particular. Radiocarbon ages obtained refer to the average time basal water samples resided in the basal aquifers, i. e. the time elapsed between recharge and sampling. Age calculations were based on differences in radiocarbon activity between basal water samples {{on the one hand and}} the activity of a recharge reference on the other, this difference being due to loss of radiocarbon through radioactive decay. Radiocarbon activity of the recharge reference was obtained from radiocarbon data on dike waters, high level <b>perched</b> <b>waters</b> and others. Processes such as carbonate dissolution, carbonate exchange and salt water intermixing were examined in some detail because, if they occur, they alter the relative or absolute content of aqueous radiocarbon, thus resulting in false ages. On the basis of theoretical considerations and experimental data it was shown that the effects of such nonradiogenic processes in principle can be detected and adjusted for with the aid of carbon 13 data. No such adjustment was applied in calculating the majority of basal water radiocarbon ages because respective carbon 13 data and recharge reference carbon 13 data had distributions that largely overlapped each other. Averages of radiocarbon ages for Isopiestic Areas 1 ~o 3, called geochemical mean residence times, ranged between 270 and 550 years, whereas displacement mean residence times calculated from geologic and hydrologic data ranged between 30 and 40 years. On the basis of this and other observations, a hypothesis was advanced that old water from pre-development bottom storage is still being flushed out of some systems. In accordance with this hypothesis, it was concluded that during the period of study old stored water was discharged by several sources in Isopiestic Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 and, in particular, by sources in Areas 3 and 4. The amount of old stored water in the discharge from Kalihi Shaft varied as a function of time, a feature attributed to variations in pumping rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> {{bodies in the}} vicinity of the potential repository at Yucca Mountain has many implications, and however, it may provide insight into moisture movement, flow pathways, or surface infiltration history of the mountain. The first implication is that percolation flux does not travel vertically through the unsaturated zone to the water table, but has been trapped, blocked or diverted laterally. As a result, non-uniform recharge rates are expected at the water table. Another concern is that perched zones may divert water around low-permeability zeolitic lenses underlying the potential repository horizon. By-passing of these units, which are thought to have substantial capacity to retard radionuclide transport, could have important implications for the capability of the geologic system to mitigate radionuclide releases to the environment. We have conducted a series of 3 -D modeling simulations to investigate the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> occurrences at the Yucca Mountain site, using a numerical code and available <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> data from six boreholes. A spatially varying surface infiltration map (Flint et al., 1996) is used to describe areally distributed net infiltration at the model land surface. <b>Perched</b> <b>water</b> data observed in the field were used to calibrate the model in terms of matrix and fracture permeabilities, capillary functions, and relative permeabilities of gas within the perched zones. Calibrated parameter values were within the range of field and laboratory measurements. The steady-state simulation results are in agreement with the observed <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> data in terms of <b>water</b> saturation and <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> locations. Furthermore, the results of a transient numerical pumping test conducted, using a 3 -D submodel, matched water level data observed during field pumping tests. <b>Perched</b> <b>water</b> may occur where percolation flux exceeds the capacity of the geologic media to transmit flux in unsaturated zones. The conceptual model of water movement {{in the vicinity of}} investigating the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> zones indicates that: (1) no large-scale connected fractures intersect the underlying low-permeability units, and (2) both vertical and horizontal permeabilities within the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> zone must be small when compared with measurements outside these zones. This modeling study indicates that the key factors necessary to create a perched-water zone using a numerical model are: (1) a <b>water</b> <b>perching</b> geologic structure with low permeability zones or a capillary barrier underlain and surrounding, (2) weak capillary forces under high saturation condition within and near perched-water zones, and (3) sufficient water infiltration rates...|$|R

40|$|During {{significant}} precipitation events {{water that}} does not directly run off infiltrates the soil. If the soils are thin or overlie an impermeable layer, the water will percolate to the impermeable layer and build-up forming a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table. If the build-up of infiltrating water generates sufficient pore fluid pressure, the shear strength of the material will be reduced, resulting in slope failure. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the conditions resulting in periodic slope instability on gently sloped terrain. It was hypothesized that that a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table, generated by excessive or intense precipitation events, affects the slope stability in the area and results in intermittent movement of the landslide. Data-gathering activities included monitoring precipitation, measuring the height and extent of the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table using a piezometer array, interpreting the location and morphology of impermeable boundaries with ground penetrating radar and assessing relative slide movements. Field measurements suggest that there was a correlation between the amount of rainfall received and the change in height of the rise of water above the impermeable surface; a slope-stability analysis was performed to quantify probable conditions resulting in stability. Conditions that lead to slope instability on gentle slopes in this study were identified as precipitation falling on soils with high antecedent moisture conditions, causing the formation of a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{that follows}} the clearing of tropical forest for cattle pasture is associated with lower soil hydraulic conductivity and increased frequency and volume of overland flow. We investigated the frequency of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> tables, overland flow and stormflow in an Amazon forest and in an adjacent 25 -year-old pasture cleared from the same forest. We compared the results with the frequencies of these phenomena estimated from comparisons of rainfall intensity and soil hydraulic conductivity. The frequency of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> tables based on rainfall intensity and soil hydraulic conductivity was expected to double in pasture compared with forest. This corresponded closely with an approximate doubling of the frequency of stormflow and overland flow in pasture. In contrast, the stormflow volume in pasture increased 17 -fold. This disproportional increase of stormflow resulted from overland flow generation over large areas of pasture, while overland flow generation in the forest was spatially limited and was observed only very near the stream channel. In both catchments, stormflow was generated by saturation excess because of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> tables and near-surface groundwater levels. Stormflow was occasionally generated in the forest by rapid return flow from macropores, while slow return flow from a continuous <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table was {{more common in the}} pasture.

40|$|Natural {{enrichment}} of ²³⁴U {{with respect}} to ²³⁸U was investigated in <b>perched</b> <b>water,</b> vadose zone pore waters, and secondary minerals. The activity ratio (AR) for dissolved ²³⁴U increased from about 1. 4 in runoff to > 6 in <b>perched</b> <b>water.</b> The AR in the vadose zone increased sharply at a transition that correlated with increased magnetic susceptibility and decreasing hydraulic conductivity. This was evidently caused by auto—oxidative selective leaching controlled by matrix saturation. The direct recoil fractionation mechanism has been proposed for tuffs on the Nevada Test Site, and could imply enhanced retardation of U. Direct recoil was evaluated using a steady state isotopic mass balance formulated to represent matrix pore water, and including first order sorption and selective leaching. Matrix sorption parameters were estimated by selectively leaching intact core with hydroxylamine. Much U was recovered, fractionated similarly to pore water. Interpreting this as isotopic exchange limited by Fickian transport within a sorbent layer, the rate constant and distribution coefficient were estimated. Uranium—series analysis of fracture—lining MnO₂ indicated that isotopic exchange was operant. The isotopic mass balance showed that direct recoil is a minor contribution to fractionation, so the predominant mechanism is selective leaching. This result depends mainly on the sorption rate constant, and where direct recoil is likely such as in roll—front deposits, it implies that the rate constant is smaller than in typical oxidizing waters. Extrapolating matrix properties to formation scale transport, an upper bound on formation scale sorption was inferred from the isotopic mass balance. Formation scale sorption is greater where the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table lies in more porous, permeable tuff. The layer diffusion model predicts that the effective sorption rate constant decreases significantly for thicker sorbent layers. Thus although fracture lining MnO₂ minerals are common at Yucca Mountain, U retardation may be strongly rate limited. Elevated AR's (> 5) generally signify conditions favorable to U retardation, based on hydraulic isolation from recharge. Elevated vadose zone AR's do not necessarily signify the former presence of <b>perched</b> <b>water,</b> but could be interpreted that way at Yucca Mountain if similar fractionation is not found where past perching is unlikely...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perched</b> <b>water</b> zones {{have been}} {{identified}} in the fractured, welded tuff in the semiarid to arid environments of Yucca Mountain, Nevada and near Superior, Arizona. An understanding of the formation of such zones is necessary in order to predict where future <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> might form at Yucca Mountain, the proposed site of a high-level nuclear waste repository. The formation or growth of a perched zone above a repository is one factor of the factors to be considered in the risk assessment of the Yucca Mountain site. The Apache Leap Research Site (ALRS) near Superior, Arizona is a natural analog to the Yucca Mountain site in terms of geology, hydrology, and climate. <b>Perched</b> <b>water</b> has been identified over an area of at least 16 km² in the Apache Leap Tuff, a mid- Miocene fractured, welded ash-flow tuff. A primary goal of this investigation was to characterize the physical and hydrologic properties of the tuff in the region above and including the perched zone, and to evaluate those characteristics to develop a model for a perching mechanism in the tuff. A second goal was to determine what fraction of water entering a watershed reaches the subsurface, to potentially recharge the perched zone. The Apache Leap Tuff has been subject to considerable devitrification and vapor phase crystallization, which dominate the character of the rock. With depth to the perched zone, pumice fragments become increasingly flattened and segregated; the pumice fragments are the primary locations of porosity in the rock, therefore porosity also becomes greatly reduced with depth, {{to the extent that the}} rock matrix is virtually impermeable at the <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> zone. Fractures are the primary pathways by which water moves through the rock; fracture hydraulic conductivity values were determined to be nine orders of magnitude greater than measured matrix hydraulic conductivity at the perched zone. An increase in fracture filling by silica mineralization beneath the perched zone reduces the secondary permeability, enhancing the formation of <b>perched</b> <b>water.</b> Thus, the primary mechanisms for the formation of the perched zone include fracture flow bringing water into the subsurface, combined with extremely low matrix hydraulic conductivity at depth, and reduced secondary permeability by filled fractures and lower fracture density. Water budgets were calculated for two years in a 51. 4 -ha watershed. Direct measurements were made of precipitation and runoff', evapotranspiration was both directly measured, and modeled based on measurement of a number of weather parameters.

40|$|Understanding how {{water and}} solutes {{move through the}} vadose zone is {{necessary}} to make effective remedial action decisions where contaminants were spilled or leaked at the ground surface or were buried in shallow land-disposal sites. In layered, heterogeneous systems, high contrasts in hydraulic conductivity can lead to formation of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> zones, and enhanced lateral spread of contamination. Two conceptual models are considered solute for migration through the vadose zone. In the diffuse flow conceptual model, <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> zones accumulate until the head over the perching layer becomes sufficient to drive the infiltration through the perching layer. In the preferential flow conceptual model, <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> moves laterally until a path around the perching layer is encountered. Preferential flow paths can enhance contaminant migration because greater moisture saturation leads to higher advective velocities, and the preferential flow paths bypass low permeability layers with higher sorption capacity. Monitoring wells and instrumented boreholes were installed around a newly constructed industrial-waste percolation pond and an ephemeral river that lie over a 150 -m-thick layered vadose zone. Background data gathered before discharge to the pond began show the presence of at least one, and possibly two, deep perched zones.

There is a deeper zone at 90 -m bls, southeast of the pond, in the direction away from the river. The river last contained water in May 2000, two years before data collection began in the summer of 2002. Two significant implications of this are (1) <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> persists for several years in the absence of surface recharge, and (2) lateral migration of <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> extends on the order of a kilometer from the river. Hydrological data collected and analyzed since discharge to the pond began in October 2002 indicate a high degree of spatial variability within the shallow subsurface, resulting in directional flow in a southern direction from discharge to the south cell and a northern direction from discharge to the north cell. Water arrival was observed at deeper locations before shallower ones, and lateral transport was observed not only at basalt/interbed interfaces but also within thick basalt layers. Recharge was observed as deep as 87 -m bls and as far away as the Big Lost River 860 -m to the north. New perched zones formed at the first alluvium/basalt interface on {{the southern end of the}} pond after discharge began to the south cell and at deeper lithologic interfaces where monitoring wells were completed on the northern, southern, and western perimeter of the pond. Preferential flow was found to be the most prevalent type of flow at the Vadose Zone Research Park, in contrast to the current INEEL conceptual model of vadose zone transport that adopts the diffuse flow model for contaminant transport predictions...|$|R
50|$|A <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table (or <b>perched</b> aquifer) is an aquifer {{that occurs}} above the {{regional}} water table, in the vadose zone. This occurs {{when there is}} an impermeable layer of rock or sediment (aquiclude) or relatively impermeable layer (aquitard) above the main water table/aquifer but {{below the surface of the}} land. If a perched aquifer's flow intersects the Earth's dry surface, at a valley wall for example, the water is discharged as a spring.|$|R

It explains historical {{changes in the}} Australian landscape affecting vegetation, drainage, and morphology, including the typical <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> flows. NSF management techniques are analysed as structural and non-structural and, {{in the opinion of}} the CSIRO Expert Panel, both produce manifold benefits in terms of erosive water velocities, aquifer recharge, soil structure, erosion, compaction, and pasture productivity, to name a few...|$|R

The region is subject to very heavy precipitation, so the subsoil drainage system is designed to withstand cloudburst, such that play can start within minutes of a rain stoppage.|$|R
