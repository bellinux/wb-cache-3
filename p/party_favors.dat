5|$|Festivities {{formally}} {{begin in}} the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6:00p.m. ET. <b>Party</b> <b>favors</b> are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians.

25|$|Another {{attraction}} of the market {{is that it is}} surrounded by a number of small specialty shops and many street vendors. Most of the specialty shops are furniture stores or those related to items for formal occasions, such as weddings and quinceañeras. Most sell women’s dresses in fantasy and princess styles for these events, as well as baptisms, presentations and many more, but there are also shops dedicated to elaborate decorations and <b>party</b> <b>favors</b> (either made or supplies to be made) along with some related services such as photography. Most of these stores are located on Honduras, Allende and Chile Streets with some in Building 2 on the south side.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>favors</b> {{raising the}} minimum wage and {{believes}} that all Americans {{have the right to}} a fair wage. They call for a $10.10/hour national minimum wage and think {{the minimum wage}} should be adjusted regularly. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed. In May 2017, senate Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024, and marks a leftward turn in Democratic economic policies.|$|E
25|$|The other {{aisles of}} the market are also {{dedicated}} {{to a number of}} specialties. Some areas are dedicated to pottery and dishes for everyday use, much of which is from the state of Guanajuato. These include plates, bowls, jars for atole, coffee cups, large platters and more. While traditional pottery still dominates, it is also interspersed with cheaper glass items as well. Another traditional area sells toys and <b>party</b> <b>favors.</b> Traditional wooden, cloth and clay toys can still be found, although they are slowly being replaced with cheaper plastic ones. These include dolls, tops, yo yos, cup-and-ball and many more. This area also carries party supplies such as hats, decorations and piñatas, mostly for children’s events. The area also contains costumes for children, such as animals like rabbits and bears as well as princesses and ballerinas. There are also traditional “indito” (little Indian) outfits mostly used in schools on Corpus Christi.|$|E

50|$|Several famous Muppet {{characters}} are {{off on a}} long-awaited long cruise. Unfortunately for them, the magnificent Muppets find themselves stuck on the bottom deck of the boat. They develop a plan to get out, however, in which they set up fun mini-games in their cabins to earn <b>party</b> <b>favors.</b> Players use the <b>party</b> <b>favors</b> to unlock mini-games and battle their way up five decks, eventually leading to First Class.|$|E

5000|$|Capital {{gains taxes}} are disproportionately paid by high-income households, {{since they are}} more likely to own assets that {{generate}} the taxable gains. While this supports the argument that payers of capital gains taxes have more [...] "ability to pay,"it also means that the payers are especially able to defer or avoid the tax, as it only comes due if and when the owner sells the asset. The disproportionate incidence on high-income households means that most debate on tax rates is partisan. The Republican <b>Party</b> <b>favors</b> lower rates, whereas the Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>favors</b> higher rates.|$|E
50|$|Its {{followers}} {{were generally}} known simply {{for the first}} portion of the name Fareynikte (פֿאַראײניקטע) - 'United'. Politically the <b>party</b> <b>favored</b> national personal autonomy for the Jewish community. The party upheld the ideas of building a secular Jewish community.|$|R

5000|$|Guests {{should not}} expect to receive <b>party</b> <b>favors.</b> It is {{considered}} improper for hosts to announce {{that they have made}} a charitable donation [...] "in lieu of favors" [...] as this is the broadcasting of a private matter which would normally not be discussed with others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>party</b> <b>favored</b> {{the idea}} of a Jewish National Assembly (a Seym).
