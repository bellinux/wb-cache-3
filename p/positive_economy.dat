60|$|There is {{one method}} of {{preserving}} books, which, alas, only tempts the borrower, the stealer, the rat, and the book-worm; {{but which is}} absolutely necessary as a defence against dust and neglect. This is binding. The bookbinder's art too often destroys books when the artist is careless, {{but it is the}} only mode of preventing our volumes from falling to pieces, and from being some day disregarded as waste-paper. A well-bound book, especially a book from a famous collection, has its price, even if its literary contents be of trifling value. A leather coat fashioned by Derome, or Le Gascon, or Duseuil, will win respect and careful handling for one specimen of an edition whereof all the others have perished. Nothing is so slatternly as the aspect of a book merely stitched, in the French fashion, when the threads begin to stretch, and the paper covers to curl and be torn. Worse consequences follow, whole sheets are lost, the volume becomes worthless, and the owner must often be at the expense of purchasing another copy, if he can, for the edition may now be out of print. Thus binding of some sort not only adds a grace to the library, presenting to the eye the cheerful gilded rows of our volumes, but is a <b>positive</b> <b>economy.</b> In the case of our cloth-covered English works, the need of binding is not so immediately obvious. But our publishers have a taste for clothing their editions in tender tones of colour, stamped, often, with landscapes printed in gold, in white, or what not. Covers like this, may or may not please the eye while they are new and clean, but they soon become dirty and hideous. When a book is covered in cloth of a good dark tint it may be allowed to remain unbound, but the primrose and lilac hues soon call out for the aid of the binder.|$|E

40|$|We find {{substantial}} <b>positive</b> <b>economies</b> {{of scale}} in asset management using a newly available pension plan database: Large plans outperform small ones by 30 - 40 bps/year. We test whether plans make hypothesized {{changes on the}} intensive margin (within asset class) or the extensive margin (across asset classes) as they grow, and find that both channels are important. On the intensive margin, larger plans utilize more internal and passive management, which leads to cost savings that improve net returns by about 13 bps per year. On the extensive margin, larger plans dramatically overweight areas where we expect negotiating power to matter (where costs are high and where there is substantial variation in costs across plans). There are substantial <b>positive</b> <b>economies</b> of scale in both before- and after-cost returns in these areas, particularly in private equity and real estate, where shifting from smallest to largest quintile increases returns by up to 7 % per year. We also find evidence of organizational diseconomies of scale, as larger assets at the plan level reduce net returns in an asset class, but not by enough to offset the economies of scale arising from larger investments in the asset class. All in all, diseconomies of scale documented in mutual and hedge fund literature do not necessarily translate to more flexible, multi-asset-class institutions such as pension plans.

40|$|To {{what degree}} should {{societies}} allow inequality to be inherited? What role should estate taxation play {{in shaping the}} intergenerational transmission of welfare? We explore these questions by modeling altruistically-linked individuals who experience privately observed taste or productivity shocks. Our <b>positive</b> <b>economy</b> is identical to models with infinite-lived individuals where efficiency requires immiseration: inequality grows without bound and everyone's consumption converges to zero. However, under an intergenerational interpretation, previous work only characterizes {{a particular set of}} Pareto-efficient allocations: those that value only the initial generation's welfare. We study other efficient allocations where the social welfare criterion values future generations directly, placing a positive weight on their welfare so that the effective social discount rate is lower than the private one. For any such difference in social and private discounting we find that consumption exhibits mean-reversion and that a steady-state, cross-sectional distribution for consumption and welfare exists, where no one is trapped at misery. The optimal allocation can then be implemented by a combination of income and estate taxation. We find that the optimal estate tax is progressive...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{progress}} operations management theory and practice by organising contributions to knowledge production, in industrial sustainability, from disparate researcher communities. It addresses the principal question “What scholarly dialogues can be explicated in the emerging research field of industrial sustainability?” and sub-questions: what are the descriptive characteristics of the evidence base? and what thematic lines of scientific inquiry underpin the body of knowledge? Design/methodology/approach Using an evidenced-based approach, a systematic review (SR) of 574 articles from 62 peer-reviewed scientific journals associated with industrial sustainability is conducted. Findings This paper distinguishes three prevailing dialogues in the field of industrial sustainability, and uses Kuhn’s theory of paradigms to propose its pre-paradigmatic scientific status. The three dialogues: “productivity and innovation”, “corporate citizenship” and “economic resilience” are conjectured to privilege efficiency strategies as a mode of incremental reductionism. Industrial sustainability espouses the grand vision of a generative, restorative and net <b>positive</b> <b>economy,</b> and calls for a future research trajectory to address institutional and systemic issues regarding scaling-up and transition, through transformative strategies.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use {{datasets}} from the 1995 and 2000 Community Water Supply surveys to examine the production costs of water supply systems. We first estimate the economies of scale in water supply by estimating the total unit cost {{as well as individual}} component cost elasticities. For total unit cost elasticity, we find that a 1 % increase in production reduces unit costs by a statistically significant 0. 16 %. For individual component cost elasticities, we find that higher economies of scale exist in capital costs, outside costs, other costs, and materials costs; labor costs and energy costs exhibit lower but still <b>positive</b> <b>economies</b> of scale. These economies of scale may reflect production economies or suggest that larger systems are better than smaller systems at bargaining and can obtain inputs at a lower unit cost.

This is regulatory impact assessment, i. e., the process through which regulators appraise {{the costs and benefits}} of proposed regulations and how proposals affect different stakeholders. Since public officers are the analysts, the ways in which evidence is used, edited, abused, and translated into policy are determined by political relationships between the bureaucracy and its political master. Consequently, instead of looking exclusively at instrumental usages of evidence or lack of (typically by measuring if decisions are sensitive to empirics), we borrow from the <b>positive</b> political <b>economy</b> of delegation the hypothesis that evidence is an important component of control procedures. Rational politicians – <b>positive</b> political <b>economy</b> goes – design administrative processes based on impact assessment to solve problems of political uncertainty and maximise power over the long-term.

Under the cooperative rule, publicness of the household good is necessary and sufficient for <b>positive</b> <b>economies</b> of size and for these to increase with family size. This no longer holds true under the non-cooperative rule where negative economies of size may appear even in the case where the household consumption good is purely public. The results {{suggest that it is}} the inefficiency of the non-cooperative rule that is at the origin of the problem. Furthermore comparison of the scale factors' values indicates that the cooperative rule leads to less generous scales than the non-cooperative one.

40|$|When {{public goods}} are joint outputs of {{agricultural}} production, {{there is a}} trade-off between agricultural and non-agricultural provision of the public good. The principle of minimal price distortion in the reform of agricultural policies {{has led to a}} theoretical recommendation that public goods, if under-provided at agricultural free market level, should be promoted through non agricultural policies instead of agricultural policies. We show that the economies of scope between the agricultural production and the joint public good {{play a key role in}} determining the optimal way of providing this latter. If the policy designed is a non-agricultural policy, the production cost of the public good is higher than with an agricultural policy. If the policy designed is an agricultural policy, the production cost is lower but generates market effects. Under the assumption of strictly <b>positive</b> <b>economies</b> of scope, we show that the optimal policy is a mix of agricultural and non-agricultural policy. We confirm this result in the two-country case, demonstrating the optimal level of agricultural support for public good provision is strictly positive and lower than in the case of one country. multifunctionality, jointness, coupled support, protectionism, public good, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) has mobilized {{economic}} theory {{in order to}} encourage E. U.

In this case, the increase of the degree of discrimination of the abatement effort is required only if it generates significant <b>positive</b> <b>economies.</b> Our theoretical and empirical results have shown that the discrimination advantage becomes insignificant for either very demanding or very little demanding ecological standards and varies according to the polluters' profile.
