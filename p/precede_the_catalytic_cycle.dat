A simplified model of <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> was found to describe the experimental data and the rate constants of the individual steps were used to calculate Michaelis parameters that agree with the direct determinations. In spite of many studies on selected reactions from <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle,</b> this is amongst the first efforts to provide a comprehensive kinetic description of the reactions of BSAO, whose results can {{be compared with the}} steady-state parameters. The reoxidation reaction by dioxygen is more complex than previously thought, in agreement with a recent report [Su, Q. & Klinman, J. P. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 12513 - 12525], and occurs in at least two steps whose rate constants, previously undetermined, have been measured. The reaction of the oxidized enzyme with the amine substrate is poorly determined in this type of experiment, thus irreversible combination with aromatic hydrazine inhibitors was used as a model system, demonstrating that the mechanism and rate constants of their reaction is fully compatible with an accurate description of <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> with <b>the</b> physiological substrate. These results constitute a simplified, yet complete and consistent, description of <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> and offer an interesting comparison with those obtained on plant amine oxidases; two steps of <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> are significantly slower in BSAO than in pea seedling or lentil seedling amine oxidases, namely the reoxidation and the trans-iminative proton abstraction occurring in the enzyme-substrate complex.

40|$|AbstractSeveral issues {{relevant}} to the current studies of cytochrome c oxidase catalytic mechanism are discussed. The following points are raised. (1) The terminology currently used to describe <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> of cytochrome oxidase is outdated and rather confusing. Presumably, it would be revised so as to share nomenclature of the intermediates with other oxygen-reactive heme enzymes like P 450 or peroxidases. (2) A “catalytic cycle” of cytochrome oxidase involving complete reduction of the enzyme by 4 electrons followed by oxidation by O 2 is a chimera composed artificially from two partial reactions, reductive and oxidative phases, that never operate together as a true multi-turnover <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> <b>The</b> 4 e− reduction–oxidation cycle would not serve a paradigm for oxygen reduction mechanism and protonmotive function of cytochrome oxidase. (3) The foremost role of the K-proton channel in <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> may consist in securing faultless delivery of protons for heterolytic O–O bond cleavage in the oxygen-reducing site, minimizing the danger of homolytic scission reaction route. (4) Protonmotive mechanism of cytochrome oxidase may vary notably for the different single-electron steps in <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|R

40|$|P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP-dependent {{hydrophobic}} {{natural product}} anticancer drug efflux pump whose overexpression confers multidrug resistance to tumor cells. The work reported here {{deals with the}} elucidation of the energy requirement for substrate interaction with Pgp during <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> We show that the Kd (412 nM) of the substrate analogue [125 I]iodoarylazidoprazoin for Pgp is not altered {{by the presence of}} the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide 5 ′-adenylylimididiphosphate and vanadate (Kd = 403 nM). Though binding of nucleotide per se does not affect interactions with the substrate, ATP hydrolysis results in a dramatic conformational change where the affinity of [125 I]iodoarylazidoprazoin for Pgp trapped in transition-state conformation (Pgp⋅ADP⋅vanadate) is reduced > 30 -fold. To transform Pgp from this intermediate state of low affinity for substrate to <b>the</b> next <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle,</b> i. e., a conformation that binds substrate with high affinity, requires conditions that permit ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, there is an inverse correlation (R 2 = 0. 96) between 8 AzidoADP (or ADP) release and the recovery of substrate binding. These results suggest that the release of nucleotide is necessary for reactivation but not sufficient. The hydrolysis of additional molecule(s) of ATP (or 8 AzidoATP) is obligatory for <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> to advance to completion. These data are consistent with the observed stoichiometry of two ATP molecules hydrolyzed for the transport of every substrate molecule.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cytochrome}} oxidase family of heme-copper oxidases {{has been the}} subject of intense kinetic and mechanistic enquiry. Much of this work has focussed on transient kinetic studies of the partial reactions of the enzyme with the goal being to build a kinetic model describing <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> that <b>the</b> enzyme undergoes to direct the oxidation of substrate, reduction of oxygen and vectorial proton transfer. A key aspect of such a model is to define the structures of each of the intermediate forms the enzyme takes up as it traverses <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> One complication that has been prevalent with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is the existence of structural variants of the enzyme, as isolated, that may not be participants in catalysis.
