She developed the concept for a new rocket engine, the hydrazine resistojet, and she proposed the use of a single propellant because of the value and simplicity that it would provide. Her invention resulted in not only higher engine performance but also increased reliability of the propulsion system. Due to the reduction this created in <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> requirements this resulted in either increased payload capability or extended mission life.|$|E
25|$|The Harrier {{is usually}} flown in STOVL mode, which enables it {{to carry a}} higher fuel or weapon load over a given distance. In V/STOL the VTOL {{aircraft}} moves horizontally along the runway before taking off using vertical thrust. This gives aerodynamic lift as well as thrust lift and permits taking off with heavier loads and is more efficient. When landing the aircraft is much lighter due {{to the loss of}} <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> and a controlled vertical landing is possible.|$|E

40|$|A two-dimensional, two-temperature, single fluid MHD {{code was}} used to predict the {{performance}} of cylindrical, self-field magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters operated with argon, lithium, and hydrogen propellants. A thruster stability equation was determined relating maximum stable J(sup 2) /m values to cylindrical thruster geometry and propellant species. The maximum value of J(sup 2) /m was found to scale as the inverse of the <b>propellant</b> molecular <b>weight</b> to the 0. 57 power, in rough agreement with limited experimental data which scales as the inverse square root of the <b>propellant</b> molecular <b>weight.</b> A general equation which relates total thrust to electromagnetic thrust, <b>propellant</b> molecular <b>weight,</b> and J(sup 2) /m was determined using reported thrust values for argon and hydrogen and calculated thrust values for lithium. In addition to argon, lithium, and hydrogen, the equation accurately predicted thrust for ammonia at sufficiently high J(sup 2) /m values. A simple algorithm is suggested {{to aid in the}} preliminary design of cylindrical, self-field MPD thrusters. A brief example is presented to illustrate the use of the algorithm in the design of a low power MPD thruster...|$|R

50|$|If it {{were not}} for air {{resistance}} and the reduction of propellant during flight, specific impulse would be a direct measure of the engine's efficiency in converting <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> or mass into forward momentum.|$|E
25|$|It {{might be}} thought that adding power {{generation}} capacity is helpful, and although initially this can improve performance, this inevitably increases {{the weight of}} the power source, and eventually the mass of the power source and the associated engines and <b>propellant</b> dominates the <b>weight</b> of the vehicle, and then adding more power gives no significant improvement.|$|R
40|$|The nuclear rocket is {{potentially}} capable of much higher specific impulse than any chemically fueled rocket, {{because of the}} high energy content per unit mass of the fissionable material. While a part of this potential can be realized by use of a low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>propellant</b> heated by solid fuel plates, it seems clear that the full potential can be realized only if the fissionable material can be retained in gaseous form, and its fission energy transferred directly to the propellant. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} liquid {{rocket engine}} design, performance, weight, envelope, and operational characteristics were evaluated {{for a variety}} of candidate engines for use in mixed-mode, single-stage-to-orbit applications. Propellant property and performance data were obtained for candidate Mode 1 fuels which included: RP- 1, RJ- 5, hydrazine, monomethyl-hydrazine, and methane. The common oxidizer was liquid oxygen. Oxygen, the candidate Mode 1 fuels, and hydrogen were evaluated as thrust chamber coolants. Oxygen, methane, and hydrogen were found to be the most viable cooling candidates. Water, lithium, and sodium-potassium were also evaluated as auxiliary coolant systems. Water proved to be the best of these, but the system was heavier than those systems which cooled with the engine <b>propellants.</b> Engine <b>weight</b> and envelope parametric data were established for candidate Mode 1, Mode 2, and dual-fuel engines.

50|$|A {{small arms}} proof round is loaded {{to a higher}} than normal service pressure, {{stressing}} both the gun barrel and breech during firing. This can {{be due to a}} heavy projectile fired using the standard propelling charge, the standard projectile fired with a different <b>propellant</b> type or <b>weight,</b> or combinations of charge and bullet weight to give the required proofing pressure. Minimum proof testing pressures are specified by the owner of the cartridge specification, such as C.I.P. or SAAMI for most commercial cartridges or NATO EPVAT testing for appropriate military cartridges.|$|R

The series of experiments performed appear to promise advantages over previously proposed schemes in terms of <b>propellant</b> economy, system <b>weight,</b> reliability, and safety. The simulation tests established the feasibility of the proposed maneuvering concept by showing that test subjects were able to place their bodies sufficiently near the reference position to avoid excessive angular momentum build-up; no difficulties were encountered in selecting self-rotation maneuvers suitable for effecting desired changes in orientation; and the execution of these maneuvers produced predicted reorientations without tiring the test subject significantly...|$|R

50|$|Lower rocket stages usually use {{high-density}} (low volume {{per unit}} mass) propellants {{due to their}} lighter tankage to <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> ratios and because higher performance propellants require higher expansion ratios for maximum performance than can be attained when operated in atmosphere. Thus, the Saturn V first stage used kerosene-liquid oxygen rather than the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen used on its upper stages. Similarly, the Space Shuttle used high-thrust, high-density solid rocket boosters for its lift-off with the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen Space Shuttle Main Engines used partly for lift-off but primarily for orbital insertion.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{propellant}} is normally measured either in units of mass or weight. If mass is used, specific impulse is an impulse per unit mass, which dimensional analysis shows to have units of speed, and so specific impulses are often measured in {{meters per second}} and are often termed effective exhaust velocity. However, if <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> is used, an impulse divided by a force (weight) {{turns out to be}} a unit of time, and so specific impulses are measured in seconds. These two formulations are both widely used and differ from each other by a factor of g0, the dimensioned constant of gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth.|$|E

5000|$|Specific impulse (usually {{abbreviated}} Isp) is {{a measure}} of the efficiency of rocket and jet engines. By definition, it is the total impulse (or change in momentum) delivered per unit of propellant consumed and is dimensionally equivalent to the generated thrust divided by the <b>propellant</b> mass or <b>weight</b> flow rate. If mass (kilogram or slug) is used as the unit of propellant, then specific impulse has units of velocity. If weight (newton or pound) is used instead, then specific impulse has units of time (seconds). Multiplying flow rate by the standard gravity (g0) converts specific impulse from the mass basis to the weight basis.|$|R
50|$|A low-propellant space drive {{has long}} been a goal for space exploration, since the <b>propellant</b> is dead <b>weight</b> that must be lifted and {{accelerated}} with the ship all the way from launch until the moment it is used (see Tsiolkovsky rocket equation). Gravity assists, solar sails, and beam-powered propulsion from a spacecraft-remote location such as the ground or in orbit, are useful because they allow a ship to gain speed without propellant. However, some of these methods do not work in deep space. Shining a light out of the ship provides a small force from radiation pressure, i.e., using photons as a form of propellant, but the force is far too weak (for a given amount of input power) to be useful in practice.|$|R
50|$|The P80 is {{the first}} stage of VEGA, its name is derived from the design phase <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> of 80 tons that was later {{increased}} to 88 tons. The P80 includes a thrust vector control (TVC) system (developed and made in Belgium by SABCA) consisting of two electromechanical actuators that operate a movable nozzle with flexible joint using lithium ion batteries. The 3 m diameter case is composed of graphite epoxy filament wound case and low density rubber is used for the internal insulation. The nozzle is made of light low-cost carbon phenolic material; a consumable casing is used for the igniter. The solid propellant loaded has low binder content and high aluminium percentage (HTPB 1912).|$|E
50|$|The Star 37FM {{rocket motor}} was {{developed}} and qualified for use as an apogee kick motor on FLTSATCOM. The motor is a replacement for the Star 37E Delta, which has been discontinued. The Nozzle assembly uses a 3D carbon-carbon throat and a carbon-phenolic exit cone. Maximum <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> is 2350 pounds, while the motor has been qualified for propellant off-loading to 2257 pounds. The Star 37XFP rocket motor has been qualified as the orbit insertion motor for Rockwell International's (now Boeing) Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), and as the apogee motor for the RCA SATCOM Ku-Band satellite. The Star 37XFP motor {{can be used as}} a replacement for the Star 37F motor, which has been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{sea level}} test stand may be {{designed}} to restrain the rocket engine in either a horizontal or vertical position. Liquid rocket engines are usually fired in a vertical position because the propellant pump intakes are designed to draw fuel from the bottoms of the fuel tanks. The effect of the <b>propellant</b> <b>weight</b> on the thrust measurement system (TMS) must be accounted for as the engine is firing. The rocket exhaust is directed into a flame bucket or trench. The flame trench is designed to redirect the hot exhaust to a safe direction and is protected by a water deluge system that both cools the exhaust and also reduces the sound pressure level (loudness). The sound pressure level of large rocket engines has been measured at greater than 200 decibels — one of the loudest man-made sounds on earth.|$|E
40|$|A {{stability}} equation relating thruster discharge current, argon propellant {{mass flow}} rate, and electrode geometry has been solved {{for a variety}} of cylindrical self-field MPD thruster configurations and discharge currents. Realistic values for cathode emission current densities were used to provide additional constraints on the thruster geometries. A two-dimensional MPD code was employed to provide better estimates of the maximum achievable specific impulse, thrust, and flow efficiency for cases of interest. The model results indicate that long life, cylindrical self-field MPD thrusters operated with argon propellant {{may not be able to}} provide specific impulse values in excess of 2100 s. Alternate electrode geometries, applied magnetic fields, and/or low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>propellants</b> may be necessary to achieve higher values of specific impulse...|$|R

Comparison between the constant reverse gravity acceleration and impulsive reverse gravity acceleration {{to be used for}} the activation of propellant resettlement, it shows that impulsive reverse gravity thrust is superior to constant reverse gravity thrust for liquid reorientation in a reduced gravity environment. Comparison among impulsive reverse gravity thrust with 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10 Hz frequencies for liquid filled level in the range between 30 to 80 percent, it shows that the selection of 1. 0 Hz frequency impulsive thrust over the other frequency ranges of impulsive thrust is most proper based on the present study...|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} sixty-five guns were built by Skoda. The first {{thirteen}} {{were for the}} Radetzky-class, while the last fifty-two guns were for the Tegetthoff-class. Only the Tegetthoff-class carried the K10 guns. The K10 differing from the earlier guns by having a 5 cm longer firing chamber to accommodate a larger <b>propellant</b> charge. Otherwise <b>weights,</b> dimensions and ballistic performance for the two series of guns were very similar. Both guns used Krupp horizontal sliding breech blocks with separate loading metallic cased charges and projectiles. [...] Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and ammunition, the 30.5 cm /45 used separate loading ammunition with charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation.|$|R
50|$|The M196 tracer {{cartridge}} (54-grain bullet) 5.56mmx45mm NATO {{was developed}} for the original M16 rifle and {{is compatible with the}} M16A1 barrel also using 1:12 rifling twist. It has a red tip and is designed to trace out to 500 yards, and trajectory match the M193 (56-grain) ball cartridge, which has no tip color. Trajectory match, or ballistic match, is achieved between two bullets of slightly different weight and aerodynamic characteristics by adjusting the cartridge <b>propellant</b> <b>weight,</b> propellant type, and muzzle velocity, to remain within safe pressure limits, yet provide each bullet with a trajectory to the target that is nearly identical over all atmospheric conditions and target engagement ranges, while using the same gunsight aimpoint. Trajectory match is not intended to be perfect, an engineering impossibility under the closest of similarities between the two bullets, that is further complicated {{in the case of the}} tracer losing mass and changing its drag properties as it flies. The intent is that the tracer matches the ball round well enough for the purposes of machinegun fire.|$|E

40|$|The Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) {{developed}} by the USAF and NASA is a highly reliable, cost-effective solid propellant upper stage, with inherent flexibility and adaptability for integration with the Space Shuttle.

40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the feasibility of developing toroidal propellant tanks for a bipropellant (N 204 /MMH) propulsion system {{to be used in}} a proposed advanced Pioneer spin-stabilized vehicle intended for a Jupiter-orbiter and possibly a Saturn-orbiter mission. The rationale for considering the use of two toroidal tanks rather than the proposed use of four spherical tanks includes the belief that a more symmetrical distribution of propellant mass and a smaller variation in the position of the vehicle center-of-mass during propellant consumption would result, reducing requirements for attitude-control <b>propellants,</b> for balance <b>weight,</b> and for other weights associated with the dynamics of the spinning spacecraft. Results lead to the conclusion that a toroidal tank containing an effective, passive surface tension propellant acquisition device could be fabricated with available manufacturing methods and could be used interchangeably for either fuel or oxidizer...|$|R
50|$|In the API {{blowback}} design, the primer is ignited {{when the}} bolt is still moving forward {{and before the}} cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile <b>weight,</b> <b>propellant</b> charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static inertia to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first {{have to do the}} work of overcoming forward momentum to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved. Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.|$|R
