5000|$|Many {{potential}} {{routes of}} BLV transmission exist. Transmission through procedures that transmit blood between {{animals such as}} gouge dehorning, vaccination and ear tagging with instruments or needles that are not changed or disinfected between animals is a significant means of BLV spread. Rectal palpation with common sleeves poses a risk that is increased by inexperience and increased frequency of palpation. Transmission via colostrum, milk, and in utero exposure is generally considered to account for a relatively small proportion of infections. [...] Embryo transfer and artificial insemination also account for {{a small number of}} new infections as long as common equipment and/or palpation sleeves are not used. While transmission has been documented via blood feeding insects, the significance of this risk is unclear. The bottom line appears to be that transmission relies primarily on the transfer of infected lymphocytes from one animal to the next and that BLV <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> with lymphocytosis are more likely to provide a source for infection.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnder the Irish Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) Eradication Programme all herds are {{subjected}} {{to at least one}} test per annum. The Single Intra-dermal Comparative Tuberculin Test (SICTT) is used in Ireland for the detection of cattle infected with. There have been concerns regarding the specificity of the SICTT, notably by farmers, and particularly in herds where the detection of a single <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> {{in the absence of an}} obvious source of (bTB) infection could be perceived as a "false" positive. To address this issue the so-called 'Singleton Protocol' was established as part of the Irish bTB eradication programme. This protocol allows for the early restoration of free trading status to herds where a single <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> was detected and where the herd was not confirmed as infected with by epidemiological investigation, by, by laboratory examination, or by further test. This paper presents data from the 2005 to 2008, inclusive, bTB programmes on the number of herds that were assessed, which qualified for inclusion under the 'Singleton Protocol' and the outcome for qualifying herds up to and including having status restored early as a consequence of inclusion in that programme. The outcome of this protocol reaffirms the reliability of the SICTT at current levels of infection. Furthermore it is advocated that the 'Singleton Protocol' be continued as a monitor of herds in which a single <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> is disclosed, and as overall infection levels of bTB fall the outcome may be used as one means to assess progress towards bTB eradication in Ireland...|$|R

50|$|Antibody (Ig) ELISAs {{are used}} to detect {{historical}} BVDV infection; these tests have been validated in serum, milk and bulk milk samples. Ig ELISAs do not diagnose active infection but detect the presence of antibodies produced by the animal in response to viral infection. Vaccination also induces an antibody response, which can result in false positive results, therefore {{it is important to}} know the vaccination status of the herd or individual when interpreting results. A standard test to assess whether virus has been circulating recently is to perform an Ig ELISA on blood from 5-10 young stock that have not been vaccinated, aged between 9 and 18 months. A positive result indicates exposure to BVDV, but also that any <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> are very unlikely to be PI animals themselves. A positive result in a pregnant female indicates that she has previously been either vaccinated or infected with BVDV and could possibly be carrying a PI fetus, so antigen testing of the newborn is vital to rule this out. A negative antibody result, at the discretion of the responsible veterinarian, may require further confirmation that the animal is not in fact a PI.|$|E

Method Coverage of sampled vs expected number of sheep and goats, absolute number of <b>positive</b> <b>animals,</b> prevalence, frequency distribution, and classes of disease prevalence were retrospectively analyzed at the village level for 2004 - 2006. A comparative analysis of the disease prevalence in the investigated villages was also performed. The percentage of slaughtered animals was analyzed for 2000 - 2006. Results We found differences between the expected and actual number of sampled animals, which {{were related to the}} type of livestock breeding. Traditionally maintained flocks and migratory flocks were considered to be responsible for the transmission of the disease. The absolute number of <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> and the number of infected vs non-infected holdings did not decrease over the study period.

40|$|Brucella melitensis is {{the cause}} of {{brucellosis}} in sheep and goats, which often results in abortion. Few cases of B. melitensis infection in goats have occurred in the United States over the last 25 years. However, vigilance must be maintained, as it is for the bovine milk industry, to ensure that brucellosis is not introduced into the U. S. goat population. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a sensitive and specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) for the detection of B. melitensis-specific antibodies in goat milk. Brucella salt-extractable protein extract was employed as an antigen, and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polyclonal anti-goat antibody was used as an anti-species conjugate. Thirteen of 13 (100 %) individual infected goat milk samples tested positive and 134 of 134 (100 %) uninfected bulk milk samples tested negative by the developed iELISA. Three positive milk samples with high, medium, and low absorbance values were used to simulate one <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> in an otherwise negative herd. By this estimation, one high-titer animal could be detected in a herd of > 1, 600 animals. Detection estimates for medium- and low-titer <b>animals</b> were one <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> per herd of < 200 and 50 animals, respectively. Based on this estimation, it is recommended that herds be sampled in groups of 50 animals or less for bulk milk testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the associations between feed efficiency and feeding behavior, growth and carcass traits in Senepol cattle. A total of 137 animals were evaluated. Of these animals, 36 males were evaluated in a second test, totaling 173 records (initial age of 466 ± 96 days and initial weight of 426 ± 104 kg). Residual feed intake (RFI) was calculated as the difference between observed and expected dry matter intake, estimated by regression of dry matter intake on average daily gain and metabolic body weight (BW 0. 75), and the animals were classified as negative (high efficiency) and positive RFI (low efficiency). The mean RFI was - 0. 838 ± 0. 078 and 0. 797 ± 0. 075 kg DM day- 1 for negative and <b>positive</b> RFI <b>animals,</b> respectively, with a difference of 1. 63 kg dry matter day- 1. The dry matter intake of negative RFI animals, expressed as kg day- 1 and percentage of mean body weight, was 11. 3 % and 13. 1 % lower than that of <b>positive</b> RFI <b>animals.</b> Negative RFI animals spent less time at the feed bunk and ingested less dry matter per visit than <b>positive</b> RFI <b>animals,</b> but did not differ in terms of chest girth, scrotal circumference, or hip height. However, negative RFI animals had lower rump fat deposition (7. 13 ± 0. 477 mm) than <b>positive</b> RFI <b>animals</b> (7. 83 ± 0. 473 mm). The Spearman correlation between RFI estimated in the first and second tests was 0. 69, indicating that RFI is consistent when evaluated during two different periods of the life of the animal. Senepol animals with low residual feed intake (high efficiency) deposit less subcutaneous rump fat, but this reduction is not accompanied by a reduction in backfat thickness and longissimus muscle area...|$|R

40|$|Swine {{brucellosis}} {{caused by}} Brucella suis biovar 2 is an emerging disease in continental Europe. Without effective vaccines being available, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends the full depopulation of infected herds {{as the only}} strategy to eradicate B. suis outbreaks. Using data collected from 8 herds suffering natural swine brucellosis outbreaks, we assessed the efficacy of four control strategies: (i) oxytetracycline treatment only, as a default scenario, (ii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with skin testing and removal of <b>positive</b> <b>animals,</b> (iii) oxytetracycline treatment combined with serological testing (Rose Bengal test-RBT-and indirect ELISA -iELISA-) and removal of seropositive animals and (iv) oxytetracycline treatment combined with both serological (RBT/iELISA) and skin testing and removal of <b>positive</b> <b>animals.</b> A Susceptible-Infectious-Removal model was used to estimate the reproduction ratio (R) for each strategy. According to this model, the oxytetracycline treatment alone was not effective enough to eradicate the infection. However, this antibiotic treatment combined with diagnostic testing at 4 -monthly intervals plus immediate removal of <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> showed to be effective to eradicate brucellosis independent of the diagnostic test strategy used in an acceptable time interval (1 - 2 years), depending on the initial number of infected animals. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, {{is a serious}} infectious disease that remains an ongoing concern for cattle farming worldwide. Tuberculin skin-tests are often used to identify infected animals (reactors) during test-and-cull programs, however, due to relatively poor sensitivity, additional tests can be implemented in parallel. For example, in Northern Ireland interferon-gamma (IFN-g) testing is used in high-risk herds. However, skin-test negative animals which are positive to the IFN-g test are not {{required by law to}} be slaughtered – therefore the final choice for these animals’ fate is left with the owner. During this study we investigated whether these animals represented a greater risk of becoming a skin reactor, relative to IFN-g test negative animals from the same herds. Our study population included 1107 IFN-g <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> from 239 herds. A Cox-proportional hazard model indicated that animals which tested IFN-g positive were 2. 31 times (95 % CI: 1. 92 - 2. 79; P[*]<[*] 0. 001) more likely to become a reactor compared with IFN-g negative animals. Animals from dairy herds, and from herds in the south-east, were of higher risk than animals from beef herds and other regions, respectively. Our findings suggest that IFN-g <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> represent a higher risk of failing a skin-test in the future, indicating the value of IFN-g testing for identifying early-stage infected animals. These IFN-g <b>positive</b> <b>animals</b> are not under any disease restriction, and may move freely (trade), which may put recipient herds at increased risk.

Senior patients are often taking multiple drugs to controlling these diseases, and population ageing drastically increases the medical most of these diseases. To reduce such medical burden and improve patient compliance, one of the concepts to develop drugs with multi-target. As inflammation {{is one of the}} common pathophysiological factors of these diseases, anti-inflammatory drugs seem to be the drug of choice. Unfortunately, although genetic modified animal model and association studies in human demonstrates positive results, the clinical evidence showing beneficial effect of anti-inflammatory drugs in these chronic diseases is controversial. Many of the <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> studies have focused the role of toll-like receptor (TLR), a classic pathway of innate immunity, in these diseases. In spite of its immune-originality, many cell types other than immune cells express TLR. Evidence of these <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> studies only demonstrated the TLR effect mediated by the immune cells, and the function in non-immune cells has largely been ignored. Whether this missing area explains the limited effect of anti-inflammatory drug in these diseases shown in clinical study is noteworthy to be explored. In this project, we used a different angle to study the role of TLR pathway in metabolic diseases. Despite that many studies showed the harmful effect elicited by activation of TLR, our data demonstrated that when we genetic deleted one of the downstream cytosolic branches of TLR pathway, TRIF in mice, they displayed a worsened metabolic phenotype under a high fat diet. Hepatic steatosis and elevated fasting blood glucose were present in these TRIF knockout mice. The increased hepatic accumulation of lipid was due to the abnormal upregulation of lipogenesis pathway in hepatocytes. We further showed that activation of TRIF pathway can inhibit the critical lipogenic protein, stearyl-CoA desaturase - 1 (SCD- 1) in hepatocytes. It appeared that SCD- 1 was a direct target of the downstream transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor- 3 (IRF 3) which is activated through TRIF pathway. These results highly suggested an unconventional effect of TLR pathway in non-immune cells. This study gave us a new understanding of the role and function of TLR/TRIF pathway in non-immune cells during metabolism, thus a different angle to design a more effective therapeutic strategy in treating multiple chronic diseases including metabolic diseases and their fatal complications...|$|R

30|$|Another {{example of}} where {{indigenous}} fire practice is being {{incorporated in the}} commercial fire paradigm is {{the extension of the}} fire season in wildlife areas, like the Kruger National Park, to the entire dry winter period. Previously, prescribed burning was limited {{to the end of the}} dry season either before or after the first spring rains. Pertinently, research on the effects of season of burn on the grass sward in southern Africa (West 1965, Trollope 1987) has shown the importance of plant dormancy in minimizing the harmful effects of fire on the regrowth of grass plants, thereby promoting support for the desirability of applying prescribed burns throughout the entire dry winter period. The practice in the communal fire paradigm of applying grazing as soon as possible after a burn to take advantage of the highly palatable and nutritious regrowth of the grass sward is also now incorporated into the commercial fire paradigm. Intensive research conducted by Zacharias (1994) and Kirkman (2001) showed the benefits of this practice on <b>positive</b> <b>animal</b> performance, provided it was accompanied by a regular rotational resting program in the overall range management system, and encouraged the adoption of this indigenous practice.|$|R
