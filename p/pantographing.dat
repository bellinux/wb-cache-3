40|$|This paper {{develops}} a so-called <b>pantographing</b> self adaptive gap element type contact strategy. Due to {{the manner of}} formulation, the scheme has the capability to handle large deformations in the contact zone; contact initiation in structure exhibiting either positive or indefinite stiffness characteristics; kinematic and material nonlinearity as well as; self adaptively adjusts load/time stepping. In this context, contact in pre and postbuckling structure can be treated. To illustrate the scheme, several benchmark problems are presented. These include contacting structure involving large deformation kinematics, inelastic behavior as well as pre and postbuckling stiffness characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{material}} {{technology was}} applied {{to the development of a}} collapsible transparent window suitable for manned spacecraft structures. The effort reported encompasses the evaluation of flame retardants intended for use in the window matrix polymer, evaluation of reinforcement angle which would allow for a twisting <b>pantographing</b> motion as the cylindrical window is mechanically collapsed upon itself, and evaluation of several reinforcement embedment methods. A fabrication technique was developed to produce a reinforced cylindrical space window of 45. 7 cm diameter and 61. 0 cm length. The basic technique involved the application of a clear film on a male-section mold; winding axial and girth reinforcements and vacuum casting the outer layer. The high-strength transparent window composite consisted of a polyether urethane matrix reinforced with an orthogonal pattern of black-coated carbon steel wire cable. A thin film of RTV silicone rubber {{was applied to}} both surfaces of the urethane. The flexibility, retraction system, and installation system are described...|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} {{fitted with}} <b>pantographs</b> of 5 different patterns. 376 was {{fitted with a}} Simens Schukert <b>pantograph,</b> 377 was fitted with a Fischer bow collector, 378 was fitted with an ASEA <b>pantograph,</b> 379 was fitted with a Metropolitan Vickers <b>pantograph</b> and 380 was fitted with an English Electric <b>pantograph.</b> The <b>pantographs</b> on 376, 379 and 380 were all fitted on a small <b>pantograph</b> tower while 377 and 378 had their <b>pantographs</b> mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the <b>pantographs</b> were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was fitted with a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit <b>pantograph</b> operation, the <b>pantographs</b> fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were fitted with <b>pantographs</b> 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the <b>pantograph</b> noise of Shinkansen rolling stock, large <b>pantograph</b> covers had been {{attached}} around conventional <b>pantographs.</b> But with increases in speed, the aerodynamic noise of the <b>pantograph</b> covers themselves becomes a problem. So, we have recently developed low-noise <b>pantographs</b> and low-noise insulators 1) to replace <b>pantograph</b> covers. For the FASTECH 360 S high-speed test train on which we have been proceeding with development with a target of achieving 360 km/h, further reduction of <b>pantograph</b> noise is required. Thus, we have improved the noise reduction performance of <b>pantographs,</b> and at the same time, introduced <b>pantograph</b> noise insulating panels to be attached on the both sides of the <b>pantograph</b> (hereinafter “noise insulating panels”). In this paper, we will explain the development and the effect of the noise insulating panels for FASTECH 360 S...|$|R
40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the <b>pantographs</b> makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the <b>pantographs</b> and then raise them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the <b>pantographs</b> can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the <b>pantograph</b> configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during <b>pantograph</b> raising and lowering, a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three <b>pantographs,</b> various <b>pantograph</b> raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading <b>pantograph</b> is little influenced by the raising and lowering movement of any <b>pantograph</b> behind it. However, any trailing <b>pantograph</b> is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the <b>pantograph</b> spacing distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the operating position in a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading <b>pantograph</b> works as an auxiliary <b>pantograph,</b> this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading <b>pantograph</b> benefits the trailing <b>pantograph</b> and suggests specifying the speed where the leading <b>pantograph</b> gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

30|$|This paper {{researched}} on the {{influence of}} <b>pantograph</b> head parameters {{on the power}} collection quality under the condition of motion in a curved track with a radius of 100  m. The <b>pantograph</b> head parameters are the weight of <b>pantograph</b> head parts, the stiffness of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element and the damping of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element.|$|R
40|$|Shinkansen noise can be {{classified}} into four categories; <b>pantograph</b> noise, aerodynamic noise from the train nose, aerodynamic noise from the upper parts of cars, and noise from the lower parts of cars and structure-borne noise as shown Fig. 1. <b>Pantograph</b> noise is one of main sources of noise. <b>Pantograph</b> noise is composed of aerodynamic noise from the <b>pantograph</b> itself, spark noise caused by contact loss, and sliding noise generated between the contact strips and the overhead contact line. If there is a decreased amount of contact loss, most of the <b>pantograph</b> noise is due to aerodynamic noise from the <b>pantograph</b> itself (including insulators). Therefore, the noise sources of the PS 207 type <b>pantograph</b> (Fig. 2) were investigated in detail, and two types of low-noise <b>pantograph</b> were developed; a<-shaped arm type <b>pantograph,</b> which is an improve...|$|R
25|$|L class {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two <b>pantographs.</b> The VR issued instructions for both <b>pantographs</b> {{to be raised}} in winter months, with the first <b>pantograph</b> serving to knock ice off the overhead catenary and ensure good contact for the second <b>pantograph.</b>|$|R
40|$|The present-day {{evolution}} of <b>pantograph</b> preload regulating systems, exploiting pressure-controlled servo-valves driven by electronic units, allows a diversification of the preloads of {{front and rear}} <b>pantographs.</b> In this work a suitable solution to improve multiple <b>pantographs</b> collection quality is analysed, {{by the use of}} a lower mean force on the leading <b>pantograph</b> meant to reduce the oscillations of contact wire the trailing <b>pantograph</b> is subjected to. This would improve the current collection quality of the trailing <b>pantograph,</b> and could be pursued even admitting a slight worsening of front <b>pantograph’s</b> performances. At the same time an increased preload on the rear <b>pantograph,</b> whose working condition is the most critical, would allow to prevent contact losses...|$|R
40|$|The current {{collection}} using {{more than one}} <b>pantograph</b> is needed in railway operation to provide power to non-electrically connected traction units and, in some cases, to reduce current density on the collector strips that heavily influences the wear on the contacting bodies. The multiple {{current collection}} may become a critical condition due to the mechanical disturbances produced on the trailing <b>pantographs</b> by {{the interaction between the}} first <b>pantograph</b> and the catenary. The present-day evolution of <b>pantograph</b> preload regulating systems, exploiting pressure-controlled servo-valves driven by electronic units, allows a diversification of the preloads of front and rear <b>pantographs.</b> In this work, a suitable solution to improve multiple <b>pantograph</b> collection quality is analysed by the use of a lower mean force on the leading <b>pantograph</b> aimed at reducing the oscillations of contact wire the trailing <b>pantograph</b> is subjected to.

30|$|However, the {{research}} about the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>pantographs</b> {{in the above}} literature mainly focused on the <b>pantograph</b> itself and neglected {{the influence of the}} train body on the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>pantographs.</b> As the thickness of the boundary layer increases along the opposite running direction of the train, the <b>pantograph</b> fixing position would have significant influences on the aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>pantographs</b> and the train body [13]. In the present paper, aerodynamic models of high-speed trains with <b>pantographs</b> fixed on different positions are established based on the theory of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The external flow fields of the high-speed trains are numerically simulated using the software STAR-CCM+. In addition, influences of the <b>pantograph</b> fixing position on the aerodynamic characteristics of the high-speed train and <b>pantographs</b> are analyzed.|$|R
50|$|When {{there was}} no {{compressed}} air in the unit's system to raise a <b>pantograph</b> to start up, a <b>pantograph</b> hook stick was used to manually raise the <b>pantograph.</b> This started the high voltage motor which drove the auxiliary alternator to supply 110V power to start the compressor and power other control circuits. Once there was enough main air pressure to keep the <b>pantograph</b> in the raised position, the <b>pantograph</b> hook stick could be removed.|$|R

40|$|Contacts between <b>pantograph</b> and {{catenary}} are {{the most}} critical parts in the transmission of electrical energy for modern high-speed trains. Contact wire oscillations change combined force between <b>pantograph</b> and catenary, and the contact may even get lost. Therefore special <b>pantographs</b> and catenaries have been developed and further constructive changes are under development. A design criterion includes the permanent contact of <b>pantograph</b> head and contact wire at high speed and the reduction of both aero acoustic noise and wear. Because of complicated dynamic behaviour and very high costs for prototypes, all modifications and new design concepts for the pantograph/catenary system are essentially based on dynamical simulation. Traditional approaches focus on the catenary, which is modelled as set of coupled strings and/or beams, whereas simplified lumped mass models are {{used to describe the}} <b>pantograph.</b> Nowadays increased computer power allows considering applications with more refined <b>pantograph</b> modes (e. g. the elasticity of the <b>pantograph)</b> and active control components in innovative <b>pantograph</b> concepts...|$|R
50|$|The <b>pantograph</b> used on 325 was {{the stock}} Faiveley GPU.

The main structure of the <b>pantograph</b> is constructed of cylindrical tubing, which (Faiveley claims) reduces the <b>pantograph's</b> sensitivity to random variations in environmental factors. The only modifications to the GPU <b>pantograph</b> were {{an increase in the}} stiffness of the pneumatic dampers, and a reduced total aerodynamic lift of the structure.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>pantographs</b> {{are raised}} using {{compressed}} air, which is provided at 5 bar (...) to the lifting cylinder. Raising the <b>pantograph</b> takes 5 seconds, while retraction takes 4 seconds. The contact shoe pushes against the contact wire with adjustable pressure of between 70 and 120 N. The driver controls the <b>pantograph</b> via a push {{button on the}} driver's desk (Up, Down, and Down + Sanding for emergency cases are the settings). The choice of which <b>pantograph</b> to use can be left up to the locomotive by the driver, which would automatically use the back <b>pantograph</b> {{in the direction of}} travel, or, in double heading, where two locomotives are coupled, it would be the front <b>pantograph</b> on the front locomotive, and the back <b>pantograph</b> on the back locomotive. Otherwise the driver, using a switch located on the battery control table in driver's cab 1, may raise one or the other, or both together. This is primarily an advantage during shunting/switching operation, where otherwise the change from one driver's cab to the other would mean the automatic switching from one <b>pantograph</b> to the other. In cases where the <b>pantograph</b> is being switched, the unit that was in the down position is lifted first, and once it is successfully pushed up against the contact wire, the <b>pantograph</b> that was in service is lowered.|$|R
