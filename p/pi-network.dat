The Wideband Tuning technique is for actual RF chips. So on-chip models for RF capacitors and inductors are considered. And the effects of the parasitic component loss in the <b>PI-network</b> are analyzed. Then the circuit is simplified according to the sensitivities of the elements. Therefore, the computational complexity is dramatically reduced. Finally, the AQPSO algorithm is adopted to maximize the power transmission efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed tuning technique can achieve good accuracy of impedance matching and load power. The reflection coefficient and VSWR obtained are also satisfactory. Moreover, the proposed method can be useful for software defined radio systems using a single antenna for multiple mobile and wireless bands...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose and {{validate}} a simple {{lumped parameter model}} based on a pi-type network. This model is able to simulate the ground potential rise of typical tower grounding systems under surge conditions. The lumped parameter values are estimated {{by means of an}} optimization procedure based the micro-genetic algorithm (muGA). This procedure minimizes the standard deviation between target values (obtained using a full circuit model able to perform frequency domain analyses and time domain analysis under linear and non-linear conditions) and simulation results (obtained using the equivalent <b>pi-network</b> model). The proposed model has been validated by means of massive simulations of typical Italian 380 HV transmission line grounding systems under surge conditions (varying impulsive current wave shapes, grounding system geometrical configurations, soil characteristics and also accounting for non-linear ionization phenomena). The simulation results have always revealed a very good agreement between target values and model results. In addition, the proposed <b>pi-network</b> model drastically reduces the computational resources required for linear and non-linear transient analyses of typical tower grounding systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A compact {{interdigital}} capacitor coupled dual-behavior resonator (DBR) filter {{with high}} spurious responses suppression is proposed in this paper. The technique {{is based on}} two equivalent topologies of J-inverter and dual-line equivalent circuit of open-circuited stubs. The first compact equivalent topology capacitive inverter is a high pass structure, and consequently, the spurious responses can be suppressed effectively at low frequencies. The second equivalent topology <b>pi-network</b> is employed in realizing a compact size and adding new transmission zeros dedicated to the spurious responses suppression at high frequencies. Further compactness is achieved with a dual-line equivalent circuit of open-circuited stubs. The relevant equations are given in the paper. Finally, a 3 rd-order compact DBR filter is designed and measured. This structure has {{a high degree of}} miniaturization (83 %) in comparison to the classical one. Measurement results show good agreement with the simulated ones. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{superconductor}} {{bandpass filter}} with tunable central frequency {{in the range}} of 2. 1 – 3. 5 GHz has been implemented using Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID). The filter is designed as two <b>pi–network</b> resonators connected by a transmission line. Both resonators have a SQUID inductor with a tuning range of 65 – 200 pH, controlled by DC current magnetically coupled to the SQUIDs. Over a frequency tunability of 40 % from 3. 5 to 2. 1 GHz, the filter has a corresponding fractional bandwidth of 35 % to 27 % and a mid-band insertion loss of 0. 5 – 3. 0 dB. Due to the presence of active elements, the tunability of the filter depends on the power of the microwave signal. A maximum power of - 52 dBm corresponds to a frequency tuning range of 15 %. Spectral measurements by controlling the central frequency of the filter with variable pulse-width shows that the filter can be tuned at a rate of 120 GHz per us...|$|E

However, it appears that-port T-networks {{have not been}} previously identified for, a strange topological asymmetry in circuit theory. We introduce the general-port T-network and illustrate applica-tion by synthesis of an-port T-network lumped model from-parameters for a three-port microstrip via to ground on GaAs. The existence of the-port T-network partially relieves the noted circuit theory asymmetry; however, the T-network is structurally different from the <b>Pi-network.</b> We show that circuit theory be-comes topologically perfectly symmetric under an appropriate change of variables when we consider-parameters and derive circuit theory from the electromagnetically symmetric form of Maxwell’s equations. The perfect topological symmetry requires both electric and magnetic (i. e., magnetic monopole) current.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 20 - 23, 2003 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaQuartz crystal is an {{important}} electronic element {{in the field of}} communication systems, computer systems, etc. It is important to precisely measure the frequency of quartz crystal unit for manufacturing. The <b>Pi-network</b> transmission system recommended by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is generally acknowledged as a measurement technique. However it needs a precise frequency source. The frequency source must be calibrated within a regular period in the process of manufacturing. Frequency counters, time internal counters, phase comparisons, which are the most common frequency calibrations, are introduced in the paper. Nowadays GPS has also become the primary system for frequency calibration. GPS receivers provide 1 PPS (Pulse Per Second) with accuracy < 100 nanoseconds to UTC under normal conditions. Motorola UT Oncore timing GPS with time accuracy < 50 ns (1 sigma) uses time RAIM algorithm to ensure the validity and reliability of measurements. The comparison between the precise 1 PPS and local reference is implemented. And the phase differences are logged and read by computer. According to the values, the frequency output of DDS is coordinated. In order to reduce the phase ambiguity, local reference is divided before comparison. The calibration can be implemented at any time by GPS. Block diagrams of calibration are presented in this paper...|$|E

In addition, a 67 - 78 GHz 4 -bit passive phase shifter using low-pass <b>pi-network</b> and 0. 13 [mu]m CMOS switches is demonstrated. By adding amplifiers to the passive phase shifter with the architecture of alternating amplifiers and phase shifter cells, a low-power BiCMOS 4 -element phased array receiver for 76 - 84 GHz applications are presented. Lastly, a 76 - 84 GHz 16 -element phased array receiver, designed differentially {{in order to reduce}} the sensitivity to packaging effect such as ground inductance, is presented. This thesis presents the silicon-based on- chip W-band phased array systems. An improved quadrature all-pass filter (QAF) and its implementation in 60 - 80 GHz active phase shifter using 0. 13 [mu]m SiGe BiCMOS technology is presented. It is demonstrated that with the inclusion of an Rs/R in the high Q branches of C and L, the sensitivity to the loading capacitance, therefore the I/Q phase and amplitude errors are minimized. This technique is especially suited for wideband millimeter- wave circuits where the loading capacitance (CL) is comparable to the filter capacitance (C). A prototype 60 - 80 GHz active phased shifter using the improved QAF is demonstrated. The overall chip size is 1. 15 x 0. 92 mm² with the power consumption of 108 mW. The measured S₁ 1 and S₂ 2 are 8 dBm and the simulated IIP 3 is > 22 dBm. A low-power 76 [...] 84 GHz 4 -element phased array receiver using the designed passive phase shifter is presented. The power consumption is minimized by using a single-ended design and alternating the amplifiers and phase shifter cells to result in a low noise figure at a low power consumption. A variable gain amplifier and the 11 degree phase shifter are used to correct for the rms gain and phase errors at different operating frequencies. The overall chip size is 2. 0 x 2. 7 mm² with the current consumption of 18 mA/channel with 1. 8 V supply voltage. The measured S₁ 1 and S² 2 is 10 dB for 76. 4 - 90 GHz with the rms gain error of - 45 dB. The measured NF is 11. 2 - 13 dB at 77 - 87 GHz at the maximum gain state. And the measured input P 1 dB is - 20 dBm at 77 GHz and - 25. 8 dBm at the 83 GHz.

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} {{different}} methods to tune the antenna impedance in mobile devices. Mismatch from antenna impedance can cause undesirable effects such as spurious emissions, channel leakages, increased noise floor, degraded receiver sensitivity and so on. With the advancement in technology, digitally tunable reactive components are now available. Thus, a feedback system with tunable circuitry and the aperture tuning method where the component is directly {{embedded in the}} antenna design {{are some of the}} popular choices of solution. The ‘look-up table’ method is currently widely adopted in wireless industry. The hardware component chain (RF chain) contains the set-up to measure Γ_in(ratio of reflected signal to transmitted signal in dB) and a circuit to be tuned according to the values found in the look-up table. The look-up table is a pre-defined calibration chart provided by the manufacturer. It is saved in the memory of the device for permanent use during its lifespan. In this thesis, in the effort to eliminate the process of creating this look-up table and also to free up large space of memory, we approach an analytical solution to predict the exact values of the component in the tunable circuit – hence, making the procedure a one-time measurement, so called the open-loop configuration. In Chapter 3, a thorough mathematical analysis has been developed to integrate the Q factors of each component into a sample pi-circuit. In such setup, the system is expected to calculate ZL (or the antenna, load) with measured Γ_in and then compute the three capacitance values that yield the best transducer gain by conjugate matching method. However, due to many non-ideal characteristics of the components, calibrating the setup and incorporating the calibration data into analytical solution becomes very challenging. Therefore, the closed-loop configuration is more useful. It collects the empirical data of Γ_in, apply the optimization algorithm and then tune the circuitry in feedback manner, until the lowest desired Γ_in is reached. (Note that there is no difference between the closed and open loop configuration in the physical set-up.) The purpose of this thesis is to develop the optimization algorithm used in closed-loop configuration. It involves three degrees of freedom using three Digitally Tunable Capacitors (DTCs). Accordingly, the challenge of this research points to inventing a 3 D-unconstrained optimization technique that is simple enough to be implemented in a microprocessor without employing complex equation-solving libraries. In Chapter 4, the Hill-Climbing algorithm is investigated to see if it provides a suitable approach for finding the global minimum Γ_in in the 3 D space gradient defined by 3 variables or DTCs. The Hill Climbing method, however, will limit its solution to finding only the local minimum within the gradient. This means that the location of the solution will change with the resolution of the gradient and the search step-size. Therefore,it is expected that Hill Climbing algorithm yields different solutions depending on the increment size and the starting location of the search. Chapter 5 develops a new algorithm that is based on Grid Searching. The main idea is to grasp the picture of the entire gradient of 3 D space and zoom-in closer to the global point by iteration. The challenge lies in defining the boundary of zoom-in region without leaking the global point and leaving it behind. Also, the scanning of the reduced region in each iteration must not be too rigorous – meaning requiring too many data points. All different <b>pi-network</b> will have its limited coverage region on Smith Chart, of which the load impedance can be matched with. Therefore, selecting the reactive component with the suitable range of capacitance is also an important step, in order to fully utilize the work of this thesis. Apart from that, the algorithm does not require any information about the antenna, frequency of operation nor the configuration of the DTCs. Overcoming these challenges will guarantee the device to have the best optimized state of impedance match, at a specific frequency. Given that the algorithm is a 3 D optimization technique, the work of this research does not only apply to tuning a pi-tuner. The three DTCs can be also integrated in the aperture tuning system.
