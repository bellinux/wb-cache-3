50|$|In DMLS, <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> {{supports}} the parts {{and keep them}} held in place. However, support structures are explicitly required {{for most of the}} downward facing surfaces that make an angle less than 45 degrees with the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> This is {{because of the fact that}} <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> alone is not sufficient enough to hold the liquid phase of the metal that is created when laser is scanning the powder. Support structures are also required to restrict curling/warping of the melted powder due to high-temperature gradients. The overhangs having angles less than 45 degrees should be avoided if possible at the design stage. The main advantage of this is to reduce material usage and the post processing requirement of removing support structures from the designed components.|$|E
50|$|Selective Laser Melting (also {{known as}} <b>Powder</b> <b>Bed</b> Fusion) is an {{additive}} manufacturing procedure {{used to create}} intricately detailed forms from a CAD file. In CAD, a shape is designed and then converted into slices. These slices are sent to a laser writer to print the final product. In brief, a bed of metal powder is prepared, and the first slice of the CAD design is formed in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> by a high energy laser sintering the particles together. After this first slice is generated, the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> moves downwards, and a new batch of metal powder is rolled {{over the top of}} the slice.

The sintered sample was then characterized by using X-ray diffraction, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysisand impedance analyzer {{in order to determine}} the phase of the element, microstructure and dielectric properties, respectively.

40|$|An {{important}} parameter for {{the overall}} quality of SLS parts is the density of powder layers before sintering.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} {{to determine how the}} mean particle size of monomodal quartz particle beds and the bed preparation method affect initial and final bed apparent density and the kinetics of densification by tapping. The study was conducted on eight quartz particle size fractions obtained from a commercial quartz powder by sieving, each having a different mean particle size and a very narrow (monomodal) particle size distribution. The amplitude of the distribution and the particle shape were practically the same for all fractions. Densification experiments were conducted on the beds obtained with each fraction, using an assembly designed for this purpose. A kinetic model representing the densification process of monomodal <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> by tapping is proposed, in which good relations are obtained between the parameters of the model and the foregoing variables. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Laser {{engineered}} net shaping (LENS) is an {{additive manufacturing}} technique for rapidly fabricating, enhancing and repairing metal components directly from CAD data. The processes use a high power {{solid state laser}} focused onto a metal substrate to create a ~1 mm diameter melt pool. Metal powder is then injected into the melt pool to increase the material volume and build up the component layer by layer. Experimental gas thrusters (build time 8 hours) and automotive brackets have been manufactured in Ti-Grade 5. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is similar, except that the laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning {{on the surface of}} a <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> After each cross-section is scanned, the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the findings}} of the selective laser melting (SLM) of tool steel and stainless steel powders. The distinguishing feature is the melting of single layers in deep <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> by a continuous CO 2 laser. First, effect of process parameters on the surface roughness for each material is investigated. Based on these results combined with visual observation of the solidified tracks, the question is then discussed as how the processability of various type of steels is changed. The results show that surface morphology of layers is affected strongly by scan spacing, thereby giving a lower average roughness at reduced scan spacing. The effect of scan speed is also remarkable. In addition, other roughness parameters such as the peak height and skewness are found to be useful tools for evaluation of laser melted surfaces. 1...|$|R
40|$|INGENIERIE+FRMThe {{temperature}} prevailing in {{the catalyst}} bed {{of three different}} IR spectroscopic reaction cells was assessed by means of thermocouples, an optical pyrometer and reaction rate measurements. One of the cells was a custom-made transmission FT-IR cell for use with thin wafers and the two others were commercial Harrick and Spectra-Tech diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFTS) cells used {{for the analysis of}} powdered samples. The rate of CO methanation measured over a 16 wt% Ni/alumina catalyst was used as a means to derive the effective temperature prevailing in the IR cells from that existing in a traditional (non-spectroscopic) reactor having a well-controlled temperature. The sample bed of these three IR cells exhibited a significantly lower temperature than that of the corresponding measure thermocouple, which was yet located in or close to the sample bed. The comparison of Arrhenius plots enabled us to determine a temperature correction valid over a large temperature range. The use of an optical pyrometer was assessed with a view to determining the temperature of the surface of the <b>powdered</b> <b>beds</b> and that at the centre of the wafer. The optical pyrometer proved useful {{in the case of the}} catalyst powder, which behaved as a black non-reflecting body. In contrast, the temperature reading was inaccurate in the case of the pressed wafer, probably due to the shiny surface and minute thickness of the wafer, which led to a significant portion of the IR radiation of the surroundings being reflected by and transmitted through the wafer. The optical pyrometer data showed that the temperature of the surface of the <b>powdered</b> <b>beds</b> was significantly lower than that of the bulk of the bed, and that the total flow rate and composition did not affect this value. This work emphasises that the effective bed temperature in spectroscopic cells can be significantly different from that given by measure thermocouples, even when located in the vicinity of the sample, but that the calibration curves derived from rate measurements can be used to overcome this problem...|$|R
