40|$|International audienceWhen {{formally}} analyzing security protocols it {{is often}} im- <b>portant</b> <b>to</b> express properties {{in terms of an}} adversary's inability to distinguish two protocols. It has been shown that this problem amounts to deciding the equivalence of two constraint systems, i. e., whether they have the same set of solutions. In this paper we study this equivalence problem when cryptographic primitives are modeled using a group equational theory, a special case of monoidal equational theories. The results strongly rely on the isomorphism between group theories and rings. This allows us to reduce the problem under study to the problem of solving systems of equations over rings. We provide several new decidability and complexity results, notably for equational theories which have applications in security protocols, such as exclusive or and Abelian groups which may additionally admit a unary, homomorphic symbol...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} and immunologic {{data in a}} case of rheum atoid arthritis complicated by serum hyperviscosity are reported. The elevation in the serum viscosity was accompanied by the presence of interm ediate im m une complexes which w ere partially purified from the patient’s serum by gel filtration chromatography. These complexes had a molecular weight of approxim ately 510, 000 daltons and contained polyclonal IgG and IgA immunoglobulins. The hyperviscosity syndrome in this patient was likely due to the presence of in term ediate complexes and unrelated to the rheu matoid factor activity which was found predom inantly within the IgM fraction of the serum. This case dem onstrates that the hyperviscosity syn drom e may, in rare cases, develop as a complication of rheum atoid arth ri tis. It is im <b>portant</b> <b>to</b> consider this possibility before the clinical symptoms of increased serum viscosity become manifest...|$|R

40|$|Institute of Right <b>to</b> <b>Build</b> in Czech and German Law The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} {{institute}} of right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> in Czech and German law. The elementary aim of the thesis is to describe the legal institute of right <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> not only in the Czech legal system, but also in the German legal system. The right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> is an absolute property right with effect erga omnes. It belongs into a group of rights, which privileges one to use a thing of someone else. The statute declares the right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> be real property. On the ground of the right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> arises the right of the builder to have a building on the surface or under the surface of the encumbered piece of land. The right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> is always limited through a set period of time, it should not be created for longer than 99 years. The typical features of the right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> are alienability and inheritability. The content of this thesis is divided into four chapters. The nature of right <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> as a right, which privileges one to use the thing of someone else, is described in the first chapter. There are also descriptions of the basic legal terms associated with the right <b>to</b> <b>build.</b> The chapter describes the terms 'building' and 'builder' as well as the principle of superficies solo cedit.

40|$|A plaster-of-Paris double hip spica {{remains the}} pre ferred method of {{maintaining}} a reduction of a congenital dislocation of the hip. It is required that this cast maintain a concentric reduction until stability is achieved, {{and at the same}} time avoid complications. During and after the application of the spica, it is im <b>portant</b> <b>to</b> prevent the femoral head from slipping postero superiorly, the usual direction of dislocation. We have frequently observed migration of the infant's buttocks from the spica-table post while the cast is being applied, resulting in a space between the buttocks and the seat of the plaster (Fig. 1). This loose fit risks a loss of control of the reduction, as the proximal part of the femur is no longer maintained in a caudal position and the femoral head can slide posterosuperiorly. To overcome this, we devised a hip sling that temporarily holds the femoral head in a caudal and anterior position during the application and setting of the plaster spica...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{very few}} studies have been {{conducted}} on microorganisms growing in the Maltese islands, and these have rarely resulted in the description of new gen- era, species or serovars. Two important exceptions are the studies on Brucella melitensis, by Sir Temi Zammit in 1905 (Wyatt, 2005) and a new serovar of Salmonella from Gozo (Vella & Cuschieri, 1995). Ten years ago, sampling of microorganisms growing as bio lms on di erent substrates around the Maltese islands was initiated. The microorganisms consisted mainly of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria and microalgae. Today the culture collection of Maltese microorganisms contains over a hundred new microbial strains that are new to science and which include fresh- water, marine, soil and subaerophytic microorganisms. The aim of the research is twofold. Firstly, it is im- <b>portant</b> <b>to</b> characterise the Maltese microbial strains and describe new taxa as required.
