Saunders defended herself saying, [...] "I’m not here to make popular decisions. I always feel under pressure to make the right decision."In June 2015 The Guardian reported that, following a review, the <b>decision</b> not to <b>prosecute</b> Lord Janner would in fact be overturned. Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, told the Guardian that [...] "if the report is accurate, Saunders will now have to consider her position" [...] {{as a result of the}} scrutiny that her initial decision would now be placed under. [...] The decision marks the first time a DDP has had a major <b>prosecuting</b> <b>decision</b> reviewed and overturned. Amid calls for her resignation, she told the BBC that she will not resign.|$|R
