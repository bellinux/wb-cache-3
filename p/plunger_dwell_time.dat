30|$|A first remark {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the travel demand (in terms of arrival rate) in a station and the related <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> Indeed, although Eq. (1) shows the direct dependence of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on travel demand (i.e. the higher the travel demand, the higher the <b>dwell</b> <b>time),</b> Eq. (3) (or, equivalently, Eq.  4) shows the direct dependence of travel demand on headway which, by means of Eq. (2), in turn depends on <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in previous stations. Hence, the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> in a station {{is a function of the}} arrival rate in that station, the arrival rates in the previous stations and the framework of the travel demand (in terms of alighting flows). For this reason, in general, it is not possible to state that higher flows (in terms of arrival rates) necessarily imply higher <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the factors that determine the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in a visual search task, that is, the duration the gaze remains fixated on an object. It {{has been suggested that}} an item’s similarity to the search target should be an important determiner of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> because <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are taken to reflect the time needed to reject the item as a distractor, and such discriminations are supposed to be harder the more similar an item is to the search target. In line with this similarity view, a previous study shows that, in search for a target ring of thin line-width, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidth Landolt C’s distractors were longer than <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on Landolt C’s with thick or medium linewidth. However, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> may have been longer on thin Landolt C’s because the thin line-width made it harder to detect whether the stimuli had a gap or not. Thus, it is an open question whether <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin line-width distractors were longer because they were similar to the target or because the perceptual decision was more difficult. The present study de-coupled similarity from perceptual difficulty, by measuring <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin, medium and thick line-width distractors when the target had thin, medium or thick line-width. The results showed that <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were longer on target-similar than target-dissimilar stimuli across all target conditions and regardless of the line-width. It is concluded that prior findings of longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidthdistractors can clearly be attributed to target similarity.

40|$|Purpose: Dose plans {{generated}} with optimization models hitherto used in HDR brachytherapy {{have shown}} a tendency to yield longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> than manually optimized plans. Concern has been raised for the corresponding undesired hot spots and various methods to mitigate these have been developed. The hypotheses of this work are a) that one cause for the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> {{is the use of}} objective functions comprising simple linear penalties and b) that alternative penalties, being piecewise linear, would lead to reduced length of individual <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> Methods: The characteristics of the linear penalties and the piecewise linear penalties are analysed mathematically. Experimental comparisons between the two types of penalties are carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients. Results: While most dose-volume parameters do not differ significantly between the two types of penalties significant changes {{can be seen in the}} <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> On the average, total <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were reduced by 4. 2 %, with a reduction of maximum <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> by 30 %, using the alternative penalties. Conclusion: The use of linear penalties in optimization models for HDR brachytherapy is one cause for undesired longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> appearing in mathematically optimized plans. By introducing alternative penalties significant reduction in <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> can be achieved for HDR brachytherapy dose plans. Although various constraints as to reduce the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> have been developed our finding is of fundamental interest in showing the shape of the objective function to be one reason for their appearance...|$|R
40|$|Train <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unpredictable}} components of railway operations mainly due to the varying volumes of alighting and boarding passengers. For reliable estimations of train running times and route conflicts on main lines it is however necessary to obtain accurate estimations of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at the intermediate stops on the main line, the so-called short stops. This is a big challenge for a more reliable, efficient and robust train operation. Previous research has shown that <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> is highly dependent on the number of boarding and alighting passengers. However, the latter numbers are usually not available in real time. This paper discusses the possibility of a <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> estimation model at short stops without passenger demand information, by means of a statistical analysis of track occupation data from the Netherlands. The analysis showed that the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are best estimated for peak and off-peak hour separately. The peak hour <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are estimated using a linear regression model of train length, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at previous stops and <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> of the previous trains. The off-peak hour <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are estimated using a non-parametric regression model. There are two major advantages of the proposed estimation model. The model does not need passenger flow data which is usually impossible to know in real time in practice. Also, detailed parameters of rolling stock configuration and platform layout are not required, which eases implementation. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Crowded passenger trains cause longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> and may prevent some passengers from boarding the first avail-able train that arrives.

40|$|The common {{approach}} to estimate bus <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> at a BRT station {{is to apply}} the traditional <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> methodology derived for suburban bus stops.

However field survey is resource and cost intensive, so <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> estimation based on limited observations can be somewhat inaccurate. Most public transport systems are now equipped with Automatic Passenger Count (APC) and/or Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems.

This research effort contended that models could be developed to reliably estimate <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> distributions when measured distributions of transaction times are known.
