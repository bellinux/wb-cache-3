In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective assist-provider.|$|E

He <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> able and ruthless ruler of the Mahdiyah, the Mahdist state. At first the state was run on military lines as a Jihadist state. Later, a more conventional form of administration was introduced. The Kalifa consolidated his rule in Sudan, then invaded Ethiopia, killing Emperor Yohannes IV in March 1889 and penetrating as far as Gondar. The same year, the Kalifa attacked Egypt at Tushki, but was defeated.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010.

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> early dawn for Arsenal, who {{spent most of the}} rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> undistinguished {{appointment}} {{and was not}} particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day.

When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
