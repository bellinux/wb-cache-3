40|$|There are {{numerous}} methods of preparing nanocrystalline materials. Magnesium oxide {{is an ideal}} model system on which to probe {{the relation of the}} preparative route and the microstructure. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) we show that the sol-gel route can be used to prepare highly crystalline material provided there is careful control of the calcination conditions. In the present work this is achieved by calcining at high temperatures (at least 800 8 C). However, this results in grain growth that can be prevented by the addition of a <b>pinning</b> <b>agent,</b> SiO 2, during the preparation of the sol. The pinned samples maintain a particle size of 11 nm even after calcining at 1000 8 C. Ball-milling is a common method of preparing nanocrystalline oxides, however the present work shows that this produces a significant fraction of amorphous material, the fraction increasing with decreasing grain size (e. g. 30...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{consider}} two studies which show how computer {{modeling and simulation}} {{can be used to}} study aspects of material science for which experimental methods would be time consuming or difficult. In the first we examined the optimization of electromagnetic levitation coils, for reduced sample temperature, through the development of a genetic algorithm and a rigorous analytical model. In the development of the analytical model for levitation, we propose a new model for the heating effect from a design consisting of a series of co-axial circular loops. With the new model we are better able to predict sample temperatures as compared with existing models. The new model is incorporated into a robust genetic algorithm to produce a powerful and generic design tool for the creation of levitation coils. Using this new design tool we seek to expand the range of temperatures (specifically to lower temperatures) and materials that are able to be studied using EML. In the second study, we examine the growth of a grain structure in the presence of second phase particles that act as pinning agents. The existing models of grain growth with pinning agents have thus far focused on particle distributions at the extremes of grain boundary correlation. When experimental measurements at the limits of correlation are compared to the appropriate models, they have shown good agreement but seem to suggest that there is a transition in behavior between the limits but the nature and mechanisms are not well known. As such we look to study <b>pinning</b> <b>agent</b> distributions centered around the initial grain boundaries and varied {{in such a way as}} to examine the transition from high to low boundary correlation. The results show that the average grain size varies smoothly during the transition. However, the results also show that there is an anomalous increase in grain size, when the boundary region containing pinning agents is slightly larger than the diffuse boundary width from the phase-field model and the local density of pinning agents is held constant. In this situation, it is believed that the reduction in the probability of an agent beginning on a boundary leads to a reduction in the fraction of boundaries interacting with a <b>pinning</b> <b>agent</b> and consequently an increase in the average grain size. This effect appears to out weigh the effect of the increased number of available pinning agents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} problem of event-triggered pinning control for the {{synchronization}} of networks of nonlinear dynamical agents onto a desired reference trajectory. The <b>pinned</b> <b>agents</b> are those that {{have access to the}} reference trajectory. We consider both static and switching topologies. We prove that the system is well posed and identify conditions under which the network achieves exponential convergence. A lower bound for the rate of convergence is also derived. Numerical examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the results are provided. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the formation of}} experimentally observed trapezoidal hillocks on etched Si(110) surfaces, describing their generic geometrical shape and analyzing the relative stability and/or reactivity of the key surface sites. In our model, the hillocks are stabilized by Cu impurities in the etchant adsorbing {{on the surface and}} acting as <b>pinning</b> <b>agents.</b> A model of random adsorptions will not result in hillock formation since a single impurity is easily removed from the surface. Instead a whole cluster of Cu atoms is needed as a mask to stabilize a hillock. Therefore we propose and analyze mechanisms that drive correlated adsorptions and lead to stable Cu clusters.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the low-frequency internal-friction peak observed in cold-worked Al- 0. 5 wt% (0. 21 at%) Cu around 214 K (f= 2 Hz) showed that it consists of two closely-situated internal-friction peaks : a relaxation peak (R-peak) and a "phase transformation peak" (P-peak). A. model of dragging by dislocations is suggested for the R-peak in which the copper atom-vacancy pairs are the mobile <b>pinning</b> <b>agents.</b> Experiments on Al- 4 wt% (1. 6 at%) Cu showed that the frequency-independent P-peak observed around 224 K cannot be attributed to the presence of G. P. [1] zone. This peak may be associated with some clustering stage of the Cu atoms in aluminum just before the formation of the G. P. [1] zone and may be correlated to an ordering phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{a system of}} mobile agents that move in an {{anisotropic}} space and interact according to the Vicsek model. In particular, the space is divided in two regions: in the first one, agents obey to the traditional Vicsek model, while in the second one, called control region, a motion control law is added. The control law forces the <b>pinned</b> <b>agents,</b> that are the agents moving in the control region, to follow a criterion mediating between the tendency to adopt the average direction of neighboring agents, and that to follow an imposed preferential direction. We show that, for low and medium levels of noise in the system, the control law is effective to drive the system towards a global ordered state, while, for high levels of noise, a strong control action leads to a configuration, for some aspects paradoxical, where all the agents tend to avoid the control region and occupy {{for most of the}} time the remaining part of the spac...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the leader-following consensus problem for multiagent systems with inherent nonlinear dynamics. Some M-matrix strategies are developed to address several challenging {{issues in the}} pinning control of multiagent systems by using algebraic graph theory and the properties of nonnegative matrices. It is shown that second-order leader-following consensus in a nonlinear multiagent system can be reached if the virtual leader has a directed path to every follower and a derived quantity is greater than a positive threshold. In particular, this paper analytically proves that leader-following consensus may be easier to be achieved by <b>pinning</b> more <b>agents</b> or increasing the pinning feedback gains. A selective pinning scheme is then proposed for nonlinear multiagent systems with directed network topologies. Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} deformation behaviour of zirconia single crystals stabilised with yttria is reviewed. Cubic or fully stabilised zirconia (FSZ), {{which is}} considered the matrix of high-strength partially stabilised zirconia (PSZ), deforms plastically down to 400 degrees C without confining hydrostatic pressure. The relevant deformation behaviour above about 1200 degrees C is characterised by athermal dislocation motion mainly on cube slip planes and diffusion-controlled recovery. Tetragonal polydomain zirconia or t' zirconia consists of plate-like tetragonal domains alternately stacked to form large colonies. These colonies are arranged in a characteristic way to fill the whole crystal volume. t' zirconia shows ferroelastic behaviour preceding dislocation plasticity. In tension, a tetragonal single crystal forms containing residual defects. The data available indicate that the coercive stress strongly depends on temperature. In situ straining experiments in a high-voltage electron microscope show an instantaneous switching of the individual tetragonal domains with the domain boundaries moving sidewise through the domains. Dislocations moving after the ferroelastic deformation are strongly bowed. The nature of the <b>pinning</b> <b>agents</b> is not clear yet. PSZ crystals are thought to consist of a cubic matrix and precipitates of the tetragonal phase of a structure {{similar to that of}} the colonies in t' zirconia. Complete dislocations in the cubic matrix moving on cube planes are partial dislocations in two of the three tetragonal variants of the precipitates. They have then to produce a stacking fault or antiphase boundary like defect. The strong age-hardening and overageing experimentally observed can be explained by a decreasing width of the matrix channels between the precipitates and an increasing width of the domains within the colonies. Recent in situ studies in a high-voltage electron microscope have shown that the precipitates in PSZ may undergo ferroelastic deformation, too. Besides, in a number of cases the matrix of PSZ crystals turned out to be tetragonal rather than cubic. Thus, the formation of a tetragonal single crystal containing residual defects as during the ferroelastic deformation in t' zirconia should affect the subsequent dislocation plasticity. The stacking fault or antiphase boundary like defects have experimentally been observed on { 110 } planes, however, not on the usual { 100 } slip planes. Thus, in spite of numerous experimental results a number of questions are still open particularly concerning the plastic deformation of PSZ crystals. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.
