5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert <b>petroleum</b> <b>refinery</b> naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
