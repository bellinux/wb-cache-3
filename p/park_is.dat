40|$|Current {{debates on}} {{downtown}} <b>parking</b> policy have <b>been</b> concentrating on downtown parking pricing, while overlooking downtown parking capacity. This paper focuses {{on how much}} curbside to allocate to parking when the private sector provides garage parking. In the first-best optimum, no cruising for parking occurs, and only curbside <b>parking</b> <b>is</b> provided when demand is low relative to street capacity, both curbside parking and garage <b>parking</b> <b>are</b> provided when demand in intermediate, and only garage <b>parking</b> <b>is</b> provided when demand is high. In the second-best optimum where curbside <b>parking</b> <b>is</b> underpriced, cruising for parking occurs only when both curbside and garage <b>parking</b> <b>are</b> both present. As the fee differential between garage and curbside parking increases, cruising for parking becomes more severe, {{and the range of}} demand levels over which curbside and garage <b>parking</b> <b>are</b> both present shrinks and eventually disappears...|$|R
