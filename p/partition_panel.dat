40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} to develop {{fire-resistant}} panels with a high biomass ash ratio from the combustion of EFB at an industrial scale {{to be used in}} different fire-resistant internal partitions in buildings and industrial constructions. This study develop new products made of by biomass ash from industry waste for the internal partitions panel. Modifying the internal <b>partition</b> <b>panel</b> of wall with addition of biomass ash (EFB) and clay soils in producing new products that can resist and retain durability and resilience of the panel products to the fire. ASTM C 1396 Standard Specification for Gypsum Board defines Gypsum wallboard as designed wallboard use for on walls, ceilings, or partitions and that affords a surface suitable to receive decoration tested in accordance with ASTM E 1 19 Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials. For this study, fire resistance, thermal and mechanical parameters were measured. The panels which are 100 mm × 100 mm by 15 mm thick were prepared following ASTM standard. The product here studied in the form of low-density panels (800 kg/m) has a great potential for an industrial use, showing similar properties to those found in commercial gypsum plasterboard, a material of generalized use for this type of application. Consequently, from the test, biomass ash (EFB) panel board can retain more than 2 hours fire resistance in standard conditions of room temperature by fire laboratory and panels showing a compressive strength of 3. 535 MPa...|$|E

40|$|A {{partitioned}} fluid-structure coupling {{code for}} transonic panel flutter {{has been developed}} and validated. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically {{by means of an}} implicit finite volume method to account for nonlinear aerodynamics, as there are shock waves and a viscous boundary layer at the panel surface. An implicit finite element formulation of the structural equations as well as a Galerkin solution of the von-Kármán plate equation are employed to solve elastic panel deformations with respect to geometric nonlinearities. A detailed validation process is presented in this paper for high subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers. This comprises a discussion of available results from literature with the objective to propose a guideline for validation purposes of <b>partitioned</b> <b>panel</b> flutter solvers. Thereupon the code is used for studies on the impact of turbulent boundary layer characteristics on aeroelastic stability boundaries and post-flutter.

40|$|The primary {{advantages}} of using natural fibers as reinforcements in plastics are numerous. Such fibers may exhibit low densities, non abrasiveness, high specific properties (such as high filling levels possibly resulting in high stiffness properties),easily recycled nonbrittle fibers, sharp curvature allowances (with no fracture), and biodegradability. There {{may also be}} wide fiber availability (throughout the world). One of the big areas of development is in combining natural fibers with thermoplastic. Combining kenaf fiber with other materials provides a strategy for producting advanced composite materials that {{take advantage of the}} properties of both types of materials. It allows the researchers to design materials in accordance to the end - use requirements within a framework of cost, availability, recycliability, energy use, and environmental considerations. Kenaf fiber is a potentially outstanding reinforcing filler in thermoplastic composites.

40|$|A {{distributed}} acoustic actuator {{for active}} noise control, {{consisting of a}} piezoelectric PVDF film, bonded at each side of a carrier structure, is simulated and built. The piezoelements are driven in anti-phase, resulting in a bending motion of the actuator, and thus in the necessary out-of-plane displacement for sound radiation. An analytical model for the acoustic actuator is derived, relating the actuator's displacement to the applied voltage, {{taking into account the}} influence of the piezoelectric film on the actuator's stiffness. The model is used to optimise the specifications for the piezoelectric film and the carrier structure, resulting in the highest sound power output in a frequency range from 30  500 Hz. An analytical model for the behaviour of a double <b>panel</b> <b>partition</b> is derived. The analytical model is combined with the model for the acoustic actuator, describing an actively controlled double <b>panel</b> <b>partition</b> with a distributed acoustic actuator integrated in the cavity.

40|$|In many {{situations}} {{it is impossible}} to obtain a suitable reference signal which is highly correlated with the offending noise source. In such cases feedforward control becomes ineffective and feedback control may indeed be the only alternative. In this paper, experimental results obtained from the feedback control of noise transmission through a double-panel partition are presented to show its effectiveness. The approach makes use of an acoustic secondary source located within the cavity enclosed by the two <b>partitioning</b> <b>panels</b> and driven by the output from an error microphone via a feedback compensator. In the two cases investigated the first deals with the control of a narrow-band low frequency disturbance below the first resonance of the acoustic cavity bounded by the panels. The result shows that global sound attenuation within this cavity leads to global noise reduction inside the receiving room. In the second instance, the control of a higher frequency noise where the sound field between the panels is dominated by more than one cavity mode is attempted. The experimental result shows that noise reduction inside the cavity does not guarantee global sound attenuation inside the receiving room by the single-channel feedback control...|$|R

It allows the researchers to design materials in accordance to the end-use requirements within a framework of cost, availability, recyclability, energy use, and environmental considerations. Kenaf fiber is a potentially outstanding reinforcement in thermoplastic composites [1, 2]. In this paper the research is focused on development of a lightweight, environmentally friendly, cost-effective composite material based on natural i. e. kenaf fibers applied as <b>partitioning</b> <b>panels</b> in buildings. Kenaf/PP composite preforms of different fiber content have been fabricated by KEFI-Italy. Consolidation of the composite preforms was performed at T= 175 oC, P= 180 bar, t= 15 min. Mechanical properties of Kenaf/PP composites have been characterized by tensile and bending test, as well as by DMTA. Water absorption was followed at room temperature. The research has shown that high fiber/low matrix kenaf/PP composites can fulfill the end user requirements for partitioning boards in offices and dwelling houses to a greater extend. The results have shown that the obtained composites have exhibit average flexural strength of 30, 1 MPa and modulus of 9, 0 GPa, impact toughness of 43, 1 kJ/m 2 and compression strength of 17, 4 MPa. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{jackknife}} {{for reducing the}} order of the bias of maximum likelihood estimates of nonlinear dynamic fixed effects panel models. In its simplest form, the half-panel jackknife, the estimator is just 2 θ ̂ − θ 1 / 2, where θ ̂ is the MLE from the full panel and θ 1 / 2 is the average of the two half-panel MLEs, each using T/ 2 time periods and all N cross-sectional units. This estimator eliminates the first-order bias of θ̂. The order of the bias is further reduced if two <b>partitions</b> of the <b>panel</b> are used, for example, two half-panels and three 1 / 3 -panels, and the corresponding MLEs. On further <b>partitioning</b> the <b>panel,</b> any order of bias reduction can be achieved. The split-panel jackknife estimators are asymptotically normal, centered at the true value, with variance equal to that of the MLE under asymptotics where T is allowed to grow slowly with N. In analogous fashion, the split-panel jackknife reduces the bias of the profile likelihood and the bias of marginal-effect estimates. Simulations in fixed-effect dynamic discrete-choice models with small T show that the split-panel jackknife effectively reduces the bias of the MLE and yields confidence intervals with much better coverage...|$|R
