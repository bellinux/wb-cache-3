5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of <b>psittacosis</b> and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with <b>psittacosis</b> and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of <b>psittacosis</b> (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E

2500|$|Sayings about parrots colour {{the modern}} English language. [...] The verb [...] "parrot" [...] in the {{dictionary}} means [...] "to repeat by rote". [...] Also clichés such as the British expression [...] "sick as a parrot" [...] are given; although this refers to extreme disappointment rather than illness, it may originate from the disease of <b>psittacosis,</b> which can be passed to humans. The first occurrence of a related expression is in Aphra Behn's 1681 play The False Count. Fans of Jimmy Buffett are known as parrotheads. Parrots feature in many media. Magazines are devoted to parrots as pets, and to the conservation of parrots. Fictional films include Home Alone 3 [...] and Rio, and documentaries include The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Feral parrot flocks can {{be formed}} after mass escapes of newly imported, wild-caught parrots from {{airports}} or quarantine facilities. Large groups of escapees have {{the protection of}} a flock and possess the skills to survive and breed in the wild. Some feral parakeets may have descended from escaped zoo birds. Escaped or released pets rarely contribute to establishing feral populations. Escapes typically involve only {{one or a few}} birds at a time, so the birds do not have the protection of a flock and often do not have a mate. Most captive-born birds do not possess the necessary survival skills to find food or avoid predators and often do not survive long without human caretakers. However, in areas where there are existing feral parrot populations, escaped pets may sometimes successfully join these flocks. The most common era or years that feral parrots were released to non-native environments was from the 1890s to the 1940s, during the wild-caught parrot era. In the <b>psittacosis</b> [...] "parrot fever" [...] panic of 1930, a city health commissioner urged everyone who owned a parrot to put them down, but owners abandoned their parrots on the streets.|$|E

5000|$|In 1929, {{a highly}} publicized {{outbreak}} of <b>psittacosis</b> hit the United States.

[...] The aftermath of the outbreak and how it was handled led to the establishment of the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
50|$|<b>Psittacosis</b> {{belongs to}} a group of {{infectious}} diseases transmitted from birds to man (so-called ornithoses). - Meyer isolated the agent of <b>psittacosis</b> (i.e. one of the Chlamydia bacterium) and later also defined antigens. In addition, in the early 1930s, Meyer fought for interstate embargo on the export of parakeets to stop propagation of the disease. He also was responsible for California-wide actions to liberate the majority of aviaries of infested birds. Towards this goal, the Hooper became a center for testing thousands of birds and selecting the ones free of the bacteria, with the result that germs and disease largely disappeared from local commerce. With the advent of antibiotics, the disease can be successfully treated. Meyer, together with colleagues, developed a system of quarantine and treatment for imported birds that was highly effective in minimizing <b>psittacosis</b> in imported pet birds. The incidence of <b>psittacosis</b> declined notably owing to the many discoveries in this area by Meyer.|$|E

50|$|From 2002 through 2009, 66 human {{cases of}} <b>psittacosis</b> were {{reported}} to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and most resulted from exposure to infected pet birds, usually cockatiels, parakeets, and macaws. Many more cases may occur that are not correctly diagnosed or reported.Bird owners, pet shop employees, zookeepers and veterinarians {{are at risk of}} the infection. Some outbreaks of <b>psittacosis</b> in poultry processing plants have been reported.|$|E
50|$|However, other {{contagion}} besides {{bird flu}} are transmitted by pigeons. For example, the bacteria Chlamydophila psittaci is endemic among pigeons and causes <b>psittacosis</b> in humans. It is transmitted both from handling pigeons but mostly from their droppings. <b>Psittacosis</b> {{is a serious}} disease but rarely fatal (less than 1%). Pigeons are also important vectors for different species of the bacteria Salmonella, which causes diseases as salmonellosis and paratyphoid fever.|$|E
50|$|The disease {{caused by}} C. psittaci, <b>psittacosis,</b> was first {{characterized}} in 1879 when seven individuals in Switzerland {{were found to}} experience pneumonia after exposure to tropical pet birds. The causative pathogen was not known. The related bacterial species Chlamydia trachomatis was described in 1907, but {{was assumed to be}} a virus, as it could not be grown on artificial media. In the winter of 1929-1930, a <b>psittacosis</b> pandemic spread across the United States and Europe. Its mortality rate was 20% and as high as 80% for pregnant women. The disease's spread was eventually attributed to exposure to Amazon parrots imported from Argentina. Though C. psittaci was identified in 1930 as the agent responsible for <b>psittacosis,</b> it was not found to be a bacterium until examination by electron microscopy in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 he {{transferred}} {{to the study of}} Foot-and-mouth disease and in 1926 was awarded a Freedom Fellowship to study viruses at London Hospital, which in 1929 included a study of <b>psittacosis.</b> The causal micro-organisms Chlamydophila psittaci of <b>psittacosis</b> were known, from the 1930s to the 1960s, as Bedsoniae {{as a result of his}} research. In 1934 he was appointed to the Goldsmiths Company’s Chair of Bacteriology at the London Hospital Medical College, from which he retired in 1952.|$|E

50|$|Dr Walter Michel Levinthal FRSE (1886-1963) was a German-born bacteriologist, {{working in}} Britain in the 20th century. He gave {{his name to}} Levinthal’s Agar. He {{is known for his}} work on <b>Psittacosis</b> and the {{influenza}} virus.|$|E
50|$|Chlamydia psittaci is {{a lethal}} {{intracellular}} bacterial species that may cause endemic avian chlamydiosis, epizootic outbreaks in mammals, and respiratory <b>psittacosis</b> in humans. Potential hosts include feral birds and domesticated poultry {{as well as}} cattle, pigs, sheep and horses. Chlamydia psittaci is transmitted by inhalation, contact or ingestion among birds and to mammals. <b>Psittacosis</b> in birds and in humans often starts with flu-like symptoms and becomes a life-threatening pneumonia. Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated under stress. Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydia infection, because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{control is}} {{important}} because pest birds can create health-related problems through their feces, including histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and <b>psittacosis.</b> Bird droppings may also cause damage to property and equipment.
