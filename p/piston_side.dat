50|$|An engine {{has many}} moving parts that produce {{friction}}. Some of these friction forces remain constant (as long as applied load is constant); {{some of these}} friction losses increase as engine speed increases, such as <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> forces and connecting bearing forces (due to increased inertia forces from the oscillating piston). A few friction forces decrease at higher speed, such as the friction force on the cam's lobes used to operate the inlet and outlet valves (the valves' inertia at high speed tends to pull the cam follower away from the cam lobe). Along with friction forces, an operating engine has pumping losses, which is the work required to move air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. This pumping loss is minimal at low speed, but increases approximately as the square of the speed, until at rated power an engine is using about 20% of total power production to overcome friction and pumping losses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{secondary}} {{motion of}} a piston {{has a significant}} impact on the performance and reliability of an internal combustion engine. However, the variation in the system inertia, namely the variable inertia of the piston–connecting-rod–crankshaft mechanism due to the change in their positions relative to the crankshaft axis, has been neglected in most studies on piston secondary motion. A novel mathematical model is developed for piston–connecting-rod–crankshaft dynamics by taking the variation in the system inertia into consideration. Then a coupling model of the piston secondary dynamics and the fluid dynamic lubrication is built. The simulations show that the variation in the system inertia influences the piston secondary motion and <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> force, and that the <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> force plays an important role in determining the piston lateral motion. Results also show that the engine speed and the centre-of-mass (COM) positions of the connecting rod have considerable effect on the piston secondary motion. The analysis of the COM positions can be employed to optimize the design of the connecting rod...|$|E

The finite-element model is established in this study to predict the dynamic responses of cylinder liners to two significant sources: combustion shock and <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> thrust. It takes into account both the characteristics of structural modes and nonlinearities of assembly constraints when selecting adequate elements for efficient computation of the responses under both the highly nonlinear combustion pressure excitations and subsequent piston slap impacts. The predictions are then evaluated against experimental results under different engine operating conditions. To suppressing noise in measured signals, continuous wavelet analysis is employed to process the complicated responses for characterizing key response events and their frequency ranges.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{comparative}} frictional behaviour of drum brakes and disc brakes in automobiles has been investigated. The influential factors; contact force and friction radius were modeled for {{the estimation of}} the friction coefficient for drum as well as disc brakes. The effect of contact force and friction radius is studied with varying conditions of parameters; longitudinal force, caliper force and torque on <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> as well as non-piston side. The numerical results obtained have been compared with the similar obtained from virtual Matlab/Simulink models for drum and disc brakes. The results evidenced that friction radius predominantly affects brake pressure and thus the friction coefficient, also the increase in contact force resulted with decrease in friction coefficient both for drum and disc brakes. Further {{it has been found}} that disc brakes exhibit gradual decrease of friction coefficient due to the equitable distribution of braking effort while drum brake presents sudden variations in friction coefficient. It can be revealed that frictional behaviour of disc brake is more consistent than drum brake...|$|E

It is well-known that the replacing of the rotating compressor from a classical refrigerator by a linear compressor leads to an efficiency improving wit about 5 % by avoiding the <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> friction, which is very important because of the huge number of refrigerators in operation world-wide.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the frictional behavior of a roller crosshead configuration is given. This configuration consists of a piston which carries at the wristpin position a roller of large diameter which can roll on the cylinder liner surfaces. A preliminary assessment is given of whether the roller can roll on the cylinder liner without skidding, and what, if any, are the tribological implications of this approach to a dry lubricated design. The rotational speed of the roller must change during the stroke {{if it is not}} to slip on the cylinder liner. The maximum value of angular acceleration occurs at top dead center and bottom dead center. If the traction force {{on the rim of the}} roller, which is the product of the normal force due to <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> load and the coefficient of friction, is not sufficient to drive the roller through the necessary angular acceleration, sliding will occur. At 1, 000 rpm, it appears that there will be a definite area of slip near each end of the stroke. The length of the area of slip may be of the order of 1 / 8 inch at each of these points...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the relationship between the combustion behavior and vibration response of internal combustion (IC) engines fueled with biodiesel based on finite element modelling along with experimental evaluation. An improved finite element (FE) model is established and validated to predict the dynamic responses of cylinder liners with respect to two main sources: combustion shock and <b>piston</b> <b>side</b> thrust. Based on the validated FE model, the response characteristics of the cylinder liner in an IC engine fueled with biodiesel and its causal relationship with excitation sources have been predicted. Due to the lower calorific value of biodiesel, a greater amount of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber to maintain power outputs, which results in a prolonged combustion duration and subsequent higher overall vibration levels, compared with that of diesel. The advanced ignition of biodiesel is the main cause to the compound effect on the coupling of piston side-thrust force, thereby resulting in a nonlinear increase in the root mean square (RMS) of local vibration response close to the combustion top dead center (TDC). These key findings provides insight understandings for not only biodiesel combustion diagnostics but also more accurate diagnostics of fossil diesel based on nonintrusive vibrations...|$|E
