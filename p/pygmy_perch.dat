40|$|Biogeographic {{patterns}} {{displayed by}} obligate freshwater organisms are intimately {{related to the}} nature and extent of connectivity between suitable habitats. Two of the more significant barriers to freshwater connections are seawater and major drainage divides. South-eastern Australia provides a contrast between these barriers as it has discrete areas that are likely influenced to a greater or lesser extent by each barrier type. We use continental shelf width as a proxy for the potential degree of river coalescence during low sea levels. Our specific hypothesis is that the degree of phylogeographic divergence between coastal river basins should correspond to the continental shelf width of each region. This predicts that genetic divergences between river basins should be lowest in regions with a wider continental shelf and that regions with similar continental shelf width should have similar genetic divergences. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>perches</b> (Nannoperca australis and Nannoperca ‘flindersi’) in south-eastern Australia provide an ideal opportunity to test these biogeographic hypotheses. Phylogeographic patterns were examined based on range-wide sampling of 82 populations for cytochrome b and 23 polymorphic allozyme loci. Our results recovered only limited support for our continental shelf width hypothesis, although patterns within Bass clade were largely congruent with reconstructed low sea-level drainage patterns. In addition, we identified several instances of drainage divide crossings, typically associated with low elevational differences. Our results demonstrate high levels of genetic heterogeneity with important conservation implications, especially for declining populations in the Murray–Darling Basin and a highly restricted disjunct population in Ansons River, Tasmania.

40|$|The {{biogeography}} {{of southern}} Australia {{is characterized by}} a repeated pattern of relatedness between the biota of southwestern and southeastern Australia. Both areas possess a temperate climate but are separated by a vast arid region, currently lacking permanent freshwater habitats, which has become increasingly drier since about 15 Ma. Aquatic organisms have thus potentially remained isolated for a considerable time. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>perches</b> (Nannatherina and Nannoperca, Percichthyidae) provide an excellent scenario for investigating biogeographic relationships between southwestern and southeastern regions as multiple species occur on either side of Australia. This allows us to potentially differentiate between “Multiple Invasion” and “Endemic Speciation,” the two major hypotheses proposed to account for current distributions. The first suggests that multiple east–west movements have occurred, whereas the second suggests a single east–west split, with current biodiversity in each region being reciprocally monophyletic. Systematic relationships within this group were investigated with the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene; nuclear intron and exon sequences from S 7, RAG 1, and RAG 2; and 53 allozyme loci. Our data supported the hypothesis of multiple movements across southern Australia based on a consistent lack of support for reciprocal monophyly of eastern and western species. This study appears to be the first example of an animal group displaying clear multiple east–west movement in southern Australia, as all other aquatic and terrestrial fauna previously examined displayed a single east–west split. Despite a high degree of sympatry within each region, the only evidence for hybridization was found between Nannoperca australis and N. obscura, with the latter having its mitochondrial genome completely replaced by that of N. australis, with no evidence for nuclear introgression. This is one of only a few confirmed examples of complete replacement of the mitochondrial genome in one species with that of another. Cryptic differentiation was also evident within the two most widespread species, N. australis and N. vittata, indicating that these likely consist of multiple species. We also highlight the need for multiple molecular markers with different strengths in order to obtain a more robust phylogeny, despite problems resulting from potential incongruences between data sets.

40|$|During September 2004 a {{total of}} 25 sites were sampled for fish and {{freshwater}} crayfish in Ellen Brook, Cowaramup Brook and Gunyulgup Brook. This included 11 sites on Ellen Brook, six sites on Cowaramup Brook and eight sites on Gunyulgup Brook. A total of 1270, 720 and 1450 m 2 were sampled on Ellen, Cowaramup and Gunyulgup Brooks, respectively. Five species of fish were captured in the 11 sites sampled in Ellen Brook. These included two freshwater species that are endemic to south-western Australia, i. e. the Western <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> and the Nightfish, the marine-estuarine opportunistic Sea Mullet, the marine Zebra Fish and the introduced Mosquitofish. The only fish species captured in the six sites sampled in Cowaramup Brook was the introduced Mosquitofish. Three species of fish were captured in the eight sites sampled in Gunyulgup Brook. These include the estuarine Swan River Goby and Black Bream and the marine/estuarine opportunistic Sea Mullet. All three species were found {{at the mouth of}} the brook, with the Black Bream (1 specimen, 43 mm TL) and Sea Mullet (5 individuals, 34 - 43 mm TL) being small juveniles.

40|$|A {{paucity of}} {{information}} {{exists on the}} fish and crayfish communities of two major rivers that flow into the Leschenault Inlet, south-western Western Australia. This study documents these communities and assesses their ecological significance. During February 2006, seven sites were sampled for fish and freshwater crayfish {{on each of the}} Brunswick River and Preston River with additional sites having been previously sampled in the summer of 1999 / 2000. The rivers generally had similar native fish communities with four endemic species, Freshwater Cobbler, Western Minnow, Western <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> and Nightfish making up 60 % of all fish captures (2670) with the remaining being from three feral freshwater and six estuarine species. Two native species of freshwater crayfish were also recorded, the Marron and Gilgie. The endemic Western Minnow and Western <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> were the most common and widespread native fish species in both rivers. This study recorded {{what appears to be the}} Empire Gudgeon in the Preston River; the first record of this northern Australian species in the South-west Drainage Division, and its presence was attributed either to marine larval drift or as a result of an aquarium release.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} freshwater macrophytes as refuge by testing the hypothesis that predators capture fewer prey in more dense and structurally complex habitats. We also tested the hypothesis that habitat structure not only affects the prey-capture success of a single predator in isolation, but also the effectiveness of two predators combined, particularly if it mediates interactions between the predators. We conducted a fully crossed four-factorial laboratory experiment using artificial plants to determine the separate quantitative (density) and qualitative (shape) components of macrophyte structure on the prey-capture success of a predatory damselfly, Ischnura heterosticta tasmanica, and the southern <b>pygmy</b> <b>perch,</b> Nannoperca australis. Contrary to our expectations, macrophyte density {{had no effect on}} the prey-capture success of either predator, but both predators were significantly less effective in the structurally complex Myriophyllum analogue than in the structurally simpler Triglochin and Eleocharis analogues. Furthermore, the greater structural complexity of Myriophyllum amplified the impact of the negative interaction between the predators on prey numbers; the habitat use by damselfly larvae in response to the presence of southern <b>pygmy</b> <b>perch</b> meant they captured less prey in Myriophyllum. These results demonstrate habitat structure can influence multiple predator effects, and support the mechanism of increased prey refuge in more structurally complex macrophytes...|$|E
40|$|Water {{from the}} Yarragadee Aquifer {{surfaces}} in Poison Gully and Milyeannup Brook, and maintains flow in these Blackwood River tributaries throughout the year. It also enters Layman Brook during winter and spring, yet this stream dries during summer. The {{aim of this}} study was to provide baseline information on the fish and freshwater crayfish fauna in these Yarragadee aquifer-fed tributaries, and compare them to both those upstream tributaries devoid of any flow from the aquifer, and those tributaries entering the Blackwood River immediately downstream of the aquifer discharge area. A comparison was also made of the fish fauna of the Blackwood River main channel that receives flow from the Yarragadee Aquifer to a number of main channel sites upstream of the discharge area, i. e. main channel sites that do not receive any flow from the Yarragadee. There was a significant difference between the fish fauna associated with main channel sites when compared to tributaries and there were substantial differences in the fauna of the downstream and upstream main channel sites. Main channel sites downstream of the Yarragadee Aquifer discharge area had a much higher diversity of fish and freshwater crayfish than main channel sites upstream of the discharge area. For example, within the main channel sites that receive summer input from the Yarragadee, 11 species of fish and 4 species crayfish were captured compared to 4 species of fish and 2 species of crayfish upstream of the discharge zone. Furthermore, the 4 species of fish in the main channel in the upper riverine part of the study area were all halotolerant, whereas most of the additional species present in the sites in the lower section of the river tolerate only low salinities. A number of species found in the main channel are absent from the tributary sites sampled and vice versa. For example, Freshwater Cobbler, Western Hardyheads, Swan River Gobies and South-western Gobies were only captured in the main channel, while Mud Minnows and Balston’s <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> were restricted to tributaries. The tributaries that receive direct flows from the Yarragadee Aquifer, i. e. Milyeannup Brook and Poison Gully provide important refuges for Balston’s <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> and Mud Minnows. Ninety percent of all Balston’s <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> were found in Milyeannup Brook and with the exception of one site in the tributaries upstream of the Yarragadee (Leederville Aquifer sites), all Mud Minnows were only found in excavated waterpoints. Water extraction and the lowering of water tables have the potential to reduce surface water in Milyeannup Brook and Poison Gully and may lead to the elimination of Balston’s <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Perch</b> from the Blackwood River. It may also impact on aestivating fish and freshwater crayfish by drying out the substrates that they burrow into. The main channel section of the Blackwood River that receives flow from the Yarragadee Aquifer supports a number of recreational fisheries, the most important being the Marron fishery, and reduced freshwater input from the Yarragadee Aquifer may comprise these fisheries. Reduced inflow of freshwater could potentially lead to an increase in salinity of this part of the river and may be intolerable to a number of species (see Discussion) ...|$|E
