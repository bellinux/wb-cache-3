40|$|Background: Many {{essential}} oils have been advocated {{for use in}} complementary medicine for bacterial and fungal infections. However few of the many claims of therapeutic efficacy have been validated adequately by either in vitro testing or in vivo clinical trials. The objective {{of the study was}} to study the antifungal activity of nine commercially available {{essential oils}} against Candida albicans in vitro and to compare the antifungal activity between each material. Methodology: Nine pure essential oils; wintergreen oil, lime oil, cinnamon oil, spearmint <b>oil,</b> peppermint <b>oil,</b> <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil,</b> cedarwood oil, clove oil and eucalyptus oil were selected for the study. Candida albicans was inoculated at 37 ˚C and seeded on Sabourauds dextrose agar medium. Sterilized filter paper saturated with the oils were placed on the seeded agar plates and inoculated for 48 hours. Zone of inhibition were measured around the filter paper in millimeters with vernier caliper. Results: Cinnamon oil showed highest activity against Candida albicans followed by <b>Lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> and cedarwood oil. Wintergreen oil, lime oil, peppermint oil and spearmint oil showed no antifungal activity.

The porosity of the prepared porcelain ceramics, which affects the different absorption and vaporization of essential oils, was studied by the variation of Al 2 O 3 quantities and firing temperatures. The absorption and vaporization on water and essential oils of the developed ceramics were studied at ambient temperature (24 - 27 °C), 50 °C and 100 °C. The ceramic product fried at 1150 °C possessed a higher absorption and evaporation than that fired at 1230 °C in all evaporated temperatures. Moreover, in term of the absorption property, water absorption raised as the Al 2 O 3 content increased however; at 1150 °C of firing temperature, water absorption increased to maximum at 4 % Al 2 O 3 content but decreased at higher content.

50|$|Coatings are {{sometimes}} applied to copper. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth, and metallic tone of copper alloys. Oils exclude moisture from copper roofs and flashings and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster {{and depth of}} color. The most popular oils are lemon <b>oil,</b> U.S.P., <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil,</b> Native E.I., paraffin oils, linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended up to five years. Opaque paint coatings are primarily applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required. Lead-coated copper coatings are used when the appearance of exposed lead is desired or where water runoff from uncoated copper alloys would ordinarily stain lighter-colored building materials, such as marble, limestone, stucco, mortar, or concrete. Zinc-tin coatings are an alternative to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and workability.|$|R

The primary objective was to show that novel essential oil loaded microspheres are promising {{in the treatment of}} H. pylori infection as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy. In this context, firstly, the minimum inhibitory concentration of clarithromycin and five essential <b>oils</b> namely <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil,</b> thyme oil, clove leaf oil, lemon oil and cinnamon bark oil on H. pylori was investigated. Among five essential oils, cinnamon bark oil showed the strongest anti-H. pylori activity. After choosing the most effective essential oil on H. pylori, we focused on the preparation of clarithromycin and cinnamon bark oil loaded microspheres by spray drying technique. Spray drying conditions were optimized by reponse surface methodology. Genipin, a natural crosslinker, was used as a crosslinking agent to achieve controlled drug release. Finally, it was aimed to investigate the clarithromycin and essential oil release in buffer solution and their antibacterial activity on H. pylori when released from microspheres. Higuchi equation well described the release characteristics. Drug release from microspheres was diffusion controlled. Cinnamon bark oil and clarithromycin released from the microspheres inhibited the growth of H. pylori resulting that the antibacterial activity of cinnamon bark oil and clarithromycin was maintained during the microsphere manufacturing. In conclusion, clarithromycin and cinnamon bark oil loaded chitosan microspheres have a great potential {{to be used as a}} control release system in treatment of H. pylori infection...|$|R

40|$|Cryptococcosis is an {{emerging}} and recalcitrant systemic infection occurring in immunocompromised patients. This invasive fungal infection {{is difficult to}} treat due {{to the ability of}} Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus laurentii to form biofilms resistant to standard antifungal treatment. The toxicity concern of these drugs has stimulated the search for natural therapeutic alternatives. Essential oil and their active components (EO-ACs) have shown to possess the variety of biological and pharmacological properties. In the present investigation the effect of six (EO-ACs) sourced from Oregano oil (Carvacrol), Cinnamon <b>oil</b> (Cinnamaldehyde), <b>Lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> (Citral), Clove oil (Eugenol), Peppermint oil (Menthol) and Thyme oil (thymol) against three infectious forms; planktonic cells, biofilm formation and preformed biofilm of C. neoformans and C. laurentii were evaluated as compared to standard drugs. Data showed that antibiofilm activity of the tested EO-ACs were in the order: thymol>carvacrol>citral>eugenol=cinnamaldehyde>menthol respectively. The three most potent EO-ACs, thymol, carvacrol, and citral showed excellent antibiofilm activity at a much lower concentration against C. laurentii in comparison to C. neoformans indicating the resistant nature of the latter. Effect of the potent EO-ACs on the biofilm morphology was visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which revealed the absence of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM), reduction in cellular density and alteration in the surface morphology of biofilm cells. Further, to realize the efficacy of the EO-ACs in terms of human safety, cytotoxicity assays and co-culture model were evaluated. Thymol and carvacrol as compared to citral were the most efficient in terms of human safety in keratinocyte- Cryptococcus sp. co-culture infection model suggesting that these two can be further exploited as cost-effective and non-toxic anti-cryptococcal drugs...|$|R

40|$|Polylactic acid was {{combined}} with <b>lemongrass</b> essential <b>oil</b> (EO) to produce functional nanocapsules (NCs). The obtained polylactic acid nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity both {{with and without}} the presence of lemongrass oil; however, the presence of EO improved {{the activity of the}} NCs. The presence of lemongrass assisted the formation of well-separated NCs and also provided enhanced antimicrobial properties, since lemongrass is known for its antimicrobial character. Fluorescence microscopy was used to optically observe the nanoparticles and NCs and revealed the attachment of <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> with the polylactic acid NCs.

40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} essential oils from clove, cedar wood, Cymbopogon species, peppermint, Eucalyptus and neem were tested for their efficacy against nine Fusarium species, namely F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, F. anthophilum, F. pallidoroseum, F. sporotrichioides, F. solani, F. graminearum and F. lateritium, isolated from maize and sorghum. The {{results showed that}} essential oilswere antifungal at concentrations of 500 - 2500 ppm or higher. The oil Cymbopogon nardus (referred to as citronella oil) was inhibiting all the Fusarium species growth at 500 ppm and higher. The next most potent inhibitors, the oil from C. citratus (referred to as <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil)</b> and peppermint oils, were fully inhibitory from a concentration of 1500 and 2000 ppm and higher, respectively. Eucalyptus and neem oils were less effective in inhibiting the growth of Fusarium species tested, irrespective of their concentration. Among the seven essential oils tested against all the Fusarium species,the citronella oil showed highest inhibitory effect (minimuminhibitoryconcentration, MIC) at ≥ 1500, 2000, 1000, 500 ppm against F. verticillioides, F. oxysporum, F. sporotrichioides, F. lateritium mycelial growth development respectively. However clove, <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> and citronella showed highest inhibitory effect (≥ 1500 ppm) against F. proliferatum and F. pallidoroseum respectively.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of mixed flowers bouquets {{has increased in}} the cut flower industry. The longevity of mixed flowers bouquets {{is limited by the}} individual life of each flower in the bunch. Various factors have been studied for their effect on the individual life of each flower in mixed flowers bouquets. The results indicate that the differences in vase life of each flower in mixed bouquets may come from the influence of their phenotype. In cut rose flowers, there were various contents of fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol in all cultivars. However, levels of sugars contents were not related to the long-lived cultivars. For cut lily flowers, the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose were measured in the primary and the secondary bud of ‘Tiber’ lilies. Differences in the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose between the primary and secondary bud, did not relate to the longevity of individual bud life. However, this experiment found increases in sucrose contents in both positions before the time of opening. This increase in sucrose may relate {{to the role of the}} carbohydrate energy source for bud opening. Bacteria found in this study seemed to be largely specific to different flower types. Also, species of bacteria found in the vase water of mixed flowers were less than in that of single varieties. Difference in species of bacteria may be due to differences between plants, and the conditions they exert in the vase water. In general bacterial numbers were high at the beginning of all the experiments, indicating a strong inoculum effect from stems, although there was no straightforward relationship between stem numbers and inoculum size, in all cases. Experiments of single varieties were studied using ‘Tiber’ lily, ‘Akito’ rose and ‘Valentino’ rose. The results indicated that the addition of stems did not result in higher numbers of bacteria, but vase life was reduced, especially for the roses. The effect of number of stems in mixed flowers was investigated in distilled water and liquid flower food. The result of the addition of stems was to reduce the vase life of both ‘Tiber’ lily and ‘Akito’ rose. However, the effect of more stems of ‘Akito’ roses had a greater effect on vase life, fresh weight and water uptake than in ‘Tiber’ lilies. This indicated that ‘Akito’ roses had a greater response to high bacteria populations than lilies. The role of chemical exudates on flowers was not clear in the present study as they only had an effect during the early part of the vase life. The vase lives of ‘Tiber’ lilies and ‘Akito’ roses in all treatments were not significantly different. Perhaps treatment effects caused by the presence of chemical exudates may have been ‘masked’ by the presence of micro-organisms. The screening of 12 essential oils (West Indian bay, cinnamon leaf, clove bud, clove leaf, Chinese ginger, lemongrass, mandarin, rosemary, sage, spearmint, sweet fennel, and thyme) showed that thyme <b>oil</b> and <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> are effective against more bacterial species over other essential oils. The comparison of the minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) of thyme <b>oil</b> and <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil</b> showed that the average MBC for thyme oil was lower than that of <b>lemongrass.</b> However, the thyme <b>oil</b> failed to extend the vase life of ‘Tiber’ lily and ‘Akito’ rose. Thyme oil was effective against bacteria for a very short time and could not extend vase life, especially that of the ‘Akito’ rose. Overall, thyme oil treatment appeared to reduce vase life. The efficacy of nine weak organic acids was studied in vivo for their effect on six bacterial species. Bacterial samples were inoculated on trypticase soya agar (TSA) pH 4 and 7. At pH 7, the TSA was prepared by using distilled water. All six bacteria species grew well under these conditions. The results of weak organic acids studied at pH 7 showed that Trans-cinnamic acid was the only weak organic acid that could act against some bacteria. At pH 4, only L 8 (Bacillus spp.) could grow, and Trans- cinnamic acid was effective against this bacteria. The initial result of testing Trans- cinnamic acid against bacteria offered some promise for it to be applied successfully to the vase water of cut flowers, in combination with buffer systems...|$|R
