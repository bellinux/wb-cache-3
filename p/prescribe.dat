DESIGN [...] Analysis of <b>prescribing</b> data (PACT) for one year before and one year after practices become first, second, or third wave fundholders and comparison with practices that were not fundholders during {{any part of the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] <b>Prescribing</b> costs (net ingredient cost per <b>prescribing</b> unit), <b>prescribing</b> volume (items per 1000 <b>prescribing</b> units), net ingredient cost per item, and percentage of generic <b>prescribing.</b> SETTING [...] Former Mersey Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS [...] 100 fundholders (20 first wave, 31 second wave, 49 third wave) and 312 nonfundholders. RESULTS [...] <b>Prescribing</b> costs and volume rose throughout the study in all groups. In all three fundholding waves the rate of increase of <b>prescribing</b> costs was significantly lower than for nonfundholders. Both cost per item and <b>prescribing</b> volume tended to decrease, the former probably because of a significant increase in generic <b>prescribing.</b> Fundholding and non-fundholding practices differed in several respects. CONCLUSION [...] Fundholding has altered practice <b>prescribing</b> patterns compared with those of nonfundholders, increasing generic <b>prescribing</b> and reducing the rate of increase of <b>prescribing</b> costs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{drug use}} in 2 Dutch nursing homes (254 residents) by developing and evaluating <b>prescribing</b> indicators based on pharmacy prescription data. METHODS: We evaluated the <b>prescribing</b> of benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ulcer-healing drugs, and diuretics. <b>Prescribing</b> indicators were used to identify <b>prescribing</b> that was potentially not in line with recommendations in national and regional <b>prescribing</b> guidelines. We used both descriptive indicators, such as the number and percentage of users, and indicators reflecting potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing,</b> such as use of drugs outside the regional drug formulary, use of > 1 drug from the same drug class, and prescription of drug dosages above recommended values. When potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing</b> was found, we verified the findings {{by means of an}} interview with 1 of the prescribers. RESULTS: The <b>prescribing</b> indicators we assessed were generally in agreement with national and regional guidelines. However, <b>prescribing</b> of NSAIDs without concomitant <b>prescribing</b> of gastroprotective drugs was found in a relatively high number of patients. After prescriber interview and patient chart review, it was found that some <b>prescribing</b> indicators, such as dosages above recommended values, were not always indicative for suboptimal <b>prescribing.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that <b>prescribing</b> indicators based solely on pharmacy prescription data can be a useful tool to evaluate drug <b>prescribing.</b> With some of these <b>prescribing</b> indicators, we identified cases of potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing.</b> However, with other indicators such as those based on drug dosages, we could not identify suboptimal <b>prescribing,</b> and clinical information from the prescriber was necessary to get insight into the appropriateness of prescribin...|$|R

5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to <b>prescribe</b> {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to <b>prescribe</b> them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
40|$|Background  <b>Prescribing</b> is a core {{activity}} for general practitioners, yet significant {{variation in the}} quality of <b>prescribing</b> has been reported. This suggests there may be room for improvement in the application of the current best research evidence. There has been substantial investment in technologies and interventions to address this issue, but effect sizes so far have been small to moderate. This suggests that <b>prescribing</b> is a decision-making process that is not sufficiently understood. By understanding more about <b>prescribing</b> processes and the implementation of research evidence, variation may more easily be understood and more effective interventions proposed.   Methods  An ethnographic study in three Scottish general practices with diverse organizational characteristics. Practices were ranked by their performance against Audit Scotland <b>prescribing</b> quality indicators, incorporating established best research evidence. Two practices of high <b>prescribing</b> quality and one practice of low <b>prescribing</b> quality were recruited. Participant observation, formal and informal interviews, and a review of practice documentation were employed.   Results  Practices ranked as high <b>prescribing</b> quality consistently made and applied macro and micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions, whereas the low-ranking practice only made micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions. Macro <b>prescribing</b> decisions were collective, policy decisions made considering research evidence in light of the average patient, one disease, condition, or drug. Micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions were made in consultation with the patient considering their views, preferences, circumstances and other conditions (if necessary).   Although micro <b>prescribing</b> can operate independently, the implementation of evidence-based, quality <b>prescribing</b> was attributable to an interdependent relationship. Macro <b>prescribing</b> policy enabled <b>prescribing</b> decisions to be based on scientific evidence and applied consistently where possible. Ultimately, this influenced <b>prescribing</b> decisions that occur at the micro level in consultation with patients.   Conclusion  General practitioners in the higher <b>prescribing</b> quality practices made two different ‘types’ of <b>prescribing</b> decision; macro and micro. Macro <b>prescribing</b> informs micro <b>prescribing</b> and without a macro basis to draw upon the low-ranked practice had no effective mechanism to engage with, reflect on and implement relevant evidence.

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject: Electronic <b>prescribing</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce <b>prescribing</b> errors in US hospitals. However we know little about its effect on <b>prescribing</b> quality, or its {{effectiveness}} in UK hospitals where systems for medication <b>prescribing</b> and supply are very different. Hospital pharmacists already review prescriptions to both detect errors and improve prescription quality. What this study adds: Electronic <b>prescribing</b> significantly increased <b>prescribing</b> quality in a UK hospital, as shown by fewer pharmacists' interventions and fewer <b>prescribing</b> errors. However, some new types of error were introduced. There was relatively little overlap between <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' interventions, signifying their different contributions to <b>prescribing</b> quality. Electronic <b>prescribing</b> and pharmacists' interventions should be viewed as an integrated system. AIMS: To investigate the effects of electronic <b>prescribing</b> (EP) on <b>prescribing</b> quality, as indicated by <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' clinical interventions, in a UK hospital. METHODS: <b>Prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' interventions were recorded by the ward pharmacist during a 4 week period both pre- and post-EP, with a second check by the principal investigator. The percentage of new medication orders with a <b>prescribing</b> error and/or pharmacist's intervention was calculated for each study period. RESULTS: Following the introduction of EP, there was a significant reduction in both pharmacists' interventions and <b>prescribing</b> errors. Interventions reduced from 73 (3. 0 % of all medication orders) to 45 (1. 9 %) (95 % confidence interval (CI) for the absolute reduction 0. 2, 2. 0 %), and errors from 94 (3. 8 %) to 48 (2. 0 %) (95 % CI 0. 9, 2. 7 %). Ten EP-specific <b>prescribing</b> errors were identified. Only 52 % of pharmacists' interventions related to a <b>prescribing</b> error pre-EP, and 60 % post-EP; only 40 % and 56 % of <b>prescribing</b> errors resulted in an intervention pre- and post-EP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EP improved the quality of <b>prescribing</b> by reducing both <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' clinical interventions. Prescribers and pharmacists {{need to be aware of}} new types of error with EP, so that they can best target their activities to reduce clinical risk.

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to <b>prescribe</b> an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat.

The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

40|$|There are {{indications}} that {{the increasing number of}} nurse prescribers has had a positive impact on patient access to medicines and that patients are satisfied with nurse <b>prescribing.</b> However, in order to impact on clinical outcomes, nurses’ <b>prescribing</b> consultations need to be not only safe, but also demonstrate a range of quality indicators derived from the evidence on effective <b>prescribing.</b> A number of frameworks that outline the competencies to guide safe and effective <b>prescribing</b> have been developed, which nurses and those responsible for the governance of <b>prescribing</b> in practice could use to assess and monitor the safety and quality of nurse <b>prescribing.</b> Research into nurse <b>prescribing</b> suggests that nurses use a range of competencies and skills in their <b>prescribing</b> consultations that are necessary to underpin quality and safe <b>prescribing</b> of medicines.

40|$|Background: Antidepressant <b>prescribing</b> has {{dramatically}} increased in Scotland, {{and the cause}} is unknown. Objective: To investigate if the increase in antidepressant <b>prescribing</b> coincided with a reduction in <b>prescribing</b> of anxiolytics and hypnotics; to investigate this relationship at practice level; and to explore whether general practitioners (GPs) explain the increase by their increased use for anxiety. Methods: Study design: analysis of routine <b>prescribing</b> data and interviews with GPs. Setting: Scottish general practices. Participants: 942 practices included in the analysis. Sixty-three GPs in 30 practices completed interviews. Main outcome measures: Quantity of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics <b>prescribed.</b> Relationship at practice level between anxiolytic/hypnotic and antidepressant <b>prescribing.</b> Spontaneous comments by GPs about <b>prescribing</b> antidepressants for anxiety. Results: Antidepressant <b>prescribing</b> increased from 28. 9 million defined daily doses (DDDs) in 1992 / 3 to 128. 3 million in 2004 / 5.

Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to <b>prescribe</b> contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to <b>prescribe</b> contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses).

To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women.

Our {{objective was to}} measure the utility of current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance when used to inform practical <b>prescribing</b> decisions, and to compare current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance in the UK with idealized <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Methods: We developed 25 clinical scenarios. Two independent assessors rated and ranked the performance of five common sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance in the UK when used to answer the clinical scenarios. A third adjudicator facilitated review of any disparities. An idealized list of contents for <b>prescribing</b> guidance was developed and sent for comments to academics and users of <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Following consultation an operational check {{was used to assess}} compliance with the idealized criteria. The main outcome measures were relative utility in answering the clinical scenarios and compliance with the idealized <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Results: Current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance used in the UK differ in their utility, when measured using clinical scenarios. The British National Formulary (BNF) and EMIS LV were the best performing sources in terms of both ranking [mean rank 1 · 24 and 2 · 20] and rating [%excellent or adequate 100 % and 72 %]. Current sources differed in {{the extent to which they}} fulfilled criteria for ideal <b>prescribing</b> guidance, but the BNF, and EMIS LV to a lesser extent, closely matched the criteria. Discussion: We have demonstrated how clinical scenarios can be used to assess <b>prescribing</b> guidance resources.
