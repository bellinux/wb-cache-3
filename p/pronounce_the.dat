5|$|The Welsh {{also created}} a dish called Llymru, finely ground oatmeal soaked in water {{for a long time}} before boiling until it solidified. This blancmange styled dish became so popular outside Wales that it got a new name, flummery, as the English couldn't <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> original. A similar dish, sucan, was made with less finely ground oatmeal, making a coarser product.|$|E
5|$|The {{general law}} {{of this land}} is in favour of the wager of battle, {{and it is our}} duty to <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> law as it is, and not as we may wish it to be.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{having taken}} Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in Westminster Abbey in January 1533. This was made easier {{by the death}} of Archbishop Warham, a strong {{opponent}} of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, {{going so far as to}} <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> judgment that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533). Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.|$|E

25|$|On 3 October 1835, Schumann met Felix Mendelssohn at Wieck's {{house in}} Leipzig, and his {{enthusiastic}} appreciation of that artist was shown {{with the same}} generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and which later prompted him to publicly <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> then-unknown Johannes Brahms a genius.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, Supreme Court {{restrained}} {{the trial}} courts from pronouncing judgement in nine sensitive riot cases, including Godhra train incident.

25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases in Wales, the Welsh and English names for a place are identical, almost always because the Welsh name is used. So, for example, Aberystwyth, Blaenau Ffestiniog, Bangor, Machynlleth and Llandudno all have the same spelling in Welsh and English, although it is also often the case that many English people do not <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> name {{in the same way as}} the Welsh.|$|E
25|$|Most romanizations are {{intended}} to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully {{as possible in the}} target language. The popular Hepburn romanization of Japanese {{is an example of a}} transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.|$|E
25|$|Syllable {{deletion}} – stressed syllables are emphasis {{that may}} be given to certain syllables in a word. They {{are more likely to}} be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process. So children may say helikat instead of helicopter or fowe instead of telephone. That way, they don't <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> more emphasized sound in the word.|$|E

25|$|In Japanese language, Chinese names can be {{pronounced}} {{according to}} Chinese-approximation or Local reading (現地読み) {{of the characters}} or Japanese-way or On'yomi reading (音読み) to <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> Chinese characters, in exception in places with more Western influences like Hong Kong when their names are borrowed in Katakana despite many people names borrowed in Kanji. For example, 毛泽东 (Mao Zedong) was spelled as Mōtakutō in Japanese-way pronunciation, or Beijing (北京) was pronounced as Pekin in Chinese-approximated pronunciations but not Hokkyō or Hoku-Kyō in Japanese-way. This is because both China and Japan have historical relations, sharing the culture and adopt Hanzi and Kanji respectively.|$|E
25|$|Although {{developed}} from the Biblical ban, excommunication, as employed by the Rabbis during Talmudic times and during the Middle Ages, it became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by Rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it {{became one of the}} modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonably}} {{complete list}} of uncontroversial so-called minimal pairs can be seen below. The two words in each pair are distinguished solely by having different tone (acute vs. grave). In those cases where both words are nouns {{it would have been}} possible to list the genitive forms of the words as well, thereby creating another word pair, but this has been avoided. A few word pairs where one of the words is a plural form with the suffix -or have been included. This {{is due to the fact}} that a vast majority of Swedish-speakers in all parts of Sweden <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> suffix -or the same way as -er.|$|E

25|$|Boas applied these {{principles}} to his studies of Inuit languages. Researchers have reported {{a variety of}} spellings for a given word. In the past, researchers have interpreted this data {{in a number of}} ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different dialects. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.|$|E
25|$|All unaccented {{letters are}} {{pronounced}} approximately {{as in the}} IPA, {{with the exception of}} c. Esperanto j and c are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: j has a y sound , as in yellow and boy, and c has a ts sound , as in hits or the zz in pizza. The accented letters are a bit like h-digraphs in English: Ĉ is pronounced like English ch, and ŝ like sh. Ĝ is the g in gem, ĵ a zh sound, as in fusion or French Jacques, and the rare ĥ is like the German , Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Scottish Standard English loch, or how Scouse people sometimes <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> 'k' in book and 'ck' in chicken.|$|E
25|$|A custom {{to use a}} {{domestic}} animal as a polaznik was kept in some regions until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. A sheep, ox, swine, or calf was led into the house on Christmas morning. In the west Serbian region of Rađevina, centered on the town of Krupanj, the head of household would place a sheep between himself and the fireplace, and <b>pronounce</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned words while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it. In the region of Bihor, north-eastern Montenegro, a round loaf of bread with a hole in its center was prepared; four grooves were impressed into its surface along two mutually perpendicular diameters of the loaf. After an ox was led into the house, the loaf was put on his horn, and some grain was thrown on the ox. Yanking his head, the ox would throw off the loaf; having fallen down, the loaf would break into four pieces along the grooves. The pieces were picked up and distributed among the family members. This custom was preserved up to the 1950s even in some Muslim families of the region. Ethnologists consider that the animal polažajnik is more ancient than the human one.|$|E
