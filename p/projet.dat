The production {{received the}} award for best new play and {{the award for}} the best playwright at the Moliere Awards of that year. He went on to direct Philippe Auger’s Mélédouman and Le <b>Projet</b> Conrad, an adaptation {{of the short story}} Un Avant-poste du progrès. Adrien's interest in African works continued with Boesman et Lena, by the South-African playwright Athol Fugard in 2014 and a stage production of Amos Tutuola’s novel L’Ivrogne dans la brousse.|$|E
25|$|The Ancient Images Laboratory is {{equipped}} with a Nikon Metrology microtomography (microCT) scanner, a Faxitron digital x-ray, a 3D Systems <b>Projet</b> 660 Pro3D printer, and artifact photography stations. The microCT and digital x-ray are used to conduct non-invasive studies of a range of archaeological and bioarchaeological materials, to facilitate the study of internal structures and features. Sustainable Archaeology's 3D scanning equipment consists of five 3D scanners: a Konica Minolta Vivid 9i, and four structured-light 3D scanners from 3D3 Solutions. Imaging data and 3D scans produced at Sustainable Archaeology are integrated into the database and research platform, and are used to re-construct virtual archaeological environments.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 1917, Sykes (who {{had been}} sent to France in mid-December to see what was {{happening}} with the <b>Projet</b> d'Arrangement) and a representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the Central Syrian Congress in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.|$|E

25|$|Pacifist ideals {{emerged from}} two strands {{of thought that}} {{coalesced}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular Enlightenment, promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the evangelical religious revival that had played an important part in the campaign for the abolition of slavery. Representatives of the former included Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in Extrait du <b>Projet</b> de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre (1756), Immanuel Kant, in his Thoughts on Perpetual Peace, and Jeremy Bentham who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was William Wilberforce who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the French Revolutionary War based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Bohemian Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848) taught about the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social, and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations.|$|E

On 30 January, Shipbuilding Engineer Andressen began working on the <b>projet,</b> which at that time included a pair of [...] guns in an armored casemate. Pöck {{pointed out that the}} ship should not include heavy guns, and that two [...] guns without armor would be sufficient; the only armor the ship was to have was a curved protective deck. Andressen prepared three more designs, as seen in the table below.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{his friends}} {{provided}} music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw where it rests at the Church of the Holy Cross. He also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, <b>Projet</b> de méthode, to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. [...] "No longer", he replied. He died {{a few minutes before}} two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.|$|E

500|$|In 1841, Léon Escudier {{wrote of}} a recital given by Chopin that year, [...] "One {{may say that}} Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the {{sweetness}} with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace." [...] Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed {{that there was no}} set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his <b>Projet</b> de méthode he wrote: [...] "Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm." [...] He further stated: [...] "One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [...] unlimited dexterity." [...] The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.|$|E
