The finding revealed that, in average, working-age population aged 50 – 59 years old in Thailand had moderate economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement. Moreover, the findings also revealed that age, income, income sufficiency, year of schooling and health condition had the positive influences on {{the opportunity to have}} above average economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement. Males had the higher opportunity to have above average economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement than females while married people had the higher opportunity than people with the other marital statuses. Private enterprise employees were found having the lower opportunity to have above average economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement than all other occupations and those who admitted that the economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement was necessary had the higher opportunity to have above average preparation than those who did not. In addition, those who lived as a head of household or a spouse of a head of household had the highest opportunity to have above average economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement. However, living with children under 18 years old lowered the opportunity to have above average economic <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> retirement while indebtedness raised the opportunity to have it...|$|R

It was hypothesized that children without siblings would be better prepared for, and report more satisfaction with, <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> caregiving than individuals with siblings. Female children without siblings were expected to report being more prepared for caregiving than all other participants; familism, affection, and personal willingness to provide care were expected to mediate these relationships. A random mail survey and a non-random snowball survey yielded a total of 128 individuals between the ages of 18 and 40; 60 % of the participants reported having siblings, whereas 40 percent reported not having siblings. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed no significant relationships between sibling status and <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> and satisfaction with <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> caregiving.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of the <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living skills training program by measuring the learning gains and learning outcomes of students participating in the training. The quasi-experimental posttest control group design was used. A treatment sample of twelve students received the <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living training. A nontreatment sample was selected by matching the characteristics of educational and reading level and the gender of twelve students with no previous independent living skills training with those of the treatment sample. Students in the treatment sample were tested for learning gains using the <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living Test. Both the treatment and nontreatment sample were tested using the post-training <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living Scale to determine the level of their learning outcomes. The <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living Test results were analyzed using the t-test for correlated samples of pretests and posttests. The t-test for independent samples was used to analyze the <b>Preparation</b> <b>for</b> Adult Living Scale results to determine the students' learning outcomes.

The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark.

Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack.
