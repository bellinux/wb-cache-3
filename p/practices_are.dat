5|$|The tantra <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> secretive, {{subject to}} speculations and criticism. Scholars {{variously}} attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias {{on the part}} of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are some of the reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found}} to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study <b>was</b> to examine <b>practice</b> {{scheduling}} and composition in judo based upon motor learning theory. Practice scheduling and composition of Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusokurenshu were analyzed from the case of the practice of A University judo team. A University judo team has a competitive level of participating in the national collegiate judo tournament. The viewpoints of analysis by motor learning theory were massed and distributed practice, random and blocked practice, whole and part practice, and variable and constant practice. Results demonstrated as follows. Massed and distributed practice, and Random and blocked <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> scheduled in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by fractionation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu by simplification, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakarirenshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by segmentation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Variable and constant <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Specific training methods were proposed for each practice...|$|R

5|$|Populations have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to agricultural <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> thought {{to be responsible for}} reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Strength-stones {{are used}} in modern times for {{strength}} training, particularly in the martial arts where such <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> known as hojo undō. Special stones are manufactured for this purpose, usually with a wooden handle to aid their manipulation; such stones are also known as chi ishi. It is a common practice in karate, used in solo training to improve stances and upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Yoga, as a {{technique}} for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and {{the attainment of}} other supernatural accomplishments; these are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, {{as well as the}} Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta; James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.|$|E

40|$|Two major {{features}} of the overcorrection procedure, restitution and positive <b>practice,</b> <b>were</b> analyzed for their educative and suppressive properties {{in the treatment of}} profoundly retarded adults. Positive <b>practice</b> techniques that <b>were</b> topographically similar and dissimilar to the target behavior were studied. Eating behavior and puzzle performance were observed. Restitutional overcorrection and both forms of positive <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> effective for suppressing inappropriate behaviors. Even when appropriate behaviors had been acquired by positive practice, restitution and dissimilar positive <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> generally ineffective for increasing their rate of occurrence. However, topographically similar positive <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> successful as a means of teaching new appropriate behaviors...|$|R

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5|$|Temples and cults in Egypt itself {{declined}} as the Roman economy deteriorated in {{the third}} century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at Philae, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. But many of the practices involved in their worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted {{as part of the}} Coptic Church. Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time, scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and Muslim, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} founded by Aldo Benzi, who {{converted}} to Christianity after being healed from a pleurisy. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became pastor of the churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.|$|E

5|$|The major {{religious}} activities (or pujas) performed every morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|Betjeman {{explores the}} ruins of St Benet's Abbey before seeing its modern {{equivalent}} at a convent of Anglican nuns at the Community of All Hallows, Ditchingham. Betjeman then takes the North Norfolk Railway to Walsingham to see the Anglican pilgrims going to the church of Our Lady of Walsingham. After {{a look at the}} Queen's church in Sandringham and the unusual Victorian church at Booton, choir <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> seen in progress at Martham and Wymondham Abbey. Exulting the work of Sir Ninian Comper at Lound, Suffolk, Betjeman recalls that he looked like Colonel Sanders. As Easter Day approaches, Betjeman reflects on the furthest reaches of the diocese - water-borne ministries, a parish church in Flordon that no one attends, as well as the fate of those churches declared redundant; conversion into hospitals, an artists' studio, a shoe store and dereliction. Easter Day breaks in Lowestoft, and the viewer sees traditionally dressed ladies from the Almshouses in Castle Rising. The film concludes back in Norwich as parishioners of St Peter Mancroft, and parishioners from churches all around the county summoned by bells, walk to worship.|$|E
