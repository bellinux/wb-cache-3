50|$|The oil {{contained}} in the andiroba almond, known as crab oil or carap oil, is light yellow and extremely bitter. When subjected to a temperature below 25 °C, it solidifies, with a consistency like that of petroleum jelly. It contains olein, <b>palmitin</b> and glycerin.|$|E
5000|$|Japan wax is a {{byproduct}} of lacquer manufacture. It is not a true wax but a fat that contains 95% <b>palmitin.</b> [...] Japan wax is sold in flat squares or disks and has a rancid odor. It is extracted by expression and heat, or {{by the action of}} solvents.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} triglycerides {{are those}} where the three fatty acids are identical. Their names indicate the fatty acid: stearin derived from stearic acid, <b>palmitin</b> derived from palmitic acid, etc. These compounds {{can be obtained}} as three forms or polymorphs: α, β, and β′. These forms differ {{in terms of their}} melting points.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} used in Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking, {{and in the case}} of roasted oil, for added flavor. Peanut oil has a high smoke point {{relative}} to many other cooking oils, so is commonly used for frying foods. Its major component fatty acids are oleic acid (46.8% as olein), linoleic acid (33.4% as linolein), and palmitic acid (10.0% as <b>palmitin).</b> The oil also contains some stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and other fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|In East Asia, in {{particular}} in Japan, traditional candle fuel (also called Japan wax) was produced, among other sumac plants, from Rhus succedanea crushed fruits rather than beeswax or animal fats. Japan wax is a byproduct of lacquer manufacture. It is not a true wax but a fat that contains 10-15% <b>palmitin,</b> stearin, and olein with about 1% japanic acid (1,21-heneicosanedioic acid). Japan wax is sold in flat squares or disks and has a rancid odor. It is extracted by expression and heat, or {{by the action of}} solvents. The fatty-acid methyl ester of the kernel oil meets all of the major biodiesel requirements in the USA (ASTM D 6751-02, ASTM PS 121-99), Germany (DIN V 51606) and European Union (EN 14214).|$|E
50|$|In East Asia, in {{particular}} in Japan, traditional candle fuel was produced from Toxicodendron vernicifluum (synonym: Rhus verniciflua) and Toxicodendron succedaneum (synonym: Rhus succedanea), among other sumac plants in the genus Toxicodendron, rather than beeswax or animal fats. The sumac wax was a byproduct of traditional Japanese lacquer manufacture. The conical rousoku candles produced from sumac wax burn with smokeless flame and were favored in many respects over candles made from lard or beeswax during the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan wax is not a true wax but a solid fat that contains 10-15% <b>palmitin,</b> stearin, and olein with about 1% japanic acid (1,21-heneicosanedioic acid). It is still used in many tropical and subtropical countries {{in the production of}} wax match sticks.|$|E
30|$|Sesame oil {{is derived}} from the plant species Sesamum indicum L., an {{herbaceous}} annual belonging to the Pedaliaceae family (Kubes & Grabger 1996). Constituents of sesame oil include olein, stearin, <b>palmitin,</b> myristin, linolein, sesamin, and sesamolin (Simon et al. 1984). In traditional Taiwanese medicine, sesame oil was used to relief the pain in people with joint pain, toothache, premenstrual syndrome, scrapes, and cuts. Recently, sesame oil has been proved to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties (Hsu & Liu 2002; Hsu & Liu 2004).|$|E
40|$|The ether-lipid {{precursor}} sn- 1 -O-hexadecylglycerol (HG) {{can be used}} {{to compensate}} for early metabolic defects in ether-lipid biosynthesis. To investigate a possible metabolic link between ether-linked phospholipids {{and the rest of the}} cellular lipidome, we incubated HEp- 2 cells with HG. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed major changes in the lipidome of HG-treated cells compared to that of untreated cells or cells treated with <b>palmitin,</b> a control substance for HG containing an acyl group instead of the ether group. We present quantitative data for a total of 154 species from 17 lipid classes. These species are those constituting more than 2 % of their lipid class for most lipid classes, but more than 1 % for the ether lipids and glycosphingolipids. In addition to the expected ability of HG to increase the levels of ether-linked glycerophospholipids with 16 carbon atoms in the sn- 1 position, this precursor also decreased the amounts of glycosphingolipids and increased the amounts of ceramide, phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol. However, incubation with <b>palmitin,</b> the fatty acyl analogue of HG, also increased the amounts of ceramide and phosphatidylinositols. Thus, changes in these lipid classes were not ether lipid-dependent. No major effects were observed for the other lipid classes, and cellular functions such as growth and endocytosis were unaffected. The data presented clearly demonstrate the importance of performing detailed quantitative lipidomic studies to reveal how the metabolism of ether-linked glycerophospholipids is coupled to that o...|$|E
40|$|Chlorination, {{oxidation}} with {{nitric acid}} and ozonization of fatty acids adsorbed on different materials (Al_ 2 O_ 3, SiO_ 2, BaSO_ 4) were studied {{with respect to}} regioselective chemical CH oxidation and compared with the Fe (II) -catalized fatty acid oxidation by amine N-oxides {{in the presence of}} trifluoroacetic acid. Hydroxylation with amine N-oxides yields the highest product selectivity and regionalselectivity with respect to terminal hydroxyfatty acids. Dry ozonolysis of fatty acids adsorbed on silica gel yields 80 - 90 % oxofatty acids. By fermentation of oleic acid with candida tropicalis 50 % cis- 9 -octadecene- 1, 18 -diacid is obtained. Microbial <b>palmitin</b> acid oxidation could be improved by batch fermentation to yield 35 - 47 % hexadecane-diacid.

40|$|The {{triglyceride}} composition of avocado oil {{was determined by}} high-performance liquid chromatography using a light-scattering detector. Two avocado varieties, Fuerte and Hass, were analysed, and the qualitative composition of each {{was found to be}} similar, though quantitative differences were detected. The {{triglyceride composition}} was predicted using a system of equations base on the relationship between log k′ and the molecular variables equivalent carbon number, chain length and number of double bonds for each of the fatty acids in the glycerides. A total of 24 molecular species of triglycerides were identified. The chromatographic system used successfully separated the critical pairs OOOLOS, PaPaOLnPP and PaOOLOP (O = olein; L = linolein; S = stearin; Pa = palmitolein; Ln = linolenin; P = <b>Palmitin).</b> Detector response was found to have a linear relationship with the amount of sample injected over the injection range 10 - 70 μg. © 1992.

40|$|Copper soap {{formation}} as a {{test for}} the hydrolysis of fat (Carnot and Mauban, 1918) {{may be used for}} the detection of microbial lipase. METHOD To standard nutrient agar in the tube add 0. 5 cc. per tube of melted butter of good quality and sterilize in the usual manner. The melted fat agar is cooled to 45 °C., the fat well mixed in and the medium poured at once into a cold petri dish. On solidifica-tion the medium is inoculated by the streak method with the organism under test, and incubated at suitable temperature for forty-eight hours. The plate is then flooded with a saturated aqueous solution of CuS 04 for ten minutes and rinsed gently with water. When the fat has been attacked conspicuous bluish-green streaks of insoluble copper soap appear on the plate. The in-tensity of the color is a rough gauge of lipolytic activity.

40|$|Pellets from biomass {{represent}} an appropriate form of biofuel for combustion. They {{are characterized by}} good fuel parameters, they enable efficient storage, transport and handling, and automatic fuel supply to the combustion chamber. Pellet production is quite a complicated and energy-consuming process. During the production {{it is necessary to}} ensure that the amount of input energy was the same or even smaller than the energy obtained. To streamline the production and improve thermo-mechanical properties some binders and additives can be used. It is possible to increase the strength, density, calorific value and resistance to abrasion by using such binders and additives, in addition, you may achieve changes in characteristics and quantity of ash, decrease of the cost of pellets production, the use of materials which are separately difficult to burn and not easy to process by pelleting and affecting emission parameters during combustion. The most important binders and additives with a positive effect on pellets include: lignin, starch, molasses, glycerol, paraffin and <b>palmitin,</b> carboxymethyl cellulose, limestone, rye and corn flour, lignosulfonate and waste potatoes...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate coprolites {{derived from}} Upper Triassic {{terrestrial}} deposits of southern Poland {{have been subjected}} to various analytical methods in order to retrieve information about their composition, producer’s diet and nature of the microscopic structures preserved in the groundmass. Morphologically, the coprolites have been classified into four morphotypes, of which only three were further analysed due to their good state of preservation. Their groundmass are composed of francolite, a carbonate-rich apatite, in which abundant coccoid structures are preserved. Based on various microscopic and organic geochemical techniques, they are interpreted as fossilized bacteria which could have mediated the phosphatization of the faeces. The thin sectioning revealed that the coprolites consist of those containing exclusively bone remains, and those preserving both bone and plant remains. Those coprolites preserving only vertebrate remains are suggestive for exclusive carnivorous diet of the producers. However, the interpretation of coprolites consisting of both vertebrate and plant remains is more debatable. Although they may attest to omnivory, it cannot be excluded that potential producers were carnivorous and occasionally ingested plants, or accidentally swallowed plant material during feeding. The latter may involve predation or scavenging upon other herbivorous animals. The potential producers may have been animals that foraged in or near aquatic habitats, such as semi-aquatic archosaurs and/or temnospondyls. This is supported by the presence of ostracode and other aquatic arthropod remains, and fish scales within the coprolites, {{as well as by the}} presence of specific biomarkers such as phytanic and pristanic acids, which are characteristic constituents of fish oil. The preservation of such labile organic compounds as sterols, <b>palmitin,</b> stearin or levoglucosan attests for rapid, microbially-mediated mineralization of the faeces at very early stages of diagenesis...|$|E
