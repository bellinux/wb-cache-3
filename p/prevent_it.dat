5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E
5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. But as a vast crowd of spectators began pouring into Hanslope the venue was switched {{at the last minute}} to Salcey Green, just inside Northamptonshire, thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless to <b>prevent</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

It was actually the Grim Reaper who killed Rees-Jones, despite Frank's attempts to <b>prevent</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Governor Evan Bayh {{called a}} special session of the General Assembly in 1992 because no budget had been passed in the regular session. During the special session, the General Assembly passed the budget and also legalized the {{operation}} of riverboat casinos in the state, overriding the governor's veto to <b>prevent</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E

People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, {{as well as}} insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait {{can be a problem}} to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to <b>prevent</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 1513, James IV of Scotland invaded England {{with a large}} army; {{equipped}} with modern artillery, he took the border castles of Norham and Wark, and then moved south against Etal Castle.

The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E
