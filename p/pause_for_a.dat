5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} {{through the}} use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian {{strategy}} of invading Italy was a blunder. The losses incurred in the invasion and retreat seriously weakened Archduke John's army. Instead of having ample forces {{to defend the}} mountain barrier east of the Italian plains, John was left with an insufficient number of soldiers. The capture of Tarvis and its outlying forts gave Eugène an open road to Villach, which he occupied on 20 May. His troops seized Klagenfurt the following day. In both cities, the Franco-Italians found supplies that would be of future use. Eugène was forced to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days in order to let his artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains catch up with his infantry. John withdrew to Graz, where he arrived on 24 May, followed by Gyulai's bedraggled division. Eugène's patrols soon detected Jellacic's division marching across his front and sent Grenier's corps to intercept. The next action was the Battle of Sankt Michael on 25 May. Monuments to Engineer officers Hensel and Hermann and the fallen Austrian soldiers are located at both the Malborghetto and Predil forts. The one at Predil was constructed in 1849.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed {{two songs}} that Goeslaw {{performed}} while with Potret in {{its list of}} the 150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time, {{both of which were}} from the album Potret II. [...] "Salah" [...] ("Wrong") was ranked 74th, being noted as the best example of Goeslaw's [...] "fresh, direct, and often provocative nuances" [...] when writing songs and writing that her [...] "sweet" [...] vocals challenged the paradigm that a singer singing about an affair should be either a victim or full of revenge. The other song, [...] "Bunda" [...] ("Mother") was ranked at 110; it was noted being capable of making anyone, [...] "even the most cruel man", <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment to think of their mother. Rolling Stone Indonesia noted a decrease in the quality of Goeslaw's songs since Ada Apa Dengan Cinta?.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Williams and Wisefield {{joined with}} singer Mick Stubbs, keyboardist Clive John and drummer Mick Cook {{to form the}} {{progressive}} rock group Home. The band signed a recording deal with Epic Records and issued their debut LP, <b>Pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Hoarse Horse, in 1971. Home was a supporting act for Jeff Beck, Mott the Hoople, The Faces and Led Zeppelin. In 1972, Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released a self-titled album, featuring their only hit single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.41 in the UK album charts. Their next album, The Alchemist, followed in 1973, but did not gain chart success. When British folk singer-songwriter Al Stewart suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974, Mick Stubbs left the group. The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band, but split up after the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{garden warbler}} breeds {{in most of}} Europe between the [...] isotherms and east across {{temperate}} Asia to the Yenisei River in Siberia. Its range extends further north than any other Sylvia warbler. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa {{as far south as}} South Africa. Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest, reorientating to the south or southeast once in Africa, although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the Alps and across the Mediterranean Sea. S. b. woodwardi reaches Africa by a more easterly route, many birds passing through the Arabian Peninsula. When garden warblers cross the Sahara, they fly at night, resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day. During their journey, they can metabolise not only body fat but also up to 19% of their breast and leg muscles and 39% of their digestive tract. Many birds <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Referring to the song's segment in {{the concert}} film, Justin Gerber of Consequence of Sound praises Preston's {{showmanship}} {{and suggests that}} this [...] "powerful" [...] live version [...] "could cause <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> non-believer" [...] as the singer undertakes [...] "a full-on dance {{of someone who has}} seen the light". Similarly impressed, Nigel Williamson of Uncut writes of Preston [...] "giving the performance of his life" [...] on the song. In his book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon opines that the triple live album [...] "is worth the retail price just for that track", which he describes as [...] "pure bolts of energy, live on stage".|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese {{animation}} {{industry was}} practically put on <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade until 1976 when the cultural revolution was over.

Animations such as Little Trumpeter in 1973, a story about a young boy named [...] "Xiaoyong" [...] who became a heroic red guard soldier. Other animations from the same year include Little 8th Route Army, a story about a boy taking on revenge against the Imperial Japanese Army.

2500|$|A [...] "unicorn chaser" [...] is {{a concept}} created by Boing Boing editors as an {{antidote}} to blog postings linking to sites containing disgusting or shocking images.

Xeni Jardin posted the first one (titled [...] "And now, we <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Unicorn Moment.") in August 2003 as a reply to a picture of a rash posted by editor Mark Frauenfelder in an attempt to get readers to diagnose it for him.

2500|$|Singing without drums is {{extremely}} rare and considered inappropriate (Nettl, 1989). The drum accompaniment to songs is rhythmically independent to the singing but in perfect unison, [...] "slightly off the beat", and [...] "often related roughly by {{the proportion of}} 2:3", to the vocal pulse or beat level (though see Pantaleoni, 1987). Another change in Blackfoot music is increased relatedness of the drum part to the song now than in the past. Often drumming over repeated sections that comprise a song begins with players softly striking {{the rim of the}} bass drum. The tempo increases as the drumming moves further {{to the center of the}} drum skin. At some point [...] "hard beats", loud strokes off the rhythm by an individual, sometimes the leader, and beats may be omitted. Drumming may <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> phrase or two in the last stanza of the last repetition and finish loudly. When playing the stick game, players drum upon a plank, and the drumming is more likely to coincide with vocal beats, but less accurate unison playing. Rattles are no longer used.
