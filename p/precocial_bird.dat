Nevertheless, the extensive use of <b>precocial</b> <b>bird</b> models for investigating behavioral development issues requires in depth knowledge concerning the emergence of sex differences. Here, we evaluated behavioral differences between Japanese quail chicks {{in relation to their}} sex. We know that maternal influences are strong and early social environment shapes behavioral development in this species. Therefore, we investigated the emergence of sex differences in two very different early social situations to evaluate the impact of <b>precocial</b> <b>bird</b> mothers on sex differences. We assessed behavioral differences related to sex of (1) non-brooded chicks and of (2) brooded chicks, using various ethological tests to evaluate emotional reactivity and social motivation differences related to sex. Our results show that both non-brooded and brooded chicks present behavioral differences related to sex. They differed greatly according to chicks' early experience. Sex-related differences between maternally deprived (non-brooded) chicks concerned mainly fearfulness, whereas differences between male and female brooded chicks concerned mainly their reactions to social isolation. We hypothesize that mothers attenuate sex differences related to fearfulness by being a model for responses to fear-eliciting situations and by providing a similar secure basis to both males and females. We finally propose that mothers induce differences in chicks' sociality by providing asymmetrical care toward males and females...|$|E

40|$|The {{metabolic}} rate of <b>precocial</b> <b>bird</b> eggs reaches a plateau when about 80 % of the incubation period has passed. This is unexpected, {{as in many}} species the embryo continues to grow and maintenance costs must therefore increase. To investigate this paradox, daily energy budgets were constructed for embryos of four galliform species according to two models that used empirical data on egg {{metabolic rate}} and embryo growth. In the first model, embryonic synthesis costs were estimated, with an assumed synthesis efficiency, before calculating the maintenance costs. In the second model, embryonic maintenance was calculated first, and no assumptions were made on the synthesis efficiency. The calculations show that assumptions of the synthesis efficiency had {{a major impact on}} the energy budget calculations, because embryonic growth rate was high. During the plateau phase, a galliform embryo allocated energy in favor of its maintenance costs in three ways: by decreasing growth rate, by increasing synthesis efficiency, and by depressing the formation of glycogen. Our study suggests that a reduction in growth rate plays a minor role. An increase of synthesis efficiency is more likely to explain the plateau in energy expenditure, since small increases in synthesis efficiency can lead to great savings on synthesis costs. ...|$|E

Duckling survival was best modelled to include a treatment effect, with higher survival on lakes with food added, and a negative effect of harsh weather. As expected, duckling survival increased nonlinearly with age. Only one female remained on control lakes after 24 days, whereas four remained on lakes with food added.

40|$|An organism's {{reproductive}} success {{may be affected}} by choice of breeding habitats and subsequent investment in offspring. Nest microclimate may profoundly influence energetic costs of incubation or embryonic survival, but few studies have evaluated whether birds select nest-sites based on microclimate. Likewise, increased investment of nutrients in eggs may have costs in terms of future survival and reproduction. These ideas have received only limited testing, particularly behavioural and physiological responses to clutch size variation of <b>precocial</b> <b>birds.</b> Therefore, I evaluated whether: (1) ducks select nest-sites for thermal features; and, (2) incubation behaviours, incubation periods, or energetic costs of incubation are related to clutch size. Blue-winged teal (A. discors; hereafter teal) nested most often in grass or short shrub habitats, while mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) nested in all habitats. Within nesting habitats, microclimate followed a gradient from hot and sunny in grass-dominated sites to cool and shaded sites in aspen (Populus spp.) groves. I measured microclimatic conditions at mallard and teal nests and randomly located nonnest sites, to evaluate thermal consequences of nest-site selection. Duck nests received on average less solar insolation than nonnest sites, producing more moderate thermal conditions than at nonnest sites. When mallard and teal nests were concurrently monitored, teal selected warmer nest-sites than mallards. Thus, teal may choose warmer nests to offset costs of incubation, a hypothesis {{which has not been}} tested. Apart from egg formation costs, processes occurring during incubation may also limit clutch size of <b>precocial</b> <b>birds.</b> I tested if incubation periods were positively correlated with clutch size and found that incubation periods of captive mallards and wild teal, but not wild mallards, were longer for females incubating clutches enlarged by 50 %. Incubating females may respond to increased energetic costs of incubation by: (1) losing more mass, (2) decreasing nest attendance, or (3) some combination of both. Mass loss and mass at hatch were unrelated to clutch enlargement, however, mass loss was positively correlated with mass at the start of incubation. While controlling for effects of weather, I found no change in incubation behaviours of mallards incubating enlarged clutches, but, teal increased overall recess frequency. Finally, I evaluated effects of clutch enlargement on incubation strategies, representing an integration of behaviour and body mass dynamics. When controlling for weather and body mass dynamics, clutch enlargement produced significant, yet subtle changes in incubation behaviours. Mallards took slightly shorter recesses, but maintained constancy, whereas teal increased recess frequency and decreased nest attendance. Energetic costs of incubation are controversial. I tested if incubation metabolic rates (IMR) were greater than resting metabolic rate (RMR). Incubation caused an increase in metabolic rate by mallard and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus spadiceus). I tested the assumption that IMR is positively correlated with clutch size and found that IMR of junglefowl within thermoneutrality was unrelated to clutch mass. Further work is needed to evaluate metabolic responses of <b>precocial</b> <b>birds</b> to clutch size variation. Overall, clutch size of <b>precocial</b> <b>birds</b> (particularly small species) may be limited by costs in terms of extended laying and incubation periods, as well as by subtle changes in incubation behaviours. Further integration of incubation costs with those associated with egg formation and brood-rearing, would provide a comprehensive and powerful analysis of factors limiting clutch size in <b>precocial</b> <b>birds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Developing {{animals are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to predation. Hence, precocial young of many taxa develop predator escape performance that rivals that of adults. Ontogenetically unique among vertebrates, birds transition from hind limb to forelimb dependence for escape behaviours, so developmental investment for immediate gains in running performance may impair flight performance later. Here, in a three-dimensional kinematic study of developing birds performing pre-flight flapping locomotor behaviours, wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and a newly described behaviour, controlled flapping descent (CFD), we define three stages of locomotor ontogeny in a model gallinaceous bird (Alectoris chukar). In stage I (1 ‚Äì 7 days post-hatching (dph)) birds crawl quadrupedally during ascents, and their flapping fails to reduce their acceleration during aerial descents. Stage II (8 ‚Äì 19 dph) birds use symmetric wing beats during WAIR, and in CFD significantly reduce acceleration while controlling body pitch to land on their feet. In stage III (20 dph to adults), birds are capable of vertical WAIR and level-powered flight. In contrast to altricial species, which first fly when nearly at adult mass, we show that in a <b>precocial</b> <b>bird</b> the major requirements for flight (i. e. high power output, wing control and wing size) convene by around 8 dph (at ca 5 % of adult mass) and yield significant gains in escape performance: immature chukars can fly by 20 dph, at only about 12 per cent of adult mass...|$|E

Testis size and ornament size were not correlated. Thus, both primary and secondary male sexual traits could be important components of female allocation decisions. Experimental manipulation of hormone levels during embryonic development showed that {{both male and female}} traits influencing female egg size were sensitive to early hormone exposure.

BACKGROUND: The amount of {{resources}} provided by the mother before birth has important and long-lasting effects on offspring fitness. Despite this, there is a large amount of variation in maternal investment seen in natural populations. Life-history theory predicts that this variation is maintained through a trade-off between the benefits of high maternal investment for the offspring and the costs of high investment for the mother. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying these costs of reproduction are not well understood. Here we used artificial selection for high and low maternal egg investment in a <b>precocial</b> <b>bird,</b> the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to quantify costs of maternal reproductive investment. RESULTS: We show that females from the high maternal investment lines had significantly larger reproductive organs, which explained their overall larger body mass, and resulted in a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR). Contrary to our expectations, this increase in metabolic activity did not lead to a higher level of oxidative damage.

Results revealed that augmented prenatal visual stimulation prior to hatching does not disrupt the ability of bobwhite chicks to recognize and prefer information learned in a contingent fashion, whereas augmented prenatal auditory stimulation disrupted the ability of chicks to benefit from contingently presented information.

We address these biases in an experimental test of the timing hypothesis (i. e.

Standardised invertebrate sampling was done concurrently to get a measure of lake-level abundance of aquatic prey, a likely causative agent of putative seasonal difference in duckling survival. Survival data and covariates (duckling age; days) were analysed by an information theoretic approach. There was no effect of treatment (i. e. manipulation of hatching date) on duckling survival, which was higher in 2005 than in 2004. In contrast to observational studies from more seasonal wetlands, our experiment demonstrates that duckling survival on boreal lakes was not affected by a 12 -day delay in hatching date.

Although {{many studies have}} examined the variation of brain size in birds, there is little information on Palaeognaths, which include the ratite lineage of kiwi, emu, ostrich and extinct moa, as well as the tinamous. Therefore, we set out to determine to what extent the evolution of brain size in Palaeognaths parallels that of other birds, i. e., Neognaths, by analyzing the variation in the relative sizes of the brain and cerebral hemispheres of several species of ratites and tinamous. Our results indicate that the Palaeognaths possess relatively smaller brains and cerebral hemispheres than the Neognaths, {{with the exception of the}} kiwi radiation (Apteryx spp.). The external morphology and relatively large size of the brain of Apteryx, as well as the relatively large size of its telencephalon, contrast with other Palaeognaths, including two species of historically sympatric moa, suggesting that unique selective pressures towards increasing brain size accompanied the evolution of kiwi. Indeed, the size of the cerebral hemispheres with respect to total brain size of kiwi is rivaled only by a handful of parrots and songbirds, despite a lack of evidence of any advanced behavioral/ cognitive abilities such as those reported for parrots and crows. In addition, the enlargement in brain and telencephalon size of the kiwi occurs despite the fact that this is a <b>precocial</b> <b>bird.</b> These findings form an exception to, and hence challenge, the current rules that govern changes in relative brain size in birds.

Dinosaurs had growth rates intermediate between similar sized/scaled-up reptiles and mammals, but a much lower rate than scaled-up birds. All dinosaurian growth rates were within the range of extant reptiles and mammals, and were lower than those of birds. Under the assumption that growth rate and metabolic rate are indeed linked, our results suggest two alternative interpretations. Compared to other sauropsids, the growth rates of studied dinosaurs clearl...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms are {{considered}} to be crucial selective factor affecting reproductive success of birds. It is hypothesized that egg-white antimicrobial proteins and incubation behavior are the most important defense mechanisms that eliminates the risk of microbial trans-shell infection. The latest studies supposed that incubation temperatures may significantly affect the antimicrobial activity of egg white proteins. The concentration of egg white antimicrobial proteins as well as incubation patterns differ among altricial and <b>precocial</b> species of <b>birds.</b> However, experimental study testing the effect of incubation temperature on the antimicrobial potential of antimicrobial egg white proteins in altricial and <b>precocial</b> <b>birds</b> is missing. In this study we tested in manipulative experiment the effect of partial and full incubation, the concentration of lysozyme and ovotransferrin and their interactions on the antimicrobial activity of egg whites of two model species - Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and home pigeon (Columba livia). Antimicrobial protein activity was determined by the agar well diffusion method against two Gram-positive bacteria - Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus that have been documented as pathogenic egg-white invaders of several birds. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of [...] ...|$|R
