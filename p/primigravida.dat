2500|$|Associated {{terms for}} {{pregnancy}} are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid {{come from the}} Latin for [...] "heavy" [...] and a pregnant female is {{sometimes referred to as}} a gravida. Gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant. [...] Similarly, the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage. Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth. [...] A woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida. [...] A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a <b>primigravida,</b> and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as multiparous. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. [...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as nulliparous.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 This study {{compared}} the parental attitudes of mothers under 35 years of age, {{who are having}} their first child, called <b>primigravidas,</b> with the parental attitudes of mothers 35 years old and older, called mature <b>primigravidas,</b> who are having their first child. Historically, most women in America {{had to choose between}} having a career or having children. Today, in America women have more choices. They can choose to have a career, children and family, or both. Many women ages 20 to 35 are choosing to have children before pursuing a career. Other women are choosing to develop their careers first and not have children until they are 35 years of age or older. Often the women who choose a career first increase their education and socioeconomic status significantly before having their first child. In this study the population sample consisted of 80 <b>primigravidas.</b> Fifty of the <b>primigravidas</b> were under the age of 35. Thirty of the <b>primigravidas</b> were 35 years and older. The sample population of 80 <b>primigravidas</b> was generated from <b>primigravidas</b> participating in birthing classes held in 12 of Oregon's northwestern counties. The findings of this study were based upon responses to the 115 Likert instrument, Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI), developed by S. C. Schaefer and Richard Q. Bell. The Mann-Whitney U̲ test, at the. 05 level of significance, was used to evaluate the results. Seventeen of the 25 null hypotheses were rejected, supporting the hypothesis that there is a difference in the parental attitudes of <b>primigravidas</b> when age, education, and socioeconomic status are the quantitative measurements. In accordance with the review of literature and the research findings, the following recommendations are suggested: 1) Educators need to update their information on birthing and parenting in order to present available options for the "new" age group of mature <b>primigravidas.</b> 2) The "new" age group of first-time mature <b>primigravidas</b> need references that are specifically applicable to their first parenting experience. 3) Informative, new materials need to be disseminated to physicians and other medical practitioners regarding mature <b>primigravidas</b> and their opportunities for a normal birth at ages not historically acceptable. 4) Writers of textbooks in health education need new perspectives that deal with later pregnancies of <b>primigravidas</b> 35 years of age and older in a more positive, supportive posture...|$|R

RESULTS: Of the 2000 women enrolled, there were 50. 4 % (n= 1008) <b>primigravidas</b> and 49. 6 % (n= 992) multigravidas. Of the 2000 8. 5 % were delivered by elective CS and 13. 4 % were delivered by emergency CS giving an overall rate of 21. 9 %. The overall CS rate was 30. 1 % in obese women compared with 19. 2 % in the normal BMI category (p< 0. 001). In <b>primigravidas</b> the increase in CS rate in obese women was due {{to an increase in}} emergency CS (p< 0. 005) and in multigravidas the increase was due to an increase in elective CS (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: Birthweight {{outcomes}} in rural Tanzania were determined {{in relation to}} place of delivery (hospital, dispensary or home), parity and maternal age (adolescent or non-adolescent) in order to evaluate the usefulness of birthweight data for monitoring malaria control in pregnancy. Study design: Retrospective descriptive study. Methods: Birthweight data for the years 1997 - 2001 were obtained from Kilosa district hospital (n = 6269), nine dispensaries (n = 3688) and for home deliveries (n = 677). Results: The prevalence of low birthweight in singletons was highest in hospital births (<b>primigravidae,</b> 23. 4 %; multigravidae, 10. 0 %). Adolescent <b>primigravidae</b> with home deliveries had the lowest mean birthweight (2. 611 kg; 95 % confidence interval 2. 546 - 2. 676 kg). An excess risk of low birthweight in <b>primigravidae</b> compared with multigravidae was seen with increasing distance from the district hospital. The population attributable risk percent for tow birthweight in <b>primigravidae</b> associated with malaria increased with distance from the hospital, from 30 % for Kilosa town to 45. 7 % at distances > 50 km. Young adolescent <b>primigravidae</b> were at highest risk of poor birthweight outcomes. Dispensary birthweight data were considered to provide the most representative sample for routine birthweight surveillance. Conclusions: Birthweight indicators show that malaria control in pregnancy is poor in this population, deteriorates with distance of place of birth from the main hospital location, and is worst in adolescent <b>primigravidae.</b> Greater attention {{should be given to}} the use of birthweight indicators in rural areas of Tanzania for monitoring malaria control in pregnancy.

40|$|Introduction : Psychological {{problems}} commonly {{experienced by}} pregnant women especially <b>primigravidae</b> are anxiety and fear. Prenatal classes {{is used to}} manage anxiety and low self -efficacy in pregnant women. However, {{it is still not}} enough. This study aimed to prove the efficacy of CBT for reducing anxiety and increasing self-efficacy in third trimester <b>primigravidae.</b> Method: This is a pre- experimental study with the one group pretest posttest design approach. The population was all third trimester <b>primigravidae</b> at Kendangsari Mother and Child Hospital, Surabaya. Samples were third trimester <b>primigravidae</b> who experienced anxiety, answered self-efficacy questionnaire, met the inclusion criteria and willing to be a research subject. Sample size was 10. The statistical test used to determine the influence of independent variable toward dependent variables was Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Result : CBT could lower the anxiety level (p= 0. 007), CBT could improve self-efficacy (p= 0. 007) in third trimester <b>primigravidae.</b> Discussion : CBT has been able to reduce anxiety. In the process, CBT encourages clients against their negative thoughts and figure out how more positive thoughts could change the level of anxiety becoming lower. CBT in the process turns client’s mind into more positive thought that will be resulted in changing feelings (affection), so that positive behaviors implemented could reduce anxiety level. Declining anxiety level individual could control the situation, produce positivethings and increase self-efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to malaria in pregnant women, we determined {{the level of}} malaria-specific immunity in <b>primigravidae.</b> Humoral and cellular in vitro responses to unpurified (a crude schizont extract and a gametocyte preparation) and purified (affinity-purified Pfl 55 /ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen [RESA]) Plasinodiuin falciparuin proteins, an immunodominant 45 / 47 -kilodalton antigen from Mycobacterium Dovis, and leucoagglutinin were compared between 52 <b>primigravidae</b> and 52 nonpregnant women from a semirural area of Cameroon. In vitro cellular responses were investigated in terms of lymphocyte proliferation, as well as production of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), interferon-gamma (IF"-y), and IL- 4. Cells from <b>primigravidae</b> exhibited a reduced proliferative response to schizont and gametocyte antigens, {{as well as to}} the M. bovis antigen. Conversely, the IL- 2 response to Pfl 55 RESA was reduced. Interleukin- 4 and IFN-y production did not appear to be affected in <b>primigravidae.</b> Antibody levels were also similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Our results underline the importance of examining several parameters of T cell activation with different types of antigens for a correc...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Facing {{childbirth}} is {{one thing}} that can cause anxiety. The process of giving birth is not always only somatic, but also psychosomatic. It is because many psychological elements affect the process of giving birth. This study aimed to analyze the differences of the level anxiety in facing childbirth between <b>primigravida</b> and multigravida. The research was conducted with cross-sectional design using questionnaires and Hamilton Rating Scale Anxiety (HRS-A). Interviews were conducted on 43 primigravidae and multigravidae pregnant women on 3 rd trimester who checkup at Puskesmas Talango Sumenep.   Sample was taken by simple random sampling. Independent variables in this study were maternal characteristics, internal and external factors which cause anxiety. The dependent variable was the level of anxiety in facing labor. Testing difference in the level anxiety in the face of labor between <b>primigravida</b> and multigravida with Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test, where statistic values sig. (2 -tailed) is 0, 006 or p< 0, 05 indicating that there were differences in anxiety levels between <b>primigravida</b> and multigravida. The conclusions that can be drawn is that there are differences in the level of anxiety in facing childbirth between <b>primigravida</b> and multigravida. It is recommended for health worker to concern not only on the pregnancy but also on mother’s psychology condition. Health worker should inform husbands to accompany their wife from pregnancy to childbirth. Keyword: anxiety level, labor, primigavida, multigravi...|$|E
40|$|Oesophageal rupture in {{pregnancy}} is extremely rare. Kennard I described the post-mortem {{findings of a}} ruptured oesophagus in a 37 -year-old <b>primigravida</b> who suddenly collapsed and died shortly after a forceps delivery. The labour had been prolonged and the patient had earlier complained of dyspnoea but no chest pain. Henry 2 reported a case of spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus following severe vomiting in an 18 -year-old <b>primigravida</b> at 10 weeks ' gestation. She settled with conservative treatment, was discharged 12 days later and reached 32 weeks ' gestation and presumably subsequent delivery without further problems. CASE HISTORY A 25 -year-old <b>primigravida</b> was admitted at 35 weeks ' gestation {{with a history of}} severe and excessive vomiting for one week and crampy abdominal pain for one day. Three days prior to admission, she suddenly developed retrosternal pain but there was no accompanying shortness of breath. She noticed swelling of the left side of her face and neck on the day of admission. On examination, a swelling was noted extending from below her left orbit to her neck. Crepitus was readil...|$|E
