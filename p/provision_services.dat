40|$|AbstractEcosystems {{services}} {{are threatened by}} the rapid degradation of tropical rainforests. In light of these threats, questions remain about how societies on the forest fringe who depend on <b>provisioning</b> <b>services</b> affect plant functional traits. This study assessed the relationship between plant functional traits, forest-dependent societies and <b>provisioning</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> along a forest–agriculture matrix gradient in tropical humid forests of Madagascar. Data were collected for six functional traits and six <b>provisioning</b> <b>services.</b> We evaluated functional diversity (FD) and utilitarian diversity (FD of <b>provisioning</b> <b>services)</b> along disturbance gradients. We also determined the traits most susceptible to loss along the gradient {{as well as the}} relationship between functional traits and <b>provisioning</b> <b>services.</b> The results showed that FD, utilitarian diversity and species richness decreased significantly across all modified habitats. There was a distinct suite of traits absent from intensely used habitats and those same traits were associated with the two most important <b>provisioning</b> <b>services</b> in the region (firewood and construction). The activities of people living on the forest fringe seem to be a strong selective force on trait loss in plant communities, which in turn will influence future species assembly and trait diversity and distribution. Moreover, this study suggests {{that it is possible to}} predict trait loss from plant communities in forests where degradation is mediated primarily through subsistence agriculture and resource extraction. Conservation efforts should recognize that forest degradation and deforestation are contextually specific, determined mostly by people’s efforts to maintain their basic livelihood, and therefore necessitate local-scale interventions that feed into landscape-scale policy initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Inter-organizational {{knowledge}} exchanges {{have recently}} emerged to enable organizations to share or even commercially exploit their knowledge outside organizational borders. The implementation of such exchanges requires mechanisms for efficiently providing external access to {{knowledge that is}} internally stored within an organization. In this paper, we propose ‘Knowledge <b>Provision</b> <b>Services</b> ’ {{as a means for}} efficient discovery, retrieval and composition of knowledge from organizational repositories. We adopt a Knowledge Object (KO) ontology, i. e. a declarative specification of the knowledge representation schema which describes the content and context facets of knowledge objects and extend the OWL-S web service ontology with the KO ontology. In addition, we develop a web service-based infrastructure for the publication, discovery, composition and delivery of Knowledge <b>Provision</b> <b>Services.</b> Specifically, we replace UDDI by a knowledge provision service registry that supports richer and more appropriate semantics and develop a composition service which receives requests in the form of user-defined templates, generates the appropriate queries and applies a similarity algorithm for bundling the appropriate query results. ...|$|E
