5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E

Espejo tried to convince people {{of the dangers of}} smallpox. He understood the current European medical theories about contagious diseases and warned against the incorrect belief that smallpox was transmitted by <b>polluted</b> <b>air.</b> Citing the English doctor Thomas Sydenham, he suggested the construction of an isolated country house as a hospital.|$|E
25|$|A {{pollutant}} is a {{waste material}} that <b>pollutes</b> <b>air,</b> water or soil. Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant: its chemical nature, the concentration and the persistence.|$|R
30|$|The {{neoliberal}} administrations tend to favour {{large farm}} operations (e.g. a feedlot) and mining. This {{is leading to}} resource exploitation of vast land areas by powerful companies. The potential of new conflicts due to delimiting access and creating competition for resources {{is just around the}} corner, as occurs elsewhere (Hollander [2013]). An example in Mexico is the experience with mines: local communities do not get what they are promised, while mines restrict access to communal grazing land and also <b>pollute</b> <b>air,</b> soil and water (Rodríguez Wallenius [2011]). Similarly, the feedlot enterprise in the vicinity of one of the villages is <b>polluting</b> <b>air</b> and water sources.|$|R

25|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a problem}} in Sofia due to its location in the Sofia valley, which is surrounded by mountains that reduce the ability of the air to self-clean. The air is polluted mostly by particulate matters and nitrogen oxides. Sofia has the most <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> of any capital in the EU.|$|E
25|$|In all cases, if {{employer}} select respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (full face mask, elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or {{filtering facepiece}} respirator), all employee must be fit tested (to prevent leakage unfiltered <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> through gaps between {{their faces and}} the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces). Appendix A provides {{a detailed description of}} this testing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{major source}} of air {{pollution}} {{is represented by the}} means of transport. The largest share of gases <b>polluting</b> <b>air</b> comes from motor vehicles, mainly due to their large number. Regardless of the type of motor, vehicles <b>pollutes</b> <b>air</b> with carbon and nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons, sulphur oxides, aldehydes, plumbum, asbestos, soot, etc. But the activity of trading fuels (diesel, gasoline), lubricants, parts, accessories and auto cosmetics (which are sold in fuel sales and distribution units) is another source of environmental contamination. From this point of view we studied some gas stations located in Drobeta Turnu Severin area, the possibility of soil pollution, waste disposal, safety zone and fire security measures. Air emissions, wastewater discharge, safety and hygiene of jobs were also studied...|$|R
30|$|Management and {{processing}} {{of the waste}} from different industries are the major problem in the {{different parts of the}} world (Anupama et al. 2013). The harmful impact of molecules that are generated from various different process industries <b>pollutes</b> <b>air</b> and water by its dangerous and mutagenic properties (Busca et al. 2008).|$|R

25|$|Poor inner-city {{residents}} {{also must}} contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks {{are far more likely}} to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins. Daily exposure to this <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.|$|E
500|$|Tax {{shifting}} {{has been}} widely discussed and endorsed by economists. It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities, {{in order to create}} a more responsive market. [...] For example, a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing <b>polluted</b> <b>air,</b> the costs of acid rain damage, and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies. [...] Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform.|$|E
500|$|The mayor's office {{established}} a 10-member task force headed by Norman Cousins (known as {{the editor of}} the weekly magazine Saturday Review) to study the problem of air pollution. The task force published a 102-page report in May 1966, finding that the city had the most <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> of any major city in the United States, with a wider range and greater total tonnage of pollutants than Los Angeles. The task force criticized the city for lax enforcement of pollution laws, even naming the city itself the biggest violator, with municipal garbage incinerators [...] "operat in almost constant violation" [...] of its own laws. The report warned [...] "all the ingredients now exist for an air-pollution disaster of major proportions" [...] and that the city [...] "could become a gas chamber" [...] in the wrong weather conditions.|$|E

50|$|Industrial pig farming, {{a subset}} of CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) poses {{numerous}} threats to environmental health and justice. Feces and waste often spread to surrounding neighborhoods, <b>polluting</b> <b>air</b> and water with toxic waste particles. Waste from swine on these farms carry a host of pathogens and bacteria as well as heavy metals. These toxins can leach down through the soil into groundwater, polluting local drinking water supplies. Pathogens can also become <b>air</b> born, <b>polluting</b> the <b>air</b> and harming individuals when ingested. Contents from waste {{have been shown to}} cause many detrimental health implications, as well as harmful algal blooms in surrounding bodies of water.|$|R
50|$|The State Environmental Protection Administration investigates tens of {{thousands}} of polluters every year, shutting down thousands of the worse offenders, but has failed to reach its target of reducing emissions by 2 percent. In 2011, a factory manufacturing solar panels in Zhejiang province had been shut down because of toxic emissions of fluorine <b>polluting</b> <b>air</b> and water, sickening nearby residents.|$|R
500|$|After the 1966 smog, [...] "the {{consequences}} of state inaction were apparent {{to the naked}} eye," [...] public outcry intensified, {{and the demand for}} federal intervention increased. New Jersey passed several new air-pollution laws in 1967. Nevertheless, traffic and drifting <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> from New Jersey remained a major contributor to New York City's pollution problem. Edward Teller — the physicist known for his role in developing the hydrogen bomb and an advisor to Mayor Lindsay on pollution and energy issues—advocated for New York state to adopt stricter sulfur fuel standards than the city. A leader of the advocacy group Citizens for Cleaner Air criticized the local and state governments at a state public hearing, calling the city's enforcement [...] "in a state of collapse" [...] and, saying the city acting alone [...] "cannot or will not enforce any standard or rule," [...] demanded that the state government increase its role.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the successes}} of the Everglades Forever Act and the {{decreases}} in mercury levels, the focus intensified on the Everglades in the 1990s as {{quality of life in}} the South Florida metropolitan areas diminished. It was becoming clear that urban populations were consuming increasingly unsustainable levels of natural resources. A report entitled [...] "The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida", submitted to Lawton Chiles in 1995, identified the problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in tourism (12,000jobs and $200million annually) and income from compromised commercial fishing (3,300jobs and $52million annually). [...] The report noted that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to [...] "a precipitous juncture" [...] where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health hazards in <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe urban conditions hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered vehicles had increased by 166%. On the quality and availability of water, the report stated, [...] " [...] frequent water shortages... create the irony of a natural system dying of thirst in a subtropical environment with over 53 inches of rain per year".|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 Southeast Asian haze {{event was}} caused by {{continued}} uncontrolled burning from [...] "slash and burn" [...] cultivation in Indonesia, and affected several countries in the Southeast Asian region and beyond, such as Malaysia, Singapore, southern Thailand, {{and as far as}} Saipan; the effects of the haze may have spread to South Korea. Local sources of pollution partly contributed to the increased toxicity, particularly in high-pollution areas such as ports, oil refineries, and dense urban areas. In the highly urbanised and industrialised Klang Valley of Malaysia in particular, the surrounding terrain acted as a natural retainer of <b>polluted</b> <b>air,</b> aggravating the situation when the haze set in.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} and chemical reactions involved in photochemical smog were not understood until the 1950s. In 1948, flavor chemist Arie Haagen-Smit adapted {{some of his}} equipment to collect chemicals from <b>polluted</b> <b>air,</b> and identified ozone {{as a component of}} Los Angeles smog. Haagen-Smit went on to discover that nitrous oxides from automotive exhausts and gaseous hydrocarbons from cars and oil refineries, exposed to sunlight, were key ingredients in the formation of ozone and photochemical smog. Haagen-Smit worked with Arnold Beckman, who developed various equipment for detecting smog, ranging from an [...] "Apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere" [...] patented on October 7, 1952, to [...] "air quality monitoring vans" [...] for use by government and industry.|$|E
2500|$|The western region, which {{includes}} Boon Lay, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong, {{seemed to be}} the [...] "epicentre" [...] of the haze.

The air quality levels in the west may have consistently been the worst, but only by several points. Some speculated that the more <b>polluted</b> <b>air</b> was caused by the many construction sites and industrial parks in Jurong, but NEA refuted this, claiming that they did not contribute to the haze.
