5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} presession {{attention}} on the later occurrence of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> was examined with elementary-school children {{with a range of}} disabilities. Results of analogue functional analyses suggested an escape function, an attention function, or both. Following the analogue functional analyses, the effects of two antecedent conditions (10 -min ignore vs. 10 -min attention) were compared on <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> in subsequent test conditions. For participants who displayed attention-maintained <b>problem</b> <b>behavior,</b> the test condition involved contingent attention for <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> For participants who displayed escape-maintained <b>problem</b> <b>behavior,</b> the test condition involved contingent escape for <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> Results indicated that participants who displayed attention-maintained <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> displayed less <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> following presession exposure to attention than when ignored.

40|$|Escape from {{instructional}} demands {{is one of}} {{the most}} common functions of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> Some research suggests that a switch from difficult to easy tasks may function as a reinforcer for <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> This is especially dangerous in situations where easy tasks are part of the treatment procedure for <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> This project examined the reinforcing effects of a switch from low-probability (low-p) to high-probability (high-p) tasks for individuals whose <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> was maintained by escape from demands. It also provided preliminary evidence as to the quality of reinforcement in a switch from low-p to high-p tasks. Participants included individuals with developmental disabilities who engaged in <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> maintained by escape. We compared rate of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> during two treatment conditions in relation baseline using a multi-element design. During the baseline condition, a break from demands was presented contingent on <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> In the first treatment condition, <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> following a low-p task no longer resulted in a break from demands (escape extinction). During the second treatment condition, <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> following a low-p task resulted in a switch to high-p tasks. Participants engaged in varying levels of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> during the escape extinction condition, and elevated levels of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> during the second treatment condition. These results suggest that for individuals whose <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> is maintained by escape from demands, a switch from a low-p task to a high-p task reinforces <b>problem</b> <b>behavior...</b>|$|R

The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E

HASTAC is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; Ning supports teachers; TermWiki, Learn Central, TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, eportfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online yearbooks, both public and private. One such service is MyYearbook, which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect.

Acculturation was predicted to have an indirect, but positive, relationship to <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> proneness through parental involvement and self-esteem. The results partially supported the model and indicated that parental involvement, but not self-esteem, played a significant mediational role in children’s <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> proneness.
