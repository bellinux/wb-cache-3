5|$|The Philadelphia {{team had}} an {{opportunity}} to win the National League pennant, and the owners hoped that adding Sunday to the roster would improve their chances. Although Sunday <b>played</b> <b>well</b> in his thirty-one games with Philadelphia, the team finished in third place.|$|E
5|$|The West Indian's {{had begun}} to {{experience}} difficulties in {{the final years of}} the 1960s. The Indian defeat had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they <b>played</b> <b>well</b> against Australia on the 1972–73 tour, they lost 2:1. In the Fourth Test in Guyana they fell to a 10-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings. The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues. In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests. The West Indians played Andy Roberts and Michael Holding in both games, though India <b>played</b> <b>well</b> enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures. Their victory in the second involved a record 406-run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down.|$|E

5|$|Coulson {{was called}} into the England {{national}} C team in September 2010 for a match against Wales, but injury prevented him from making his debut. In February 2012, he received a second call up, being selected in the squad to face Italy in the 2011–13 International Challenge Trophy on 28 February. Coulson started to make his England C debut, playing the entire match as he and fellow winger Matty Blair <b>played</b> <b>well</b> on the flanks, the match finishing a 1–1 home draw. He finished his England C career with two caps, earned in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning a}} {{championship}} with the Spurs, doubts lingered over Parker's future. The Spurs had attempted {{and failed to}} acquire New Jersey Nets' Jason Kidd, but Parker told coach Popovich {{that he wanted to}} be San Antonio's starting point guard. Parker <b>played</b> <b>well</b> during the regular season, recording 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg and 3.2 rpg. However, the Spurs were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, and were denied back-to-back titles.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{was signed}} by Premier League club Wigan Athletic on 7 July 2006 for a £5.5million fee. He made his debut against Newcastle United on 19 August 2006, which his new team lost 2–1. On his 500thleague appearance, Heskey scored his first goal for Wigan in a 1–0 Premier League victory over Reading on 26 August. He scored 8 goals in 36 {{appearances}} in 2006–07, as Wigan avoided relegation on goal difference over Sheffield United, against whom Heskey <b>played</b> <b>well</b> on 13 May 2007, in a match he nearly scored a bicycle kick.|$|E

Since 2006, United has <b>played</b> <b>well</b> against international competition, beating Scottish champions Celtic F.C. and drawing Real Madrid in Seattle. In addition, the 2006 MLS All-Star Team, which included eight United players and was managed by United's manager Piotr Nowak, defeated English champions Chelsea. In 2006 and 2007, United became the first club in league history to win the MLS Supporters' Shield consecutively.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1994, Tolliver {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} by the Houston Oilers. He was originally the third-string quarterback, but ineffectiveness by Bucky Richardson led Tolliver to relieve him {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. Tolliver <b>played</b> <b>well</b> enough to be considered for the starting job the following week due to Cody Carlson dealing with injuries. Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the New York Jets. After finishing the season, Tolliver became a free agent and left the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Tech <b>played</b> <b>well</b> also, {{especially}} on defense {{where they were}} able to create four turnovers including Thompson's first interception in 99pass attempts. Defensive back Antonio Huffman returned the pick 54yards for a touchdown and put the Red Raiders up 24–10 late in the second quarter. Texas Tech was able to capitalize on the other take-aways as well, turning them into 14more points and held the lead until the fourth quarter. Two missed field goals and a fired-up Sooner defense held the Red Raiders off, however, and the Sooners were able to put the game away with a two-yard touchdown run by Brown.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{finished}} with an 11–3 record in 1963 {{and faced the}} Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field in Chicago, the Giants' defense <b>played</b> <b>well,</b> but the Bears newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times and battered him throughout the game. Sherman resisted calls from players such as linebacker Sam Huff to replace the struggling Tittle. The Giants defense held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much {{of the blame}} for the Giants' poor {{performance}} was placed on Brown. He put up lackluster numbers for the second straight year. Though the Giants defense still <b>played</b> <b>well,</b> and young players like Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead began to emerge,* Freeman, Mike. , The New York Times, October 30, 1995, accessed December 6, 2010. the Giants inspired tepid interest league-wide and sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick <b>played</b> <b>well</b> {{against a}} weak Zimbabwe {{side in the}} two-Test series in May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan {{averaging}} over 100. His form continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening stand with Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained his form in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at The Oval completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.|$|E

The pass to Jenks Gillem went wide, and before he could recover it he was downed by Enoch Brown for a safety. Gillem had one punt of 58 yards that day. Vanderbilt's game seemed to stagnate until Wilson Collins was hurt and replaced by Tom Shea in the third quarter. Then two touchdowns came in the fourth period, one by Robins and another Turner. In his last game, Lew Hardage <b>played</b> <b>well</b> despite his hurt left ankle.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC <b>played</b> <b>well</b> at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Friday {{returned}} to Acton, {{where he had}} a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday <b>played</b> <b>well</b> enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants <b>played</b> <b>well,</b> {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Born in La Ceiba, Honduras to an American {{father and}} a mother of Spanish heritage, Stephen Wood Van Buren was {{orphaned}} at age ten and was sent to live with relatives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he attended Warren Easton High School, and tried out for the football team originally as a sophomore, but {{did not make the}} team. Later that year he {{dropped out of high school}} and went to work in an iron foundry. He returned to high school two years later and made the team as an end his senior year. He <b>played</b> <b>well</b> enough that season to earn an athletic scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge.|$|E
5|$|Facing the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in {{the opening}} round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Luongo started {{the first two games}} and <b>played</b> <b>well</b> but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider {{for the rest of the}} series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum, and Luongo {{remained}} on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks' final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011–12. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo told reporters that he would waive his no-trade clause if management asked him to. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager Mike Gillis' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful due to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract.|$|E
