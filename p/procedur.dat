Recently, several approaches based on conjectural variations equilibrium models have been proposed for representing agents' {{behavior in}} electrical power markets. These models provide insight of market equilibrium sensitivity to agents&# 8217; strategies and external variables, and therefore, they are widely applied. Unfortunately, not enough analysis {{has been done in}} how these user-supplied parameters, the conjectural variations, should be estimated. This paper proposes a parameter inference procedure based on two stages. The first stage infers historical values of the parameter by fitting the models' results to historical market data. The second stage is based on a statistical time-series model whose objective is to forecast parameter values in future scenarios.

In addition the technical realizability of separate collection on the building site was checked and a manual was developed which was proved in practice and turned into action. This was the basis for the advice or the organization and <b>procedurs</b> on different building sites. The economic impacts, that means the organizational and financial additional expenditure, were shown.

Gene analysis of 10 subjects who didn't show dystrophin gene deletion were not examined about point mutation.
