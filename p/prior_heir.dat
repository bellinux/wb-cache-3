50|$|Following her death, a {{succession}} question came about. Liu Xi's older brother Liu Yin, Liu Yao's <b>prior</b> <b>heir</b> apparent, whom Liu Yao had {{assumed to have}} been killed in Jin Zhun's coup, had in fact escaped but was taken as a slave by the Heiniyuju (黑匿郁鞠) tribe. In 323, Liu Yin revealed his identity to the chief of the tribe, who promptly delivered him back to his father. Liu Yao considered replacing Liu Xi with Liu Yin, since Liu Yin was previously his heir, but Liu Yin's uncle Bu Tai (卜泰) and another official Han Guang (韓廣) spoke against it, and Liu Yin himself personally declined to replace Liu Xi. Liu Yao let Liu Xi remain crown prince, while granting Liu Yin special honors, including requiring Liu Xi to yield to Liu Yin as an older brother in ceremonies, rather than for Liu Yin to yield to Liu Xi as the crown prince. The relationship between the brothers appeared to remain cordial until their deaths.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} on strategic changes has asserted that long-tenured CEOs {{are less likely}} to initi-ate strategic changes. The authors argue that this assertion may exclude CEOs ’ prior experi-ences since it implicitly assumes that all new CEOs have the same inclination toward change. By viewing CEOs as individuals embedded within experiences and relationships throughout their careers, the authors propose that CEO newness—a concept integrating prior board expe-rience, <b>prior</b> <b>heir</b> apparent experience, and length in the current position—can provide a more complete assessment of a new CEO’s tendency toward change. They further argue that the impact of CEO newness on strategic changes will be moderated by the strategic distance between a focal firm and a CEO’s previous firm, as well as by industry similarity between the two firms. The authors ’ analyses of U. S. computer firms from 1994 to 2007 support their arguments, suggesting that it is useful to adopt the concept of CEO newness while considering its boundary conditions in order to better understand strategic changes...|$|E

50|$|Following {{a decisive}} victory at Agincourt in 1415, the English gained {{the upper hand}} in the conflict, occupying much of {{northern}} France. Under the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, England's Henry V became regent of France. By this treaty, Henry married Catherine, the daughter of the current French king, Charles VI, and would then succeed to the French throne upon Charles's death. The dauphin Charles, the son of Charles VI and presumptive <b>heir</b> <b>prior</b> to the treaty, was then disinherited.|$|R
5000|$|Letya Sekkya (လက်ျာ စကြာ, [...] ) was {{governor}} of Toungoo (Taungoo) from 1342 to 1344. He became governor with the title of Zeya Thingyan (ဇေယျ သင်္ကြန်) {{after the death of}} his father-in-law Kayin Ba, who left no male <b>heirs.</b> <b>Prior</b> to becoming governor, he had been a longtime minister serving at the regional court of Toungoo at least since the 1310s. In 1317−18, Sekkya led the negotiations with the forces of Pinya that allowed the rebellious governor Thawun Nge to remain in office in exchange for the latter's nominal submission. He was assassinated in 1344 by his younger brother Htauk Hlayga.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} 1245, a later William de Gresley gifted the advowson {{of the nearby}} Church of Lullington, Derbyshire to the <b>Prior</b> and his <b>heirs</b> in-return for [...] "all the {{benefits}} and prayers which should henceforth {{take place in the}} conventual church of Gresley, for ever." [...] This, and all other previous charters and gifts from the Gresley family to the Priory, were confirmed by Sir Geoffrey de Gresley in 1268; these included the grant of the mill at Castle Gresley to the priory.In 1291, Sir Geoffrey's grandson, another Geoffrey de Gresley assigned lands to the priory in the parish of Castle Gresley; the following years he made arrangements for one canon of the priory to sing mass for the soul of his wife Anneys.|$|R
5000|$|Francis was {{the only}} son of Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy and a great-great-grandson of King Charles V of France. His family was not {{expected}} to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King Charles VIII was still young {{at the time of}} his birth, as was his father's cousin the Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. [...] The Salic Law prevailed in France, thus females were ineligible to inherit the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already Count of Angoulême after the death of his own father two years <b>prior)</b> became the <b>heir</b> presumptive to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of Duke of Valois.|$|R
50|$|When King Edward died in January 1066, Edgar {{was still}} in his early teens, too young to be an {{effective}} military leader. This had not previously been an insurmountable obstacle: the earlier kings of England Eadwig, Edgar the Peaceful and Edward the Martyr had all come to the throne at a similar age, while Æthelred the Unready had been significantly younger at his accession. However, the avaricious ambitions which had been aroused across north-western Europe by Edward the Confessor's lack of an <b>heir</b> <b>prior</b> to 1057, and by the king's failure thereafter to prepare the way for Edgar to succeed him, removed any prospect of a peaceful hereditary succession. War was clearly inevitable and Edgar was in no position to fight it, while he was without powerful adult relatives to champion his cause. Accordingly, the Witenagemot elected Harold Godwinson, the man best placed to defend the country against the competing foreign claimants, to succeed Edward.|$|R
50|$|Ra's {{realizes that}} Batman has {{apparently}} died after Darkseid's invasion during Final Crisis. After confronting Nightwing with his knowledge, {{he and the}} hero eventually duel with swords. Nightwing defeats Ra's and earns the immortal's respect, signified by leaving his sword in the Batcave as a gift after their fight. Ra's refuses to believe his enemy's passing despite the evidence, leading him {{to be involved in}} the Red Robin's (Tim Drake) quest concerning the fate of the original Dark Knight. After Drake finds proof that Wayne is still alive but lost in time after his battle with Darkseid, the former Boy Wonder cripples Ra's' organization, the League of Assassins, from within. In response, Ra's returns to Gotham to begin his attack to destroy every legacy of the Wayne Family. While his men target everyone close to the Waynes, Ra's makes a pact with Hush as part of his plans. Unknown to both men, Bruce Wayne has already named Tim as his <b>heir</b> <b>prior</b> to his disappearance, leaving him in control of the Wayne Family resources.|$|R
50|$|On November 13, 1838, {{at the age}} of 31, Clemson married Anna Maria Calhoun, {{daughter}} of John C. Calhoun and Floride Calhoun. John C. Calhoun was the noted Senator from South Carolina and 7th Vice President of the United States. After Calhoun's death, Floride Calhoun, Anna Calhoun Clemson, and two other Calhoun children inherited the Fort Hill plantation near Pendleton, South Carolina. It was sold with 50 slaves for $49,000 to Calhoun's oldest son, Andrew Pickens Calhoun, in 1854. After the war and upon the Andrew's death in 1865, Floride Calhoun foreclosed on his <b>heirs</b> <b>prior</b> to her death in 1866. After lengthy legal procedures, Fort Hill was auctioned in 1872. The executor of her estate won the auction, which was divided among her surviving heirs. Her daughter, Anna Clemson, received the residence with about 814 acres (329.6 ha) and her great granddaughter, Floride Isabella Lee, received about 288 acres (116.6 ha).

50|$|Former U.S. Army Special Forces {{sergeant}} Chris Vaughn (The Rock) {{returns to}} his small home town in Kitsap County, Washington. Looking for work, he finds the local cedar mill was closed down three years <b>prior</b> by its <b>heir,</b> Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), who opened a new casino that now accounts {{for the majority of}} revenue for the local area. Hamilton, who was also Vaughn's school friend, invites him to a night of fun at the casino. While checking out the VIP lounge, Vaughn stumbles upon his childhood friend Deni (Ashley Scott), who is now working as a stripper. Later, he notices the craps dealer using loaded dice and demonstrates this to the patrons by placing a bet and calling out the roll before throwing the dice. When the floorman declares no payout, Vaughn instigates a fight. Although he beats down most of the security guards, he is subsequently subdued with a cattle prod and knocked unconscious. The security staff take Vaughn into the basement and Hamilton's right-hand man and head of security Booth (Kevin Durand) tortures him by cutting his torso with a utility knife before dumping him on a roadside. He is found by a trucker and hospitalized, but recovers quickly.|$|R
5000|$|After Calhoun's {{death in}} 1850, the {{property}} passed {{to his wife}} to be shared with three of her children: Cornelia, John, and Anna Maria, wife of Thomas Green Clemson.

In his 1888 will, Clemson bequeathed more than 814 acre of the Fort Hill estate to the State of South Carolina for an agricultural college with a stipulation that the dwelling house [...] "shall never be torn down or altered; but shall be kept in repair with all articles of furniture and vesture... and shall always be open for inspection of visitors." [...] Clemson University has operated Fort Hill as a house museum as stipulated in the will. The house is {{all that remains of}} what was once an extensive plantation estate.|$|R
