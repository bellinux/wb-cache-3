5|$|On August 6, Judge Yeager {{terminated}} Beard's probation (he remained {{under the}} conditions of his bail release in the Barker incident) so he could attend the Canterbury School in Connecticut. Half of the $39,900annual tuition was <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> Jena Six defense fund money. At Canterbury, Beard played on the basketball, baseball, and football teams and graduated in 2010. Beard attended Hofstra University in New York, where he earned an academic scholarship and played on the lacrosse team.|$|E

The insurers, a {{syndicate}} from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and slaves for up to £8,000, approximately half the slaves' potential market value. The remaining risk was borne by the owners.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|Lathrop House was {{the third}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory built {{on the campus of}} Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of the dorm was <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had been paid for by a gift from John D. Rockefeller.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was as {{conservative}} {{in matters of}} state as in those of religion, but implemented significant reforms to strengthen Austria's military and bureaucratic efficiency. She employed Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, who modernised the empire by creating a standing army of 108,000men, <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> 14million gulden extracted from each crown-land. The central government {{was responsible for the}} army, although Haugwitz instituted taxation of the nobility, who never before had to pay taxes. Maria Theresa oversaw the unification of the Austrian and Bohemian chancellories in May 1749.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} brought into use on 11 December 1971, {{although}} not officially opened until 1972. It cost 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to build, of which NOK23.5 million was <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> tolls, which were collected until 1983. When it opened, it was the longest suspension bridge in Norway, but is now the seventh longest. There exist {{plans to build a}} second bridge to either expand the road to four lanes, or carry a proposed extension of the Bergen Light Rail. Alternatively, a subsea tunnel could be built to carry a motorway.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> {{the issuance of}} promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|Trade {{items such}} as spice and silk had to be <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also {{produced}} glass in certain locations. Chinese-produced glassware {{date back to the}} Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD). In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering their chief enemies, the nomadic Xiongnu, than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the merchant class were frowned upon by the gentry who dominated the Han government.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler {{attempted}} to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, {{insisted on a}} tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments {{to the security of}} Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.|$|E
5|$|Like the Wii, the DSi {{can connect}} to an online store. The store, called the DSi Shop, {{allows users to}} {{download}} DSiWare games and applications, which are <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>with</b> a Nintendo Points Prepaid Card (previously known as Wii Points Prepaid Card). Application prices follow a three-tiered pricing scheme. The service launched with the DSi Browser, a free web browser developed by Opera Software and Nintendo. A DSiWare trial campaign, whose expiration date varied by region, formerly offered 1,000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop. As of June 2011, over 350 downloadable games were available, varying by region. Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo. Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS, however saved data cannot.|$|E

25|$|Sceptics {{of fiscal}} policy {{also make the}} {{argument}} of Ricardian equivalence.

Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from fiscal policy will be offset by the increased savings rate intended to pay for future higher taxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolutions of}} the {{founding}} convention of the Workers Alliance were presented at the White House by Lasser on March 4, 1935.
