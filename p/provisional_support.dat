40|$|Climate change {{adaptation}} {{demands a}} successful science–policy interface that {{can enhance the}} translation of climate scenarios to adaptation policies. However, experience shows {{it is difficult to}} implement this interface in practice, particularly at the regional/local scale. This paper considers the communities of practice theory in a new way, by examining two model cases to highlight areas of potential opportunities and contentions with the theory, and to understand how a successful science–policy interface in climate change adaptation projects could be envisioned as a community of practice. The assumption is that the social contexts in which these projects often exist could be established by the concepts of ‘communities of practice’, which defines activities in a social and historical context that gives structure to the engagement of participants. We compiled cases from open-ended survey and interactive research experience and observation, and inductively reflected on these vis-à-vis communities of practice. The model cases revealed challenges as well as potential opportunities for communities of practice, in that they exist within a middle space (social context) that could facilitate personal and professional relationship, promote formal and informal interactions, and are needed to negotiate different expertise and narrow apparent boundaries. We conclude that vigorous and dynamic communities of practice promise to nurture the social context in which participants in adaptation projects are potentially engaged, and thus provide a <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> to the science–policy interface...|$|E
40|$|The Indonesian reformation of 1998 {{marked a}} {{fundamental}} turning {{point of this}} country's democracy. In the administrative sector, the so-called Decentralisation Act 22 / 1999 was enacted to reform a formerly centralistic system. A strong central government used to maintain a hierarchical spatial planning system. It has been overruled, however, {{by the emergence of}} equally powered local governments. This paper discusses the relationship between Indonesian decentralisation and the phenomenon of fragmented local governments, which in turn has led to fragmented metropolitan transport planning. Transaction cost theory is utilised given the fact that, since decentralisation, comprehensive metropolitan transport planning relies much on inter-local governments' voluntary collaboration. The success of metropolitan transport planning collaboration is influenced by planning actors' perceived transaction cost. Through the application of Q-methodology in the case of Bandung Metropolitan Area, this article identifies four actors perception systems. These perception systems accentuate, consecutively, legalistic and cultural local government aspects, the strengthening of local government authority in land-use planning, the establishment of supra-regional institutions, and, finally, socio-economic and political aspects. Findings suggest a <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> among urban planners, politicians, administrators and legislators for decentralised local government in the field of transportation. However, a further establishment of formalised rules and practices of agreement making aimed at setting compliance and commitment will be essential.

40|$|Structural {{conception}} of bridges is strictly {{related to the}} construction methods involved.

During construction, static schemes and strength characteristics of the elements generally change. The connection of different structural elements in subsequent stages, the introduction of delayed restraints {{and the use of}} <b>provisional</b> <b>supports</b> modify the structural configuration. Such transient phases can influence significantly the final behaviour of the bridge. In such a way the designer, acting during the constructive stages, can force the structural scheme towards the solution that optimizes elements functionality.

The effects of additional restraints and support removal on the final solution are evaluated and discussed. The study permits characterizing the phenomena, to define possible simplifications, useful for developing simplified models in the hypothesis of linear viscoelasticity and homogeneous structures. These models allows the use of elastic solutions by means of the redistribution functions. A case study of an arch-portal bridge is presented.

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that {{delusional}} and delusion-prone individuals {{have a tendency}} to gather less data before forming beliefs. Most of the evidence for this "jumping to conclusions" (JTC) bias comes from studies using the "beads task" data-gathering paradigm. However, the evidence for the JTC bias is mixed. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of individual participant data from 38 clinical and nonclinical samples (n = 2, 237) to investigate the relationship between data gathering in the beads task (using the "draws to decision" measure) and delusional ideation (as indexed by the "Peters et al Delusions Inventory"; PDI). We found that delusional ideation is negatively associated with data gathering (r(s) = - 0. 10, 95 % CI [- 0. 17, - 0. 03]) and that there is heterogeneity in the estimated effect sizes (Q-stat P =. 03, I² = 33). Subgroup analysis revealed that the negative association is present when considering the 23 samples (n = 1, 754) from the large general population subgroup alone (r(s) = - 0. 10, 95 % CI [- 0. 18, - 0. 02]) but not when considering the 8 samples (n = 262) from the small current delusions subgroup alone (r(s) = - 0. 12, 95 % CI [- 0. 31, 0. 07]).

40|$|Background: Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is {{a debilitating}} syndrome {{that is often}} undiagnosed and undertreated. Population surveys show that persons with BD often self-medicate with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or integrative therapies in spite of limited research evidence supporting their use. To date, no review has focused specifically on nonconventional treatments of BD. Objectives: The study objectives were to present a review of nonconventional (complementary and integrative) interventions examined in clinical trials on BD, and to offer provisional guidelines for the judicious integrative use of CAM {{in the management of}} BD. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL,® Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for human clinical trials in English during mid- 2010 using Bipolar Disorder and CAM therapy and CAM medicine search terms. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were also calculated where data were available. Results: Several positive high-quality studies on nutrients in combination with conventional mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications in BD depression were identified, while branched-chain amino acids and magnesium were effective (small studies) in attenuating mania in BD. In the treatment of bipolar depression, evidence was mixed regarding omega- 3, while isolated studies provide <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> for a multinutrient formula, n-acetylcysteine, and l-tryptophan. In one study, acupuncture was found to have favorable but nonsignificant effects on mania and depression outcomes. Conclusions: Current evidence supports the integrative treatment of BD using combinations of mood stabilizers and select nutrients. Other CAM or integrative modalities used to treat BD have not been adequately explored to date; however, some early findings are promising. Select CAM and integrative interventions add to established conventional treatment of BD and may be considered when formulating a treatment plan. It is hoped that the safety issues and clinical considerations addressed in this article may encourage the practice of safety-conscious and evidence-based integrative management of BD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Children {{with cancer}} and their {{families}} are frequently confronted with physical and psychosocial late effects resulting from cancer. In recent years, this has been expanded to include posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, to date very little research has been completed in the UK to investigate these symptoms. Furthermore, previous research has been limited by lack of adherence to mainstream theoretical accounts of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, the current study examined rates of PTSS in children with cancer and their siblings. Secondly, it investigated whether aspects of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model of PTSD could provide a useful framework for understanding the phenomenon in this population. Methods: A cross-sectional between-groups design was employed to examine the differences in levels of PTSS between children who had been diagnosed with and/or treated for cancer (n = 34) and siblings (n = 26). Participants were aged between 8 - 18 years. Self-report measures of PTSS, maladaptive appraisals, traumacentred identity, thought suppression, perceived social support and family functioning were completed. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} children with cancer and siblings on measures of PTSS. In support of the hypotheses, maladaptive appraisals, thought suppression and trauma-centred identity were found to significantly correlate with levels of PTSS for both children with cancer and siblings. Perceived social support was found to be significantly correlated with levels of PTSS for siblings only. Contrary to the hypothesis, family functioning was not related to PTSS for either the patient or sibling group. Conclusions: Results failed to evidence differences in levels of PTSS between children with cancer and their siblings. However, <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> was found for aspects of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD in explaining PTSS for the current population...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal affective {{disorder}} (SAD) is {{a variant}} of recurrent depression in which episodes are linked to a particular season, typically winter. SAD is understood as the extreme end of a continuum of seasonality in the general population. Photoperiod (the timing and duration of daylight) has been assumed to be aetiologically critical. The present research used a survey design to investigate the assumed centrality of photoperiod for SAD/seasonality in Australia. Two hypotheses were tested: that self-reported seasonality does not increase further from the equator and that seasonality does not stand alone from non-seasonal neurotic complaints. The sampling frame used was adult females on the Australian Twin Registry roll. A sample of 526 women residing across the latitudes of Australia responded to a survey based around the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). The SPAQ asks respondents to retrospectively report on season-related changes in mood and behaviour. The survey also contained three questionnaire measures of neurotic symptoms of anxiety and depression: the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Community Epidemiological Survey for Depression (CES-D) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T). Self-reported seasonality did not correlated with latitude (r = 0. 01, NS). On the other hand, a substantial relationship was found between seasonality {{and each of the}} measures of non-seasonal complaints: GHQ (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 001); CES-D (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 001); and STAI-T (r = 0. 30, p < 0. 001). Within the limitations of a design based on retrospective self-report, the findings of the present study suggest that the diathesis for SAD/seasonality may not be photoperiod-specific. At least in Australia, there is <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> for the proposal that human seasonality may have a broader psychological component. The findings are discussed in terms of established research into normal mood, trait personality and non-seasonal depression...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to examine {{cognitive}} and parenting factors involved in the development and maintenance of social anxiety in adolescents. Cognitive factors comprised interpretational biases of ambiguous social situations and mildly social scenarios. Interpretative biases are assumed {{to play a major role}} in maintaining social anxiety. Socially anxious adults interpret ambiguous social events negatively and interpret negative social events in a catastrophic fashion. However, there is little research to support the extension of this theory to adolescents. Parenting factors comprised parenting rearing styles examining dimensions of over-protection, emotional warmth and rejection and parental discipline styles examining dimensions of verbosity, laxity and overreactivity. Past research has indicated a link between child anxiety and parental styles that are characterised by control and rejection, however, these studies have largely been retrospective and few have specifically examined social anxiety. The current study was a prospective crosssectional study with a sample of 78 adolescent pupils aged 12 - 14 years. The relationships between cognitive factors andÃ‚Â· parenting factors in relation to social anxiety were examined individually. The planned mediation analysis regarding the role of cognitive factors in the relationship between parenting factors and social anxiety in adolescents was not undertaken due to limited significant associations between the variables. Although only a trend was found suggesting that social anxiety in adolescents was associated with a tendency to generate negative interpretations of ambiguous social situations, a strong association was found between social anxiety and a tendency to endorse catastrophic responses to mildly negative social events. The results provided <b>provisional</b> <b>support</b> for the applicability of adult cognitive theories of social anxiety to adolescents. Social anxiety was associated with negative parental rearing styles and with negative discipline styles overall. It was found to be specifically linked with a rejecting parenting style. Support for associations between parenting and cognitive factors was not found, except for a relationship between the dimension verbosity and self-responsibility for negative social situations, such that children who rated high levels of verbosity in their parents showed a tendency to indicate that they would feel responsible for mildly negative social situations.
