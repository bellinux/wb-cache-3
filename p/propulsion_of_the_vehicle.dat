40|$|The {{development}} of an energy efficient air conditioning system for electric vehicles is an ever increasing challenge, because the cooling {{as well as the}} heating of the passenger cell reduces the cruising range dramatically. Almost always the compressor of the air conditioning system in electric cars is a scroll compressor with a separate electric motor and appropriate power electronics. However, this solution is critical in terms of the installation space, the weight and also the costs. Therefore, IAV develops innovative and energy efficient drivetrain structures for electric vehicles, which integrate the motor of the air conditioning compressor directly into the drivetrain of the vehicle. Thus it is possible to switch off the compressor motor and to use the main motor for the propulsion of the air conditioning compressor at certain driving situations. As a result the operating point of the main motor can be shifted to a better efficiency. This leads to a reduced power loss and an enhanced cruising range. In addition the compressor motor can be used for the <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> too, if the efficiency of the compressor motor is higher than the efficiency of the main motor, e. g. at urban traffic. Thereby the efficiency and the cruising range of the vehicle can be increased. This contribution presents a new powertrain concept which realizes the above-mentioned mechanical coupling of the main motor and the compressor motor. Moreover, the developed simulation models for the air conditioning system, the passenger cell and the drivetrain of electric vehicles are introduced. These models were used to compare an electric vehicle equipped with the new powertrain concept with a common electric car with a separate scroll compressor.

Pure organic fluids were found to present numerous problems, including their low thermal stability, safety issues and in case of most organic refrigerants the potential to increase global warming. Another key challenge in the development of Rankine cycle systems for vehicles relates to the design of suitable expansion devices. Two expander types are considered suitable for vehicular systems: turbo expanders and displacement expanders. In order to establish a method for determining which type will offer the greatest efficiency in any given case, an analysis based on dimensionless numbers was performed. Displacement expanders were found to have favorable performance characteristics in situations involving high expansion pressure ratios and low flow rates; such conditions tend to increase the thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. On the other hand, turbo expanders can be made more compact than displacement expanders and may therefore be more suitable in cases where space is at a premium. Moreover, by using a pure organic working fluid instead of the suggested water-alcohol mixture and decreasing the expansion pressure ratio, the cycle parameters can be adjusted to permit the efficient operation of turbo expanders. Based on the above analyses of the system’s components, a model heat recovery system was created using the GT-Suite 1 -D flow simulation program. This model can be used in conjunction with a previously established model of a heavy-duty diesel engine created using the same software, which was in this work converted to mean-value model in order to permit faster computation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Primary Factors that Impact the Fuel Consumption of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles RICHARD ‘BARNEY’ CARLSON, MATTHEW G. SHIRK Idaho National Laboratory 2525 N. Fremont Ave., Idaho Falls, ID 83415, USA richard. carlson@inl. gov Abstract Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) {{have proven}} to {{significantly}} reduce petroleum consumption as compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) by utilizing electrical energy for propulsion. Through extensive testing of PHEV’s, analysis {{has shown that the}} fuel consumption of PHEV’s is more significantly affected than conventional vehicles by either the driver’s input or by the environmental inputs around the vehicle. Six primary factors have been identified that significantly affect the fuel consumption of PHEV’s. In this paper, these primary factors are analyzed from on-road driving and charging data from over 200 PHEV’s throughout North America that include Hymotion Prius conversions and Hybrids Plus Escape conversions. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) tests plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) vehicles as part of its conduct of DOE’s Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity (AVTA). In collaboration with its 75 testing partners located in 23 states and Canada, INL has collected data on 191 PHEVs, comprised of 12 different PHEV models (by battery manufacturer). With more than 1 million PHEV test miles accumulated to date, the PHEVs are fleet, track, and dynamometer tested. Six Primary Factors The six primary factors that significantly impact PHEV fuel consumption are listed below. Some of the factors are unique to plug-in vehicles while others are common for all types of vehicles. 1. Usable Electrical Energy is dictated by battery capacity, rate of depletion as well as when the vehicle was last plugged-in. With less electrical energy available the powertrain must use more petroleum to generate the required power output. 2. Driver Aggressiveness impacts the fuel consumption of nearly all vehicles but this impact is greater for high efficiency powertrains. 3. Accessory Utilization like air conditioner systems or defroster systems can use a significant amount of additional energy that is not contributing to the <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> 4. Route Type such as city, highway or mountainous driving can affect the fuel consumption since it can involve stop and go driving or ascending a step grade. 5. Cold Start / Key On includes control strategies to improve cold start emissions as well as control routines to quickly supply cabin heat. These control strategies are necessary for consumer acceptance even though fuel consumption is negatively impacted. 6. Ambient Temperature can reduce the efficiency of many powertrain components by significantly increasing fluid viscosity. For vehicles that utilize battery energy storage systems, the temperature of the battery system can greatly affect the power output capability therefore reducing its system effectiveness. The analysis of the six primary factors that impact fuel economy of PHEV’s helped to identify areas of potential further development as well as may assist in informing drivers of these effects in an effort to modify driving behavior to reduce petroleum consumption...|$|E

A multitude of solutions have been proposed to integrate the charger using the already existing equipment, which normally serves <b>the</b> <b>propulsion</b> operating mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> However, only a few <b>of</b> them have <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> torque-free fast charging that is accomplished without any hardware reconfiguration. <b>The</b> primary aim <b>of</b> these integrated on-board chargers is to provide fast charging by enabling connection to a three-phase grid. These structures also enable slower charging by connection to a single-phase grid. This paper examines single-phase charging capabilities of an integrated charger using a nine-phase machine. The charger does not require any reconfiguration or additional elements other than those used in propulsion mode {{and it does not}} produce torque during the charging. Additionally, the charger can provide energy recuperation to the grid. The operating principle relies on additional degrees of freedom of multiphase machines, to draw currents through non-flux and non-torque producing planes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machines...|$|R
40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{emerging}} research topics in <b>the</b> <b>propulsion</b> drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> is <b>the</b> improvement in <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> its component parts, namely, the propulsion motor {{and the associated}} inverter. This paper is focused on <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inverter and analyzes the improvement that follows from <b>the</b> replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silicon (Si) IGBT devices with silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. To this end, the paper starts by deriving <b>the</b> voltage-current solicitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inverter over the working torque-speed plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propulsion</b> motor. Then, a proper model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power losses in the inverter over a supply period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motor is formulated for <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> device, including <b>the</b> integrated freewheeling diode. By putting together the voltage-current solicitations and the device power losses, <b>the</b> efficiency maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Si IGBT and SiC MOSFET inverters are calculated and compared over the torque-speed plane. The results for the Si IGBT inverter are supported by measurements executed on a marketed C-segment compact electric car, while the SiC MOSFET loss model is validated by an on-purpose built test bench. Finally, <b>the</b> overall efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propulsion</b> drive is calculated by accounting for the motor efficiency. Main outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper is a quantitative evaluation <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> improvement in the efficiency achievable with the SiC MOSFETs and the ensuing increase in the electric car range...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{global warming}} due to fossil fuel usage, {{increasing}} diesel price {{and efforts to}} improve urban air quality increase {{the need for new}} vehicle technologies. Hybrid electric <b>vehicles</b> have <b>the</b> potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions related to engine combustion. In this thesis, a hybrid electric vehicle concept (HEV) is compared to a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle concept (PHEV) for a city bus application. The difference between a HEV and a PHEV is that the latter can be charged from the electricity grid. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is to evaluate impact on total life-cycle-cost and total emissions when a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traction power is provided by an electric motor instead of a diesel engine. Three scenarios regarding the EU energy market are established, reflecting present day and possible future developments until 2015. The scenarios are used to investigate the total life-cycle-cost and total emissions impact of different marginal electricity generation technologies and energy prices. Optimisation calculations of different powertrain configurations are carried out using the computer tool THEPS. Costs and emissions from vehicle operation and power plant electricity generation are then compiled. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project indicate {{that it is possible to}} achieve diesel fuel savings between 14 and 57 % for a PHEV compared to a HEV. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> savings depends on type and properties of powertrain components and length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure electric <b>propulsion</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> drive cycle. Life cycle costs can potentially be decreased by 5 - 6 % and total CO 2 -emissions by 18 %. In order to decrease PHEV life cycle cost, a certain minimum fraction <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> in all-electric-drive mode is required. For the life cycle cost advantage compared to HEVs to increase further, the diesel price must be high and energy buffers’ (e. g. batteries) cycling sensitivity, energy density and cost must be improved. Emissions from vehicle operation are generally lower for PHEVs compared to HEVs, giving PHEVs potential to reduce local emissions. However, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> marginal electricity generation technology used to provide the external electricity for buffer charging has significant impact on total emissions...|$|R

Two studies which were recently carried out by the Fraunhofer-Institute for Systems Technology and Innovation Research (ISI) for Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia serve as a basis. In addition, policy approaches and selected regional initiatives are described concisely. Which type of (automobile) region can profit from <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> fuel-cell <b>propulsion</b> technologies possibly depends on <b>the</b> dynamic force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. A gradual introduction could favour regions which accommodate product experts who develop their profiles as outside suppliers step by step an initially with a smaller output. A more dynamic introduction process is likely to indicate shifts in added value earlier and prompt previous agents to define and develop core competence of supply potentials in the fuel cell system consciously, in order to secure their own share in the added value. In any case, however, the issue is innovation - and not industrial policy for future regions of crisis. Regional policy must position itself in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> tension between <b>the</b> pilot function <b>of</b> regions and <b>the</b> attainment <b>of</b> critical masses, in order to overcome the still numerous problems in <b>the</b> commercial use <b>of</b> fuel-cell technology.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Increasing {{environmental}} concerns {{as well as}} economic and social impacts of transportation in communities necessitate <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> sustainability into <b>the</b> planning process. The common approach for sustainability assessment in transportation considers only personal vehicles or all modes present on a section of a network using aggregate measures <b>of</b> performance. <b>The</b> accelerated development and introduction of vehicles with alternative propulsion systems compel a detailed breakdown of vehicle components and characteristics for <b>the</b> proper understanding <b>of</b> their sustainability performance and impacts over their entire life cycle. This study develops a long-term sustainability-based comprehensive framework for the life cycle assessment of any urban transportation mode. In developing a life cycle sustainability framework (LCSF), the generic structure components of a transportation system and the restrictions that may be faced in its development and implementation are considered. LCSF consists of seven fundamental dimensions that govern transportation systems: (1) Environment; (2) Technology; (3) Energy; (4) Economy, (5) Users and other stakeholders, (6) Legal framework, and (7) Local restrictions. LCSF is used to assess <b>the</b> sustainability performance <b>of</b> 11 vehicles with a variety <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> technology. <b>The</b> <b>vehicles</b> are ranked based on their performance per sustainability dimension, and overall sustainability. Gasoline pickup truck (GTP) and gasoline SUV are the most energy demanding vehicles. Hybrid electric are the least energy demanding vehicle per vehicle mile traveled over its life cycle, with 44 % lower energy requirements than an internal combustion engine vehicle. Car Share and BRT have the lower energy consumption per passenger mile traveled (PMT). Vehicle-specific results were combined in a tool to perform a sustainability assessment of Atlanta, Chicago and OPTIMUS [...] a hypothetical metropolitan area with superior transportation sustainability elements. Normalized indicators per metropolitan area are aggregated into a sustainability dimension index (SDI) and an overall sustainability index (OSI). Both SDI and OSI are used to reveal dimension specific and overall sustainability tradeoffs for each alternative when different characteristics, policies, scenarios and assumptions are used. The sustainability LCSF with its proposed indicators provides a workable method both for sustainability assessment in transportation planning and for facilitating policy analysis and decision-making...|$|R
