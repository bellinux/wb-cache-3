40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system for}} interactively acquiring depth for an image-based representation consisting of a single input image. We use layers of images with depth to represent the scene. Unlike traditional 3 D modeling and rendering systems that require precise information that are usually difficult to model and manipulate, our system's emphasis is on ease of use, comprehensiveness, and use of potentially crude depth information. Depth is extracted by the user through intuitive, interactive tools using the powerful notion of selection. Once a set of pixels is selected, the user can assign depth by painting and chiseling, using shape from shading, applying filters, aligning and extracting shape from geometry primitives, or using level set methods. The ground <b>plane</b> <b>tool</b> provides an intuitive depth reference for all other tools and serves as an initial step in depth specification. Our system is based on pixels and selections, and therefore does not impose any restriction on the scene geometry. Our system allows the user to interactively perform high quality editing operations on SGI 02 s and Octanes. We demonstrate the application of our system in the architectural design (relighting, sketching, 3 D walkthroughs from images), complex photocompositing, and fine art exploration contexts. by Max Chen.

40|$|The use {{of shape}} as a cue for {{indexing}} into pictorial databases has been traditionally based on global invariant statistics and deformable templates, {{on the one}} hand, and local edge correlation on the other. This paper proposes an intermediate approach based on a characterization of the symmetry in edge maps. The use of symmetry matching as a joint correlation measure between pairs of edge elements further constrains the comparison of edge maps. In addition, a natural organization of groups of symmetry into a hierarchy leads to a graph-based representation of relational structure of components of shape that allows for deformations by changing attributes of this relational graph. A graduate assignment graph matching algorithm is used to match symmetry structure in images to stored prototypes or sketches. The results of matching sketches and grey-scale images against a small database consisting {{of a variety of}} fish, <b>planes,</b> <b>tools,</b> etc., are depicted...|$|R

40|$|Hot forging process {{currently}} {{requires a}} succession of preforming operations to target the final form. The shape of each preform is based on how the workpiece material must be distributed for most effective forging in the next impression. The number of preform impressions {{is difficult to determine}} for forgings characterized by irregular shape and a length somewhat greater than the other dimensions. The manufacturing of the forging tools and their adjustment, is most cases a result from forger’s experience and from a series of experiments. These tools development will affect the time to manufacturing and the profitability of the manufacturing. Thanks to the finite element method and prediction of the material constitutive laws, these expensive operations can be reduced extensively by adding results of a numerical approach to the forger experience. However, finite element modeling of the hot forging process constitutes complex computations that require the knowledge of different process characteristics and accurate numerical methods. This paper presents a virtual manufacturing of an industrial workpiece (from the FCC-MSI 5 company) performed with Morfeo. This new code is specially dedicated to the simulation of material forming processes and is currently developed within Cenaero. Morfeo has been enhanced with special features in order to simulate the forging process. The forging process is carried out in two steps: • the forming of cylindrical billet by crushing a cylindrical slab between two <b>plane</b> <b>tools</b> on a mechanical press. • the final workpiece forming with a hammer. Three to four punches may be done to obtain the final part. Keywords—Forging simulation, virtual manufacturing, hot forging, finite element. I...|$|R
