6000|$|Mr. Osborne was {{the godfather}} of young Master Todd (who in {{subsequent}} life wrote Mr. Osborne Todd on his cards and became a man of decided fashion), while Miss Osborne had accompanied Miss Maria Todd to the font, and gave her protegee a prayer-book, a collection of tracts, a volume of very low church poetry, or some such memento of her goodness every year. Miss O. drove the Todds out in her carriage now and then; when they were ill, her footman, in large plush smalls and waistcoat, brought jellies and delicacies from Russell Square to Coram Street. Coram Street trembled and looked up to Russell Square indeed, and Mrs. Todd, who had a pretty hand at cutting out <b>paper</b> <b>trimmings</b> for haunches of mutton, and could make flowers, ducks, &c., out of turnips and carrots in a very creditable manner, would go to [...] "the Square," [...] as it was called, and assist in the preparations incident to a great dinner, without even so much as thinking of sitting down to the banquet. If any guest failed at the eleventh hour, Todd was asked to dine. Mrs. Todd and Maria came across in the evening, slipped in with a muffled knock, and were in the drawing-room by the time Miss Osborne and the ladies under her convoy reached that apartment--and ready to fire off duets and sing until the gentlemen came up. Poor Maria Todd; poor young lady! How she had to work and thrum at these duets and sonatas in the Street, before they appeared in public in the Square! ...|$|E
50|$|Now in San Gregorio {{town the}} feast begins {{a day before}} with The Candelaria Virgin vigil. The church is {{decorated}} with <b>paper</b> <b>trimmings</b> and purple color flowers. The Virgin is never in the church, except the 1st and 2 February. She is always {{in a house in}} the town. Any family can ask for Her, and She is given for a year to them, as well as the church's Child.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of paper {{that can be used}} as feedstocks for making recycled paper: mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste. Mill broke is <b>paper</b> <b>trimmings</b> and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled internally in a paper mill. Pre-consumer waste is material that was discarded before it was ready for consumer use. Post-consumer waste is material discarded after consumer use such as old magazines, old telephone directories, and residential mixed paper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mandatory}} ordinance represents further {{investment in}} recycling infrastructure and in San Francisco's goal of zero waste. It {{has provided the}} leverage of law and participation rates have increased as a result. Since the mandatory ordinance went into effect, [...] "composting has increased by 45 percent, and the City is now sending nearly 600 tons of food scraps, soiled <b>paper,</b> and yard <b>trimmings</b> to Recology's compost facilities daily, up from 400 tons a year ago." [...] In August 2010, San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, announced the city's diversion rate had reached 77 percent.|$|R
40|$|In 2009, {{food waste}} in the United States {{comprised}} 14. 1 % of municipal solid waste, the third largest category after <b>paper</b> and yard <b>trimmings.</b> With food scraps and other organics dominating {{a large portion of}} the waste stream, cities across the United States and Canada are slowly adopting organics diversion programs as they learn of the feasibility and paybacks of these programs on a municipal scale. The first part of this capstone examines existing trends in the development and execution of organics programs, including a few precedent examples, as well as techniques to motivate participation among residents. The second portion of this capstone explores the benefits and drawbacks of three viable organics recycling scenarios currently available to municipalities. These options include: increasing the use of food waste disposers in kitchens, developing a community-based network of composting sites, and implementing a city-wide curbside collection program. While these programs can be applied to any city, the third portion of this capstone looks at data specific to Philadelphia because Greenworks Philadelphia, the city’s comprehensive sustainability plan, includes a goal to divert 70 % of solid waste from landfills by 2015. In the end, these organics recycling options are all feasible within Philadelphia, or any municipality, and this capstone provides the foundation for a city to make an educated decision as to which program would best fit the needs of its residents...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{an overview of}} landfilling as a waste management strategy {{in relation to the}} development of material-specific emission factors for EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Estimates of the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfilling most of the materials considered in WARM and several categories of mixed waste streams (e. g., mixed paper, mixed recyclables and mixed municipal solid waste (MSW)) are included in the chapter. 1. A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF LANDFILLING When food scraps, yard <b>trimmings,</b> <b>paper</b> and wood are landfilled, anaerobic bacteria degrade the materials, producing methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). CH 4 is counted as an anthropogenic GHG because, even if it is derived from sustainably harvested biogenic sources, degradation would not result in CH 4 emissions if not for deposition in landfills. The CO 2 is not counted as a GHG because is it considered part of the natural carbon cycle of growth and decomposition; for more information, see the text box on biogenic carbon in the Introduction & Background chapter. The other materials in WARM either do not contain carbon or do not biodegrade measurably in anaerobic conditions, and therefore do not generate any CH 4. In addition to carbon emissions, some of the carbon in these materials (i. e., food scraps, yar...|$|R

Mill broke is <b>paper</b> <b>trimmings</b> and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled in a paper mill. Pre-consumer waste is material which left the paper mill but was discarded before it was ready for consumer use. Post-consumer waste is material discarded after consumer use, such as old corrugated containers (OCC), old magazines, and newspapers. Paper suitable for recycling is called [...] "scrap paper", often used to produce molded pulp packaging. The industrial process of removing printing ink from paperfibers of recycled paper to make deinked pulp is called deinking, an invention of the German jurist Justus Claproth.|$|E
