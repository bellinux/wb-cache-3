40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build new {{contracts}} theories of SaaS service supply chain. Software as a Service (SaaS) has become a hot topic in this industry. Compared with traditional manufacturing supply chain and general service supply chain, the new IT service supply chain which based on SaaS has characteristics of both service and IT. And SaaS is completely different from traditional software package model. Therefore the classic contracts, which be widely used in traditional manufacturing supply chain, can’t be directly applied in SaaS service supply chain. The necessary way of IT services developing is to study the SaaS service supply chain combining with characteristics of SaaS. Therefore, It focuses on the coordination of SaaS service supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: It tries to answer the following question: how do the ISV motivate SaaS operators to improve the service level through effective contracts mechanism under conditions of asymmetric information. In order to answer these questions, this paper does some researches including: Under the conditions of information asymmetry, supposing the service level (is related to the degree of effort) of SaaS operator was private information, we construct model of compensation contract, i. e., to motivate SaaS operator to improve service level through transfer <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> price. - 1174 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|E

40|$|The {{power of}} {{compulsory}} acquisition {{has always been}} an important aspect in the acquisition of land for public purposes in the history of PNG. The Power, however, was abused during the colonial era by virtue of the fact that too many occuppied lands were acquired by the Colonial Administration. These acquisitions led first, to shortage of land {{in many parts of the}} country and second, domination of Papua New Guinea's economy by foreigners, especially plantation economy. The successive post - Independence Governments of PNG have adopted an overall policy to redress the situation by acquiring foreign owned lands and redistributing them to nationals for subsistence farming or economic development so that they may participate in the economic development of the country. This work examines the law relating to compulsory acquisition of land in PNG. In particular it examines the policies, laws and practices aimed at compulsory acquisition. of land and their effects on the landowners. The work also proposes reforms to the laws relating to compulsory acquisition of land in PNG. The thesis proposes several reforms to the law relating to compulsory acquisition of land in th,e country. 1. That the power of compulsory acquisition in PNG continue as it is essential to acquire lands the Government needs for development purposes in the interest of the greater national community. However, an amendment to the provisions of the Land Act is necessary to introduce a system of H compulsory lease " to replace the current system of compulsory acquisition. 2. That the <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to the dispossessed citizen owner, especially an automatic citizen, should be over and above the market value of the land compulsorily acquired to reflect the extra market values or non - economic values that Papua New Guineans often attached to their land. However, the situation regarding <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to remedy grievances caused by colonial land acquisitions requires urgent review as there appears to be no proper guidelines for such payments and it has proved to be unnecessarily costly to the nation. That the payment of compensation to the dispossessed non - citizen owner should be less thanthe concept of the market value of the land. The Government should pay the dispossessed non - citizen landowner compensation based on what it considers just. 3. The imposition of two months time - limit under the present Land Act within which landowners are required to respond to a notice to treat is unrealistic and should be extended to six months as most of the customary landowners are still in the remote rural areas with poor communication and transportation systems. However, provisions be inserted in the Land Act to establish a minimum time - limit within which the Government must complete the compuslory acquisition once a notice to treat has been issued. The absence of such a time - limit could cause injustice to the landowners as months or years may elapse before the procedure for the acquisition is effected...|$|E
40|$|Background People {{who claim}} {{compensation}} after {{a motor vehicle}} accident do not recover {{as well as people}} with similar injuries who do not claim compensation. It has been suggested that this impeded recovery is caused by the stressful compensation process and the adversarial attitude of professionals. However, this theory has not been well investigated. The aim of the current study is twofold. The first is to investigate whether dissatisfaction with the insurance agency is associated with anxiety. The second is to explore what is causing dissatisfaction with the insurance company. Methods Participants (n = 417) were injured people involved in a traffic accident compensation scheme in New South Wales, Australia. The predictors of interest were (among others) dissatisfaction with the insurance company and catastrophizing. Outcome measures were (1) the anxiety/depression subscale of the EuroQol, and (2) comments explaining dissatisfaction with the insurance company. Interviews were conducted by phone at 2, 12 and 24 months after injury. The associations between predictors and anxiety were analysed using stepwise logistic regression analyses. The comments about dissatisfaction with the insurance company were analysed qualitatively by a cyclic process of open, axial and selective coding. Results The strongest association with anxiety was catastrophizing (AOR, 11. 75 [95 % CI, 4. 97 - 27. 78]; p <. 001). Dissatisfaction with the insurance company was associated with more anxiety (AOR, 2. 67 [95 % CI, 1. 37 - 5. 20]; p =. 004). Dissatisfaction was attributed to (1) lack of communication and lack of information, (2) delayed or denied <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation,</b> (3) slow treatment approval and discussions about causality, (4) too much complicated paperwork, and (5) discussions about who was at-fault. Conclusions As catastrophizing was the strongest predictor, this study suggests that injured people might best be helped by enrolling in psychological interventions aiming at tackling negative cognitions. There is also a role for claim managers who could adopt a more pro-active attitude in claims settlement...|$|E
40|$|Background: Motor vehicle crashes (MVC) are {{associated}} with diminished mental health, and furthermore, evidence suggests the process of claiming compensation following an MVC further increases distress and impedes recovery. However, further research is required on why the compensation process is stressful. The aim {{of the current study}} is twofold. The first is to investigate whether the interaction with the insurance agency is associated with anxiety. The second is to explore qualitatively aspects of dissatisfaction with the compensation process. Methods: Participants (N = 417) were injured people involved in a compensation scheme after a motor vehicle crash (MVC) in New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were conducted by phone at 2, 12 and 24 months after the MVC. A suite of measures were used including compensation related measures, pain catastrophising and the anxiety/depressed mood subscale of the EuroQol. The association between predictors and anxiety/depressed mood as the dependent variable were analysed using forward logistic regression analyses. The comments about dissatisfaction with the insurance company were analysed qualitatively. Results: The strongest predictor of mood status found was pain-related catastrophising, followed by dissatisfaction with the insurance company. Dissatisfaction was attributed to (1) lack of communication and lack of information, (2) delayed or denied <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation,</b> (3) slow treatment approval and discussions about causality, (4) too much complicated paperwork, and (5) discussions about who was at-fault. Conclusions: Factors were found that contribute to anxiety in the compensation process. The association between catastrophising and anxiety/depressive mood suggests it is worthwhile further investigating the role of negative cognitions in compensation processes. People who score highly on catastrophising after the MVC may benefit from early psychological interventions aiming at addressing negative cognitions. Another important stressor is the interaction with the insurance company. Stress is associated with problems of communication, medical treatment, and claim settlement. This study additionally draws attention to some under recognised problems such as delayed payments. Pro-active claims management could address some of the identified issues, which could improve health of injured people after a MVC...|$|E

Findings and Originality/value: The study finds out that when ISV get to “positive feedback”, instead of the traditional market equilibrium, compensation contract (linear) can coordinate satisfactorily the SaaS service supply chain. In the point of “positive feedback”, the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost, but it is not the equilibrium of ISV’profit-maximization. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in this research. In the linear compensation contracts, the compensation price is fixed value. If in the contract, we can create a change value which is related to the sales volume of service, the coordination efficiency of compensation will be increased. And in the future, the nonlinear compensation contracts should be researched. Practical implications: In the practical implication, it will promote the development of study and practice of SaaS and IT service industry. And it is beneficial to ISV, platform operators and customers. Originality/value: From the theoretical perspective, this paper put forward some new contracts and motivating mechanism for effective coordination of SaaS service supply chain and the conclusion will enrich content of service supply chain theory system. In theory, it has more significance for further researching on SaaS and service supply chain.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 A {{plethora of}} land use {{policies}} are implemented at the local, state, and federal levels to influence {{the manner in which}} land is utilized. The distribution of the costs and benefits associated with implementing such land use policies always has been, and will continue to be, a source of contention. The three essays presented in this dissertation explore two types {{of land use}} policies: state and local-level land use regulations that restrict the use of land and incentives for voluntary conservation. The first essay addresses the economic issues that arise from the adoption of state-level compensation legislation, which requires a government entity to pay compensation to a property owner when the value of his property has been reduced by the enactment of a land use regulation. An assumption implicit to the idea of compensation is that effect of a land use regulation on a property's value is observable and can be accurately estimated. This assumption is problematic due to the complex interaction of land use regulations and land use decisions, and the market's anticipation of both future regulation and potential <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> Supposing that the price effects of regulation could be accurately estimated, the scope of compensation statutes is too narrow to consistently identify and appropriately compensate landowners who have been most heavily burdened by land use regulation. Economists investigating the effect of land use regulation on property value have typically estimated hedonic property value models with regulations included as exogenous regressors. This approach is likely to be invalid if parcel characteristics that determine property values also influence the government's decision about how to implement regulations. The second essay uses Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to study the effect of the Portland, Oregon, Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) on property values. RDD provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect under relatively mild conditions and is well-suited to our application because the UGB defines a sharp treatment threshold. We find a price differential on the western and southern sides of the Portland metropolitan area ranging from 30, 000 to at least 140, 000, but no price differential on the eastern side. Voter support for Measure 37, a compensation statute approved by Oregon voters in 2004, was fueled by price differences such as these among parcels subject to different regulations, but one must be careful not to view current price differentials as evidence that regulations have reduced property values. The third essay considers an incentive mechanism designed to encourage spatially coordinated land conservation: the agglomeration bonus. The primary weakness of the agglomeration bonus as it has been represented in the literature is that it requires landowners to coordinate land use decisions amongst each other, potentially resulting in coordination failure. The functionality of the agglomeration bonus is improved by allowing landowners' enrollment decisions to be conditional on surrounding patterns of enrollment. Under a conditional agglomeration bonus, a landowner's enrollment decision is determined entirely by his own private costs and benefits, eliminating the potential for coordination failure...|$|E
