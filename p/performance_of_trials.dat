40|$|Mortality in National Heart, Lung and Blood Instituteâ€“sponsored {{clinical}} trials of treatments for acute lung injury (ALI) has decreased dramatically {{during the past}} two decades. As a consequence, design of such trials based on a mortality outcome requires ever-increasing numbers of patients. Recognizing that advances in clinical trial design might be applicable to these trials and might allow trials with fewer patients, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute convened a workshop of extramural experts from several disciplines. The workshop assessed the current state of clinical research addressing ALI, identified research needs, and recommended: (1) continued <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> evaluating treatments of patients with ALI; (2) development of strategies to perform ALI prevention trials; (3) observational studies of patients without ALI undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation; and (4) development of a standardized format for reporting methods, endpoints, and results of ALI trials...|$|E
40|$|Gallbladder cancer (GC) is {{considered}} a rare disease associated with a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, the low number of cases makes the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> addressing the role of adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and/or palliative therapy difficult. For a long time, the majority of trials were 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) -based, and results were uniformly poor. Since the introduction of Gemcitabine, response rates of approximately 30 % have been observed {{through the use of}} this drug and new approaches have been tested. In this sense, drugs such as Cisplatin and Capecitabine have been employed concurrently with gemicitabine and/or radiation. Since a recurrence pattern is both distant and local, chemoradiation seems a logical option to deal with the disease. However, at the present time, the lack of valid and scientific evidence means that most of the recommendations originate from trials dealing with other tumors, such as pancreas cancer and biliary tract cancer (BTC). The aforementioned treatment alternatives Warrant further evaluation focusing on GC...|$|E
40|$|Response variability, as {{measured}} by fluctuating responses upon repeated <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trials,</b> is {{a major component of}} neural responses, and its characterization is key to interpret high dimensional population recordings. Response variability and covariability display predictable changes upon changes in stimulus and cognitive or behavioral state, providing an opportunity to test the predictive power of models of neural variability. Still, there is little agreement on which model to use as a building block for population-level analyses, and models of variability are often treated as a subject of choice. We investigate two competing models, the Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model assuming stochasticity at spike generation, and the Rectified Gaussian (RG) model that traces variability back to membrane potential variance, to analyze stimulus-dependent modulation of response statistics. Using a model of a pair of neurons, we demonstrate that the two models predict similar single-cell statistics. However, DSP and RG models have contradicting predictions on the joint statistics of spiking responses. In order to test the models against data, we build a population model to simulate stimulus change-related modulations in response statistics. We use unit recordings from the primary visual cortex of monkeys to show that while model predictions for variance are qualitatively similar to experimental data, only the RG model's predictions are compatible with joint statistics. These results suggest that models using Poisson-like variability might fail to capture important properties of response statistics. We argue that membrane potential-level modelling of stochasticity provides an efficient strategy to model correlations...|$|E
