5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you <b>put</b> <b>another</b> layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to <b>put</b> <b>another</b> (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
5|$|Minutes later Alavés {{made the}} first {{substitution}} of the match when Iván Alonso replaced defender Dan Eggen. The change had the desired effect as four minutes later, Alavés scored. Right wing-back Cosmin Contra put {{the ball into the}} area form {{the right side of the}} pitch and Alonso rose above Babbel to head the ball into the net to make the scoreline 2–1. Immediately afterwards, Alavés were almost level when Contra <b>put</b> <b>another</b> ball into the penalty area, however, Henchoz cleared the ball before an Alavés player could reach it. In the 35th minute, Alavés were again nearly level. Alonso's header fell to Javi Moreno, who went past Henchoz his shot was saved by Westerveld after it his chest. The rebound fell to Ivan Tomić, but Westerveld again saved his shot. Five minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a penalty. Michael Owen had run into the penalty area past the Alavés defence, he was brought down by Herrera was who was booked for the foul. Gary McAllister took the penalty and scored to put Liverpool 3–1 ahead.|$|E

25|$|The LCBL's vote is {{far more}} democratic; each elector only votes once. The 23 players on each team select their peers, with some stipulations.

This prevents one conference from stuffing the ballot with the weakest players in the other conference.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. <b>Put</b> <b>another</b> way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring.

Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.|$|E

25|$|This is the {{principle}} of the camera, and of the human eye.

The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. Peto's group, however, was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the League-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. <b>Put</b> <b>another</b> way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E

25|$|Tetragametic chimerism {{is a form}} of {{congenital}} chimerism. This {{condition occurs}} through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages.

As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Then on 21 April, off Cape St. Nicholas in San Domingo, Reindeer {{captured}} the French privateer schooner Creole. She was pierced for 14 guns but only mounted six, not including swivel guns. She had {{a crew of}} 59 and had <b>put</b> <b>another</b> 16 men on prizes. Creole {{had a reputation for}} being the fastest vessel in those waters; Fyffe believed that he would not have caught her if Creole's captain had not been so confident that he could outrun Reindeer that he tried to cut in front of her bow to gain the wind. Reindeer also destroyed another small privateer of two guns. The crew, however, escaped.|$|E
25|$|Women first {{participated in}} the race in 1946. The first woman to take part was Jane Tate, whose boat Active {{was the only one}} to reach Hobart in 1946. Dagmar O'Brien, with boat Connella, also took part in that year but retired from the race before finishing. Thus, the Jane Tate Memorial Trophy is awarded each year to the first female skipper to {{complete}} the race. In 1975, the first all-women crew sailed, with boat Barbarian. In 1982 or 1983, Sue Bowly <b>put</b> <b>another</b> all-female crew together, but the sails ripped.

25|$|After {{questions}} were raised {{as to the}} purchase of Ryun's townhome, his office released official documents showing that Ryun paid $80,000 more than the tax assessed value of the house, that he <b>put</b> <b>another</b> $50,000 into house repairs and that another home on the same block was sold for $409,000 {{on the same day}} he bought his home. According to property records, the other home does not have a garage or a back patio and is on a land area about half the size of Ryun's. It was assessed in 2006 as worth $528,000, compared to $764,000 for Ryun's home. In contrast, homes across the street from Ryun's were sold for over $900,000.|$|E
25|$|Drs Dayun Tao and Prapa Sripichitt, {{working at}} the Department of Agronomy, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, made {{numerous}} crosses between rice and wild, rhizomatous species. The difficulty of this work {{is illustrated by the}} case of the single successful hybrid they obtained between Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata. To get this one plant, 119 rice florets were pollinated, which produced 51 seeds. Of these seeds, 33 had culturable embryos, and only one of these embryos developed into a viable plant. <b>Put</b> <b>another</b> way, this hybridization was relatively easy: over 3000 pollinations had to be made between rice and O. rhizomatis to get a single viable plant. It was a fortunate cross in other respects: the hybrid was healthy and rhizomatous (it is still alive) and partially fertile, allowing F2 seed to be obtained.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} Earth {{and the space}} ship is manifested in this diagram {{by the fact that}} more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. <b>Put</b> <b>another</b> way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 5years after departure); the Earth sees the image of the ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9years (almost {{at the end of the}} period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.|$|E
