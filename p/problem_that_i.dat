Broadly speaking, I work in extremal combinatorics, where the problems are phrased as maximizing or minimizing a combinatorial property subject to a given constraint.

My specific research is related to several aspects of data transmission and communication. In addition to applications, the <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> work on encourage beautiful mathematics that uses a variety of techniques.

The music is purely acoustic excellence with a hint of rock." [...] In addition, Jones added that [...] "the only <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had at all with Bebo Norman is that at only 37 minutes long, I was left longing for more.

I had to get my back fixed, and they were gonna wait for me, actually, for me to recover. But then it took more than what we expected it was gonna take. So the bottom line is MORBID ANGEL could not wait for me, because I could not do it for years. So they had to find a new drummer. And that's the reason why I don't play in MORBID ANGEL anymore. Four years it took… I didn't even think I was gonna come back and play drums again, because I was really bad. I was, like, four years of recovering. And while MORBID ANGEL had already done a new record with a new guy, I recall. And so, in 2012, right after I recorded TERRORIZER's 'Hordes Of Zombies' record, during that year, somehow that's when I found God.

For Nicolle, [...] "Biodiversity {{refers to the}} variety of life on Earth and the many ecosystems that harbor those organisms." [...] She then added that, [...] "In a rich diverse ecosystem, there is a habitat that creates natural sustainability for all life making it stronger and more able to recover from any disasters. As the dominant species, we {{have the responsibility to}} ensure suitable environments for all organisms by consciously measuring our activities and the effects they cause. Deforestation for food crops {{is one of the leading}} causes of habitat destruction and animal endangerment. The cultivation of crops such as Palm Oil has consumed Indonesia and Malaysia’s rain forests, significantly shrinking the homes of the now endangered species of the orangutan and the Asian rhinoceros, as well as impacting many plants, herbs and flowers. It has also increased the amount of greenhouse gases and has commenced a cycle of soil depletion in that territory. Deforestation specifically as it relates to biodiversity encompasses a multitude of environmental problems and raises the need for food sustainability movements and the development of the ‘New Economy’ that will reduce the need for so many clearings. Ultimately, the importance of biodiversity as a global issue is as much {{an environmental}} piece as it is a social justice <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel must be strongly pursued." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{started writing}} MAJID fifteen years ago, during my studies at a film {{school in the}} UK and I only {{finished}} it three years later. I started looking for funding {{for it in the}} UK, thinking foolishly that I may get an English producer interested but I was advised to give up trying as English producers were not interested in a movie to be shot in Moroccan language in Morocco. I was told to try French producers instead but since I was living in the UK, I decided to postpone looking for funds for Majid and started writing English language screenplays set in London.Concerning the story of MAJID, it's set in Mohammedia, my hometown. It's a coming of age story of a ten years old Moroccan orphan called Majid who works as a shoe shiner in the town's streets. Following recurrent nightmares, he discovers that he can't remember his parents' faces anymore and that there are no photographs of them apart from the charred remains of a family photo with his parents heads burnt away. With the help of his new friend Larbi, an eleven years old cigarettes seller, Majid decides to go on a quest to find a photograph of his dead parents. It's a journey that will take them to the big city of Casablanca where many dangers and adventures await them. The inspiration behind this movie was diverse but one of the first ideas I had as I sat down to write the script was to tackle a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> faced myself and it concerns my own problem of loss of memory, especially concerning my childhood memory which has faded away almost completely.|$|E
