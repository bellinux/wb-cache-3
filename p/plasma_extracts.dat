40|$|Background Clinical and {{experimental}} evidence suggest that haemodialysis (HD) procedure is an inflammatory process. For {{the production of}} proinflammatory lipid mediators in many inflammatory reactions, the release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 enzyme is a prerequisite. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present investigation was to establish whether the activity of PLA 2 increases during HD and whether the increase depends on the type of dialyser used. Methods We performed dialysis in eight chronic HD patients. Blood samples entering and leaving the dialyser were obtained before and at 15, 60, 120 and 180 min after the dialysis was started, on one occasion using a cuprophane and on another occasion a cellulose triacetate dialyser. PLA 2 activity was assessed in crude plasma and in <b>plasma</b> <b>extract.</b> Results PLA 2 activity in <b>plasma</b> <b>extract</b> exhibited similar biochemical properties to that of inflammatory human synovial fluid PLA 2 enzyme which is of group II PLA 2. PLA 2 activity in crude plasma represents a type of PLA 2 other than the synovial type. In HD patients, baseline PLA 2 activities in crude <b>plasma</b> and <b>plasma</b> <b>extract</b> were significantly increased when compared to normal subjects. An increase in PLA 2 activity was observed in crude plasma with a peak appearing at 15 min when the patients were dialysed with cuprophane and cellulose triacetate membranes. This increase was observed in both arterial and venous blood samples and was more pronounced when the patients were dialysed with cuprophane than with cellulose triacetate membranes. When PLA 2 was assessed in <b>plasma</b> <b>extract,</b> the activity increased only with cuprophane but not with cellulose triacetate membranes. Conclusions PLA 2 activity in plasma is increased in HD patients and increases during the dialysis procedure to a greater extent with a less biocompatible membrane.

40|$|SUMMARY Circulating digitalislike {{compounds}} {{have been}} proposed {{to be involved in}} some Na+-dependent types of experimental hypertension and in human essential hypertension. The level of circulating Na+-K+ pump inhibitor(s) was investigated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat of the Okamoto strain (SHR), its normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), and the regular Wistar rat using the following criteria: the ability of whole plasma to inhibit the total active Na+ efflux from Wistar rat erythrocytes and to cross-react with digoxin antibodies and the ability of <b>plasma</b> <b>extracts</b> to inhibit Na +,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of membranes from rat kidney. SHR plasma inhibited the net Na+ efflux from Wistar erythrocytes by up to 27 % compared with WKY or Wistar plasma. For a given number of cells, the inhibition increased with the amount of available plasma. Cross-reactivity with digoxin antibodies was twice as high in SHR as hi WKY or Wistar plasma. It was already enhanced in 3 - to 4 -week-old rats. <b>Plasma</b> <b>extracts</b> from SHR significantly inhibited Na +,K+-ATPase activity when compared with WKY extracts (75. 6 ± 2. 6 vs 89. 3 ± 2. 4 /tmol P,/mg/hr; p < 0. 01) but did not differ from Wistar <b>plasma</b> <b>extracts.</b> These results strongly suggest that circulating digitalislike compound(s) are present in elevated amounts hi SHR as early as 3 to 4 weeks of age, but their exact participation in blood pressure elevation or maintenance remains to be clarified...|$|E

All seven <b>plasma</b> <b>extracts</b> had secretagogue activity that was {{not found in the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>extracts</b> of ten {{patients with}} ordinary duodenal ulcer disease. Each of the tumor or pancreatic tissue extracts obtained from nine patients exhibited secretagogue activity in rats even though tissue gastrin content was 101. 9 pmol (213. 8 ng). g- 1 or less. The secretagogue activity of the tumor extracts was confirmed in conscious gastric fistula dogs. The tumors' secretagogue activity, in contrast to gastrin, was destroyed by trypsin. It was eluted between porcine motilin and human gastrin I from a Sephadex G- 50 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) superfine column and was not retained by CM-cellulose, at pH 8. 5. Its retention time during reverse phase HPLC on a C 18 column also differed from those of G 17 and G 34. Thus, this secretagogue activity appeared mediated by a small, acidic peptide with a molecular size of about 2000 to 3000 daltons. The present study indicates that plasma and tumor extracts of these 11 patients contain a gastric acid secretagogue activity mediated by a nongastrin peptide. We suggest that what may be a distinct clinical entity associated with endocrine neoplasms of the pancreas should be considered in the face of excessive acid hypersecretion without fasting hypergastrinemia...|$|E

Inflammation was determined by counting cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Serum Amyloid A 3 (Saa 3) expression and glutathione status were determined in lung tissue. Plaque progression was assessed in the aorta and the brachiocephalic artery. The effect of vasoactive mediators in plasma of exposed ApoE-/- mice was assessed in aorta rings isolated from naïve C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

The liquid capacity and inertness of different packed liners were investigated. The liner packed with ATAS "A" (modified Chromosorb-based material with special treatment) was found to be the most suitable for the analysis of the tested drugs. Good linearity in response for variations in volume and concentration was observed. A comparison was made between the applicability of flame ionisation detection (FID) and mass-selective detection (MSD). When 50 -mu l volumes of <b>plasma</b> <b>extracts</b> were injected with the PTV, the detection limits for secobarbital, lidocaine, phenobarbital and diazepam were about 50 -times lower than when 1 -mu l volumes were injected. The detection limits of the tested compounds in plasma for injection of 50 - 100 mu l plasma extract are 5 - 10 ng/ml for GC-FID whereas plasma concentrations of 250 pg/ml can be detected using the selected ion monitoring (SUI) mode of a MSD. For non-selective GC-FID, the background from a 50 -mu l injection was substantially larger than with 1 -mu l injection as a result of co-injected plasma matrix components and solvent impurities.
