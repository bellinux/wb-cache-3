The study specifies factors influencing the garlic peeling process and recommends a design options for garlic <b>peeling</b> <b>machine.</b> These {{are based on a}} systematic study of the garlic peeling process. For which we consider literatures reviews & some of them are explained. In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for chaff cutter, bricks making, wood turning, cloth washing and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with speed increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing. Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines. The machine is economically viable, can be adopted for human powered process units which could have intermitted operation without affecting the end product.

30|$|To reduce {{negative}} aspects of lignocellulosic materials, chemical processes, such as etherification, esterification, and phenylation as well as heat treatment methods, have been proposed for improving the physical properties of timber materials [4, 5]. Spruce wood (Picea abies) had degraded hemicellulose, softened lignin, and hence reduced hydrophilicity of cellulose after treated with high temperature [6]. The other similar effect of heat treatment was found to improve hydrophobicity of spruce wood [7], and ameliorating the susceptibility of wood to microbial decomposition component, thus enhancing their dimensional stability and durability [8]. Furthermore, studies confirmed that the contents of major chemical constituents, including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), and spruce wood, were reduced by heat treatment, and it significantly affected durability, surface properties, physical properties, and mechanical properties of wooden materials [9, 10]. Current trend of market of bamboo industry and development inclined toward production of glued laminated timber, which is also called glulam. To fulfill the performance requirements, there has been intense research on varieties of bamboo composites. To obtain a standardized integrated element and enhance good gluing properties of bamboo composites, two side planing-machine and <b>peeled</b> <b>machine</b> are widely applied to remove bamboo epidermis recently; however, the different integrated bamboo elements would be obtained and causing the different properties of bamboo composites [11].|$|R

Furthermore, distribution of the mechanical properties is determined. The main objective is to determine the critical values of mechanical properties significant for <b>peeling</b> <b>machines.</b> The response surface methodology was used to find the relationship between the input parameters and the output responses, and the fitness function was applied to measure the optimal values using the genetic algorithm. Two-parameter Weibull function was used to describe the distribution of mechanical properties. Based on the Weibull parameter values, i. e. shape parameter (β) and scale parameter (η) calculated for each property, the mechanical distribution variations were completely described and it was confirmed that the mechanical properties are rule governed, which makes the Weibull function suitable for estimating their distributions. The energy model estimated using response surface methodology shows that the mechanical properties relate exponentially to the moisture, and polynomially to the loading velocity and probe diameter, which enabled successful estimation of the rupture energy (R²= 0. 94). The genetic algorithm calculated the critical values of seed moisture, probe diameter, and loading velocity to be 18. 11 % on dry mass basis, 0. 79 mm, and 0. 15 mm/min, respectively, and optimum rupture energy of 1. 97 · 10 -³ J.

The peeling fractures were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. The results showed that bonds peeled off from the interface between the Al layer and the top surface of the W-plugs or from the interface between the Si-base and the bottom surface of the W-plugs. The distribution of W-plugs also affected the bond peeling from the top or bottom surfaces of the W-plugs. Mechanisms giving rise to the peeling failure of bonds were analyzed based on the acoustic impedance of materials, which determined the amount of ultrasonic energy transmitted from one material to another. Two different paths of ultrasonic energy transmission occurred during the bonding process due to the different acoustic impedances of the materials. One is from the Al layer, through the TiN and Ti layers, to the IC. The other is from the Al layer, through the W-plugs, to the IC. The different distributions of ultrasonic energy at the positions with W-plugs and without W-plugs caused stress concentrations around the top or bottom surfaces of the W-plugs, which resulted in peeling failures of the bonds.

In the production of flakes from scoured barley and oat grain before feeding to the rolling line film removal from the grain of these crops and the separation of the husks is carried out by one the existing methods: the method of grinding, followed by sifting and eventilation of films from tail fractions or a method of <b>peeling</b> on special <b>machines</b> with a separation of films. Wet-heat treatment of grain, followed by rolling helps to improve taste and palatability of feed, improves the nutritional value of carbohydrate and protein complexes, reduces the exertion of the body to digest food nutrients, allows to inactivate antinutritional substances and free the grain from the pathogenic and other microorganisms. In the duration of rolling process splitting of complex carbohydrates occurs, starch loses its original structure and is easier exposed to enzymes.

50|$|Belt Woods {{is part of}} {{the former}} farm of semi-reclusive banker and gentleman farmer, Seton Belt (1870-1959). A bird {{breeding}} census first surveyed the tract in 1947; the density of Forest Interior Dwelling Species (FIDS) was then found to be 300 pairs/100 acres (1300 m² per pair). The oaks of the “North Woods”, an old-growth similar to the now-preserved “South Woods” tract, were all cut in 1981, despite the fact that Belt had stipulated in his will that the stand was never to be logged. Tom Horton, in his book Bay Country (1987), tells how this happened:The bank entrusted with administering Seton Belt’s estate, and the church to which he left his goods, found that the forest earned the highest accolades not just from naturalists and woodland songbirds. “Veneer quality”, eager buyers from the world’s leading timber concerns adjudged the massive, knot-free, straight trunks of the oaks. Debarked, steamed until soft, then sliced and <b>peeled</b> on huge <b>machines</b> into sheets just 1/4-inch thick, {{just a few of the}} Beltwoods giants would decorate acres of executive conference-room walls in warm wood tones. The church said it needed the money over and above the $10 million that old Belt had left it to build an urban home for the elderly. With the bank, it broke the will in court, and half the mighty Beltwoods fell to the chainsaw….The forester hired by the bank explained to me his satisfaction when the veneer deal went through. From the standpoint of annual, new cellulose production, he said, the old oaks were well into the area of diminishing returns, even though they might live another century or two. “The only thing left for that particular stand of trees to do was to die and fall over”, he saidThis event served as a wakeup call to conservationists and an 18-year legal battle ensued between them and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. In 1984, the state of Maryland, with partners, purchased 110 acre including the “South Woods”, designating them the Belt Woods Natural Environmental Area. Impending residential development necessitated the state’s purchase of an additional 515 acre in 1997 — known as the Belt Woods Heritage Conservation Fund site. The HCF site, which consists of the former “North” and “Central Woods” (now young forest and fields), buffers the old growth forest and forestalls further development. In all, some 625 acre are protected at the site, of which most (610 acres) were designated by the Maryland General Assembly in October 1997 as the Belt Woods Wildland.

The research was carried out with the use of equipment funded by the French National Agency for Research under the program "Investments for the Future" (ANR- 10 -EQPX- 1...|$|E
40|$|A Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system was}} {{developed}} for Chinese fish rolls and skinless chicken sausages. The production process of the above products were studied at the processing factory. Microbiological tests were carried out to assess {{the status of the}} products during the production process. The tests were also repeated after taking some corrective measures. The processing stages, namely blending, chilling, battering, crumbing and packing of the final products showed some level of microbial contamination with E. coli, in Chinese fish rolls. In chicken sausages the production line receiving area and equipment workers hands, mincer plates, meat chopper, filled sausages and many other areas showed contamination with E. coli. Staphylococcus aureus contamination was also noted in certain stages but no Salmonella contamination was detected at any stage of processing. Based on the results of monitoring the chilling, battering and crumbing equipment in the production line and during packing was considered important in Chinese fish roll production while in skinless chicken sausage production, cooking, casing and packing were considered for further improvement of quality. The suggested modifications: chilling temperature, thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the production line and hygienic practices of the food handlers in the processing line for Chinese fish rolls and washing the <b>peeling</b> <b>machine</b> with boiling water, providing effective disinfectants for hand washing and cleaning the equipment of the chicken sausage processing line led to drastic reduction of E. coli. and Staphylococcus contamination resulting insvery satisfactory improvement of the quality of products.

40|$|The {{current drive}} towards {{higher levels of}} {{commercialisation}} of cassava processing under the Presidential Initiative on Cassava requires that the scale of cassava processing be increased in Nigeria. Primary data obtained from 112 respondents selected from the 4 extension zones of Ogun State {{was used to examine}} the perception of effectiveness of innovations by cassava processors and the factors responsible for adoption of these innovations. The processors’ perception of effectiveness of cassava processing innovations was measured on a 5 -point Likert-type scale containing 20 items. Most of the respondents (75 %) are indifferent in their perception of the effectiveness of innovations in cassava processing. All the cassava processing innovations considered in this study are known to some respondents, but their levels of use and acquisition differ from one innovation or the other. There are no significant relationships between the processors’ perception of effectiveness of cassava processing innovations and adoption of cassava <b>peeling</b> <b>machine,</b> fortification of cassava with protein rich cereal and use of rotary dryer. There are however significant relationships between the cassava processors perception of the effectiveness of cassava processing innovations and adoption of hand driven grater; power driven grater, hydraulic press and iron frying pot. Also, there are significant relationships between the cassava processors perception of cassava processing innovations and the major product processed and the main occupation. The study concluded that it is important that cassava processors have access to trying and using cassava processing technologies under convenient arrangements to stimulate a positive attitude towards such innovations.

40|$|ABSTRACTCassava {{is second}} only to sweet potato as the most {{important}} starchy root crop of the tropical world. In most parts of the tropics, cassava is grown on small plots. However, in some countries, e. g. Mexico, Brazil and Nigeria, large plantations have been started and interest in mechanization is growing. The degree of mechanization depends {{on the size of the}} land and availability of machines for each unit operation involved in cassava processing. However, of all the unit operations involved in cassava processing, cassava peeling remains a serious global challenge to process engineers. An automated cassava <b>peeling</b> <b>machine</b> was thus developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering, Federal University of Technology, Akure. The design of the machine was based on the development and modification of the peeling tool of previous cassava peeling machines and the peeling principle is by impact. This machine was evaluated using newly harvested improved variety of cassava tuber (TMS 30572) grouped into different sizes: 100 ≤L< 140, 140 ≤L< 180, 180 ≤L< 220, 220 ≤L< 260, and 260 ≤L< 300. The speed of the machine varies from 100 – 600 rpm while machine operational parameters such as throughput capacity, peeling efficiency, mechanical damage, quality performance efficiency and peel retention were determined for each size. Results revealed that throughput capacity ranged from 76 – 442 kg/h, peeling efficiency ranged from 50 – 75 %, mechanical damage ranged from 12 – 44 %, quality performance efficiency ranged from 22 – 66 %, and peel retention ranged from 7. 2 – 33 %. These results show appreciable improvement over manual method and existing machines...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to study the}} suitability of oil palm trunk to be utilized as a raw material for moulded laminated veneer oil palm (MLVOP).   The trunks were converted into veneers by rotary <b>peeling</b> <b>machine.</b>   The veneers were segregated into two veneer qualities namely superior (S) and inferior (I). The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi. Two types of adhesives namely UF and PF were used to produce MLVOP. The mechanical properties of the composites were tested with three bending types i. e. flat bending, type-V bending, and type-OV in accordance with BS EN 310 : 1993. The results showed {{that most of the}} samples bonded with UF-resin have better strengths (MOR and MOE) when tested with the three bending tests compared to the samples bonded with PF-resin. However, the results vary depends on the veneer arrangements. </p...|$|E
