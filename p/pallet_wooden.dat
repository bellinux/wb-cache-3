In this context {{the objective of the}} following paper is a brief overview on technical standards governing the use of wooden packaging, with particular reference to the agricultural-food sector. In this review, as wooden packaging, are taken into account, wood or its derivatives used to support, packaging and transport goods, such as cages, <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets,</b> <b>wooden</b> frame, wooden kegs, rods or timber. Particularly European standards are briefly described in their technical content and historic development. Market data, emerging technology and environmental problems are even recalled...|$|R

5000|$|Van Meter {{is noted}} for his pile of {{discarded}} <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets</b> from a beer company. In 1951 {{when the local}} beer company had a labor dispute they wished {{to get rid of}} thousands of broken-down used <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets.</b> Van Meter said he would take a [...] "few" [...] off their hands if they would deliver them to his property. Five truckloads of the pallets showed up. He decided he had to do something with them, so contrived a <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> tower structure. The 3 foot by 3 foot 6-inch-thick pallets soon became a structure over 20-feet high. It was 22 feet at the base and built in a circle. It took him just a few weeks to construct on his property and was over the grave site of an unknown three-year-old Native American child.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wooden</b> <b>pallets</b> {{are widely}} used {{in the field of}} logistics. Their {{frictional}} characteristics directly determine the reliability of transport. Microstructuring is an effective method to enhance the friction coefficient between the <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> and corrugated box. In this study, the micro-cutting method was used to manufacture the micro grooves and pillars efficiently. 12 different sizes of microstructure are designed and manufactured on pine wood which is commonly used for the <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet.</b> The experimental results show that sample with a thickness of the groove wall 100 μm has a poor structural strength and not suitable for microstructure design. The test results show that, micropillars has larger friction coefficient than grooved surface. It can lead to a 57 percent increase in the friction coefficient (from 0. 21 to 0. 33). This study lays the foundation for the manufacture of microstructures on wood to improve the frictional characteristic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} and optimization of air-distribution systems in drying kilns {{contributes to the}} preservation of the quality, safety and shelf life of perishable products. The present study reports on the numerical solution of airflow within a two dimensional drying kiln enclosure loaded with <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets.</b> The performance of air flow field is examined with and without supply of <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets.</b> Different arrangements of the supplied <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets</b> are investigated as well as the use of a screen in order to improve the airflow filed. The steady state RANS equations that formulate the flow problem are solved along with a turbulence model that is the standard k-εor the rng k-ε. The effect of the turbulence modeling is distinguished through direct comparisons of the derived airflow patterns. The results obtained show the presence of stagnant zones inside the pallets columns and above of them and the presence of recirculation regions in different zones of the drying kiln with the two turbulence models. ...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{theoretical}} {{calculations of}} the overall heat release rate (HRR) of multiple objects at both constant and varying distances have been carried out. The results were compared to both fire experiments in a longitudinal ventilated model tunnel (scale 1 : 15) using piles of <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets</b> placed at varying distance {{from each other and}} with model scale fire experiments (scale 1 : 4) conducted with a freight truck commodity without roof over the piles of <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets.</b> Two different methods are presented which are based on physical relations for fire spread between the piles of <b>wooden</b> <b>pallets.</b> The first method uses a critical heat flux as ignition criteria while the other method uses an ignition temperature. The method using the critical heat flux as ignition criteria shows very good agreement with the corresponding experimental results used. The method using the ignition temperature as ignition criteria did not agree well with the corresponding experimental results. The prerequisite that the burning objects should not necessarily have to be positioned at equal distance was fulfilled. GRUVA...|$|R
