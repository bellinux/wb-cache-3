25|$|Initially, {{a single}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> {{develops}} {{in the form}} of a bulge in the back wall of the left atrium. This vein will connect with the veins of the developing lung buds. As development proceeds the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> and its branches are incorporated into the left atrium and they both form the smooth wall of the atrium. The embryonic left atrium remains as the trabecular left atrial appendage, and the embryonic right atrium remains as the right atrial appendage.|$|E
25|$|The {{circulatory system}} of the lungs is {{the portion of the}} {{cardiovascular}} system in which oxygen-depleted blood is pumped away from the heart, via the pulmonary artery, to the lungs and returned, oxygenated, to the heart via the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} technique {{described by}} Sugiura and Futagawa was a two-step operation consisting of an initial thoracic operation {{followed by the}} abdominal operation 3–4 weeks later. The thoracic operation consists of an extensive paraesophageal devascularization up to the inferior <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> and esophageal transection. The abdominal operation consists of a splenectomy, devascularization of the abdominal esophagus and cardia, and a selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> are {{the veins}} that {{transfer}} oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs to the heart. The largest <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> are the four main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins,</b> two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> {{are part of the}} pulmonary circulation.|$|R

25|$|The heart pumps oxygenated {{blood to}} the body and deoxygenated {{blood to the}} lungs. In the human heart there is one atrium and one {{ventricle}} for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of {{the right side of}} the heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.|$|E
25|$|Mondino's {{description}} of the human heart, though inaccurate, is fairly detailed. He discusses three chambers: the right ventricle, the left ventricle, and a middle ventricle within the septum. The right ventricle is purported to contain a large opening, through which the heart draws blood originating in the liver, {{as well as the}} opening of the vena arterialis toward the lung. The left ventricle contains an orifice with three valves and the bivalvular opening of the arteria venalis, which allows the passage of a smoke-like vapor from the lungs. Despite these anatomical shortcomings, the vena chili (Mondino's name for the vena cava) is noteworthy in its accuracy. He then moves on to the lungs, describing the course of the vena arterialis (pulmonary artery) and the arteria venalis (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein).</b> This section of Anathomia also describes the pleura and notes the importance of distinguishing between pulmonary pathologies including true pleurisy, false pleurisy, and pneumonia. His descriptions of the larynx and epiglottis are very rudimentary.|$|E
25|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, from page 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.|$|E

500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E

40|$|Background—Paroxysmal atrial {{fibrillation}} in patients is often initiated by foci in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins.</b> The mechanism of these initiating arrhythmias is unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine electrophysiological characteristics of canine <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> that may predispose to initiating arrhythmias. Methods and Results—Extracellular recordings were obtained from the luminal side of 9 <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> in 6 Langendorff-perfused dog hearts after the veins were incised from the severed end to the ostium. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> were paced at the distal end, the ostium, and an intermediate site. During basic and premature stimulation, extracellular electrical activity was recorded with a grid electrode that harbored 247 electrode terminals. In 4 hearts, intracellular electrograms were recorded with microelectrodes. Myocyte arrangement immediately beneath the venous walls was determined by histological analysis in 3 hearts. Extracellular mapping revealed slow and complex conduction in all <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins.</b> Activation delay after premature stimulation could be as long as 96 ms over a distance of 3 mm. Action potential duration was shorter at the distal end of the veins than at the orifice. No evidence for automaticity or triggered activity was found. Histological investigation revealed complex arrangements of myocardial fibers that often showed abrupt changes in fiber direction and short fibers arranged in mixed direction. Conclusions—Zones of activation delay were observed in canine <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> and correlated with abrupt changes in fascicle orientation. This architecture of muscular sleeves in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> may facilitate reentry and arrhythmia...|$|R

40|$|Rotational {{angiography}} (RTA) {{is a new}} intraprocedural {{imaging modality}} of the left atrium, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> and other anatomical structures that are relevant for atrial fibrillation ablation. RTA can be performed by direct injection of contrast medium in the left atrium and during either an adenosine-induced ventricular asystole or during rapid ventricular pacing. RTA is safe and enables imaging of the left atrium and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> in multiple angiographic projections. Additionally, anatomical variations like common <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> ostia and accessory <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> can be visualized.

2500|$|Inhaling the vaporized gas form of {{substances}} into the lungs {{is a quick}} and very effective way of delivering drugs into the bloodstream (as the gas diffuses directly into the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein,</b> then into the heart {{and from there to}} the brain) and affects the user within less than a second of the first inhalation. The lungs consist of several million tiny bulbs called alveoli that altogether have an area of over 70 m² (about the area of a tennis court). This can be used to administer useful medical as well as recreational drugs such as aerosols, consisting of tiny droplets of a medication, or as gas produced by burning plant material with a psychoactive substance or pure forms of the substance itself. Not all drugs can be smoked, for example the sulphate derivative that is most commonly inhaled through the nose, though purer free base forms {{of substances}} can, but often require considerable skill in administering the drug properly. The method is also somewhat inefficient since not all of the smoke will be inhaled. The inhaled substances trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings in the brain due to being similar to naturally occurring substances such as endorphins and dopamine, which are associated with sensations of pleasure.

60|$|But it is {{not given}} to any man to be {{altogether}} right (that is a reflection which it is very desirable for every man who has had the good luck to be nearly right once, always to bear in mind); and Erasistratus, while he made this capital and important discovery, made a very capital and important error in another direction, {{although it was a}} very natural error. If, in any animal which is recently killed, you open one of those pulsating trunks which I referred to a short time ago, you will find, as a general rule, that it either contains no blood at all or next to none; but that, on the contrary, it is full of air. Very naturally, therefore, Erasistratus {{came to the conclusion that}} this was the normal and natural state of the arteries, and that they contained air. We are apt to think this a very gross blunder; but, to anybody who is acquainted with the facts of the case, it is, at first sight, an exceedingly natural conclusion. Not only so, but Erasistratus might have very justly imagined that he had seen his way to the meaning of the connection of the left side of the heart with the lungs; for we find that what we now call the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vein</b> is connected with the lungs, and branches out in them (Fig. 1). Finding that the greater part of this system of vessels was filled with air after death, this ancient thinker very shrewdly concluded that its real business was to receive air from the lungs, and to distribute that air all through the body, so as to get rid of the grosser humours and purify the blood. That was a very natural and very obvious suggestion, and a highly ingenious one, though it happened to be a great error. You will observe that the only way of correcting it was to experiment upon living animals, for there is no other way in which this point could be settled.|$|E

To determine {{the prevalence of}} echocardiographically detected anomalous connection or drainage, or both, of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> in patients with this syndrome, preoperative two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler color flow mapping studies of 317 patients who underwent the stage I Norwood procedure were reviewed. The term “connection” was {{used to describe the}} precise anatomic attachment of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>veins</b> and the term “drainage” to describe the physiologic end point of pulmonary venous flow.
