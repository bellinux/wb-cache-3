50|$|The term {{can also}} be applied to any <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> system using three tubes, but this use is rare in the literature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} are {{different types of}} <b>projection</b> <b>televisions,</b> which differ based {{on the type of}} projector and how the image (before projection) is created: ...|$|R
50|$|Plasma lamps {{have been}} used in high bay and street {{lighting}} applications, as well as in stage lighting. They were briefly used in some <b>projection</b> <b>televisions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Large mirrors {{are used}} in rear <b>projection</b> <b>televisions.</b> Light (for example from a DLP as {{mentioned}} above) is [...] "folded" [...] {{by one or more}} mirrors so that the television set is compact.|$|R
5000|$|Sony {{also did}} some {{development}} with the Uniray concept, introducing {{a range of}} products under the [...] "Indextron" [...] trade name. Their first product was the FP-62 [...] "Vidimagic" [...] <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> system. The Indextron tube was so bright that it could directly project an enlarged image in a front <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> {{without the need for}} three separate tubes, eliminating convergence problems. A second version with built-in Betamax VCR was sold as the PF-60. A better-known application was the KVX-370, a 4-inch [...] "bedside" [...] television with a built-in alarm clock and radio.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 Ekco made a {{substantial}} investment in Scophony Limited, the developers of the ingenious Scophony <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> system. Although the system showed great promise, its development was halted by the Second World War, and not resumed postwar.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the Advent VideoBeam 1000 {{was finally}} released, the first large screen <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> for home use. In 1977, Kloss founded Kloss Video Corporation (KVC) as a {{spin-off}} company. He invented the Novatron tube there, which increased {{the efficiency of}} projection TVs.|$|E
50|$|Additive mixing {{is used in}} {{television}} and computer monitors to produce {{a wide range of}} colors using only three primary colors. A pixel is a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. <b>Projection</b> <b>televisions</b> typically have three projectors, one for each primary color.|$|R
50|$|Whilst LCoS {{technology}} was initially {{touted as a}} technology to enable large-screen, high-definition, rear-projection televisions with very high picture quality at relatively low cost, the development of large-screen LCD and plasma flat panel displays obsoleted rear <b>projection</b> <b>televisions.</b> As of October 2013, LCoS-based rear-projection televisions are no longer produced.|$|R
50|$|The use of Fresnel lenses for image {{projection}} reduces image quality, so {{they tend}} to occur only where quality is not critical or where the bulk of a solid lens would be prohibitive. Cheap Fresnel lenses can be stamped or molded of transparent plastic and are used in overhead projectors and <b>projection</b> <b>televisions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{liquid crystal}} rear <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> system using a {{patented}} [...] "optical engine" [...] made by Sony {{to provide a}} large image in a very compact chassis. Screen sizes in inches [...] can range anywhere for 42" [...] to 70"; with exceptional sharpness, composed of approximately 2.5 million plus pixels.|$|E
50|$|DLP {{technology}} {{is used in}} DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in additive manufacturing as a light source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.|$|E
50|$|Screens with a molded {{lenticular}} surface {{are frequently}} used with <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> systems. In this case, {{the purpose of}} the lenses is to focus more of the light into a horizontal beam and allow less of the light to escape above and below the plane of the viewer. In this way, the apparent brightness of the image is increased.|$|E
50|$|John Harker {{started work}} at InFocus in 1992 and has {{transformed}} the company from being a small startup selling business projectors to a thriving business with many display products. Products {{that have been developed}} under his leadership include a variety of business projectors as well as home theatre projection and DLP Rear <b>Projection</b> <b>televisions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS or LCOS) is a {{miniaturized}} reflective active-matrix {{liquid-crystal display}} or [...] "microdisplay" [...] using a liquid crystal layer {{on top of}} a silicon backplane. It is also referred to as a spatial light modulator. LCoS was initially developed for <b>projection</b> <b>televisions</b> but is now used for wavelength selective switching, structured illumination, near-eye displays and optical pulse shaping. By way of comparison, some LCD projectors use transmissive LCD, allowing light to pass through the liquid crystal.|$|R
5000|$|Pedro Zaz (born February 7, 1978) is a Portuguese New-Media {{artist and}} VJ working with fulldome / {{immersive}} cinema, video <b>projection</b> mapping, <b>television,</b> and audio-visual performance.|$|R
5000|$|Scophony Ltd was {{described}} as [...] "one of the most ingenious television manufacturers of the 1930s". A significant patent from the international company was the <b>Projection</b> <b>Television</b> System; several were installed and ran successfully. But none were sold: the dark day of World War Two on the horizon, even the BBC shut down its television experiments.|$|E
50|$|The most similar {{competing}} {{system to}} DLP {{is known as}} LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon), which creates images using a stationary mirror mounted {{on the surface of}} a chip, and uses a liquid crystal matrix (similar to a liquid crystal display) to control how much light is reflected. DLP-based television systems are also arguably considered to be smaller in depth than traditional <b>projection</b> <b>television.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rear Projection (RPTV): Most {{very large}} screen TVs (up to 254 cm (100 inch) and beyond) use {{projection}} technology. Three types of projection systems {{are used in}} projection TVs: CRT-based, LCD-based, and DLP (reflective micromirror chip) -based, D-ILA and LCOS-based. <b>Projection</b> <b>television</b> has been commercially available since the 1970s, {{but at that time}} could not match the image sharpness of the CRT; current models are vastly improved, and offer a cost-effective large-screen display.|$|E
50|$|SXRD (Silicon X-tal Reflective Display) is Sony's {{proprietary}} {{variant of}} liquid crystal on silicon, a technology used mainly in <b>projection</b> <b>televisions</b> and video projectors. In {{the front and}} rear-projection television market, it competes directly with JVC's D-ILA and Texas Instruments' DLP. Sony has discontinued the production of all of its rear-projection televisions, including those that used SXRD display chips, in favor of flat-panel sets utilizing LCD and OLED displays. Sony has now concentrated SXRD on HD home front-projectors and next generation 4K digital theater projection.|$|R
2500|$|The {{explosion}} heavily {{damaged or}} destroyed six high rise apartment buildings in the complex. Windows were shattered in virtually every other building in the compound and in surrounding buildings up to a mile (1.6km) away. A very large crater, [...] wide and [...] deep, was left where the truck had been. [...] Within {{a few hours of}} the blast, the crater began to fill with salt-water from the Persian Gulf. [...] In the minutes following the blast, the residents of the complex evacuated severely injured U.S. military personnel from the area. With power out in many of the buildings near #131, the scene was chaotic and tense as little was known about the safety of the area from further attacks. Many residents later gathered in the local dining facility, set up as a triage centre, and saw breaking news of the event on large <b>projection</b> <b>televisions</b> intended to bring news of events back home to the troops.|$|R
5000|$|Northlands Park is the [...] "Alberta A circuit" [...] {{horse racing}} track at Northlands in Edmonton, Alberta. The horse racing season {{generally}} {{consists of a}} spring harness (Standardbred) meet from February/March, a Thoroughbred meet from May/June to September/October and a fall harness meet to mid-December. Northlands Park (formerly Northlands Spectrum) is the building name for the grandstand. There are three dining areas {{on the second floor}}. Colours is the main dining room overlooking the race track and has a seating capacity of 700. Uplinks Theatre is the simulcast restaurant area and features 6 <b>projection</b> <b>televisions</b> and up to 26 different simulcast race broadcasts from North American tracks and Sha Tin in Hong Kong. Playbook Lounge is open limited hours and is available for private functions, sports broadcast events (27 televisions) and private parties. There are two other concessions on the second floor - Rock's and The Deli - that are open during live horse racing.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} part of the 21st century, many {{microdisplay}} manufacturers focused on applying the technology to rear projection based High Definition Television (HDTV) systems. However, due to developments in the manufacturing process of large-panel Liquid Crystal Display Televisions (LCD TVs) and resulting drops in the cost of components, LCD based TVs matured into the more popular consumer choice. By late 2007 almost all microdisplay Rear <b>Projection</b> <b>Television</b> (RPTV) manufacturers had withdrawn their TVs from production.|$|E
5000|$|Visitors to the Journey into Narnia {{were led}} into an {{antechamber}} with a Wardrobe prop [...] "entrance". The audience was then led through the wardrobe doors {{into a large}} room adorned with flocked pine trees, a lamppost, a large tree illuminated with fiber optics, and a large (150") <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> screen. The screen displayed a greatly abridged version of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the 2005 feature film co-produced by Disney and Walden Media.|$|E
5000|$|LCDs can, in theory, be {{built at}} any size, with {{production}} yields being the primary constraint. As yields increased, common LCD screen sizes grew, from 14" [...] (35 cm) to 30" [...] (70 cm), to 42" [...] (107 cm), then 52" [...] (132 cm), and 65" [...] (165 cm) sets are now widely available. This allowed LCDs to compete directly with most in-home <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> sets, and {{in comparison to}} those technologies direct-view LCDs have a better image quality. Experimental and limited run sets are available with sizes over 100 inches (254 cm).|$|E
50|$|The Schmidt {{system was}} popular, used in reverse, for <b>television</b> <b>projection</b> systems. Large Schmidt {{projectors}} {{were used in}} theaters but systems as small as 8-inches were made for home use and other small venues.|$|R
50|$|Different {{technical}} equipments and a 4-side colour <b>television</b> <b>projection</b> {{system are}} also present {{to project the}} performer's image onto a screen, so that audience sitting around the rear side of the stadium can also see clearly.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{district}} has become {{a model for other}} districts for its focus and emphasis on technology in education. The district invests highly in the latest computers, software, <b>televisions,</b> <b>projection</b> equipment, digital cameras, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|A <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> uses a {{projector}} {{to create}} a small image or video from a video signal and magnify this image onto a viewable screen. The projector uses a bright beam of light and a lens system to project the image to a much larger size. A front-projection television uses a projector that is separate from the screen and the projector is {{placed in front of}} the screen. The setup of a rear-projection television is in some ways similar to that of a traditional television. The projector is contained inside the television box and projects the image from behind the screen.|$|E

50|$|Established in 2002, {{the word}} Optoma was created from the {{combination}} of two words: Optical and Maxima. In its first year, Optoma launched world’s first 65-inch DLP <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> and won the Consumer Electronics Show Innovations Award in 2003. In 2005, Optoma announced the world's first all-in-one DVD projector, the MovieTime™ DV10. An ultra-mobile LED light source projector range (ML750/ML1000) as well as Optoma's first laser phosphor technology illuminated projector (ZU650) was announced in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Infocomm 2016 (Las Vegas) saw {{the announcement of the}} world's first 4K UHD ultra short throw laser projector from Optoma. Utilizing Texas Instruments' DLP projection technology, Optoma is a designer and manufacturer for home, business, education, and professional display solutions.|$|E

2500|$|Minor uses of {{ethylene}} glycol include {{the manufacture of}} capacitors, as a chemical intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} 1,4-dioxane, as an additive to prevent corrosion in liquid cooling systems for personal computers, and inside the lens devices of cathode-ray tube type of rear <b>projection</b> <b>televisions.</b> Ethylene glycol is also used in the manufacture of some vaccines, but it is not itself present in these injections. [...] It is used as a minor (1–2%) ingredient in shoe polish and also in some inks and dyes. Ethylene glycol has seen some use as a rot and fungal treatment for wood, both as a preventative and a treatment after the fact. It has been used in a few cases to treat partially rotted wooden objects to be displayed in museums. It is one of only a few treatments that are successful in dealing with rot in wooden boats, and is relatively cheap. Ethylene glycol may also be one of the minor ingredients in screen cleaning solutions, along with the main ingredient isopropyl alcohol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as a preservative for biological specimens, especially in secondary schools during dissection as a safer alternative to formaldehyde. It can also be used in killing jars. It is also used as part of the water-based hydraulic fluid used to control subsea oil and gas production equipment.|$|R
50|$|A movie theater, {{named the}} Hoff Theater, {{is located in}} Stamp. First opening in 1975 and renovated in 2002, the Hoff {{includes}} a seating capacity of 550, Dolby Digital surround sound, and a concession stand. The TerpZone, located in the Basement Level of Stamp, is an entertainment center that includes a bowling alley, billiard tables, an arcade, and <b>projection</b> screen <b>televisions</b> for viewing sporting events. An art gallery, The Stamp Gallery, prominently presents exhibitions {{on the first floor}} of Stamp and controls work throughout the Stamp. Immediately next to Stamp is the Nyumburu Amphitheater, which often features outdoor performances of various sorts.|$|R
