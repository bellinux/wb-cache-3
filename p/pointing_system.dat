5000|$|The 1954 Asian Games (officially {{known as}} the Second Asian Games - Manila 1954) was a multi-sport event held in Manila, Philippines from May 1 to May 9, 1954. A total of 970 athletes from 19 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 76 events from eight sports. The number of {{participating}} NOCs and athletes were larger than the previous Asian Games held in New Delhi in 1951. This edition of the games has a different twist where it did not implement a medal tally system to determine the overall champion but a <b>pointing</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>pointing</b> <b>system</b> is a complex system where each athlete were given points according to their achievement like position in athletics or in swimming.

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> have been {{developed}} and implemented in European countries, aimed at tackling repeat offences in road transport by acting as a deterrent and providing sanctioning. The impact of a demerit <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{on the number of}} crashes is often reported to be significant, but temporary. The objective of the EU BestPoint project was to establish a set of recommended practices that would result in a more effective and sustainable contribution of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> to road safety. A high actual chance of losing the licence and a high perceived chance of losing the licence are basic prerequisites for the effective operation of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> For measures applied {{within the context of a}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>system,</b> a four-step-approach is recommended: warning letter, driver improvement course, licence withdrawal, rehabilitation course. Further recommendations concern issues like points and offences, e. g. which offences should lead to points, target groups, and the administration of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> The final result of the EU BestPoint project is a handbook (van Schagen & Machata, 2012) which provides a concise overview of all recommended practices. The presentation/paper outlines how sustainable safety improvements can be achieved if national demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> are implemented and maintained according to the recommended practices. In addition, potential further steps towards an EU-wide demerit <b>point</b> <b>system</b> (cross-border exchange on points and/or offences) are presented. (Author/publisher...|$|R
40|$|Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe: {{room for}} improvement; Some {{recommendations}} from the European project BestPoint. Broadly speaking, a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> involves a road user receiving demerit points {{in addition to}} the regular punishment when a traffic violation has been observed. If someone has received a certain number of demerit points within a certain period of time, the driver’s licence will be temporarily suspended. Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> aim at regular offenders and for this reason they are generally considered to be fair. This may be the explanation for their considerable popularity. Three quarters of the European Member States use some form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> At present, the Netherlands has a simple variant which only applies to novice drivers. Recently, the European project BestPoint has concluded a two-year study into demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> which resulted in a handbook for governments who are considering to implement a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> BestPoint investigated the actual effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> and which type of system may be expected to be the most satisfactory. The most important conclusion is that demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> are less effective than their popularity in Europe suggests. Initially, they have a considerable road safety effect, but their deterrence often is only short-lasting. However, the effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> may be improved by setting it up in a good way; {{it is very important that}} both the objective and the subjective risk of being caught remain high and that automatically detected offences are also included...|$|R
5000|$|While the Pinaka {{will not}} be {{developed}} further into a larger system, its success and the experience gained from the programme has led the ARDE and its partner organisations, to launch a project to develop a long range MRL similar to the Smerch MLRS.

40|$|In 2012, 21 of the 27 EU Member States {{had some}} form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> In theory, demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> {{contribute}} to road safety through three mechanisms: 1) prevention of unsafe behaviour through the risk of receiving penalty points, 2) selection and suspension of the most frequent offenders and 3) correction of risk behaviour through an educative element in the demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> International studies show that in practice {{the effects of a}} demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> can indeed be significant, but that these effects exist only for a (very) limited period of time.
