50|$|The {{psychological}} effect {{of having to}} remain barefoot {{as part of a}} prisoner's dress code is comparable to the effect of specific <b>prison</b> <b>garments,</b> as it is an uncommon state in any civil society just as wearing salient uniform clothing and carries a similar denotive connotation. This situation can however have an additional unsettling effect on a detained person as the heightened vulnerability of shoeless feet typically provokes feelings of insecurity. Hereby a prisoner often perceives the reluctant and unaccustomed visual exposure of his or her bare feet as a palpable element of degradation and punishment in itself. Being forced to remain barefoot for a prison uniform is often experienced as intimidating and oppressive, which is an effect also used to further emphasize the overseers' command and authority over the prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two votes}} {{in favor of}} Williams came from the Justices Marshall and Brennan. Since Williams was in prison garb he gave the {{appearance}} of guilt. In Coffin v. United States it is stated “the principle {{that there is a}} presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law”. [...] The appearance of Williams in <b>prison</b> <b>garments</b> corrupted the court process and therefore the error in the court cannot be considered “harmless beyond a doubt.” Justice Marshall said, “the Court could not rest the reversal on a finding that respondent knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently consented to be tried in such attire, and thus had waived his due process right”. [...] The defendant never conceded to wearing his prison clothes while on trial and a retrial should be awarded because of the violation of his fourteenth amendment rights under due process.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your king is very wise, in so {{strictly}} repressing all plundering and violence," [...] he said. [...] "Only so can {{a general}} maintain an army in an enemy's country. If the peasantry {{have confidence in}} him, and know that they will get a fair price for their produce, they will bring it into the market gladly, in spite of any orders their own government may issue to the contrary. I am determined that, if I again lead an English army in the field, I will follow King Charles' example; though I shall find {{it more difficult to}} enforce my orders than he does, for he is king as well as general, and his Swedes are quiet, honest fellows, while my army will be composed of ne'er-do-wells--of men who prefer to wear the queen's uniform to a <b>prison</b> <b>garment,</b> of debtors who wish to escape their creditors, and of men who find village life too quiet for them, and prefer to see the world, even at the risk of being shot, to honest labour on the farms. It requires a stern hand to make a disciplined army out of such materials, but when the time of fighting comes, one need wish for no better." ...|$|R
