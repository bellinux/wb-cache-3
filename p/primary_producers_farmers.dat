5000|$|In 1968, Brisbane {{accountant}} D. P. O'Shea was {{a partner}} in the firm Fadden and O'Shea and was, as the court said, [...] "versed in the arts of tax minimization". He hit upon a scheme to access the income averaging provisions of division 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA). Income averaging allowed a taxpayer to spread income over multiple tax years and was meant for <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> (<b>farmers</b> etc.) with highly variable incomes. Section 157 provided that if a trust is carrying on a business of primary production, then all the income beneficiaries are likewise considered carrying on such a business.|$|E
40|$|Transitions {{leading to}} sociotechnical {{innovations}} in food supply chains {{have been described}} in dramaturgical analyses {{on the basis of}} newspaper articles and parliamentary records. The time scale of such transitions driven by aroused public opinion is typically a decade. Actors are <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> (<b>farmers),</b> other supply chain parties, authorities, NGOs voicing particular opinions, political parties, and consumers. Their interactions and reactions to external events are modelled in an agent-based simulation. The purposes of the simulation are (1) to validate that hypothetical relations derived from the dramaturgical analysis indeed lead to the emergence of the observed transitions, and (2) to study how the system could have developed under different behaviours or a different course of external events. Simulation results and a sensitivity analysis are discussed. The simulation shows particularly sensitive for the participation of both moderate and activist NGOs...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{processes}} operate over a {{range of}} scales from global to micro. The synoptic scale refers to those processes that operate over a spatial scale of hundreds to a few thousand kilometres, with a time scale ranging from a day to about a week. Weather systems of this scale are the most familiar public representation of the atmosphere, as they appear daily in both newspapers and on television. They {{also tend to be}} the most relevant for many users of weather information, as people tend to plan their working or leisure activities on the basis of forecasts of synoptic weather activity. They are also of equal significance to both physical and human aspects of the environment, as individual weather systems control such things as the input of rainfall to a catchment, the effect of wind on plants, as well as the well-being of members of the public and the livelihood of such <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> as <b>farmers</b> and fishers...|$|R

5000|$|Cyanobacteria {{remained}} principal <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> {{throughout the}} Proterozoic Eon (2500-543 Ma), {{in part because}} the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation.

40|$|Although it {{is often}} {{acknowledged}} that effective inclusion of small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> in international chains is crucial for alleviating poverty in developing countries, few insights exist about how to build sustainable and all-inclusive food chains especially those based on scarce natural resources. In order to address challenges that marketing and development policy and institutions as well as small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> in the agro-ecological sector face in promoting sustainable practices, this paper focuses {{on the use of}} contracts. The paper investigates whether small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> would engage in contracts that oblige them to implement sustainable and quality-improving practices and if so under what conditions. Results show that <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> (fishermen in this study) are open to sustainability-quality enhancing contracts provided that such contracts also enhance their welfare and economic benefits.

40|$|Nutrient {{limitation}} {{determines the}} primary production and species composition of many ecosystems. Here we apply an adaptive dynamics approach to investigate {{evolution of the}} ecological stoichiometry of <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> {{and its implications for}} plant‐herbivore interactions. The model predicts a trade‐off between the competitive ability and grazing susceptibility of <b>primary</b> <b>producers,</b> driven by changes in their nutrient uptake rates. High nutrient uptake rates enhance the competitiveness of <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> but also increase their nutritional quality for herbivores. This trade‐off enables coexistence of nutrient exploiters and grazing avoiders. If herbivores are not selective, evolution favors runaway selection toward high nutrient uptake rates of the <b>primary</b> <b>producers.</b> However, if herbivores select nutritious food, the model predicts an evolutionarily stable strategy with lower nutrient uptake rates. When the model is parameterized for phytoplankton and zooplankton, the evolutionary dynamics result in plant‐herbivore oscillations at ecological timescales, especially in environments with high nutrient availability and low selectivity of the herbivores. High herbivore selectivity stabilizes the community dynamics. These model predictions show that evolution permits nonequilibrium dynamics in plant‐herbivore communities and shed new light on the evolutionary forces that shape the ecological stoichiometry of <b>primary</b> <b>producers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Participation in agrichemical {{training}} courses {{and awareness of}} the benefits of information on safe and efficient agrichemical use and management is ultimately dependant upon recognition of a need or a desire for such training {{on the part of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>producer.</b> However, despite the benefits that can accrue to <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> from being trained in efficient and safe agrichemical use and management, the majority of <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> undertake no formal agrichemical training. One reason often identified for the low level of <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> agrichemical training participation is a perception, held by many <b>primary</b> <b>producers,</b> that agrichemical training is not cost effective. In addition to this reason there is also an erroneous belief, again held by many <b>primary</b> <b>producers,</b> that their current agrichemical practices are efficient and safe. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the influence on agrichemical training participation of two factors that have been identified as possible causes of the low level of <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> agrichemical training participation: (i) The cost effectiveness of training. (ii) Primary producer' uncertainty about efficient and safe agrichemical use and management practices. In order to achieve this objective the research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase a cost-benefit analysis of agrichemical training for New Zealand growers was undertaken. The second phase of the research then examined the factors that "trigger" New Zealand primary producers' recognition of a problem in their use and management of agrichemicals. In order to develop a model that examines the dimensions that influence problem recognition, a comprehensive data set on New Zealand primary producers' attitudes, information, behaviour and current situation is factor analysed to identify the underlying dimensions in the data. A logistic regression model is then estimated in order to evaluate the effects of these dimensions on problem recognition. The results from the cost-benefit analysis indicate that agrichemical training participation is cost effective for a significant percentage of <b>primary</b> <b>producers.</b> The findings of the empirical analysis suggest that employee involvement and safe use and export factors are positively associated with problem recognition. Conversely, the factors representing experience, health ambivalence and overconfidence are significantly negatively associated with problem recognition...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} {{significant}} changes have been made in Australian income tax legislation in regard to the treatment of non-business expenditure. The relative effects of these changes on <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> and other taxpayers operating unincorporated business rirms are dirficult to ascertain. The complexity of the taxation system together with the fact thai changes to taxation laws have different effects depending on the level and variability of incomes make generalizations difficult. Research designed to compare average rates of tax on a large number ofsimulaled income series suggests that earlier income tax advantages enjoyed by <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> relative to other businessmen with equally unstable incomes have now been largely e 1 iminaled. Furthemore, it now appears that <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> with highly fluctuating incomes may pay substantially greater tax than other businessmen with stable incomcs inspite of the use of averaging procedures. The recent changes to the tax laws regarding items of personal expenditure, therefore, have significantly reduced the benefits of averaging previously available to <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> taxpayers. © 1976 Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.
