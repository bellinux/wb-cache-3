40|$|With the Internet {{becoming}} the dominant channel for marketing and <b>promotion,</b> <b>online</b> advertisements are also increasingly used for illegal purposes such as propagating malware, scamming, click frauds, etc. To understand {{the gravity of}} these malicious advertising activities, which we call malvertising, we perform a largescale study through analyzing ad-related Web traces crawled over a three-month period.

To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them {{to build a new}} detection system called Mad-Tracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before...|$|E

40|$|There are few {{regions in}} Romania where ancestral traditions, costumes and ancient art are still preserved. Maramureº {{is indeed the}} zone where they have managed to stay {{unaltered}} by modern influences. Thus, the tourism in Maramureº is centred on the village and its folklore, exploited through rural tourism. The development of rural tourism in Maramureº is mainly based on its diversified potential, but it is directly dependent on the accommodation offer available and on the methods of promoting it. Under these circumstances, our study aims at undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the existing accommodation units, of their distribution, and of the various ways of promoting tourist offers. The online tourist market in Maramureº is rather developed and diversified in its product and service offer, due to the listing of accommodation units on many online portals. In order to help and guide users towards a well-defined goal through the chaos on the Internet, we suggest the implementation of expert systems within sites. Expert systems can bring many benefits to both consumers and tourist service providers. Maramureº, Rural tourism, <b>Promotion,</b> <b>Online</b> travel portals, Expert systems. ...|$|E

Aim: To report {{the evaluation of}} an on-line Diploma in health promotion for Primary Health Care professionals. Material and Methods: Two hundred sixty four professionals from all {{regions of the country}} (40 % rural and 60 % urban) took the Diploma. It lasted 8 months with 248 academic hours distributed in 5 modules with a total of 15 units. The program was evaluated with four surveys answered by the students (general description of participants, mid-term, final and follow-up). Results: Students were highly satisfied with the program and especially with its interactive methodology which included tutorials, individual and group assignments, online discussions and a final project. The drawbacks were time restrictions and limited internet access. Ninety percent of students completed the course with an overall mean grade of 5. 57 (out of a 1 - 7 scale). The follow-up survey showed that students implemented the new health promotion knowledge acquired, and put in practice their final assignment in their local counties. Also, most students improved their working conditions. Conclusions: The on-line interactive and participative methodology applied in this Diploma had positive results and the evaluation model can be applied in other health <b>promotion</b> <b>online</b> education programs...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{large-scale}} <b>promotion</b> <b>online,</b> {{customers are}} becoming strategic in their purchasing behaviour, thus {{giving rise to}} pulsed demand. However, pulsed demand is dynamic and highly uncertain. It will not only undermine retailers’ profit but will also increase their risks. Based on strategic customer behaviour and multiplicative demand, this paper proposes a pulsed demand model and establishes a procurement decision model within the expected utility framework {{from the perspective of}} a risk-averse retailer. A strategic customer ratio (SCR) is employed to denote the proportion of such customers in the entire customer population. We find that the optimal procurement strategy depends on a threshold - a retailer will procure only if the initial inventory level is below this threshold. When the SCR is price-independent, the procurement volume in the promotion period decreases in the selling price, and increases in the SCR in a previous period. When the SCR is price-dependent, the impact of the price in a previous period on the current procurement volume depends on the relationship of price elasticity between SCR and demand in that period. Our numerical study shows that the risk-averse procurement strategy can effectively mitigate risk without significant profit loss, and more so when the SCR becomes larger...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{begins by}} looking at marketing; what it was; how it evolved over the years, {{and what it is}} today. Marketing in its early days focused on the {{synergistic}} blending together of the four P’s of marketing; i. e., Product, Price, Place and Promotion. The main area of interest here is promotion, Integrated Marketing Communications {IMC} and, particularly <b>online</b> <b>promotion.</b> Contemporary IMC works with the other P’s and systematically, synergistically, and efficiently carries out its role within the marketing plan and helps generate customer lifetime value. This new IMC and its importance to the success of a marketing plan is the focus of this paper. Online marketing techniques and a host of online promotional innovations heavily affect the new IMC. Novel and improved ways are added to the IMC mix in order to better communicate with the changing nature of target markets. In this metamorphic universe of broadband communications, i-phones and Blu-Ray, the marketing world is metamorphosing too. <b>Online</b> <b>promotion</b> {{plays a key role in}} reaching new target markets.
