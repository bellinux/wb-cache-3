5|$|Smith began 1978 as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring {{training}} camp in Yuma, Arizona. Smith credited Padres manager Alvin Dark for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> can't handle it. Even though Dark was fired {{in the middle of}} training camp, Smith made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, {{the veteran}} Robertson still <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> was a {{valuable}} player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks {{followed in the}} 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E
5|$|Work on The Simpsons {{involved}} an irregular schedule. The producers laid off the animation staff for two-to-three-month periods, and rehired the staff {{later in the}} production cycle. During one of these layoffs, Povenmire found a temporary job on the series Rocko's Modern Life, Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production. The show's creator, television newcomer Joe Murray, hired Povenmire solely {{on the strength of}} his Life is a Fish comic strips, which <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> could both write and draw.|$|E

5|$|Varno later filed {{a second}} {{arbitration}} upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing {{credit for the}} original story. Varno claimed Corman {{had nothing to do}} with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> wrote it himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno when he wanted to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration in the writing credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands of dollars, and Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{gradually}} <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> {{belonged in}} the upper echelon of the extraordinarily deep Soviet chess elite, with many victories over top players. He placed equal fourth in the 1965 Soviet Championship. Furman was awarded the International Master (IM) title in 1954. He won the Leningrad Championship in 1953, 1954, and 1957 (jointly).|$|E
25|$|You {{will see}} there the Paysage lacustre, by Le Fauconnier, the Jeune homme et Jeune fille dans le printemps, mosaic of yellow, green, brown and pink, {{represented}} by small trapezoids of color, juxtaposed, the Paysage and Goûter by Jean Metzinger, classic cubist... A Marine by Lhote {{who invented the}} cubistic water. A figure nue by de la Fresnaye, which seems made with wooden bricks, and a mind-boggling Essai pour trois portraits by Fernand Léger. There too, Gleizes, a Chasse and a Portrait, which I find deeply regrettable, because the author, once, <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> had talent.|$|E

25|$|His {{superior}} {{officers and}} the state Governor Isham G. Harris were surprised that someone of Forrest's wealth and prominence had enlisted as a soldier, especially since major planters were exempted from service. They commissioned him as a lieutenant colonel and authorized him to recruit and train a battalion of Confederate mounted rangers. In October 1861, Forrest was given command of a regiment, the 3rd Tennessee Cavalry. Though Forrest had no prior formal military training or experience, he had exhibited leadership, and soon <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> had a gift for successful tactics.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} wicketkeeping {{reputation}} {{standing up to}} the stumps and taking tricky spin bowling from Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson, and later Colin McCool, but in his 40s he <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> was no slouch standing back to faster bowlers as Somerset's attack turned successfully to seam in the early 1960s. He set the county records for stumpings in a season, in 1949, and for catches in a season, in 1963, {{as well as for the}} most dismissals in a season. He also set the county record for the number of career dismissals, was the first to make six dismissals in an innings, and equalled the county record of nine dismissals in a match.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013 three Metropolitan Police {{officers}} were arrested {{on suspicion of}} perverting the course of justice with regard to evidence given at Rigg's inquest. In April 2014 the IPCC passed files to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider whether criminal charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice should be brought against two of the officers, Sgt Paul White and PC Mark Harratt. White had given evidence at the inquest that he had checked on Rigg and carried out a risk assessment while he was detained in the police van, including his posture and his general demeanour, but CCTV evidence <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> had not visited the van at any time. Harratt had corroborated White's version of events. The third officer was cleared by the IPCC.|$|E

25|$|In almost 18months, he {{had played}} a total of only 937.5minutes of {{competitive}} rugby union, but was nonetheless {{given a chance to}} prove his fitness for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Initially Wilkinson was left out of the 44-strong squad which was announced by Clive Woodward on 11 April 2005. However, on 8 May Woodward announced he had added the fly-half to the squad after Wilkinson had <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> was injury-free and fit. Wilkinson made his first international appearance since the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final on 23 May at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as the Lions played Argentina. Wilkinson, {{along with the rest of}} the team, played poorly, but kicked a conversion and six penalties; he salvaged a 25–25 draw with the last kick of the game.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore {{recovered}} the ring from Marvolo's estate, recognizing it {{as both a}} Horcrux {{and one of the}} Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone to talk to his deceased family. The curse destroyed his hand and began to spread throughout his body. Though the spread was partly contained in the destroyed and blackened hand by Snape, Dumbledore was doomed, having at most a year to live. In their Kings Cross encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that this <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> had learned nothing from his past mistakes and ambitions for using the Hallows, and was {{part of the reason for}} his fear that Harry might also become obsessed with their power if told of them.|$|E
25|$|Heathcote {{then went}} out to the East Indies {{commanding}} a ship of the line. After service transporting the ambassadors to Persia, he was based on the Indian coast. While there he took a bold decision to open despatches and then quit his post to deliver them to the station commanders, who were at the time involved in the Java Expedition. He was court-martialed for this, but though several charges were <b>proved,</b> <b>he</b> was judged to have acted in the service's best interests, and was acquitted. He {{went out to}} the Mediterranean late in the Napoleonic Wars, and commanded the inshore squadron during the blockade of Toulon. He led one of the last attacks on the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Action of 5 November 1813, and retired ashore {{after the end of the}} wars. He developed a new technique for hoisting staysails, received further promotions, and a knighthood, while in retirement, before his death in 1851 at the rank of admiral.|$|E

25|$|García studied law, {{first at}} the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, and earned his law degree at the National University of San Marcos in 1971. A year later, he left Peru for Spain, where he studied for a PhD. in law, for years Alan Garcia claimed to have earned a PhD, however in 2014, {{documents}} from the university <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> never finished his PhD. In 1974, he travelled to France {{with other members of}} the APRA to study at the prestigious University of Paris I. After earning a degree in sociology, he was called by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre to come back to Peru in order to run for the Constituent Assembly election in 1978. García was elected for public office as Member of the Assembly, impressing his colleagues with his oratory and skillful rhetoric. As Secretary of Organization of the APRA, he was assigned to conduct the party's public affairs during the wake of Haya de la Torre's death.|$|E
25|$|Coppola {{left his}} gun and hat at the murder scene. Since the {{advancement}} of forensics since 1977, a judge ordered Coppola to submit a DNA test. When the FBI requested a DNA sample on August 8, 1996 which could have <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> was at the murder scene, Coppola fled his Spring Lake, New Jersey home with his wife. He spent most his time moving between apartments in San Francisco and New York City. During his time on the run, he was featured on America's Most Wanted. Although on the run, authorities believed he was still holding power over organized crime in New Jersey as a fugitive. A fellow New Jersey mobster for the Genovese family and a Furmara/Coppola associate, was charged by the FBI with illegally harboring Coppola during the months before he was caught and arrested. In April 2002, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey obtained an indictment against Fiumara for conspiring to assist Coppola in Coppola’s flight. In March 2003, {{he pleaded guilty to}} conspiring to conceal and failing to report that he had been in contact with Coppola. In November, a federal judge ordered Fiumara back to prison for eight months for concealing Coppola’s whereabouts.|$|E
500|$|Pickett {{today is}} widely {{perceived}} as being a tragic hero of sorts—a flamboyant officer who wanted to lead his troops into a glorious battle, but always missed the opportunity until the disastrous charge at Gettysburg. Historian John C. Waugh wrote of Pickett, [...] "An excellent brigade commander, he never <b>proved</b> <b>he</b> could handle a division." [...] He quotes George B. McClellan, the Union general, as saying: [...] "Perhaps {{there is no doubt}} that he was the best infantry soldier developed on either side during the Civil War." ...|$|E

She died on October 30, plunging him into despair a week before the election. Poor results for the Democrats in those states that had elections for other offices in September and October presaged defeat for Greeley, and so it <b>proved.</b> <b>He</b> received 2,834,125 votes to 3,597,132 for Grant, who secured 286 electors to 66 chosen for Greeley.
