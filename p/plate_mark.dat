The maps were carefully constructed from {{the best and most}} recent surveys. They were finely engraved on a large-scale, printed on high quality paper, and carefully hand colored. Because of the great expense involved in the production and publication, the atlas was published in five parts between 1819 and 1823. A collected edition appeared in the latter year, with subsequent editions in 1825, 1833, 1839, and perhaps other years. Copies of any edition are now quite rare. The map has many interesting aspects, probably the most intriguing is the implied annexation of (what became) western Canada and Alaska to the United States.

Heymann, or Hermann, Steinthal was a German philologist and philosopher. Born in Gröbzig, Anhalt-Köthe in 1823, he attended the University of Berlin, where he later taught. Between 1852 and 1855 he studied Chinese while living in Paris. In 1860, he co-founded the Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft with his brother-in-law, Moritz Lazarus. Steinthal died in Berlin in 1899. Hermann Struck was born Chaim Aaron ben David in 1876 in Germany. He is best known as a master etcher, lithographer and early Zionist. He studied for five years at the Berlin Academy and in 1908 wrote Die Kunst des Radierens (The Art of Etching), while mentoring artists such as Marc Chagall, Max Liebermann and Lesser Ury. His art was included in an exhibition at the Fifth Zionist Congress and he helped establish the religious Zionist movement called Mizrachi. Struck was an Orthodox Jew but believed that culture and religion could thrive cooperatively in Israel. He immigrated to Haifa where he created an artistic community and participated {{in the development of the}} Tel Aviv Museum and the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem.

In a box with line border above the image, each engraving bears {{the day in the}} church calendar with which is is associated, a Bible citation, and the year of Christ's life to which it pertains. At the right end of the box is an arabic numeral, giving the sequence of the image in Christ's life, by which the prints in the present work are ordered. Below the arabic numeral is a roman number, giving the sequence of the print's subject in the Gospel readings through the church year, by which the engravings are arranged in Nadal's Adnotationes et meditationes. The images bear letters keyed to explanations in a box beneath. The t. p. and plates are after drawings by Bernardino Passeri and Martin de Vos. They were engraved by Jeronimus, Antonie and Jan Wierx, Adriaen and Jan Collaert, and Karel van Mallery. Engraved head-piece, p. [3], and tail-piece, p. [8]. Three large foliated woodcut initials and one small. Engraved title leaf. Second leaf is dedication to Clement VIII by Jacobus Ximenez, Secretary of the Society of Jesus. Reader's preface, p. [5].
