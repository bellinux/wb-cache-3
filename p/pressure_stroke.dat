40|$|Introduction & Objective: Pain on mid-sternotomy {{incision}} site after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG) is {{a common}} problem has {{a negative effect on}} quality of life and follow-up treatment. Thus the present study aimed to determine the effect of light massage therapy by patient's Light <b>Pressure</b> <b>Stroking</b> Massage Therapy on Patients' Satisfaction and Quality of Pain Control in post-CABG patients. Materials & Methods: In this semi - experimental study, 72 post-CABG patients were randomly divided into an intervention and a control group. The intervention group received Light <b>Pressure</b> <b>Stroking</b> massage by the nurse for 20 minutes in 4 sessions. The control group received routine care. Patient’s satisfaction and quality of pain control were assessed by brief pain inventory (BPI) and Idvall quality of life questionnaire before and after the intervention. Then, the data was analyzed by student t-test, paired t-test and chi-square by SPSS software version 18. Results: Mean (SD) scores for Satisfaction and Quality of Pain Control before the intervention in the case group were 5. 402 ± 1. 601 and 49. 324 ± 2. 569 and in the control group were 4. 452 ± 2. 123 and 48. 425 ± 2. 505 respectively, that did not show a significant difference (P > 0. 05). After the intervention, Mean (SD) scores for Satisfaction and Quality of Pain Control in the case group, were 8. 402 ± 1. 200 and 64. 612 ± 2. 004 and in the control group were 5. 321 ± 1. 500 and 51. 513 ± 2. 234 respectively, that showed a significant difference (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Regarding the finding of study, use of Light <b>Pressure</b> <b>Stroking</b> massage therapy can increase Patients' Satisfaction and Quality of Pain Control of patients after coronary artery bypass surgery and due to low cost and simplicity of this method, it can perhaps be used as a complement to drug therapy and postoperative interventions used in these patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Both pulse <b>pressure</b> {{variation}} and <b>stroke</b> volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation predict preload responsiveness. However, because ventilatory and cardiac frequencies {{are not the}} same, {{increasing the number of}} breaths sampled may increase calculated pulse <b>pressure</b> {{variation and}} <b>stroke</b> volume variation because larger (max) and smaller (min) pulse <b>pressure</b> and <b>stroke</b> volume may occur. Tidal volume and contractility may also alter pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation. We hypothesized that the magnitude of pulse pressure variation would increase with sampling duration, and that both tidal volume and contractility would independently alter pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation. METHODS: In seven pentobarbital-anesthetized intact dogs arterial and left ventricular pressure (Millar) and left ventricular volume (Leycom) were measured over 8 intermittent positive-pressure ventilation breaths at tidal volume of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL/kg (f ≤ 20 /min, 40 % inspiratory time) under baseline, esmolol (2 mg/min), dobutamine infusions (5 μg/kg/min) and following volume loading (500 mL NaCl). Stroke volume variation was calculated using pulse contour method (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) averaged over 12 secs. Pulse pressure variation was calculated as 100 × (PPmax - PPmin) /PPmean and calculated over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 breaths. RESULTS: Pulse pressure variation increased progressively with increasing sampling duration up to but not exceeding five breaths. The effect on sampling duration was increased by greater tidal volume. Esmolol infusion decreased both pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation as compared with baseline (p < 0. 05) at all tidal volume levels. However, dobutamine did not alter either pulse <b>pressure</b> variation or <b>stroke</b> volume variation. CONCLUSION: Sampling duration, tidal volume, and beta-adrenergic blockade differentially alters pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Thus, separate validation is required to define threshold pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation values used to drive resuscitation algorithms. © 2008 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation to predict fluid responsiveness during mechanical ventilation in patients undergoing open chest surgery by comparing their respective correlations with cardiac output changes induced by leg elevation. Serial leg elevation manoeuvres were performed before and after sternotomy in 15 patients scheduled for elective off-pump coronary bypass surgery. Under closed chest conditions, both pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation correlated well with the induced cardiac output changes (r = 0. 856, p = 0. 002 and r = 0. 897, p = 0. 0012, respectively).

5000|$|When {{considering}} tickling {{in terms}} of its qualities as a sensation, it results from a mild stimulation moving across the skin. The dual character of tickling refers to the associated behaviors that include smiling, laughter, twitching, withdrawal and goose bumps. The tickle can be divided into two separate categories of sensation, knismesis and gargalesis. Knismesis, also known as a [...] "moving itch", is a mildly annoying sensation caused by a light movement on the skin, such as from a crawling insect. This may explain why it has evolved in many animals. Gargalesis reactions refers to a pleasurable, laughter-provoking feeling caused by a harsher, deeper <b>pressure,</b> <b>stroked</b> across the skin in various regions of the body. These reactions are thought to be limited to humans and other primates, although some research has indicated that rats can also be tickled in this way.|$|R

Maintenance of stroke volume with increasing output pressure was by increases in both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane on pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation in pigs undergoing hemorrhage. METHODS: Twenty-five pigs were randomly anesthetized with isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data were registered sequentially at minimum alveolar concentrations of 1. 00 (M 1), 1. 25 (M 2), and 1. 00 (M 3). Then, following withdrawal of 30 % of the estimated blood volume, these data were registered at a minimum alveolar concentrations of 1. 00 (M 4) and 1. 25 (M 5). RESULTS: The minimum alveolar concentration increase from 1. 00 to 1. 25 (M 2) decreased the cardiac index and increased the central venous pressure, but only modest changes in mean arterial pressure, pulse <b>pressure</b> variation and <b>stroke</b> volume variation were observed in all groups from M 1 to M 2. A significant decrease in mean arterial pressure was only observed with desflurane. Following blood loss (M 4), pulse <b>pressure</b> variation, <b>stroke</b> volume variation and central venous pressure increased (p < 0. 001) and mean arterial pressure decreased in all groups.

40|$|Lymphangions, the {{segments}} of lymphatic vessel between two valves, contract cyclically and actively pump, analogous to cardiac ventricles. Besides having a discernable systole and diastole, lymphangions {{have a relatively}} linear end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (with slope Emax) and a nonlinear end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (with slope Emin). To counter increased microvascular filtration (causing increased lymphatic inlet pressure), lymphangions must respond to modest increases in transmural pressure by increasing pumping. To counter venous hypertension (causing increased lymphatic inlet and outlet pressures), lymphangions must respond to potentially large increases in transmural pressure by maintaining lymph flow. We therefore hypothesized that the nonlinear lymphangion pressure-volume relationship allows transition from a transmural pressure-dependent stroke volume to a transmural pressure-independent stroke volume as transmural pressure increases. To test this hypothesis, we applied a mathematical model based on the time-varying elastance concept typically applied to ventricles (the ratio of pressure to volume cycles periodically from a minimum, Emin, to a maximum, Emax). This model predicted that lymphangions increase stroke volume and stroke work with transmural pressure if Emin < Emax at low transmural <b>pressures,</b> but maintain <b>stroke</b> volume and stroke work if Emin= Emax at higher transmural pressures. Furthermore, at higher transmural <b>pressures,</b> <b>stroke</b> work is evenly distributed among a chain of lymphangions. Model predictions were tested by comparison to previously reported data. Model predictions were consistent with reported lymphangion properties and pressure-flow relationships of entire lymphatic systems. The nonlinear lymphangion pressure-volume relationship therefore minimizes edema resulting from both increased microvascular filtration and venous hypertension...|$|R
