5|$|Gauguin {{was celebrated}} by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous {{retrospective}} exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work {{led directly to}} Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio {{was a friend of}} Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> oeuvre in Paris.|$|E

5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George {{to announce}} his candidacy for governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most political observers because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. He promised to run the state government like a business and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E
5|$|The Massachusetts popular party gained {{ground in}} the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and {{selected}} as its clerk, in which position {{he was responsible for}} official House papers. In the coming years, Adams used his position as clerk to great effect in <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> political message. Joining Adams in the House was John Hancock, a new representative from Boston. Hancock was a wealthy merchant—perhaps the richest man in Massachusetts—but a relative newcomer to politics. He was initially a protégé of Adams, and he used his wealth to promote the Whig cause.|$|E

Yusuf Sayfa {{refused to pay}} taxes to Muhammad, prompting the latter to attempt collecting them through military means. However, while {{en route to the}} Akkar to pressure the Sayfas, Muhammad was shot dead outside of Tripoli on Yusuf Sayfa's orders in 1591. Muhammad's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule. Following his death, Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs' nawahi in Tripoli Eyalet, and he expelled the Hubaysh clan, <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> Shia Muslim Hamade allies from Jbeil at their expense. In 1593, Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad's widow and thus acquired the Assafs' wealth. He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2011, Paul {{announced}} that he would forgo seeking another term in Congress in order to focus on his presidential bid.

At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Paul received 190 delegate votes. In January 2013, Paul retired from Congress but still remains active on college campuses, giving speeches <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> libertarian vision. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector in the 2016 presidential election, making him the oldest person to receive an electoral vote, as well as the second registered Libertarian Presidential candidate in history to receive an Electoral College vote after John Hospers.|$|E

5|$|Outmaneuvering the {{opposition}} of Vogoride and his group of conservative followers during new elections for the Divan, Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17, 1859, leading to Cuza's election for a similar position in Wallachia (February 5)—the de facto union {{of the two countries}} as the United Principalities. In October 1858, he made a clear proposal regarding the unification, which, as he noted, carried the vote with only two opposing voices (Alecu Balș and Nectarie Hermeziu, the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric), being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată, the peasant representative for Putna County. During 1859, Kogălniceanu again stood in the ad hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp, while <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> candidature in Bucharest—thus profiting from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty. On the day Cuza took the throne, to begin his rule as Domnitor, Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5|$|Southampton {{returned}} to Britain {{within a few}} months of the battle, and Macnamara was appointed to command the 32-gun , initially on the Irish station. During his time there he captured the 10-gun French privateer Echange, and on 20 October 1799 came across a convoy of Spanish merchantmen escorted by five frigates and two brigs. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority Macnamara attacked and captured one of the frigates, but was forced to abandon his prize after the other Spanish frigates came to her defence. He also captured a merchant ship, and having taken her men off, burnt her. Cerberus sustained minor damage during the engagement, and had only four men wounded. The Admiralty showed their approval of Macnamara's actions by <b>promoting</b> <b>his</b> first lieutenant. Macnamara was then sent out to the West Indies, where he cruised off Jamaica and San Domingo until the Peace of Amiens. Cerberus was then paid off in February 1803, and Macnamara went ashore.|$|E
