40|$|Includes bibliographyThis article {{outlines}} {{the changes that}} occurred in employment between 2004 and 2009 and reviews the links that households established with the labour market. An {{increase in the number}} of jobs registered with the social security system was one of the key features of the period. Moreover, half of the rise in the observed employment rate represented jobs obtained by household members other than heads of household. The increase in protected employment also benefited social sectors that have traditionally been neglected, although there are factors that restrict the access of certain population groups to such jobs. Another research finding is that if the head of the household has a <b>protected</b> <b>job,</b> other household members have better chances of gaining a similar job themselves...|$|E

30|$|A second common set {{of labor}} laws, {{employment}} protection legislation (EPL), restricts employers’ ability to dismiss workers—reducing flows into unemployment but also out of it. Strict EPL can slow new employment if restrictions on dismissing workers make employers wary of hiring someone new. For this reason, restrictions on dismissal can increase unemployment, the duration of unemployment, and the attraction of fixed-term contracts. Past a certain threshold, it can even cause employers {{to turn to the}} untaxed, unregulated labor market. Beyond affecting flows into and out of employment, EPL creates an “insider-outsider” divide. Those that have a <b>protected</b> <b>job</b> (“insiders”) are relatively guarded from losing it, while the inactive and unemployed (“outsiders”) find it more difficult to gain employment. EPL changes the distribution of jobs with important implications for first-time job seekers, youth (especially), women, the disabled, and other disadvantaged groups.|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor Thesis is {{dealt with}} the forms of {{employment}} {{of people with disabilities}} which used social therapeutic workshops. The target group for this thesis are employees, past employees at social therapeutic workshops. The aim is to find out the process of employment of people with disabilities, which job positions and in which labor law relationship are employed and describe which role had the use of social therapeutic workshops in the proces sof employment. Theoretical part summarises literary knowledge and includes three chapters. The first chapter is concerned with the concept of disability, and also describes the categorization and the types of disabilities. An adult with a disability is also definied in this chapter and meaning of having a job for him. Moreover, professional preparations of people with disabilities are mentioned. The second chapter deals with social services which are definied legislatively. Social therapeutic workshop is described in detail. Furthermore, services of social actvization for seniors and for people with disabilities and the service of social rehabilitation are described. The third chapter of the thesis handles disabled people at job market. This part characterizes open and <b>protected</b> <b>job</b> market including the tools of employment politics to the disabled. Practical part includes the aims. There can be found the decription of methodology used to achieve my aims in other subchapters. I have created twelve case studies od people who found employment at social therapeutic workshops. The main result of all case studies is that the main benefit of social therapeutic workshops is forwarding, keeping and stabilizing of job comptence...|$|E
40|$|This {{comprehensive}} study finds that tariffs and quantitative import restrictions {{in place in}} 1990 cost American consumers about $ 70 billion, more than 1 percent of GDP. The net national welfare loss, after deducting tariff revenues and transfers to domestic producers, was $ 11 billion, of which perhaps 70 percent was captured by foreign producers as quota rents. Nearly half of the consumer costs are accounted for by 21 highly protected sectors, {{and more than a}} third, $ 24 billion, are attributable to textiles and apparel alone. The cost to consumers of "special" protection aside from textiles and apparel dropped sharply in the 1980 s, from $ 15 billion in 1984 to $ 6 billion in 1990. If it is ratified, the Uruguay Round will result in a further large reduction in these costs, particularly in textiles and apparel. Still, the annual consumer costs per American job "saved" by "special" protection range from $ 100, 000 to over $ 1 million and average $ 170, 000. Consumers thus pay over six times the average annual compensation of manufacturing workers to preserve each job. In terms of net national welfare, the cost per <b>protected</b> <b>job</b> is about $ 54, 000. This figure far exceeds the cost per worker of the most generous adjustment program entailing income support, retraining, and relocation. This study will be indispensable to public and private sector decision makers and analysts concerned about the very high costs and small benefits of US import barriers. Teachers will find this book an engrossing way to introduce students to the cost of protection calculations that government economists and trade negotiators frequently make. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} called Coordinated {{rehabilitation}} of clients from selected wards of the Hospital in Ostrov. The {{aim of the}} thesis was to compare course and schedule of the coordinated system applied on the clients from selected hospital wards in Ostrov Hospital. Secondary goal was to survey services provided within {{the frame of the}} coordinated system of rehabilitation in Ostrov Hospital. In theoretic part of work was performed author?s knowledge of special scientific literature. Notion Coordinated rehabilitation was defined as well as its incorporation within legal regulations. Furthermore International Classification of functional abilities, disabilities and health were referred to briefly. Last subchapter of the theoretical section was dedicated to the introduction of the Ostrov. Observational part was compiled by using method of the qualitative research. Selected technique of the data collection was documentary analysis, survey and questionnaire. Author worked with health documentation of the three clients that was transformed into three casuistries. Those are listed in the chapter Results. Author had asked clients for their permission to be mentioned and published in her work and she received from all casuistic clients their advance agreement in written form. Last supplementary method of the data collection was knowledge questionnaire. This was compiled {{on the basis of the}} theoretical part of this work and distributed among staff of the above mentioned wards where the clients were hospitalized. The aim of the research was to answer question, whether single units of the coordinated rehabilitation system applied on the clients from selected wards of the Ostrov hospital are well interconnected? Author?s detailed statement is listed in chapter called Discussion, where she associates herself with theories of specialized publications on Coordinated rehabilitation system written by other authors. During the research phase author came to the conclusion, that both medical and social elements of the Coordinated rehabilitation system work perfectly. Both elements were linked together. However they lacked continuity, contingency or client awareness in the area of working and pedagogical rehabilitation. In neither of casuistries was applied this elementary unit of the Coordinated rehabilitation system. Author?s presupposition was intensified by partial unfamiliarity of the staff with pedagogical and working rehabilitation. For example in question no. 11 where 43 % of the interviewees declared that the only job opportunity available for the handicapped people is protected workshop and <b>protected</b> <b>job</b> for the disabled people. This fact resulted from the knowledge questionnaire given to the staff of Ostrov hospital. Hence functionality and connectivity of the system was primarily influenced by the cooperation of the individual specialists who are part of the client?s multidisciplinary team. Secondly the efficiency of the provided care resulted from the cooperation of the individual clients. This work can be used for educational purposes of individual staff in Ostrov hospital, alternatively in other health centres. Additionally it can be used as valuable source of information for students of health and social care studies, helping health workers, but also for non-professional laic public...|$|E
40|$|In the Bachelor's thesis I {{have dealt}} with {{differentiation}} of tenders and rehabilitation methods. Specifically, individuals with mental or multiple disabilities and for providers of social services and other bodies. In the theoretical part I focused on defining the basic terms relating to that issue. In the introductory chapter I dealt with {{the definition of the}} concept of mental disability, causes of its creation and definition of degrees of mental retardation. The next chapter is devoted to the combined disability, specifically the yoke of the definition, causes of and classification. In the third chapter is devoted to the importance of the work, the status of the work in a person's life and the status of work for persons with disabilities, including individuals with mental or multiple disabilities in Bachelor thesis I. In the next chapter, I deal with comprehensive rehabilitation system, specifically the remedies rehabilitation, educational resources, social resources, rehabilitation, rehabilitation and special attention devoted work resources, rehabilitation, which will directly affect the Bachelor thesis. Furthermore, I determine a target group the work of rehabilitation and the preconditions for its implementation. In other chapters is devoted to the specification of tools and resources work rehabilitation, employment policy tools and I define jobs that are offered to persons with intellectual disabilities. In the practical part of the thesis, first determine the main aim and target work. The main goal was to determine what are the menus and methods of rehabilitation for people with mental or multiple disabilities with providers of social services. As the target I had set to determine what are the possibilities of transmission from individual to social services on the open employment market. Specifically, I've focused on the resources provided by the rehabilitation of daily, weekly care centers or day service center, in addition to the socio-therapeutic workshops, in a sheltered employment, and employment on the open employment market. To meet the objectives I used a qualitative approach, specifically the semi-structured interview with six providers of social services of the South Bohemian region The analysis of the information obtained, I discovered that if the device is operated daily, weekly social welfare institution or Centre, day services, the services provided are identical, not different from each other. In the case of socio-therapeutic workshops is the diversity of the wider, each device provides a variety of services, different options, some devices have socio-therapeutic workshops directly on the device, others have socio-therapeutic workshops and externally, outside of your device. Protected jobs are also in the majority of providers of social services offered both within and outside the device, always the odd jobs, such as in the kitchen, cleaning, in teahouses and the like. It always depends on the type and degree of disability, {{on the basis of a}} levy for the client to the appropriate activities. Location of the client on the open employment market is not very common in most devices, some devices that offer clients or do not provide. Partial objective was to detect transmission, I found that the only limiting factor is the client's disability that limits its options and device options, of course, that the services it offers and delivers. The aim of all devices is to achieve the greatest possible degree of autonomy of the client and allow it to advance from care centers or day service center in the socio-therapeutic workshops, found a <b>protected</b> <b>job,</b> and a job on the open employment market...|$|E
