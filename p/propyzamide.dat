In order to accommodate for the intended use of <b>propyzamide</b> in Germany, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in leaves and flowers of herbal infusions to 0. 4 mg/kg and in roots of herbal infusions to 0. 15 mg/kg. According to EFSA, the residue data are sufficient to support the extrapolation of residue data on dried peppermint, lemon balm leaves, narrow leaf plantain and camomile flowers to the whole group of dried leaves and flowers of herbal infusions with a MRL proposal of 0. 4 mg/kg. The submitted residue data on black snakeroot can be extrapolated to dried roots of herbal infusions with a MRL proposal of 0. 02 mg/kg (the LOQ). The applicant has to confirm the applicability of the enforcement method to analyse <b>propyzamide</b> residues in dried herbs. A minor data gap was identified regarding the freezer storage stability of <b>propyzamide</b> in dry matrices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of <b>propyzamide</b> on the crops under consideration and the use of dried plant parts (leaves, flowers and roots) in herbal infusions will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E

Some plots had not been previously treated {{with one of these}} herbicides. Other plots had been treated annually during the past 12 years with the same herbicide. One herbicide, and always the same, was thus applied to each plot. In the plots treated {{for the first time with}} either diuron, chlorotoluron, or simazine, the soil half-lives of these herbicides in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer were 81, 64, and 59 days, respectively. In the plots treated with the same herbicide for 12 years, the corresponding soil half-lives were 37, 11, and 46 days. Diuron thus produced a moderately enhanced biodegradation, chlorotoluron a high one, and simazine a low but significant one. In another pear tree orchard planted on sandy loam soil, each plot was treated in April 1998 with one of the amide <b>propyzamide</b> (1. 25 or 1. 0 AI kg ha(- 1)) or diflufenican (250 g AI ha(- 1)) herbicides.

A field trial was conducted to identify alternative herbicides for the management of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in field pea. Preplant (PP) soil applications of pyroxasulfone; prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; propyzamide; trifluralin alone or with triallate or with diuron; or imazamox applied POST were evaluated for their effectiveness and crop safety. <b>Propyzamide,</b> pyroxasulfone, or imazamox applied POST provided a high level of smooth barley control, did not cause any crop injury, and increased field pea grain or forage yield compared with the nontreated. Furthermore, <b>propyzamide</b> or pyroxasulfone reduced panicle density and seed production in smooth barley, whereas the effectiveness of POST imazamox varied over the two seasons. Dimethenamid-P reduced the impact of smooth barley on field pea yield, but cause stunting, and was less effective than <b>propyzamide,</b> pyroxasulfone, and imazamox in reducing smooth barley seed production. Negative relationship between field pea yield and smooth barley panicle density indicated that smooth barley is highly competitive in field pea crops and can cause large yield losses.

Sorption was investigated in batch systems as well as using a centrifugation technique to investigate changes in pesticide concentration in soil pore water over incubation periods of up to 28 days. Studies with small soil columns compared leaching of technical and formulated pesticide for irrigation events (6 pore volumes) 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after treatment. There were no differences in sorption of technical and formulated <b>propyzamide</b> when measured by batch systems. Sorption of technical material was significantly {{greater than that of}} formulated pesticide in sandy loam (p< 0. 05), but not in sandy silt loam when measured by centrifugation of soil incubated at field capacity. Partition coefficients measured by batch and centrifugation methods were similar after 1 day and those measured by centrifugation increased by factors of 5. 3 to 7. 5 over the next 4 weeks. The mass of <b>propyzamide</b> leached from soil columns ranged between 1. 1 ± 0. 33 % and 14. 4 ± 3. 2 % of the applied amount. For all time intervals and in both soils, the mass of <b>propyzamide</b> leached was significantly greater (two-sided t-tests, p< 0. 001) for the formulated product than for the technical material. Leached losses decreased consistently with time in the sandy loam soil (losses after 28 days were 14 - 17 % of those after 1 day), but with less consistency in the sandy silt loam. There was a highly significant effect of formulation on the leaching of <b>propyzamide</b> through soil (two-way ANOVA, p< 0. 001) as well as highly significant effects of time and soil type (p< 0. 001).

The active substance <b>propyzamide</b> is well known from the product KerbTM FLO (containing 500 g/L <b>propyzamide,</b> suspension concentrate, SC) which is widely used in winter oilseed rape (WITTROCK et al., 2008). Aminopyralid is formulated in the commercial product Runway (clopyralid + picloram + aminopyralid). Milestone is applied with a use rate of 1. 5 L/ha as a post-emergence herbicide from growth stage BBCH 14 of the crop {{at the beginning of}} November until February. Kerb FLO is applied with a use rate of 1. 875 L/ha at the same timing. The efficacy of Milestone and Kerb FLO was tested in randomised and replicated plot trials in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Milestone and Kerb FLO showed comparable and very high control levels against monocotyledonous species such as Alopecurus myosuroides, Apera spica-venti, Bromus species and volunteer cereals. Milestone shows a broader spectrum of activity vs. Kerb FLO against dicotyledonous weeds such as Matricaria chamomilla, Papaver rhoeas and Centaurea cyanus. The use of Milestone in dense crops (as the situation was in autumn 2014 for many areas in Germany) shows very high efficacy levels as well. The comparison of various application timings between end of October until beginning of December confirms the application date early November for best results.

40|$|Freezing and thawing of soil affect {{water flow}} in the vadose zone for {{instance}} by altering soil structure or ice blocking parts of the pore system. Changes in soil hydraulic properties impact solute transport and therefore the risk that pesticides and other agrochemicals are transported towards groundwater. In models currently used for pesticide registration freezing of soil is not accounted for, even though some substances –especially those applied in autumn– may persist throughout the winter. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of soil freezing on pesticide leaching for a Swedish clayey topsoil. The herbicides clomazone, <b>propyzamide</b> and diflufenican and the non-reactive tracer bromide were applied to undisturbed soil columns (20 cm high, 12. 5 cm diameter), which were frozen to - 2 °C and exposed to simulated rain. Three repetitions of the freezing-irrigation cycle were performed. Pesticide and bromide concentrations were measured in the effluent and compared to the results of non-frozen columns. X-ray tomography was used to visualise and quantify the macropore structure. Most concentrations of the least mobile pesticide (diflufenican) were below the limit of quantification. Relative leaching of pesticides was between 0. 15 % and 2. 67 % of the applied amount for clomazone and between 0. 10 % and 1. 67 % for <b>propyzamide.</b> Considering all three irrigation events no significant difference was found between frozen and non-frozen soil columns regarding pesticide transport. However, relative leaching in percent of the applied amount as well as concentrations of clomazone and <b>propyzamide</b> were significantly higher in the non-frozen columns during the second irrigation event. The non-reactive tracer showed the same trend, with the difference that the major part of the transport appeared already during the first irrigation event, showing significantly higher amounts of bromide transported in the non-frozen columns. A possible explanation is that soil freezing created fine voids and therefore increased diffusion into soil aggregates and reduced preferential transport...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} the applied crop protection products on crops is lost to the atmosphere. Models describing the prediction of volatility and potential fate of these substances in the environment have become an important tool in the pesticide authorisation procedure at the EU level. The main topic {{of this research is}} to assess the rate and extent of volatilisation of ten pesticides after application on field crops. RESULTS: For eight of the ten pesticides, the volatilisation rates modelled with PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales) corresponded well to the calculated rates modelled with ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System). For the other pesticides, large {{differences were found between the}} models. Formulation might affect the volatilisation potential of pesticides. Increased leaf wetness increased the volatilisation of <b>propyzamide</b> and trifloxystrobin at the end of the field trial. The reliability of pesticide input parameters, in particular the vapour pressure, is discussed. CONCLUSION: Volatilisation of <b>propyzamide,</b> pyrimethanil, chlorothalonil, diflufenican, tolylfluanid, cyprodinil and E- and Z-dimethomorph from crops under realistic environmental conditions can be modelled with the PEARL model, as corroborated against field observations.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} co-formulants {{are added to}} {{commercial}} pesticide formulations to enhance their biological effectiveness, but their impacts on the behaviour of active substances are largely unknown {{due to lack of}} regulatory measures concerning their use. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the impacts of co-formulants on pesticide sorption and leaching through soil. Leaching and sorption experiments were carried out using technical grade and commercial formulations of four different pesticides at various intervals from application in two soils from the Blackwood and Bishampton associations. The effects of formulation, residence time and soil type on the leaching behaviour of pesticides were all found to be highly statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Both solubility of the active substance and the type of formulation also influenced the effect of formulation on leaching behaviour of pesticides. The relative difference in mass leached between formulated and technical material of low solubility pesticides was less than that for pesticides with greater water solubility. Greater leaching losses of pesticide were observed from an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation compared to suspension concentrate (SC) formulation for the fungicide azoxystrobin. Results from sorption and desorption experiments on <b>propyzamide</b> in the two soils showed that the batch-equilibrium method is not suitable to study the effect of formulation on pesticide sorption. Rather it is important to use a centrifugation technique under natural moisture conditions to characterise these interactions. The effect of formulation on sorption of <b>propyzamide</b> was highly significant (p< 0. 001) in sandy loam soil, but there was no effect of formulation in the sandy silt loam soil when characterised by a centrifugation technique. Results suggested that any effect of formulation on pesticide sorption was not sufficient to explain fully the effect of formulation on leaching behaviour. Two-site and three-site sorption models were applied and fitted the sorption phase of the experiment well. However, the models failed to describe the observed desorption behaviour of <b>propyzamide.</b> These results highlight gaps in the existing knowledge about the formulation effects on pesticide sorption and leaching through soil and suggest that these effects should be considered during the risk assessment of environmental fate and behaviour of pesticides. ...|$|E

40|$|Poa trivialis is a {{perennial}} grass weed {{commonly found in}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) racetrack swards throughout New Zealand. Its presence is undesirable as it does not tolerate high wear and is susceptible to dying out over the summer. Two pot trials at Massey University and one field trial carried out at the Awapuni racecourse were conducted during winter and spring 1995 to test the relative susceptibility of Poa trivialis and perennial ryegrass {{to a wide range}} of herbicides. A bioassay was also conducted to determine whether herbicide residues from the field trial could affect the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown soon after treatment. Results showed that none of the chemicals at their chosen respective rates could completely remove Poa trivialis from a racetrack sward in the spring without some damage being caused to perennial ryegrass. <b>Propyzamide</b> and fenoxaprop at rates of 0. 2 and 0. 15 kg/ha respectively showed the most potential of the chemicals, severely damaging Poa trivialis (causing 50 to 75 % reductions) with no adverse effect on perennial ryegrass 8 weeks after spraying. <b>Propyzamide</b> can also provide some control of Poa annua. Fenoxaprop was not improved by increasing the application rate or adding an oil. The performance of fenoxaprop was substantially reduced when applied with either MCPA or a picloram/triclopyr mix. Dalapon and asulam showed good potential to control Poa trivialis but at the high rates tested caused variable or harmful effects to perennial ryegrass. Ethofumesate and chlorpropham applied at rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg/ha respectively gave inadequate control of Poa trivialis. None of the above herbicides, when used in the field trial resulted in residues which reduced the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown 3 weeks after spraying. Herbicides tested in the pot trials which showed poor control of Poa trivialis were atrazine, dicamba, isoproturon/diflufenican, linuron, mecoprop, methabenzthiazuron, metsulfuron, pendimethalin, prometryne, thifensulfuron-methyl, triclopyr, and trinexapac-ethyl. Diuron applied at 2. 6 kg/ha provided good control of Poa trivialis but caused significant damage to perennial ryegrass. It is concluded that an integrated management approach that incorporates both cultural and chemical techniques will be required to control Poa trivialis on New Zealand racetracks.

Colocalization studies indicated that NHX 3 and NHX 4 colocalize to the tonoplast. To investigate the role of all vacuolar NHX isoforms, a quadruple knockout nhx 1 nhx 2 nhx 3 nhx 4, lacking all vacuolar NHXs, was generated. Seedlings of nhx 1 nhx 2 nhx 3 nhx 4 displayed significantly reduced growth, with markedly shorter hypocotyls. Under high K+, but not Na+, pronounced root skewing occurred in nhx 1 nhx 2 nhx 3 nhx 4, suggesting that {{the organization of the}} cytoskeleton might be perturbed.

It was shown in greenhouse trials that clethodim selects the haplotype Leu 1781 more weakly (and it shows a higher partial efficacy) than cycloxydim and that heterozygous plants have a lower resistance factor than homozygous plants. The question raised whether the frequency of heterozygous plants has influence on increased efficacy of clethodim under field conditions. At 5 sites target-site resistance was detected. At one location the high proportion of heterozygous plants correlated positive with relative higher control using Select EC 240 (80 %) compared to Focus Ultra (0 %). At two locations with high proportion of homozygous resistant plants Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra treatments without subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO were not sufficient in solo variants. The subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO provided partly, but not sufficient control of black-grass. At one location no resistance was identified. The effect of Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra to control black-grass were comparable high in all variants with and without subsequent treatments of Kerb FLO. The investigations showed clearly a higher degree of control by plants with the haplotype Leu 1781 by the active substance clethodim and pointed out the fact that the frequency of resistant genotypes (homo vs. heterozygous resistant plants) has a clear influence on the resistance selection. The use of DIMs at locations suspected to be resistant should be assured only with the help of <b>propyzamide</b> and nonchemical measurements (e. g. ploughing, crop rotation). The results also indicate {{that it is necessary to}} assess resistance mechanisms in resistance research individually depending on the active ingredients, inheritance and weed species...|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} in plant {{morphogenesis}} is whether cortical microtubules {{are responsible for}} the arrangement and action of β-glucan synthases in the plasma membrane. We prepared isolated plasma membrane sheets with cortical microtubules attached and tested whether β-glucan synthases penetrated through the membrane to form microfibrils and whether these synthases moved in the fluid membrane along the cortical microtubules. This technique enabled us to examine synthesis of β-glucan as a fiber with a two-dimensional structure. The synthesis of β-glucan microfibrils was directed in arrays by cortical microtubules at many loci on the membrane sheets. The microfibrils were mainly arranged along the microtubules, but the distribution of microfibrils was not always parallel to that of the microtubules. The rate of β-glucan elongation as determined directly on the exoplasmic surface was 620 nm per min. When the assembly of microtubules was disrupted by treatment with <b>propyzamide,</b> the β-glucans were not deposited in arrays but in masses. This finding shows that the arrayed cortical microtubules are not required for β-glucan synthesis but are required for the formation of arranged microfibrils on the membrane sheet...|$|E
40|$|Grass and {{broad-leaved}} weeds {{can reduce}} both yields and product marketability of desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus) seed crops, even when cultural control strategies are used. Selective herbicides might economically control these weeds, but, {{prior to this}} study, the few herbicides tolerated by desmanthus did not control key weed contaminants of desmanthus seed crops. In this study, the tolerance of desmanthus cv. Marc to 55 herbicides used for selective weed control in other leguminous crops was assessed in 1 pot trial and 3 Queensland field trials. One field trial assessed the tolerance of desmanthus seedlings to combinations {{of the most promising}} pre-emergent and post emergent herbicides. The pre-emergent herbicides, imazaquin, imazethapyr, pendimethalin, oryzalin and trifluralin, gave useful weed control with very little crop damage. The post-emergent herbicides, haloxyfop, clethodim, <b>propyzamide,</b> carbetamide and dalapon, were safe for controlling grass weeds in desmanthus. Selective post-emergence control of broad-leaved weeds was achieved using bentazone, bromoxynil and imazethapyr. One trial investigated salvaging second-year desmanthus crops from mature perennial weeds, and atrazine, terbacil and hexazinone showed some potential in this role. Overall, our results show that desmanthus tolerates herbicides which collectively control a wide range of weeds encountered in Queensland. These, in combination with cultural weed control strategies, should control most weeds in desmanthus seed crops...|$|E
40|$|Water {{suppliers}} {{in parts}} of Europe currently face occasional Drinking Water Directive compliance challenges {{for a number of}} pesticide active substances including metal- dehyde, clopyralid and <b>propyzamide.</b> Water Framework Directive (WFD) Article 7 promotes a prevention-led (catchment management) approach to such issues. At the same time, European pesticide legislation is driving reduced active substance availability. In this context, embedding agronomic drivers of pesticide use into catchment management and regulatory decision making processes can help to ensure that water quality problems are addressed at source without imposition of disproportionate cost on either agriculture or potable water suppliers. In this study agronomist knowledge, perception and expectations of current and possible future pesticide use was assessed and the significance of this knowledge to other stakeholders involved with pesticide catchment management was evaluated. This was then used to provide insight into the possible impacts of active substance restrictions and associated adaptation options. For many arable crops, further restrictions on the range of pesticides available may cause increased use of alternatives (with potential for "pollution swapping"). However, in many cases alternatives are not available, too costly or lack a proven track record and other adaptation options may be selected which catchment managers {{need to be able to}} anticipate...|$|E
40|$|Nursery {{cultural}} practices {{have been shown}} to greatly influence the morphological and physiological condition of the seedlings- and ultimately their field performance potential. One such practice is the use of herbicides to control weeds in the nursery bed and thus reduce competition. Therefore, the use of herbicides should allow the production of better quality seedlings. However, while herbicides may control the weeds, they may also have an adverse effect {{on the quality of the}} seedlings. The phytotoxicity of most modern herbicides is caused by their disruption of plant metabolism. Herbicides disrupt plant growth and development, and occasionally lead to injury or death, depending upon the intensity of the effect. Thus it is unwise to use herbicides that damage the crop. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of herbicides used in forest nurseries on seedling quality. This project was initiated by COFORD in 1997 to address some of these problems. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior (L.)), beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)), sycamore (Acerpseudoplatanus (L.)), and oak (Quercus robur (L.)) were selected as test species because they are some of the most important tree species used in Irish forestry today. The objectives of the study were: To examine the efficacy of the herbicides oxadiazone, isoxaben, metazachlor, <b>propyzamide,</b> haloxyfop/isoxaben mixture, oxyflurofen, napropamide, simazine, and prometryn, in controlling weeds in a forest nursery; To study the seasonal effects of these herbicides on the morphology of ash, oak, beech, sycamore, and Sitka spruce seedlings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceArabidopsis PHS 1, {{initially}} {{known as}} an actor of cytoskeleton organization, is a positive regulator of flowering in the photoperiodic and autonomous pathways by modulating both CO and FLC mRNA levels. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is a major type of post-translational modification, controlling many biological processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, five genes encoding MAPK phosphatases (MKP) -like proteins have been identified. Among them, <b>PROPYZAMIDE</b> HYPERSENSITIVE 1 (PHS 1) encoding a dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase (DsPTP) {{has been shown to}} be involved in microtubule organization, germination and ABA-regulated stomatal opening. Here, we demonstrate that PHS 1 also regulates flowering under long-day and short-day conditions. Using physiological, genetic and molecular approaches, we have shown that the late flowering phenotype of the knock-out phs 1 - 5 mutant is linked to a higher expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). In contrast, a decline of both CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression is observed in the knock-out phs 1 - 5 mutant, especially at the end of the light period under long-day conditions when the induction of flowering occurs. We show that this partial loss of sensitivity to photoperiodic induction is independent of FLC. Our results thus indicate that PHS 1 plays a dual role in flowering, in the photoperiodic and autonomous pathways, by modulating both CO and FLC mRNA levels. Our work reveals a novel actor in the complex network of the flowering regulation...|$|E
40|$|The sku 6 - 1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana {{exhibits}} altered {{patterns of}} root and organ growth. sku 6 roots, etiolated hypocotyls, and leaf petioles exhibit right-handed axial twisting, and root growth on inclined agar media is strongly right skewed. The touch-dependent sku 6 root skewing phenotype is suppressed by the antimicrotubule drugs <b>propyzamide</b> and oryzalin, and right skewing {{is exacerbated by}} cold treatment. Cloning revealed that sku 6 - 1 is allelic to spiral 1 - 1 (spr 1 - 1). However, modifiers in the Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype backgrounds mask noncomplementation in sku 6 - 1 (Col) /spr 1 - 1 (Ler) F 1 plants. The SPR 1 gene encodes a plant-specific 12 -kD protein that is ubiquitously expressed and belongs to a six-member gene family in Arabidopsis. An SPR 1 :green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion expressed in transgenic seedlings localized to microtubules within the cortical array, preprophase band, phragmoplast, and mitotic spindle. SPR 1 :GFP was concentrated at the growing ends of cortical microtubules and was dependent on polymer growth state; the microtubule-related fluorescence dissipated upon polymer shortening. The protein has a repeated motif at both ends, separated by a predicted rod-like domain, suggesting that it may act as an intermolecular linker. These observations suggest that SPR 1 is involved in microtubule polymerization dynamics and/or guidance, which in turn influences touch-induced directional cell expansion and axial twisting...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to made {{literary}} review about possibilities of weed control in carrot and lettuce. The experimental part of this work was focused on optimization of herbicides weed control in lettuce and carrot. Small plot field trials were carried in 2015. 	Literary review {{was focused on the}} summarizing of information about the particular vegetables. Futhermore, the available literature about weed control in these vegetables were complied, specialy with a focus on mechanical and chemical (herbicide) control. The last section of review is dedicated to optimizing use of herbicides that are not registered in tested vegetables. 	In lettuce, herbicidal efficacy was assessed on Chenopodium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, Mercurialis annua and Echinochloa crus-gali and selectivity of herbicides to crop. In carrot, herbicidal efficacy was assessed on Amaranthus retroflexus, Solanum physalifolium, Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-gali and Mercurialis annua and selectivity of herbicides to crop. Lettuce was treated by herbicide combinations with active ingredients: befor planting or postemergence pendimethalin, postemergence <b>propyzamide,</b> postemergence phenmediphan, postemergence dimethenamid and postemergence pethoxamide. Carrot was treated by herbicide combinations with active ingredients: preemergence aclonifen, preemergence clomazone, preemergence dimethenamid, preemergence pendimethalin, postemergence linuron and postemergence metribuzin. 	In lettuce, were on the plots, where were used pendimethalin and dimethenamid. In carrot, best weed control were on the plots, where were used aclonifen, clomazone and dimethenamid. However, after application these herbicides, highest phytotoxicity was found. The lowest selectivity to both tested vegetables showed dimethenamid...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThorough {{characterisation}} {{of natural}} organic matter (NOM) in natural surface waters remains vital for evaluating pollutant dynamics and interactions with NOM under realistic environmental conditions. Here, we present the characterisation of NOM and pesticide compositions for nine sampling sites over {{the length of}} the Rhone River, also evaluating the advantages and limitations of different analytical techniques to determine how they complement one another. Together with dissolved and particulate organic carbon analyses, the dissolved organic matter (DOM, < 0. 8 mu m) or NOM (unfiltered organic matter) was characterised with gel permeation chromatography, the polarity rapid-assessment method, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate both composition and distribution. An additional objective was the determination of the NOM degradation state (i. e. constantly produced autochthonous or weakly degraded allochthonous species), an important factor in assessing potential NOM-pollutant interactions. The NOM compositions (i. e. proteins, polyhydroxy aromatics, polysaccharides, amino sugars) and proportions were similar between sites, but variations were observed in the relative proportions of autochthonous and allochthonous material from north to south. Anionic proteins and polyhydroxy aromatics in a molecular weight range of similar to 1000 - 1200 Da comprised the majority of the DOM. As a pollutant case study, five pesticides (glyphosate, metalochlor, chlortoluron, isoproturon, <b>propyzamide)</b> and some of their metabolites (aminomethylphosphonic acid, metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid and metolachlor oxanilic acid) were measured. Several exhibited trends with the NOM, particulate organic carbon and suspended particulate matter distributions in the Rhone waters, suggesting a significant influence on pesticide fate and transport in the river...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric {{hybridization}} through microprotoplast-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) is a known {{method for}} overcoming sexual breeding barriers between distantly related plant species. To obtain microprotoplasts, {{it is necessary}} to induce mass micronucleation either in somatic or gametic cells. We have tested the efficiency for micronuclei induction of five mitosis inhibitors, amiprophos-methyl (APM), butamiphos (BUT), chlorpropham (CIPC), oryzalin (ORY) and <b>propyzamide</b> (PRO), on developing microspores of diploid Spathiphyllum wallisii Regel. Besides the used toxins, also the effect of their concentrations and incubation period as well as plant genotypes and material was tested. We observed micronuclei (MNi) in pollen mother cells, dyads and tetrads as well as other abnormalities such as ball metaphases and chromosome bridges. The flower position on the spadix and the type of starting material (dissected anthers vs. complete spadices) did not significantly influence micronucleation frequencies. The highest micronucleation index of 86 % was obtained in microspores treated with 10 lM ORY during 72 h. All six genotypes tested formed micronuclei after this particular treatment, although the efficiency varied between cultivars. Next to ORY, CIPC was also a very efficient MNi inducer. The average number of MNi found in micronucleated cells varied between 1. 67 – 6. 44 for CIPC and 0. 83 – 5. 50 for ORY. The maximal number of MNi observed was 12 for CIPC and 9 for ORY. Our results demonstrate that CIPC and ORY can be applied for mass micronucleation on developing microspores of S. wallisii as a first step of MMCT in aroid interspecific or intergeneric breeding...|$|E
40|$|In {{epidermal}} and mesophyll {{cells of}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves, nuclei become relocated {{in response to}} strong blue light. We previously reported that nuclear positions both in darkness and in strong blue light are regulated by the blue light receptor phototropin 2 in mesophyll cells. Here, we investigate the involvement of phototropin and the actin cytoskeleton in nuclear positioning in epidermal cells. Analysis of geometrical parameters revealed that, in darkness, nuclei were distributed {{near the center of}} the cell, adjacent to the inner periclinal wall, independent of cell shape. Dividing the anticlinal wall into concave, convex, and intermediate regions indicated that, in strong blue light, nuclei became relocated preferably to a concave region of the anticlinal wall, nearest the center of the cell. Mutant analyses verified that light-dependent nuclear positioning was regulated by phototropin 2, while dark positioning of nuclei was independent of phototropin. Nuclear movement was inhibited by an actin-depolymerizing reagent, latrunculin B, but not by a microtubule-disrupting reagent, <b>propyzamide.</b> Imaging actin organization by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that thick actin bundles, periclinally arranged parallel to the longest axis of the epidermal cell, were associated with the nucleus in darkness, whereas under strong blue light, the actin bundles, especially in the vicinity of the nucleus, became arranged close to the anticlinal walls. Light-dependent changes in the actin organization were clear in phot 1 mutant but not in phot 2 and phot 1 phot 2 mutants. We propose that, in Arabidopsis, blue-light-dependent nuclear positioning is regulated by phototropin 2 -dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|E
40|$|TBK 5 is a plant-specific kinesin {{constantly}} {{expressed in}} tobacco BY- 2 cells. An {{analysis of the}} distribution of green fluorescent protein-tagged TBK 5 (GFP–TBK 5) transiently expressed in BY- 2 protoplasts revealed that TBK 5 could associate with microtubules in vivo. GFP–TBK 5 often assembled to form a single particle when accumulated in cells. The particle was located in close proximity to the nucleus, and its formation was accompanied by the develop-ment of a radial array of microtubules emanating from it and the loss of cortical microtubules. Microtubule depolymerization by treatment with <b>propyzamide</b> inhibited particle formation and stimulated the formation of dispersed aggregates of GFP–TBK 5. Through expression of different TBK 5 mutants as GFP fusions, the motor domain, two separated coiled-coil domains and the C-terminal domain of TBK 5 were identified as the domains playing essential roles in particle formation. Mutants with putatively non-motile motor domains or lacking the C-terminal domain were localized to cortical and perinuclear microtubules, whereas those lacking either of the coiled-coil domains were preferentially distributed around the nucleus and along perinuclar microtubules. Further, the deletion of one of the coiled-coil domains or the C-terminal domain was sufficient to inhibit the propyzamide-induced formation of dispersed aggregates, whereas the mutation in the motor domain was not. These results led us to propose a model in which the particle is formed through the microtubule-based movement of GFP–TBK 5 toward the nucleus and subsequent microtubule-independent aggregation based on coiled-coil interactions. The dramatic microtubule rearrange-ment would be explained if GFP–TBK 5 relocated and gathered newly formed microtubules and/or microtubule-nucleating units...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh.) roots {{growing on}} a tilted surface of impenetrable hard-agar media adopt a wave-like pattern {{and tend to}} skew {{to the right of}} the gravity vector (when viewed from the back of the plate through the medium). Reversible root-tip {{rotation}} often accompanies the clockwise and counterclockwise curves that form each wave. These rotations are manifested by epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) along the root. Loss-of-function alleles of ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD 3), a gene previously implicated in the control of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi compartments, resulted in an almost complete suppression of epidermal CFR, root skewing, and waving on hard-agar surfaces. Several other root hair defective mutants (rhd 2 - 1, rhd 4 - 1, and rhd 6 - 1) did not exhibit dramatic alterations in these root growth behaviors, suggesting that a generalized defect in root hair formation is not responsible for the surface-dependent phenotypes of rhd 3. However, similar alterations in root growth behavior were observed in a variety of mutants characterized by defects in cell expansion (cob- 1, cob- 2, eto 1 - 1, eto 2 - 1, erh 2 - 1, and erh 3 - 1). The erh 2 - 1 and rhd 3 - 1 mutants differed from other anisotropic cell expansion mutants, though, by an inability to respond to low doses of the microtubule-binding drug <b>propyzamide,</b> which normally causes enhanced left-handed CFR and right skewing. We hypothesize that RHD 3 may control epidermal CFR, root skewing, and waving on hard-agar surfaces by regulating the traffic of wall- or plasma membrane-associated determinants of anisotropic cell expansion...|$|E
