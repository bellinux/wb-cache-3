5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ,</b> a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.

50|$|Anglicans {{celebrate}} the traditional sacraments, with special emphasis {{being given to}} the Eucharist, also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the Mass.

40|$|ONE <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> MOST popular Latin {{religious}} works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MiddleAges was the Liber de passione Christi et doloribus et planctus Matris eius {{which was}} formerly attributed to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux but has lately {{been attributed to}} the Italian Cistercian abbot Ogerius de Locedio (1136 – 1214). 1 Thematically, the Liber de passione Christi is what is generally known as a Planctus Mariae (‘The Laments of Mary’), 2 in which <b>the</b> Virgin tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> (<b>the</b> Passio) and <b>of</b> her own affliction and sorrow at the crucifixion (the Compassio). Throughout most <b>of</b> Western Europe <b>the</b> Liber de passione Christi was translated, or adapted, into nearly every vernacular in both prose and verse. Rosemary Woolf has commented on <b>the</b> frequent appearance <b>of</b> this text in manuscripts in medieval England (1968, 247 – 48), for in-stance, and similarly John Secor noted its occurrence in medieval France (1985, 322).

40|$|O artigo intende mostrar a origem do rito da adoração da cruz na liturgia de Sexta-feira santa. Para o efeito examinam-se as liturgias romana, galicana e moçarábica. A partir dos documentos estudados, verifica-se que até ao séc. VII a Sexta-feira santa não conhece nenhuma liturgia própria. Em Roma, o sacramentário Gelasianum Vetus é o primeiro livro litúrgico a mencionar, para este dia, uma liturgia da palavra seguida do rito da veneração da cruz e da comunhão dos fiéis. A história deste rito está ligada ao culto da relíquia da verdadeira cruz praticado na liturgia estacional do Papa. A relíquia era levada em procissão da basílica de S. João de Latrão até à basílica de Santa Cruz em Jerusalém, onde era depositada num altar. Na primeira parte do séc. VIII, o Ordo romanus XXIII testemunha esta prática da liturgia papal, decalcando a descrição feita por Egéria sobre os ritos da semana santa em Jerusalém nos finais do séc. IV. A liturgia da Gália ignora qualquer rito de adoração da cruz. Na tradição hispânica, a origem dos ritos de Sexta-feira santa relaciona-se com o Ofício de Laudes, Tércia e Noa, que têm como tema dominante a paixão de Cristo. O autor conclui, por conseguinte, que o rito da adoração da cruz não nasce em Roma nem em Espanha, mas é um desenvolvimento da veneração da relíquia da {{santa cruz}} e do Ofício divino, respectivamente. This article aims to show <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross in the Good Friday liturgy. For this purpose we {{will examine the}} Roman, Gallican and Mozarabic liturgies. From the {{documents}} studied we find that up to the 7 th century no specific liturgy is known. In Rome the sacramentary Gelasianum Vetus is the first liturgical book to mention a liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Word for this day followed by a rite <b>of</b> veneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross and by <b>the</b> communion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faithful. <b>The</b> history <b>of</b> this rite is linked to <b>the</b> worship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true Cross practised in <b>the</b> stational liturgy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pope. The relic was taken in procession from <b>the</b> Basilica <b>of</b> St. John Lateran to <b>the</b> Basilica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Cross in Jerusalem, where it was deposited on an altar. In the early 8 th century, the Ordo romanus XXIII testifies to this Papal liturgical practice, following the description made by Egeria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Week rites in Jerusalem in the late 4 th century. The Gallican liturgy knows of no rite <b>of</b> adoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross. In the Hispanic tradition, <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good Friday rites is related to <b>the</b> Offices <b>of</b> Lauds, Terce and None, where the predominant theme is <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> <b>The</b> author concludes, therefore, that <b>the</b> rite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross was not born in Rome or in Spain, but was a development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Cross and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divine Office, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A presente pesquisa busca entender o programa iconográfico desenvolvido nas igrejas das Veneráveis Ordens Terceiras do Carmo, do Brasil, a partir dos sete Passos da Paixão de Cristo: Cristo no Horto, Cristo da Prisão, Cristo da Flagelação, Cristo da Coroação de espinhos, Ecce Homo, Senhor dos Passos e Cristo Crucificado. Trata-se, portanto, de estudar as sete esculturas devocionais dos diferentes momentos da Paixão de Cristo, que cumpriam uma dupla função: participar do programa iconográfico das igrejas brasileiras e da Procissão do Triunfo, realizada pelos irmãos terceiros carmelitas, nos séculos XVII e XVIII. Essa procissão fechava o tempo da Quaresma, aberto pelos irmãos leigos franciscanos, com a Procissão das Cinzas. Tem ainda como objetivo tecer considerações sobre a Ordem de Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Antiga Observância e Descalços, partindo da origem no Monte Carmelo, na Palestina, a sua introdução no território português e, a partir do século XVI, a sua instalação no Brasil. A seguir, determinar a origem das Ordens Terceiras do Carmo, como reflexo da sociedade da Península Ibérica, e o envolvimento dos leigos na encomenda e confecção dos seus altares e na própria construção das suas Igrejas. Buscou-se também valorar a importância das procissões na religiosidade popular e, em particular, da Procissão do Triunfo, com a devoção aos Passos da Paixão de Cristo, pelos irmãos leigos carmelitas, {{principal}} festividade da Ordem Terceira. O tema da Paixão de Cristo ganhou importância no final da Idade Média, a partir da espiritualidade desenvolvida pelas ordens mendicantes e pela Devotio Moderna, que certamente favoreceu o desenvolvimento de um forte caráter narrativo nas cenas retratadas nas igrejas carmelitas. Procurou-se, então, relacionar as esculturas às respectivas fontes textuais e imagéticas que pudessem ter servido de fonte de inspiração, principalmente a partir do século XV, com as novas tecnologias de reprodução gráfica. Por fim, pretendeu-se estudar as esculturas a partir das leituras cabíveis à História da Arte: técnica, iconográfica e estilística. O acervo foi inventariado e fotografado em fichas de inventário, tornando-se o volume II desta tese. A partir da inventariação, as esculturas foram agrupadas e estudadas entre si e comparativamente a similares de outras igrejas, a partir das características que apresentavam, tentando enquadrá-las nos estilos de época: barroco e rococó, com alguns exemplares alcançando o neoclassicismo, de princípios do século XIX. The {{present research}} seeks {{to understand the}} iconographic program developed at <b>the</b> churches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Venerable Third Orders of Carmo in Brazil, focused on <b>the</b> seven Steps <b>of</b> <b>Christ’s</b> Passion: <b>Christ</b> at <b>the</b> Garden <b>of</b> Olives, <b>Christ</b> Imprisioned, Christ Whipped, Christ Crowned with Thorns, Ecce Homo, Lord of Steps and Crucified. Therefore, the work deals with studying the seven liturgical sculptures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different moments <b>of</b> <b>Christ’s</b> <b>Passion,</b> which bore a double role: participating in <b>the</b> iconographic program <b>of</b> Brazilian churches and in <b>the</b> Procession <b>of</b> Thriumph, developed by <b>the</b> Third Order <b>of</b> Carmelite brothers in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. That Procession closed the Lent season, opened by the lay Franciscan brothers with <b>the</b> Procession <b>of</b> Ashes. This study also aims at establishing insights on <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> Our Lady of Carmo, formely Observance and Barefeet, starting from its origin in Mount Carmel, in Palestine, through its introduction into the Portuguese territory and, as the 16 th century, its setting up in Brazil. Then it seeks to determine <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Orders <b>of</b> Carmo as a reflex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society in the Iberic Peninsula and the laymen’s envolvement in ordering and erecting their altars and in <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> their churches itself. The research also seeks to value <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processions in popular religiousness and, in particular, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Procession <b>of</b> Triumph, with <b>the</b> devotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lay Carmelite brothers to <b>the</b> Steps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>the</b> main festivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Order. <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> theme became important at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, from the spirituality developed by the Begging Orders and by Devotio Moderna, which certainly favored <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> strong narrative character in the scenes portrayed in the Carmelite churches. It seeks then to relate the sculptures to the corresponding textual and imagery sources tha could have served as inspiration, mainly from the 15 th century, with the new graphic reproduction technologies. The final purpose is studying the sculptures based on applicable readings to Art History: technical, iconographic and stylistic. The colection was surveyed and photographed in very simple inventory cards, becoming <b>the</b> second volume <b>of</b> this thesis. As from inventory, the cards were grouped and studied among themselves, and comparatively, with similar ones from other churches, based on their features, attempting to fit them into <b>the</b> styles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period: Baroque and Rococo, with some instances reaching <b>the</b> neoclassical period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19 th century...|$|R
