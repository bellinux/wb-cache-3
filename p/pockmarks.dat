40|$|ABSTRACT: At a large North Sea <b>pockmark,</b> {{with active}} methane seeps, surface sediments {{were found to}} have higher {{insoluble}} sulphide concentrations than sedlments from the surrounding area. The fauna of the <b>pockmark</b> was characterized by 2 species which have not pi-evlously been reported from the Fladen Ground in the northern North Sea. These species were a b valve, Thyasira sarsi (which is known to contain endosymbiotic sulphur-oxidising bacteria) and a mouthless and gutless nematode, Astomonerna sp., which also contains endosymbiotic bacteria The nematode was the dominant meiofauna species in the <b>pockmark</b> sediments. Both macro-lnfauna and total nematodes were in low abundance in samples taken {{from the base of the}} <b>pockmark.</b> Sediment samples from the <b>pockmark</b> contained numerous otoliths, implying that substantial winnowing of the sediment had taken place. This was supported by studies on the sulphide concentrations in the sediment which showed multiple layering of the sediments on the sides of the <b>pockmark,</b> suggesting displacement. The carbon isotope compositions (6 I 3 c) of the tissues of benthic animals from in and around the <b>pockmark</b> were generally in the range - 16 to - 2 O...|$|R

The seafloor drill rig MeBo of MARUM was used to recover sediments as deep as 56. 74 m below seafloor. The presence of gas hydrates in specific core sections was deduced from temperature anomalies recorded during continuous records of infrared thermal scanning and anomalies in pore water chloride concentrations. In situ sediment temperature measurements showed elevated geothermal gradients of up to 258 °C/km {{in the center of}} the so-called <b>pockmark</b> A which is up to 4. 6 times higher than that in the background sediment (72 °C/km).

He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, <b>pockmarks</b> on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high.

Synthetic model studies suggest resistivity obtained from CSEM data can resolve gas or hydrate saturation greater than 5 % within the chimney. Acoustic chimneys imaged by seismic reflection data beneath the <b>pockmark</b> and on the ridge flanks were found to be associated with high-resistivity anomalies (+ 2 – 4 ?m). High-velocity anomalies (+ 0. 3 km/s), within the gas-hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and low-velocity anomalies (? 0. 2 km/s) underlying the GHSZ, were also observed. Joint analysis of the resistivity and velocity anomaly indicates pore saturation of up to 52 % hydrate with 28 % free gas, or up to 73 % hydrate with 4 % free gas, within the chimney beneath the <b>pockmark</b> assuming a nonuniform and uniform fluid distribution, respectively. Similarly, we estimate up to 30 % hydrate with 4 % free gas or 30 % hydrate with 2 % free gas within the pore space of the GHSZ outside the central chimney assuming a nonuniform and uniform fluid distribution, respectively.

Measured particulate organic carbon (POC) content, and porewater sulfate (SO 4 2 -), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and δ 34 S-SO 4 2 - distributions were used to constrain a non-steady-state reaction-transport model and quantify POC mineralization rates as well as estimate the time when fluid flow ceased at the investigated <b>pockmark.</b> An increase in POC content and δ 34 S-SO 4 2 - {{and a decrease in}} sulfate concentrations in the upper ca. 2 m at the <b>pockmark</b> and a reference core implied an increase in the flux and reactivity of organic matter during the early Holocene around 10 kyrB.

2500|$|With {{continuing}} experience, {{particularly on}} the upper continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico, the successful prediction {{of the presence of}} tubeworm communities continues to improve, however chemosynthetic communities cannot be reliably detected directly using geophysical techniques. Hydrocarbon seeps that allow chemosynthetic communities to exist do modify the geological characteristics in ways that can be remotely detected, but the time scales of co-occurring active seepage and the presence of living communities is always uncertain. These known sediment modifications include (1) precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the form of micronodules, nodules, or rock masses; (2) formation of gas hydrates; (3) modification of sediment composition through concentration of hard chemosynthetic organism remains (such as shell fragments and layers); (4) formation of interstitial gas bubbles or hydrocarbons; and (5) formation of depressions or <b>pockmarks</b> by gas expulsion. These features give rise to acoustic effects such as wipeout zones (no echoes), hard bottoms (strongly reflective echoes), bright spots (reflection enhanced layers), or reverberant layers (Behrens, 1988; Roberts and Neurauter, 1990).

Groundwater discharge from an aquifer into the brackish waters of the western Baltic, dilutes bottom water salinities to values as low as 2. 9 ‰. Seasurface height and the amount of precipitation preceding sampling periods by 5 days correlated significantly with the rate of groundwater discharge. Concentrations of methane in bottom water at the <b>pockmark</b> site were strongly influenced by seepage intensity. At two sampling sites (control and <b>pockmark</b> site) distinctly lower methane concentrations were observed towards the sea surface, although the entire water body of Eckernförde Bay appears to be affected by methane seeping from the sediments.

Methane flux from surface waters into the atmosphere follows strong seasonal variations, with maximum values in the winter (200 – 400 μmol m- 2 d- 1).

2500|$|The first {{biological}} {{evidence for}} reduced environments in the Mediterranean Sea was {{the presence of}} Lucinidae and Vesicomyidae bivalve shells cored {{on the top of}} the Napoli mud volcano ( [...] ; [...] "Napoli" [...] is only a name of a seamount. It locates south of Crete), located at 1,900m depth on the Mediterranean Ridge in the subduction zone of the African plate. This was followed by the description of a new Lucinidae bivalve species, Lucinoma kazani, associated with bacterial endosymbionts. In the southeastern Mediterranean, communities of polychaetes and bivalves were also found associated with cold seeps and carbonates near Egypt and the Gaza Strip at depths of 500–800m, but no living fauna was collected. The first in situ observations of extensive living chemosynthetic communities in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea prompted cooperation between biologists, geochemists, and geologists. During submersible dives, communities comprising large fields of small bivalves (dead and alive), large siboglinid tube worms, isolated or forming dense aggregations, large sponges, and associated endemic fauna were observed in various cold seep habitats associated with carbonate crusts at 1,700–2,000 m depth. Two mud volcano fields were first explored, one along the Mediterranean Ridge, where most of them were partially (Napoli, Milano mud volcanoes) or totally (Urania, Maidstone mud volcanoes) affected by brines, and the other on the Anaximander mounds south of Turkey. The latter area includes the large Amsterdam mud volcano, which is affected by recent mudflows, and the smaller Kazan or Kula mud volcanoes.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the cold fluid venting from a Giant <b>Pockmark</b> within the Lower Congo Basin has been elucidated based upon results of precise mapping, {{submersible}} dives, gravity coring and isotopic analyses realized under a TOTAL-IFREMER cooperative project (ZAIANGO and BIOZAIRE projects). During four dives of the IFREMER ROV-Victor 6000, the bottom was filmed, hard and soft samples were lifted from the sediment, and water samples were collected with a CTD-rosette system. The detailed dip map shows that the 800 m wide Giant <b>Pockmark</b> is a composite feature due to the coalescence of multiple 100 m wide depressions that displays {{a broad range of}} biological, mineralogical and chemical features on the seafloor, leading to a seafloor anomaly recorded on the multibeam imagery. Methane-rich fluids migrating through the sedimentary column from a buried palaeochannel clearly react with the sulphate-rich circulating sea water to produce hydrogen sulphide and bicarbonate ions. This situation leads to a concentrical arrangement of the sedimentary facies, with methane-related features in the centre and sulphide-related features at the periphery. This organization is correlated with high levels of methane (up to 20 ?mol/l) measured in the centre of the Giant <b>Pockmark,</b> responsible for the crystallization of gas hydrates at the bottom. In this model, the concentrical organization of mineralogical and biological features reflects a geochemical partitioning related to the peripheral progressive mixing of the methane flux...|$|R

40|$|The high {{biodiversity}} {{found at}} cold seeps, despite elevated concentrations of methane and hydrogen sulfide, {{is attributed to}} multiple sources of habitat heterogeneity. In addition to geological and geochemical processes, biogenic habitats formed by large symbiont-bearing taxa, such as bivalves and siboglinid tubeworms, or by microbial mats drive the biodiversity of small-sized fauna. However, because these habitat-forming species also depend on geochemical gradients, the respective influence of abiotic and biotic factors in structuring associated macrofaunal communities is often unresolved. The giant <b>pockmark</b> Regab located at 3200 m depth on the Congo margin is characterized by different fluid-flow regimes, providing a mosaic {{of the most common}} biogenic habitats encountered at seeps: microbial mats, mussel beds, and vesicomyid clam beds; the latter being distributed along a gradient of environmental conditions from the center to the periphery of the <b>pockmark.</b> Here, we examined the structure of macrofaunal communities in biogenic habitats formed in soft sediment to (1) determine the influence of the habitats on the associated macrofaunal communities (inter-habitat comparison), (2) describe how macrofaunal communities vary among vesicomyid clam beds (intra-habitat comparison) and (3) assess the inter-annual variation in vesicomyid beds based on repeated sampling at a three-year interval. The highest densities were found in the microbial mat communities in intermediate fluid-flow areas, but they had low diversity — also observed in the sediment close to mussel beds. In contrast, vesicomyid beds harbored the highest diversity. The vesicomyid beds did not show a homogeneous macrofaunal community across sampled areas; instead, density and composition of macrofauna varied according to the location of the beds inside the <b>pockmark.</b> The clam bed sampled in the most active, central part of the <b>pockmark</b> resembled bacterial mat communities by the presence of highly sulfide-tolerant species living at the sediment surface, along with vesicomyid juveniles. This similarity suggests a gradual change in community composition from mats to clam beds. Inter-annual comparisons of the different clam beds highlighted that the most active central site had a more variable community than its peripheral counterparts. Finally, a rapid shift in community structure, particularly in polychaete families, in experimentally reduced oxygen concentrations in the central part of Regab, suggests that high beta-diversity communities can withstand intense variation in geochemical conditions. These community dynamics are likely related to the diversity and to the plasticity of the vesicomyids themselves, because they can cope with high spatial and temporal environmental variability at a very local scale...|$|R
