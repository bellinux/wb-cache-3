40|$|Aim : {{to improve}} {{interdisciplinary}} care (medical, social and psychological) in children's <b>polyclinics.</b> Materials and methods : at first, authors selected interdisciplinary departments in <b>polyclinics</b> with effective medico-psychosocial care for children. Secondly, the common algorithm {{of this type}} of care was described (sociological methods — participant observation, in-depth interviews, experts interviews — were used). Thereby, the draft version of guide for medico-psychosocial care in children’s <b>polyclinics</b> appeared. The draft version was discussed and obtained by experts. Results : the basic guide for organization of medico-psychosocial departments in children’s <b>polyclinics</b> was suggested. Main goals and objectives of these departments were determined. The structure and personnel regulations were developed. The structured guideline was suggested: 1) early identification of vulnerable children and adolescents (difficult situations); 2) development of individual interdisciplinary (medico-psychosocial) care programs; 3) providing integrated interdisciplinary care for children and their families. Conclusions : organization of interdisciplinary (medico-psychosocial) department in children’s <b>polyclinics</b> will improve and protect the quality of life and health of vulnerable children and adolescents. </p...|$|R
