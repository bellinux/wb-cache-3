500|$|In {{preparation}} for the evacuation, the American Embassy had distributed a 15-page booklet called SAFE, short for [...] "Standard Instruction and Advice to Civilians in an Emergency." [...] The booklet included a map of Saigon pinpointing [...] "assembly areas where a helicopter will <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up." [...] There was an insert page which read: [...] "Note evacuational signal. Do not disclose to other personnel. When the evacuation is ordered, the code will be read out on Armed Forces Radio. The code is: The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising. This {{will be followed by}} the playing of I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas." [...] Frank Snepp later recalled the arrival of helicopters at the Embassy while the song was playing over the radio as a [...] "bizarre Kafkaesque time". Japanese journalists, concerned that they would not recognize the tune, had to get someone to sing it to them.|$|E
500|$|... "Nobody Sees" [...] was {{recorded}} by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf. In {{an interview with}} Jay and the Doctor on Triple J in November 2007, Fanning noted that the song is a [...] "bookend" [...] to Powderfinger's early breakout single [...] "Pick You Up" [...] from Double Allergic. He goes on to note that [...] "It's 'who's going to <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up now?'. Cause I'm not doing it any more." [...] Fanning also noted that he considers the song a [...] "spacey ballad". Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano, they had decided for this album to record with session pianist Benmont Tench, who previously had played for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who {{were one of the}} inspirations of the album. This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists. Despite Tench's performance on the song, Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano.|$|E

500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush {{noted that}} Lewis {{appeared}} to be restraining her vocals on the song, writing [...] "Lewis exercising incredible restraint, as she doesn’t let her remarkable, room-filling, enviable voice soar like we are used to." [...] Sciarretto continued to note that {{towards the end of}} the song, the singer does not show any restraint, and that it is a common device used in song production as it allows the singer to build tension. Lyrically, [...] "Collide" [...] is a love song, in which Lewis sings [...] "I'll <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up when you're down / Be there when no one's around / I'm in tune with how you feel / Everything 'bout this is real / When you're in unfamiliar places / Count on me through life's changes." [...] Sciarretto also noted that it is when Lewis performs the lyric [...] "Crash into me / At full speed," [...] that she allows herself to not hold back in her vocal performance, and delivers it with [...] "power and breadth".|$|E
500|$|Clough {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I'm not {{equipped}} to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back." [...] The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would knock you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up and put you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us." [...] On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches, {{was inspired by}} a popular Ronco Mr. Microphone commercial from the late 1970s, in which a boy becomes popular and [...] "scores with the girls" [...] by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy riding by in a car full of friends saying, [...] "Hey, good-looking, we'll be back to <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up later," [...] a line the staff thought was [...] "hilarious". In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song [...] "Convoy" [...] by C. W. McCall into the microphone. The producers originally wanted him to sing [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] by Gordon Lightfoot, a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier [...] on Lake Superior. However, according to Vitti, Lightfoot's licensing arrangement would have required the producers to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine crewmen who died on the ship, so [...] "Convoy" [...] was used instead. Homer also sings the song on the microphone to convince Bart to like the present.|$|E

500|$|Staff from E! Online seemed {{impressed}} with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said [...] "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired Nicki Minajs to distract you, and when you're done, just call up the helicopter to <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up (Pro tip: Hang your leg outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)". Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed {{with the number of}} videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
