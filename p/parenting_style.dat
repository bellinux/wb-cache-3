5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parenting</b> <b>style</b> {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E

40|$|Background: Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the role played}} by parent-children relationships for children’s behavioral and psychosocial development. Crucial for some authors, others consider <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> as part of a more complex system. Less adaptive <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> are generally associated with childrenwhohave lower involvement at school and may contribute for psychopathology emergence. Objectives: To investigate the contribution of <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> for the explanation of child psychopathology. Hypothesis: <b>Parenting</b> <b>styles</b> (H 1) and parents’ childhood memories regarding <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> (H 2) do contribute significantly for the explanation of statistical variance of children’s psychopathology. Method: Participants: 110 children (67 boys, 43 girls) aged 7 - 11 years (M = 9. 22, SD = 1. 14) from schools in Portugal as well as 83 fathers and 86 mothers; Instruments: For <b>parenting</b> <b>styles,</b> the Portuguese version of EMBU memories of upbringing (for parents {{regarding the}}ir own parents), EMBU-P (for parents) and EMBU-C (for children) were used. To assess children’s psychopathology the Portuguese version of CBCL was used. Results: According to linear regressions, individual and family factors do contribute significantly for the explanation of all CBCL’s indexes. EMBU-C regarding mothers’ <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> only explains the Hyperactivity/Attention index. EMBU-P explains most of CBCL’s indexes. Mothers’ and Fathers’ EMBU Memories of Upbringing explains the overall CBCL’s indexes. Conclusions: The explanation of children’s psychopathology by <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> is not restricted to parents’ representations regarding their own <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> nor to children’s perceptions regarding <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> but extends to memories of <b>parents</b> regarding <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> used by theirownparents.

Several authors believe in a relationship between parental styles and psychopathology (Amato, 1994; Perris, 1994), namely in children with reading disabilities (Al-Aygon, 2007) {{as well as in}} the importance of home environment upon literacy (Harmer & Alexander, 1978). Aim: To analyze the role of <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> in reading disabilities and in the incidence of psychopathology. Hypotheses: <b>Parenting</b> <b>styles</b> play an important role in children’s reading disabilities; childhood memories about <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> play an important role in reading/writing disabilities; parental styles and childhood memories about <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> play an important role in the incidence of psychopathology among children; the incidence of child psychopathology among reading disable children can be explained by the connection between <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> and reading disabilities. Method: 110 children (67 M, 43 F), aged between 7 - 11 years (M = 9. 22, SD = 1. 14) completed CPM (Raven, Raven & Court, 1947; Simões, 1995), EMBU-C (Castro, Toro, Arrindell & Van der Ende, 1993; Canavarro & Pereira, 2007 a) and PROLEC-R (Cuetos, Rodriguez & Arribas, 2009; Figueira & Lopes, in press); 86 parents completed a Sociodemographic Questionnaire, EMBU-MI (Perris et al., 1980; Canavarro, 1999), EMBU-P (Castro et al., 1993; Canavarro & Pereira, 2007 b) and CBCL (Achenbach, 1991; Fonseca et al., 1994). Results: <b>Parenting</b> <b>styles</b> do explain statistical variance of higher reading processes. <b>Parenting</b> <b>styles</b> and parents’ childhood memories concerning <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> revealed capacity to explain children’s psychopathology.

2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{relationship}} between parent and child distress may be influenced by parenting psychological flexibility.

[...] A similar study looked at the longitudinal relationship between perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> and psychological flexibility among students over six years (7th-12th Grade). [...] Results showed that psychological flexibility decreased with age, illustrating that as children grow older they become more set in their thoughts and habits, being less likely to change them due to circumstances. [...] Results also indicated that authoritarian parenting styles predicted low psychological flexibility in children. [...] This demonstrates that parents who over-control their children tend to restrict how well their children cope with stressors in life. [...] Lastly, results showed that children with psychological flexibility in 9th grade {{were more likely to have}} decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> later on. [...] Authoritative parenting styles seem to be associated with psychological flexibility in children. [...] Authoritative parents tend to be more warm, fair, and encouraging than other parenting styles which may be why children raised by this style have more psychological flexibility.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the contribution of familial risk to externalizing behaviors (FR-EXT), perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>styles,</b> and their interactions to the prediction of externalizing behaviors in preadolescents. Participants were preadolescents aged 10 – 12  years who participated in TRAILS, a large prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands ( =  2, 230). Regression analyses were used to determine the relative contribution of FR-EXT and perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> to <b>parent</b> and teacher ratings of externalizing behaviors. FR-EXT was based on lifetime parental externalizing psychopathology and the different <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> (emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection) were based on the child's perspective. We also investigated whether different dimensions of perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> had different effects on subdomains of externalizing behavior. We found main effects for FR-EXT (vs. no FR-EXT), emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection that were fairly consistent across rater and outcome measures. More specific, emotional warmth was the most consistent predictor of all outcome measures, and rejection was a stronger predictor of aggression and delinquency than of inattention. Interaction effects were found for FR-EXT and perceived parental rejection and overprotection; other interactions between FR-EXT and <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> were not significant. Correlations between FR-EXT and perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> were absent or very low and were without clinical significance. Predominantly main effects of FR-EXT and perceived <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> independently contribute to externalizing behaviors in preadolescents, suggesting FR-EXT and <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> to be two separate areas of causality. The relative lack of gene–environment interactions {{may be due to the}} epidemiological nature of the study, the preadolescent age of the subjects, the measurement level of parenting and the measurement level of FR-EXT, which might be a consequence of both genetic and environmental factors...|$|R
