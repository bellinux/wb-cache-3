50|$|The Cleveland {{area was}} chosen as the sample for this survey {{due to the fact that}} it {{provided}} a booming industrial community that was majorly affected by two historical events. The first event was the early implementations of Workmen’s Compensation and Employer’s Liability Act. Handicapped workers during this time period often faced discrimination by employers that often feared that hiring handicapped laborers would increase their insurance rates and increase their own liability for providing workers compensation benefits. The next historical event was the early spread of <b>Poliomyelitis</b> or the <b>Polio</b> <b>Virus,</b> which in densely populated cities such as Cleveland was rapidly infecting numerous laborers children, thus creating adding to the number of handicapped individuals. Wounded Veterans returning from World War I also added to these newly classified handicapped individuals. Because of this rapid increase of disabled individuals the survey uncovered over 60 percent of individuals they deemed crippled by their definition were in fact not documented as so by their local ordinances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarInactivated {{poliomyelitis}} vaccine, {{produced by}} the RIVM, has been evaluated for its immunogenic potential in humans in several countries in different vaccine compositions and in various vaccination regimes. A vaccine containing 40 - 8 - 32 DU/dose of poliovirus types, 1, 2 and 3 respectively, is considered suitable for use in humans. The vaccine is 90 - 100 % effective after one dose given to 6 -months-old infants and after 2 doses given to 2 -months-old infants, when circulating antibodies are used as criterion. Although it is generally accepted that durable immunity is not only related to sero-immunity but also with immunologic memory, a third vaccination is advocated to induce longterm immunity. A vaccine of essentially the same antigenic composition and given in a two-dose regimen, {{has proven to be}} effective during an outbreak of paralytic <b>poliomyelitis,</b> caused by <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> type 1. Observations of adverse events (AE) in vaccination trials, in which IPV {{produced by the}} RIVM was given in the control group and the absence of reported AE at RIVM's Medical Center Immunizations, indicate that AE of the present IPV are limited to local reactions and (undefined) irritability in a minority of recipients...|$|R

40|$|Through {{the efforts}} of the global {{campaign}} to eradicate <b>poliomyelitis,</b> <b>polio</b> cases have declined worldwide, from 35, 251 cases in 1988, to 1449 cases as of 28 October 2005. However, confirmed cases of wild <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> continue to be reported from Northern Nigeria. This paper examines the reasons for the difficulties in eradicating polio in Northern Nigeria from the perspective of residents of one town, Zaria, in northern Kaduna State. Research methods included participant observation, open-ended interviews and the collection of polio-related documents. While some people believed that the vaccine was contaminated by anti-fertility substances, others questioned the focus on polio when measles and malaria were considered more harmful. Some also distrusted claims about the safety of Western biomedicine. These concerns relate to questions about the appropriateness of vertical health interventions, where levels of routine immunization are low. While the Polio Eradication Initiative was considered to be cost-effective by Western donors, from the perspective of some people in Zaria it was seen as undermining primary health care, suggesting that a collaborative, community-based framework for primary health care, which includes routine immunization, would be a more acceptable approach.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the level of <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> with natural {{recombinant}} genome and wild <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> circulating in the environment of healthy children aged 0 to 5 years in Abidjan, 130 <b>polio</b> <b>viruses</b> made up of 26 polio type 1, 55 type 2 and 49 type 3 were identified by neutralisation test with monoclonal antibodies and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) targeting the VP 1 and 3 D 1 gene. Four wild non Sabin-like (NSL) strains (3. 1 %) : one type 2 and three type 3 were identified in non vaccinated children. One hundred and six (81. 5 %) isolates were Sabin-like, 20 (15. 4 %) were recombinant with the following <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> profiles: 2 Sabin-like type 1 /type 2, 3 Sabin-like type 3 /type 1, 11 Sabin-like type 3 /type 2 and one <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> type 3 NSL/Sabin-like type 3. Intertypic vaccine/vaccine or vaccine/wild strain recombinant <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> circulating among healthy children rate was high and suggested the need for a molecular surveillance of vaccine strains. Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) strains are well-known to revert to pathogenicity in vaccines. Therefore, the long term excretion of pathogenic OPV derived strains by some vaccinees needs to be considered quite seriously. It therefore suggested that all <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> isolated from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) be analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing of the viral genome...|$|R

However, in September 2015, a new case of <b>polio</b> <b>virus</b> (strand: VDPV, short for Vaccine-derived <b>Polio</b> <b>Virus)</b> has popped up again, resulting in a serious national issue since the probability that polio would spread throughout the country was extremely high (considering the low rates of health care).

Another problem this poses is the fact that this polio was vaccine-derived, in which the disease mutated. This raises to question if any more diseases could mutate from their vaccinated forms to infect people again in Malil.|$|R

Control of poliomyelitis in Indonesia has been commenced since 1982 with routine immunization of polio program and the National Immunization Days (NID) has been commenced since 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2006. When the world is free from <b>polio</b> <b>virus,</b> WHO suggests several alternative effort to maintain the world free from <b>polio</b> <b>viruses</b> : I) stop the OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) and no polio immunization, 2) stop OPV and stock pile mOPV (monovalent OPV), 3) use OPV and IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine) in a certain times, 4) use IPV only in a certain times. IPV has been used routinely in develop countries but has not been used in the developing countries. Several studies in development countries has been conducted, but had not been done in the developing countries. Indonesia collaboration with WHO has conducted the study of IPV in Yogyakarta Province since year 2002 until year 2010. The overall aim of the study is to compile the necessary data that will inform global and national decision-making regarding future polio immunization policies for the OPV cessation era. The data generated from the study will be particularly important to make decisions regarding optimal IPV use in developing tropical countries. It is unlikely that this data can be assembled through other means than through this study. The tentative result of the study shows that OPV immunization coverage in the year 2004 is 99 % in four district and 93 % in the Yogyakarta city.
