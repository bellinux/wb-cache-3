The first machines were installed in January 1803 {{and the final}} set for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks.

5|$|Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a famed {{engineer}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{was born}} in Portsmouth. His father Marc Isambard Brunel worked for the Royal Navy and invented the world's first production line to mass manufacture <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> for the rigging in Royal Navy vessels. James Callaghan, who was British prime minister from 1976 to 1979, {{was born and raised}} in Portsmouth. He was the son of a Protestant Northern Irish petty officer in the Royal Navy and was also the only person to have held all four Great Offices of State, having previously served as Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, and Chancellor. John Pounds, the founder of the ragged school, which provided free education to working class children, lived in Portsmouth and set up the country's first ragged school in the city. Peter Sellers, comedian, actor, and performer, {{was born in}} Southsea, and Arnold Schwarzenegger lived and trained in Portsmouth for a short time. Several other professional actors have also been born, or lived, in the city, including; EastEnders actress Emma Barton, and Bollywood actress Geeta Basra, who originally hails from Portsmouth. Cryptozoologist Jonathan Downes was born and lived in Portsmouth for a time. Helen Duncan, the last person to be imprisoned under the 1735 Witchcraft Act in the UK, was arrested in Portsmouth.|$|E

500|$|One reform St Vincent did achieve was the {{introduction}} of block making machinery at the navy yard in Portsmouth. The machinery was designed by Marc Isambard Brunel and Samuel Bentham. By 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 <b>pulley</b> <b>blocks</b> per year. The innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost {{of the project was}} recovered in three years. The revolution of machinery enabled the Navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. This self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. The buildings that housed the Block Machinery remain to this day and make up part of the Historic Portsmouth Dockyard.|$|E
