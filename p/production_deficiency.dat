40|$|Abstract. To test a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> view of {{learning}} disabilities, the perfor-mance {{of learning}} disabled and normally achieving children given minimal instruc-tion to use organizing strategies {{was compared to}} the performance of students engaged only in practice with a free recall task. Groups were selected as having equivalent pretest recall. On a posttest where strategy use was not prompted, the instructed group showed higher levels of strategy use than the control group. No differences were found between learning disabled and normally achieving subjects' strategy use. The instructed group recalled more than the control group. In contrast to predictions based on a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> hypothesis, learning disabled groups recalled less than the normally achieving group. Factors that may have contributed to this finding are discussed. Flavell (1970) described a developmental se-quence for acquisition of proficient strategy use among normally developing children.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{cognitive}} overload on <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> in metacognitive activities was investigated using a dual-task paradigm. Undergraduate students (N= 54) {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions, the dual-task condition and the non-dual-task condition. They completed a text revision task that included two types of problems, word level errors and disorganized construction. The construction improvement was assumed to require metacognitive activities from the readers’ point of view. Participants in the dual-task condition counted the number of auditory presentations of a target word while revising the given text. The results indicated that the performance level of construction improvement was lower in the dual-task condition than in the non-dual-task condition, while {{there was no difference in}} word error correction between the two conditions. It is interpreted that metacognitive activities, such as monitoring and control in text revision for comprehensibility from the readers’ perspective, are selectively impaired by cognitive overload. This study experimentally demonstrated that cognitive overload caused a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> in metacognitive activities. Methodological issues are discussed for future research...|$|E

Blades that are damaged during service or have <b>production</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are usually replaced with new ones. This leads to the waste of expensive material and is not sustainable. However, material and costs can be saved by repairing of locally damaged blades or blades with localized <b>production</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The blade needs to be further machined after welding process to reach the aerodynamic performance requirements. This paper outlines an adaptive location approach of repaired blade for model reconstruction and NC machining. Firstly, a mathematical model is established to describe the localization problem under constraints. Secondly, by solving the mathematical model, localization of repaired blade for NC machining can be obtained. Furthermore, a more flexible method based on the proposed mathematical model and {{the continuity of the}} deformation process is developed to realize a better localization. Thirdly, by rebuilding the model of the repaired blade and extracting repair error, optimized tool paths for NC machining is generated adaptively for each individual part. Finally, three examples are given to validate the proposed method...|$|R

A selective account of the agrammatic <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> is proposed, according to which only a subclass of the functional syntactic categories is impaired in this syndrome.

In the low-emphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 forgetting was present in fourth graders, but not in first graders (and kindergartners); in contrast, in the highemphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 forgetting was present from first grade on. Only fourth graders showed (adult-like) List- 2 enhancement, regardless of task instruction. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 forgetting in the high-emphasis condition only points to a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> in first graders’ directed forgetting, suggesting that the children are capable of intentional forgetting but fail to do so spontaneously.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} of a developmental trend from holistic to analytic modes of processing yield to two possible interpretations—the ability to analyze into dimensions increases with age, or a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency</b> for the strategy of analyzing decreases with age. In the three studies reported here an attempt is made to elucidate which of these interpretations is the more correct by investigating the performance of preschoolers and retarded children in three tasks, all of which require dimensional analysis. The three tasks involve (a) same-different comparisons of selected dimensions of stimuli, (b) judgments of whether dimensions are conserved through transformations of objects, and (c) predictions of the outcomes of transformations that selectively modify dimensions of objects. Normal 3 -year-old children and mildly retarded preadolescents make many errors on all three tasks and the patterns of these errors are predictable from holistic processing. Older groups of normal preschoolers, 4. 5 to 5 years old, perform very well on the tasks, although they show some hints of remaining analytic deficits. It {{seems likely that the}} ability to analyze does undergo development in the preschool years, but that the production-deficiency interpretation also has merit, particularly for explaining developmental trends within the elementary school range...|$|E

Microfiche. ix, 88 leaves, bound ill. 28 cmThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the effects of semantic typicality of category members upon first and third graders' recall and clustering in a multi-trial free recall task. In Experiment 1, members of 5 superordinate categories were elicited directly from 32 first grade and 33 third grade children using a category item production task. Size, diversity, and agreement among the category items were examined by age and category. Children of both age groups exhibited large, diverse, and non-idiosyncratic category conceptual schemes and no age differences occurred in number, diversity, and extent of agreement among category members first retrieved from long term memory. From among the age-appropriate category members, prototypical and nonprototypical items were selected to form all prototypical, all nonprototypical, and mixed (i. e., prototypical and nonprototypical) recall lists for the three list conditions of the free recall task used in Experiment 2. Sixty children (30 first and 30 third graders of the same ages, background, and school as the children in Experiment 1) were alternately assigned to one of the three age-approriate list conditions of Experiment 2. The items in each list condition were randomly ordered for each of the five free recall trials with the restriction that no two items from the same category were adjacent and that each trial began and ended with different items. Order of presentation of the five randomized lists was constant across children within each list condition. The number of items recalled and the extent of category clustering were examined. There were no significant age differences in recall and clustering with the all prototypical lists and the all nonprototypical lists. First grade children recalled as many items as third grade children and clustered their recall to the same extent as third grade children with these two types of lists. For both ages, the all prototypical list condition resulted in the highest recall and highest clustering of the three list conditions. In the all nonprototypical list condition, neither age group categorically clustered their recall. In the mixed condition, the well established age-related differences in recall and clustering occurred. Third graders recalled significantly more items and tended to have higher cluster scores, and significantly higher scores on the last two trials, than first graders. Examination of repetitions and intrusions in recall within the mixed list condition indicated that the older children used more effective retrieval cues than the younger. children, while the younger children had almost twice as many poor retrieval cues than the older children. By manipulating semantic typicality of age-appropriate' categories and items, age-differences can be either produced or eliminated. These results suggest that: (1) Past free recall studies which reported significant age differences may have used mixed typicality lists and thus may not have tapped the full range of young children's competency; (2) <b>Production</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{does not appear to be}} a child characteristic or an age-related characteristic.

Five different soft-shell capsule products were chosen based on their filling contents and treated to simulate a <b>production</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The study design compared capsules as received with capsules that were treated by coating them with the liquid contents of another capsule.

Six capsules were tested untreated, while the other six capsules were treated. Rupture and disintegration times were recorded as dependent variables in each experiment. Thedata were analyzed using ANOVA. According to the USP definition for disintegration, the rupture of a soft-shell capsule can be seen as fulfilling the disintegration criterion if the capsule contents is a semisolid or liquid. Statistical analysis showed no advantage of the rupture test over the disintegration test. On a product-by-product basis, both tests were sensitive to certain investigated parameters. A noticeable difference between both tests was that in most cases, the rupture test reached the defined endpoint faster than the disintegration test.

40|$|Abstract Background Most infections {{with human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) are resolved without clinical intervention, but a minority evolves into chronic lesions of distinct grades, including cervical-uterine cancer. It {{is known that}} {{in most cases the}} immune system mediates elimination of HPV infection. However, the mechanism of immune evasion leading to HPV persistence and development of early cervical lesions is not fully understood. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the potential of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) patients to be activated ex-vivo by vaccine antigens, the participation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and regulatory T cells, and to determine the secretion of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines mediated by stimulation of T cell receptors. Results We found that PBL from LSIL patients showed a significantly lower proliferation rate to vaccine antigens as compared to that of healthy donors, even though there was not a difference in the presence of antibodies to those antigens in sera from both groups. We did not find differences in either the frequency of CD 4 [*]+[*]CD 25 [*]+[*]FoxP 3 + in PBL, or the levels of IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 10 in plasma or conditioned media from PBL incubated with TcR agonists in vitro, between the two groups. However, we detected a lower production of IL- 2 and a higher proportion of CD 8 [*]+[*]IFNγ[*]+[*]cells in PBL from LSIL patients as compared with PBL from normal donors. We also observed that PBL from patients infected by HPV- 16 and − 18 were not able to proliferate in the presence of soluble HPV antigens added to the culture; however, a high level of proliferation was attained when these antigens were presented by activated dendritic cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that the immunodeficiency reported in LSIL patients could be due to the inability of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes that for some unknown reason are present but unable to mount a response when challenged with their antigens, probably related to an in situ IL- 2 <b>production</b> <b>deficiency.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: TfR 2 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in iron regulation during red blood cells maturation and hepcidin <b>production.</b> <b>Deficiency</b> of iron intake depletes iron storages in the human body, which subsequently result in anemia. Pregnant women are one of the highest risk population that suffers iron deficiency anemia (IDA) because older gestational age has more blood dilution. Some studies have indicated that polymorphism of TfR 2 gene decreases hepcidin levels in blood circulation, leading to iron overload. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between frequency and type polymorphism of exon 4 TfR 2 gene and incidence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in Boyolali. Methods: This observational analytic study was conducted in four primary health centers in Boyolali regency with cross sectional research design. Purposive sampling was used to recruit pregnant women who full filled research criteria. Anemia or IDA status was determined using Hb levels and red blood cells indexes with cyanmethemoglobin and routine hematology methods respectively. PCR and sequencing were performed to determine the TfR 2 gene polymorphism. All sequencing data were analyzed by using a Bioedit software version 7. 0, 5. The independent student t test was used to compare average of Hb levels and red blood cells indexes between anemia and non anemia groups while the odd ratio test was used to analyze correlation between polymorphism and anemia or IDA. Results: A total of 325 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. There are 68 pregnant women with anemia including 13 with IDA and others with non anemia. Four types of TfR 2 gene polymorphism (A 630 T, T 632 C, C 633 G and C 633 T) were observed and T 632 C polymorphism was found in a majority of pregnant women. CC genotype is a risk factor for anemia (p = 0, 973, OR 1, 029) and a protective factor for IDA (p = 0, 389, OR 0, 313). Conclusion: T 632 C is the most common polymorphism of exon 4 TfR 2 gene and has different effects on anemia and IDA. Determination of ferritin, hepcidin and erythropoietin levels is required for confirming whether or not this polymorphism is associated with anemia or IDA.

Potassium balances acid-sugar ratio in fruits. In tomato and red chillies potassium deficiency lead to irregular fruit colour development. Increasing rates of K fertilization resulted in increased lycopene and capsanthin synthesis in tomato and chilli fruits respectively. Close relation between carotenoid content of vegetables and K status of soil and of the economic plant parts exists...|$|R

In Women, ROS {{play a role in}} remodeling of uterine tissues, implantation of the embryo, settlement of the villi and development of blood vessels characteristic of gestation. The body stores of vitamins and minerals of gestating females are used to keep ROS fluxes at a level corresponding to oxidative signals and to prevent an imbalance between their production and scavenging (oxidative stress), which would be detrimental to the mother and fetus. There is some evidence that, although based on different regulatory mechanisms, most of the effects of ROS reported in humans also occur in pregnant ruminant females, some of which have been actually reported. Many vitamins and trace elements have dual effects in the organism of mammals: (a) they are involved in the control of metabolic pathways or/and gene expression, (b) {{but most of the time}} they also display ROS trapping activity or their deficiencies induce high rates of ROS <b>production.</b> <b>Deficiencies</b> induce different disorders of gestation and can be induced by different kinds of stress. An example is given, corresponding to the decreased contents of cobalt of forages, when exposed to sustained heavy rains, so that the supply of vitamins B 12 to the organism of the ruminant that grazes them is reduced and failure of gestation is induced. Outdoor exposure of ruminants to adverse climatic conditions by itself can increase the vitamin and trace element requirements. Adaptation of production systems taking into account these interactions between gestation and sources of stress or change of the quality of feeding stuffs as well as further developments of knowledge in that field is necessary to promote sustainable agricultural practices...|$|R
