25|$|Major natural {{disasters}} in <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> {{often lead to}} migration of disaster-affected families from areas crippled by the disaster to unaffected areas, the creation of temporary tent city and slums, or expansion of existing slums.

25|$|This has {{resulted}} in less food available for human consumption, especially in developing and least developed countries, where a family's daily allowances for food purchases are extremely limited. The crisis can be seen, in a sense, to dichotomize rich and <b>poor</b> <b>nations,</b> since, for example, filling a tank of an average car with biofuel, amounts to as much maize (Africa's principal food staple) as an African person consumes in an entire year.|$|E

25|$|Distressed {{securities}} funds, {{also known}} as vulture funds, buy up the debt of <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> cheaply and then sue countries for the full value of the debt plus interest which can be ten or 100 times what they paid. They may pursue any companies which do business with their target country {{to force them to}} pay to the fund instead. Considerable resources are diverted on costly court cases. For example, a court in Jersey ordered Congo to pay an American speculator $100 million in 2010. Now, the UK, Isle of Man and Jersey have banned such payments.|$|E

The deal is controversial among some UC Berkeley faculty, with some professors including Ignacio Chapela and Miguel Altieri who claim that the project will displace farmland needed for food crops in <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> and replace them with patented crops owned by multinational corporations, and others including Randy Schekman speaking out in support of the deal.|$|E

25|$|Experiments done in Uganda, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka on {{hundreds}} of households have shown that a bicycle can increase a poor family's income as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given {{one of the best}} returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in <b>poor</b> <b>nations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, {{as primary}} holders of {{developing}} countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities {{in return for}} loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter. A major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport.|$|E
25|$|At the plenary sessions, {{addresses}} {{were made}} by the chairman of the year's annual meetings, as well as the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at SSICEC. The three parties stressed the need for the World Trade Organization's Doha Round talks to resume. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the impasse in the Doha Round of trade negotiations carries a heavy cost and a high risk, and will extend beyond economics. Lee added that good governance is the key to help economies to open up in the era of globalisation and improve the lives for the people. He also outlined the roles of a good government in managing the process of changes. Lee said that governments must win the support of globalisation from the people and give them better opportunities. At the opening speech of IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato said the world leaders must quickly revive the Doha Round of trade talks to prevent a damaging shift towards protectionism. De Rato also said that the world is having a period of high growth and low inflation unseen since the 1960s, and a solid growth in the economy could be expected in the following year. He added that the global growth cycle may turn and the best hope for good performance lies in further increase in international trade. The three risks to world economic prospects include rising oil prices, disorderly unwinding of global payments imbalances, and the prevention of trade. World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz told donor countries to increase aid to <b>poor</b> <b>nations,</b> and wealthy nations to put Africa as the top of the priority list of poverty fighting.|$|E

Because sex tourism is a transnational issue, it must be addressed beyond the domestic level. Sex tourism also has economic implications for all nations involved. [...] Sex tourism is encouraged by the tourist sector of destination countries, because it draws individuals from wealthier nations with greater amounts of disposable income into <b>poorer</b> <b>nations.</b> This stimulates the economy of these <b>poorer</b> <b>nations.</b> These economic reinforcements are part of the reason sex tourism continues to exist.|$|R

2500|$|At the World Summit on the Information Society {{held by the}} United Nations in Tunisia from November 16–18, 2005, several African representatives, {{most notably}} Marthe Dansokho (a missionary of United Methodist Church), voiced suspicions towards the motives of the OLPC project and claimed that the project was using an overly [...] "U.S. mindset", {{pointing}} out that the presented solutions were not applicable to specifically [...] "African problems". Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities, stating that African women would not have enough time to research new crops to grow. She added that clean water and schools were more important. Mohammed Diop specifically criticized the project as an attempt to exploit the governments of <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> by making them pay for hundreds of millions of machines and the need of further investments into internet infrastructure.

2500|$|Suri and Chapman {{argue that}} a net {{pollution}} reduction may not actually be occurring on global scales. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that {{are still in the}} process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's <b>poor</b> <b>nations</b> develop, they will have nowhere to export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution intensive processes. However, Gene Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, environmental clean-up, and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is [...] "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth." [...] And Yandle et al. conclude that [...] "policies that stimulate growth (trade liberalization, economic restructuring, and price reform) should be good for the environment".|$|E
