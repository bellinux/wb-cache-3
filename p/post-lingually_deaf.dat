For Deaf people (the majority of bimodal bilinguals in the U.S.), level of competency in ASL and English may be influenced by factors such as degree of hearing loss, whether the individual is prelingually or <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf,</b> style of and language used in their education, and whether the individual comes from a hearing or Deaf family. Regardless of English competency in other areas, no Deaf individual is likely to comprehend English {{in the same way as}} a hearing person when others are speaking it because only a small percentage of English phonemes are clearly visible through lip reading. Additionally, many Deaf bilinguals who have fluency in written English choose not to speak it because of the general social unacceptability of their voices, or because they are unable to monitor factors like pitch and volume.|$|E
40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) {{listeners}} {{have difficulty}} understanding speech in complex listening environments. This deficit {{is thought to}} be largely due to peripheral encoding problems arising from current spread, which results in wide peripheral filters. In normal hearing (NH) listeners, central processing contributes to segregation of speech from competing sounds. We tested the hypothesis that basic central processing abilities are retained in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> CI listeners, but processing is hampered by degraded input from the periphery. In eight CI listeners, we measured auditory nerve compound action potentials to characterize peripheral filters. Then, we measured psychophysical detection thresholds in the presence of multi-electrode maskers placed either inside (peripheral masking) or outside (central masking) the peripheral filter. This was intended to distinguish peripheral from central contributions to signal detection. Introduction of temporal asynchrony between the signal and masker improved signal detection in both peripheral and central masking conditions for all CI listeners. Randomly varying components of the masker created spectral-variance cues, which seemed to benefit only two out of eight CI listeners. Contrastingly, the spectral-variance cues improved signal detection in all five NH listeners who listened to our CI simulation. Together these results indicate that widened peripheral filters significantly hamper central processing of spectral-variance cues but not of temporal cues in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> CI listeners. As indicated by two CI listeners in our study, however, <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> CI listeners may retain some central processing abilities similar to NH listeners...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{technological}} advances in cochlear implants and processing strategies have enabled subjects affected by severe to {{profound hearing loss}} to hear sounds and recognize speech in various different degrees. The variability of hearing outcomes in subjects with post-lingual deafness has been significant and cochlear implant indications have been extended to include an ever larger population. ObjectiveThis paper aims {{to look into the}} groups of post-lingual deafness patients to find where cochlear implants have yielded better outcomes than conventional hearing aids.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the speech perception performance {{of children with}} a cochlear implant (CI) after 3 and 4 years of follow-up and to study the influence of age at implantation, duration of deafness and communication mode on the variability in speech perception performance. STUDY DESIGN: A broad battery of speech perception tests was administered to 67 children with a CI. The results were reduced into one measure: the 'equivalent hearing loss (EHL) '. This outcome measure refers {{to the performance of}} a reference group of severely and profoundly hearing impaired children with conventional hearing aids. PARTICIPANTS: The population comprised 35 congenitally, 17 pre-lingually and 15 <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> children implanted between 1989 and 1999. The population was homogeneous with respect to cognition, residual hearing and support at home as a result of conservative inclusion criteria. RESULTS: During the first 2 years after implantation, <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> children showed the fastest rate of improvement in speech perception. After 3 years of implant use, the early implanted pre-lingually deaf children and congenitally deaf children implanted under the age of 6 years caught up with the <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> children. Pre-lingually deaf children implanted after a relatively long-duration of deafness tended to show poorer performance than those with a shorter duration. Performance of congenitally deaf children implanted after the age of 6 years was poorer and progress was slower. In the congenitally deaf children, 36 % of the variability in performance was explained by duration of deafness, whereas in the children with pre- and post-lingually acquired deafness, communication mode explained 69 % of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: All children derived benefit from their CI for speech perception tasks, but performance varied greatly. Several children reached EHL levels around 70 dB; their speech perception was equal to that of a child with conventional hearing aids who has 70 dB HL. After early implantation, the levels of performance that were eventually achieved differed no more than 10 dB, irrespective of whether the onset of deafness was pre-lingual or postlingual. In congenitally deaf children, duration of deafness {{played a major role in}} speech perception performance, whereas in the children with pre-lingually and post-lingually acquired deafness together, mode of communication was a major factor...|$|E

40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} work well, yet {{the outcome}} is not fully accounted by the data routinely available to the clinician, and remains unpredictable. A more in-depth understanding of the neural mechanisms that determine the clinical recovery after cochlear implantation is warranted, as they may provide the background for an accurate individual prognosis. In this study in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> adults, we show that while clinical data offer only prognosis trends, fMRI data can prospectively distinguish good from poor implant performers. We show that those deaf cochlear implant (CI) candidates who will become good performers rely on a dorsal phonological route when performing a rhyming task on written regular words. In contrast, those who will become poor performers involve a ventral temporo-frontal route to perform the same task, and abnormally recruit the right supramarginal gyrus, a region that is contralateral to classical phonological regions. These functional patterns reveal that deafness either enhances “normal” phonological processing, or prompts a substitution of phonological processing by lexico-semantic processing. These findings thus suggest that a simple behavioral pre-operative exploration of phonological strategies during reading, to determine which route is predominantly used by CI candidates, might fruitfully inform the outcome...|$|E

One striking example comes from phonetic convergence, when speakers automatically tend to mimic their interlocutor’s speech during communicative interaction. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate sensory-motor linkage in speech production in postlingually deaf cochlear implanted participants and normal hearing elderly adults through phonetic convergence and imitation. To this aim, two vowel production tasks, with or without instruction to imitate an acoustic vowel, were proposed to three groups of young adults with normal hearing, elderly adults with normal hearing and <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> cochlear-implanted patients. Measure of the deviation of each participant’s f 0 from their own mean f 0 was measured to evaluate the ability to converge to each acoustic target. Results showed that cochlear-implanted participants have the ability to converge to an acoustic target, both intentionally and unintentionally, albeit with a lower degree than young and elderly participants with normal hearing.

40|$|BackgroundSpeech {{understanding}} may rely {{not only}} on auditory, but also on visual information. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques can expose the neural processes underlying the integration of multisensory processes required for speech understanding in humans. Nevertheless, noise (from fMRI) limits the usefulness in auditory experiments, and electromagnetic artefacts caused by electronic implants worn by subjects can severely distort the scans (EEG, fMRI). Therefore, we assessed audio-visual activation of temporal cortex with a silent, optical neuroimaging technique: functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). MethodsWe studied temporal cortical activation as represented by concentration changes of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin in four, easy-to-apply fNIRS optical channels of 33 normal-hearing adult subjects and 5 <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> cochlear implant (CI) users in response to supra-threshold unisensory auditory and visual, {{as well as to}} congruent auditory-visual speech stimuli.

However, by discounting physiological noise through reference channel subtraction, auditory, visual and audiovisual speech stimuli evoked concentration changes for all sensory modalities in both cohorts (p< 0. 001). Auditory stimulation evoked larger concentration changes than visual stimuli (p< 0. 001). A saturation effect was observed for the audiovisual condition.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in earlier studies that patients with a cochlear implant have increased abilities for audio-visual integration because the crude information transmitted by the cochlear implant requires the persistent use of the complementary speech information from the visual channel. The brain network for these abilities needs to be clarified. We used an independent components analysis (ICA) of the activation (H 2 (15) O) positron emission tomography data to explore occipito-temporal brain activity in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> patients with unilaterally implanted cochlear implants at several months post-implantation (T 1), shortly after implantation (T 0) and in normal hearing controls. In between-group analysis, patients at T 1 had greater blood flow in the left middle temporal cortex as compared with T 0 and normal hearing controls. In within-group analysis, patients at T 0 had a task-related ICA component in the visual cortex, and patients at T 1 had one task-related ICA component in the left middle temporal cortex {{and the other in}} the visual cortex. The time courses of temporal and visual activities during the positron emission tomography examination at T 1 were highly correlated, meaning that synchronized integrative activity occurred.

40|$|Conclusions. Subjects with {{cochlear}} ossification derived {{benefits in}} terms of speech performance {{similar to those of}} the nonossified group. It is thus recommended that the insertion of short electrode arrays should be considered an alternative choice for patients with cochlear ossification. Objective. Cochlear ossification has been recognized as a major obstacle to the full insertion of a multichannel cochlear implant electrode array. To alleviate the technical difficulty of placing a standard electrode array and the possibility of causing undesirable trauma to the cochlea, a newly designed electrode array with the same number of electrodes compressed into a shorter length has been made available. The aim of the present study was to examine the speech perception performance of patients implanted with the MED-EL C 40 + S compressed electrode array and to compare their results with those of matched groups implanted with the MED-EL C 40 + standard electrode array. Material and methods. One pre-lingually and two <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> subjects using short electrode arrays were matched with three groups of subjects using standard electrode arrays. The pre- and postoperative speech perception scores were evaluated. Results. All three subjects using compressed electrode arrays achieved speech perception scores comparable to those of matched subjects using standard electrode arrays. There was also a tendency for the subjects to show similar patterns of speech perception scores as a function of the difficulty of the tests. © 2005 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{cochlear}} implant (CI), by enabling oral communication in severely to profoundly deaf subjects, {{is one of}} the major medical advances over the last fifty years. Despite the globally very satisfactory results, individual outcomes vary considerably. The objective of this review is to describe the various factors influencing the results of CI rehabilitation with particular emphasis on the better understanding of neurocognitive mechanisms provided by functional brain imaging. The following aspects will be discussed: 1. Peripheral predictors such as the degree of preservation of nerve structures and the positioning of the electrode array. 2. The duration of auditory deprivation whose influence on brain reorganization is now becoming more clearly understood. 3. The age of initiation of hearing rehabilitation in subjects with pre-lingual deafness influencing the possibility of physiological maturation of nerve structures. 4. The concepts of sensitive period, decoupling and cross-modality. 5. In <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> adults, brain plasticity can allow adaptation to the disability induced by deafness, subsequently potentiating CI rehabilitation, particularly as a result of audiovisual interactions. 6. Several studies provide concordant evidence that implanted patients present different phonological analysis and primary linguistic capacities. The results of CI rehabilitation are dependent on factors situated between the cochlea and cortical associative areas. The importance of higher cognitive influences on the functional results of {{cochlear implant}}ation justify adaptation of coding strategies, as well as global cognitive management of deaf patients by utilising brain plasticity capacities...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the efficacy of a multimodal approach to musical training to improve melody perception in cochlear implant recipients. Five <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> cochlear implant recipients were trained for a duration of two weeks with take-home training software for computer tablets. The software included a keyboard interface which facilitated learning of familiar melodies and a closed-set melody recognition task founded on the melodies learnt. The Modified Melodies Test {{was used to measure}} melody perceptual skills before and after training. A statistically non-significant trend of improvement (p = 0. 173) was found between pretest and posttest overall scores of the Modified Melodies Test. However, limitations imposed on psychometric scoring in the Modified Melodies Test resulted in alternative scoring methods that did not allow conclusions to be aptly applied to melody perceptual skills. Furthermore, the present study had a small sample size that resulted in low statistical power and also prevented a planned comparison of multimodal training to a reference of unimodal training that incorporated listening tasks only. As such, there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the importance of the multimodal approach to musical training in cochlear implant users.

This is a correlational study conducted in five tertiary care referral hospitals with 21 <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> adult cochlear implant users. Two maps were created: a behavioral, bitonal balanced (BB) map and an objective map, in which T-levels were the same as in the BB map, and C-levels were obtained with C-NRT. C-NRT consisted of performing the AGF of nine electrodes, and of setting the current level eliciting a 100  μV ECAP amplitude as C-level in the map. AutoNRT was also measured. Main outcome measures were correlation between behavioral C-profile level, objective C-profile level, behavioral T-profile level and objective T-profile (AutoNRT) level; disyllabic word recognition scores in quiet and in noise conditions (SNR = +  10 and 0) with both maps. A strong correlation was found between behavioral and C-NRT-derived C-levels (mean per electrode correlation: R =  0. 862, p <  0. 001). C-NRT could predict behavioral C-levels with a greater accuracy than AutoNRT. Word recognition was significantly better with BB maps only in the quiet condition (p =  0. 002).

40|$|In {{this study}} {{simultaneous}} paired stimulation of electrodes in cochlear implants is investigated by psychophysical experiments in 8 <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> subjects (and one extra subject who only participated {{in part of}} the experiments). Simultaneous and sequential monopolar stimulation modes are used as references and are compared to channel interaction compensation, partial tripolar stimulation and a novel sequential stimulation strategy named phased array compensation. Psychophysical experiments are performed to investigate both the loudness integration during paired stimulation at the main electrodes {{as well as the}} interaction with the electrode contact located halfway between the stimulating pair. The study shows that simultaneous monopolar stimulation has more loudness integration on the main electrodes and more interaction in between the electrodes than sequential stimulation. Channel interaction compensation works to reduce the loudness integration at the main electrodes, but does not reduce the interaction in between the electrodes caused by paired stimulation. Partial tripolar stimulation uses much more current to reach the needed loudness, but shows the same interaction in between the electrodes as sequential monopolar stimulation. In phased array compensation we have used the individual impedance matrix of each subject to calculate the current needed on each electrode to exactly match the stimulation voltage along the array to that of sequential stimulation. The results show that the interaction in between the electrodes is the same as monopolar stimulation. The strategy uses less current than partial tripolar stimulation, but more than monopolar stimulation.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) can partially restore the hearing {{of individuals with}} perceptive deafness. The CI stimulates the auditory nerve directly via an electrode in the cochlea. The ability of a person to understand speech when using a CI depends on whether deafness occurred pre- or post-lingually, {{before or after the}} development of hearing, language, and speech. <b>Post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> adults and pre-lingually deaf children can achieve a high level of speech perception with a CI. In contrast, pre-lingually deaf individuals who receive a unilateral CI at an older age perform substantially worse, but may benefit from a CI as support for lip-reading. Eight academic centres in the Netherlands implant CIs. Children are eligible for a CI if they have a hearing loss of more than 60 dB at the frequencies 2000 and 4000 Hz, despite using the best available hearing aids. For adults these criteria include a pure tone average of more than 90 dB and speech perception scores lower than 60 % with the best available hearing aids. Nowadays, children with congenital deafness younger than 5 years are given bilateral CIs, preferably before 1 year of age. CIs are implanted sequentially in congenitally deaf children and adolescents aged 5 – 18 years. Contraindications for bilateral implantation are poor experience with earlier implants and congenital deafness in children older than 12 years who have not yet received a CI. Children with acquired deafness are also eligible for bilateral CIs. The need for, and effectiveness of, bilateral CIs in adults and deaf–blind individuals are disputed and currently costs are not reimbursed by Dutch health insurance companies...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{cochlear}} implantation technologies allow deaf {{patients to}} understand auditory speech; however, the implants deliver only a coarse auditory input and patients must use long-term adaptive processes to achieve coherent percepts. In adults with post-lingual deafness, the high progress of speech recovery is observed {{during the first}} year after cochlear implantation, but there is a large range of variability in the level of cochlear implant outcomes and the temporal evolution of recovery. It has been proposed that when profoundly deaf subjects receive a cochlear implant, the visual cross-modal reorganization of the brain is deleterious for auditory speech recovery. We tested this hypothesis in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> adults by analysing whether brain activity shortly after implantation correlated with the level of auditory recovery 6 months later. Based on brain activity induced by a speech-processing task, we found strong positive correlations in areas outside the auditory cortex. The highest positive correlations were found in the occipital cortex involved in visual processing, {{as well as in the}} posterior-temporal cortex known for audio-visual integration. The other area, which positively correlated with auditory speech recovery, was localized in the left inferior frontal area known for speech processing. Our results demonstrate that the visual modality's functional level is related to the proficiency level of auditory recovery. Based on the positive correlation of visual activity with auditory speech recovery, we suggest that visual modality may facilitate the perception of the word's auditory counterpart in communicative situations. The link demonstrated between visual activity and auditory speech perception indicates that visuoauditory synergy is crucial for cross-modal plasticity and fostering speech-comprehension recovery in adult cochlear-implanted deaf patients...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of auditory deprivation and age-related speech decline on perceptuo-motor abilities during speech processing in <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> cochlear-implanted participants and in normal-hearing elderly participants. Design: A close-shadowing experiment was carried out on ten cochlear-implanted patients and ten normal-hearing elderly participants, with two groups of normal-hearing young participants as controls. To this end, participants had to categorize auditory and audiovisual syllables as quickly as possible, either manually or orally. Reaction times and percentages of correct responses were compared depending on response modes, stimulus modalities and syllables. Results: Responses of cochlear-implanted subjects were globally slower and less accurate than those of both young and elderly normal-hearing people. Adding the visual modality was found to enhance performance for cochlear-implanted patients, whereas no significant effect was obtained for the normal-hearing elderly group. Critically, oral responses were faster than manual ones for all groups. In addition, for normal-hearing elderly participants, manual responses were more accurate than oral responses, as was the case for normal-hearing young participants when presented with noisy speech stimuli. Conclusions: Faster reaction times were observed for oral than for manual responses in all groups, suggesting that perceptuo-motor relationships were somewhat successfully functional after cochlear implantation, and remain efficient in the normal-hearing elderly group. These results are in agreement with recent perceptuo-motor theories of speech perception. They are also supported by the theoretical assumption that implicit motor knowledge and motor representations partly constrain auditory speech processing. In this framework, oral responses would have been generated at an earlier stage of a sensorimotor loop, whereas manual responses would appear late, leading to slower but more accurate responses. The difference between oral and manual responses suggests that the perceptuo-motor loop is still effective for normal-hearing elderly subjects, and also for cochlear-implanted participants despite degraded global performance...|$|E

Chapter 1 describes a study of how electrical stimulation delivered from a cochlear implant affects processing of co-varying frequency (spectral-variance) and temporal cues. We hypothesized <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf</b> cochlear implant listeners retain central processing abilities, which are hampered by degraded peripheral, cochlear inputs. In eight cochlear implant listeners, we measured auditory nerve compound action potentials to estimate peripheral filters, quantifying implant-induced spread of current and resultant spread of neural excitation. Then, we measured psychophysical detection thresholds {{in the presence of}} multi-electrode maskers placed either inside or outside the peripheral filter to determine peripheral and central contributions on processing. Results from actual and simulated implant listening support the hypothesis broad peripheral filters greatly limit central processing of spectral-variance, but not of temporal cues.

Lack of drug effects on central gain (tone-in-noise detection), temporal acuity (auditory gap detection), frequency resolution (spectral ripple discrimination), or auditory discrimination (attended listening) seem largely due to ceiling performance. Variability in the most demanding gap condition just reaching a significant decrease with nicotine could reflect improved temporal summation. Presumably, low task demand and maximum individual baseline attentional processing limit nicotine effects. Correlation analyses propose separability of attention and auditory processes and dissociable gap detection mechanisms. Chapter 3 describes a study in auditory neuropathy— disorders typically disrupting synaptic encoding and/or neural transmission of auditory signals in the cochlea and auditory nerve– differentiating temporal gap processes. The data seemingly support our hypothesis desynchronized neural discharges and/or reduced neural input limit peripheral temporal acuity but not central temporal acuity. Comparing subjects with disrupted auditory nerve activity with control subjects, a significant gap delay on the order of tens of milliseconds and insignificant delay on the order of hundreds of milliseconds may differentiate peripherally- and centrally-based temporal processing, respectively. We conclude by summarizing results and exploring future research for medical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Children {{with severe}} to {{profound}} {{sensorineural hearing loss}} face communication challenges that influence language, psychosocial and scholastic performance. Clinical studies over the past 20 years have supported wider application of cochlear implants in children. The Childhood Development after Cochlear Implantation (CDaCI) study is the first longitudinal multicentre, national cohort study to evaluate systematically early cochlear implant (CI) outcomes in children. The objective {{of the study was}} to compare children who have undergone cochlear implantation, with similarly aged hearing peers across multiple domains, including oral language development, auditory performance, psychosocial and behavioural functioning, and quality of life. The CDaCI study is a multicentre national cohort study of CI children and normal hearing (NH) peers. Eligibility criteria include informed consent, age less than 5 years, pre- or <b>post-lingually</b> <b>deaf,</b> developmental criteria met, commitment to educate the child in English and bilateral cochlear implants. All children had a standardised baseline assessment that included demographics, hearing and medical history, communication history, language measures, cognitive tests, speech recognition, an audiological exam, psychosocial assessment including parent-child videotapes and parent reported quality of life. Follow-up visits are scheduled at six-month intervals and include a standardised assessment of the full battery of measures. Quality assurance activities were incorporated into the design of the study. A total of 188 CI children and 97 NH peers were enrolled between November 2002 and December 2004. The mean age, gender and race of the CI and NH children are comparable. With regard to parental demographics, the CI and NH children's families are statistically different. The parents of CI children are younger, and not as well educated, with 49 % of CI parents reporting college graduation vs. 84 % of the NH parents. The income of the CI parents is also lower than the NH parents. Assessments of cognition suggest that there may be baseline differences between the CI and NH children; however the scores were high enough to suggest language learning potential. The observed group differences identified these baseline characteristics as potential confounders which may require adjustment in analyses of outcomes. This longitudinal cohort study addresses questions related to high variability in language outcomes. Identifying sources of that variance requires research designs that: characterise potential predictors with accuracy, use samples that adequately power a study, and employ controls and approaches to analysis that limit bias and error. The CDaCI study was designed to generate a more complete picture of the interactive processes of language learning after implantation. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
