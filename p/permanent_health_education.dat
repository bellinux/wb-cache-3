40|$|This study mapped the {{movements}} of <b>Permanent</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> {{in the region of}} Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil, begun by the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> Facilitators program, promoted by the Ministry of Health and the National School of Public Health. This qualitative study was grounded on the theoretical framework of institutional and schizoanalysis. Data were collected from operative groups of individuals who finished the program. The results were grouped into two plans: micropolitics and organization. Micropolitics indicates the production of different concepts concerning permanent education and different ways to establish it. Autonomy and control and also a tenuous relationship between tutorship and autonomy were highlighted, in the plan of organization. In conclusion, the program was an important device that suffered captures/overcoding but also produced changes in practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{building}} the National Health System, health training and continuing education for professionals {{are regarded as}} instruments for the changes and transformations in society. Thus, we aimed to analyze scientific publications and documents of the Ministry of Health about the national policy for lifelong learning. This is a documentary analysis carried out from March to September 2011, with search held in the Ministry of Health publications. Eight documents were found, analyzed by cataloging in summary tables and content analysis. The National Policy on <b>Permanent</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> was established {{as one of the}} strategies of the National Health System to change aspects of training for health professionals. We concluded that despite the changing needs, the training of professionals proves to be a challenge because it sets up with the complexity of management, service and teaching with intergovernmental policies between Ministries of Health and Education...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} unique {{evidence that}} orphanhood {{matters in the}} long-run for <b>health</b> and <b>education</b> outcomes, in a region of Northwestern Tanzania, an area deeply affected by HIV-AIDS in Africa. We use a sample of non-orphans surveyed in 1991 - 94, who were traced and reinterviewed in 2004. A large proportion, 23 percent, lost one or more parents {{before the age of}} 15 in this period, allowing us to identify the impact of orphanhood shocks. Since a substantial proportion reaches adulthood by 2004, we can also assess <b>permanent</b> <b>health</b> and <b>education</b> impacts of orphanhood. In the analysis, we can control {{for a wide range of}} child and adult characteristics before orphanhood, as well as community fixed effects. We find that maternal death causes a permanent height deficit of about 2 cm (or 22 percent of one standard deviation) and a persistent impact on years of education of almost 1 year (or 25 percent of one standard deviation). We also find that paternal orphanhood has an impact on educational outcomes, but only for particular groups. We show evidence that living arrangements and whether the child was in school at the time of losing a parent strongly influence the impact of maternal and paternal death. We also illustrate the problems of inference on the impact of orphanhood if only children who remained in their baseline communities by 2004 had been reinterviewed...|$|R

O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar as percepções desses sujeitos sobre o curso de facilitadores de EPS em Londrina (PR). Trata-se de um estudo qualitativo, realizado com tutores e facilitadores de EPS, no período de dezembro de 2006 a janeiro de 2007. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas e submetidos à análise de discurso proposta por Martins e Bicudo. Os resultados revelaram algumas críticas referentes ao processo de seleção de facilitadores, tempo de duração e término do curso, dificuldades com a metodologia, entre outras. Apesar disso, os participantes salientaram contribuições, tais como a sistematização do conhecimento sobre EPS e a oportunidade de refletir sobre as práticas de trabalho. As críticas voltaram-se mais para aspectos operacionais, ao passo que as contribuições levantadas referiram-se justamente aos objetivos centrais do processo de formação de facilitadores.

40|$|Background: In Brazil, {{in order}} to train the Family Health Strategy teams, the Health Ministry {{implemented}} the Brazil Telehealth Program to provide health support and <b>permanent</b> <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> In Pernambuco, the Telehealth Center Network of Pernambuco (RedeNUTES) offers telehealth services to 80 municipalities, supporting 154 Family Health Strategy teams. The goal {{of this article is to}} present a profile of nurses' participation in the telehealth services developed by RedeNUTES. Subjects and Methods: This article is a descriptive study of the actions taken by nurses in tele-education and in the telesupport environment, covering the period from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2010. Results: Three-hundred forty-nine Web conferences in tele-education, which included nurses both as lecturers and as members of the audience, were analyzed. The median average number of participants was 50 per course during the 2 -year period. The participation in the training courses, among the higher-education professionals, was mainly composed of nurses. In telesupport, nurses participated as teleconsultants, answering questions received by electronic forms and by remote Web conference consultations. The most popular categories found in the requests for second opinion, submitted by nursing professionals, were obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatrics. Conclusions: We conclude that nurses have participated in telehealth services as members of the audience, as lecturers, and as teleconsultants. We also consider that the active participation of nurses could bring benefits to the quality of the telehealth services provided to the community. These practices could help predict how healthcare will look like in the next few years...|$|E

40|$|A experiência aqui relatada nasce de crises e tensões presentes no cotidiano de trabalho de um serviço de atenção primária à saúde. Surge, também, do esforço em transformar esse conflito em 'cuidado' dirigido ao conjunto da equipe. Para tanto, duas vivências que se estruturam para {{responder}} a tais desafios conformaram um projeto mais amplo de educação permanente em saúde, o "Cuidando do cuidador". Essa iniciativa buscou mobilizar e fazer circular valores e sentimentos que, usualmente, são pouco considerados em processos de educação no trabalho. Ao dar visibilidade a estas dimensões intersubjetivas, foi possível tornar presentes questões essenciais para pensar o papel de cuidador de que deve estar investido o profissional de saúde. Com o uso de recursos sociodramáticos em diferentes espaços do projeto, viabilizou-se, ainda, um movimento de sensibilização que se inicia no profissional e em sua identidade como pessoa, passa pelo reconhecimento do outro (colega de trabalho e paciente) e chega a um coletivo mais amplo, o institucional. O desenvolvimento do projeto ajudou a entender que a humanização de nossos serviços exige, igualmente, reconhecer que nós, cuidadores, também somos frágeis e humanos. The experience narrated {{here had}} its {{origin in the}} crises and tensions present in the everyday work of a basic health care unit.

This initiative attempted to encourage and propagate values and feelings that are normally ignored in processes of education at work. By giving visibility to these inter-subjective dimensions, it was possible to bring to light some essential issues related to the role of carer that should be assumed by the health professional. With the help of socio-dramatic resources in different areas of the project, we also generated a sensitization movement that begins with the professional and his/her identity as a person, includes the recognition of the Other (colleague and patient) and reaches a wider collective, i. e. the institutional one. The project development helped us to understand that the humanization of our services requires the recognition that we, carers, are also human and fragile...|$|E

Prawidłowe odżywianie polega na dostarczaniu organizmowi właściwych pod względem ilości i jakości składników pokarmowych, które zapewniają prawidłowy wzrost i dojrzewanie człowieka, a także jego dobrą sprawność fizyczną, umysłową i emocjonalną. Nawyki żywieniowe kształtowane są już w okresie dzieciństwa i stanowią ważny element stylu życia. Ukształtowane nieprawidłowe nawyki u dzieci i młodzieży jest bardzo trudno zmienić, a nierzadko są one powielane w dorosłym życiu, także we własnych rodzinach. Przekłada się to na poziom zdrowia w dalszych okresach życia w postaci poważnych następstw chorób przewlekłych, głownie o podłożu metabolicznym. W wielu badaniach udowodniono, że występują wyraźne różnice w przestrzeganiu zasad prawidłowego odżywiania między młodzieżą zamieszkałą w dużych miastach a tą zamieszkałą na terenach wiejskich. Cel pracy. Rozpoznanie i ocena rodzajów zachowań żywieniowych uczniów gimnazjum zamieszkałych na terenach wiejskich. Materiał i metoda. Badaniami objęto grupę 115 uczniów kształcących się w gimnazjum. Przeprowadzono je w czerwcu 2015 roku, w losowo wybranej szkole wiejskiej w powiecie sanockim. Zastosowano metodę sondażu diagnostycznego i Skalę Likerta. Narzędziem badawczym był autorski Kwestionariusz ankiety. Do analiz statystycznych wykorzystano test chi-kwadrat oraz V Kramera, a za wartość istotną statystycznie przyjęto p< 0, 05. Wyniki. Większość badanych uczniów deklarowała prawidłową masę ciała (80, 9 %). Chłopcy częściej (67, 6 %) niż dziewczęta (30, 8 %) stwierdzali, że odżywiają się prawidłowo. Niewiele ponad połowa uczniów (52, 2 %) codziennie spożywała śniadanie. Większość młodzieży (67, 0 %) wskazywała na dojadanie między posiłkami. Chłopcy preferowali posiłki grillowane i smażone (40, 5 %), natomiast dziewczęta gotowane na wodzie (66, 7 %). Na racjonalne odżywianie wskazało 42, 6 % i tyle samo starało się przestrzegać regularnego spożywania posiłków. Pięć posiłków dziennie spożywało tylko 30, 4 % ogółu badanych uczniów. Wnioski. Pomimo, że ponad połowa badanych osób zamieszkałych na wsi przestrzega zasad racjonalnego odżywiania się, to odsetek ten jest zbyt niski, aby stwierdzić, że zachowania żywieniowe badanych są prawidłowe. Dzieci i młodzież zamieszkała na wsi wymaga wczesnej permanentnej edukacji zdrowotnej w zakresie odżywiania się i aktywności fizycznej. Słowa kluczowe: młodzież, odżywianie, wieś, zdrowie. Abstract 	Proper nutrition consists in supplying the body with nutrients which are adequate from the aspect of their amount and quality, provide normal growth and maturation for an individual, as well as physical, mental, and emotional fitness. Eating habits are shaped as early as in childhood and constitute an important element of life style. It is very difficult to change bad dietary habits in children and adolescents, and these habits often continue into adulthood, and into own families. This is translated into the level of health in further periods of life in the form of serious consequences of chronic diseases, mainly on the metabolic background. Many studies confirmed that there occur clear differences in the observance of the principles of correct nutrition between adolescents living in large cities, and those from rural areas. Objective. The objective of the study was recognition and assessment of the types of nutritional behaviours among junior high school adolescents living in rural areas. Materials and Method. The study was conducted in June 2015, and covered a group of 115 adolescents attending a rural junior high school, randomly selected in the Sanok province. The method of a diagnostic survey and the Likert scale was applied. The research instrument was an author-constructed Questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test and Cramer’s V test. The p values p< 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results. The majority of the examined school adolescents declared a normal body weight (80. 9 %). Boys reported correct nutrition more often than girls (67. 6 % vs. 30. 8 %). Slightly more than a half of the adolescents (52. 2 %) consumed breakfast every day. The largest number of the respondents (67. 0 %) admitted snacking between meals. Boys preferred grilled and fried meals (40. 5 %), whereas girls chose boiled food (66. 7 %); 42. 6 % of respondents indicated rational nutrition, and the same percentage tried to observe regular consumption of meals; only 30. 4 % of the total number of adolescents in the study consumed five meals daily. 	Despite the fact that more than a half of the respondents living in rural areas observe the principles of rational nutrition, this percentage is too low to state that their eating behaviours are correct. Rural children and adolescents require an early <b>permanent</b> <b>health</b> <b>education</b> in the area of nutrition and physical activity.

First-year university students completed one questionnaire containing measures concerning satisfaction with high school sexual <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> sexuality-related individual difference variables, and intentions to pursue further sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> at the university level. Question 1 was whether students were satisfied with their high school sexual <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> Results were examined for differences by gender and type of school attended (i. e., public or Catholic). Participants rated sexual health topics as very important; believed that most sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> should occur between Grade 6 and 8, but that many relevant topics were not covered until Grade 9 to 12; and were generally satisfied with their sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> teachers and the sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> program in, general. With few exceptions, participant ratings did not differ by gender or type of school attended. In Question 2, comfort with sexuality, past sexual behaviour, and sexual self-concept were examined as potential correlates of satisfaction with sexual <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> Results differed by gender of participants: For males, sexual self-concept (but not comfort with sexuality or past sexual behaviour) correlated significantly and positively with satisfaction with sexual health education; for females, comfort with sexuality and past sexual behaviour (but not sexual self-concept) were significantly and negatively correlated with satisfaction with sexual <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> Question 3 examined whether satisfaction with sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> predicted intentions to pursue further sexual <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> It was found that students who were less satisfied with sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> were more likely to pursue further sexual <b>health</b> <b>education</b> at the university level.

40|$|Background: Federal {{and state}} {{governmental}} activities have significantly influenced schools’ <b>health</b> <b>education</b> practices {{over the past}} 50 years. Evaluation of these initiatives in the scientific literature has enhanced development of <b>health</b> <b>education</b> and influenced {{the creation of the}} National <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> Standards (NHES). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts periodic surveys to evaluate the impact of state and local policies on school <b>health</b> <b>education</b> programs and practices. Objectives: This research project reviews and analyzes state <b>health</b> <b>education</b> policies for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia with regard to the recommendations of the NHES. It also evaluates state education agency websites for accessibility of <b>health</b> <b>education</b> standards and related information. Methods: I conducted an internet-based review of current state policies regarding <b>health</b> <b>education</b> standards, their correlation with the NHES, instructional time requirements, and health educator qualifications. I scored the strength of states’ policies using an original scoring matrix to evaluate these four <b>health</b> <b>education</b> policy criteria. I also evaluated states’ websites for accessibility to <b>health</b> <b>education</b> standards and policies. Results: Forty-nine states have adopted <b>health</b> <b>education</b> standards of which 27 fully correlate with the NHES. Only one state had a policy that quantified <b>health</b> <b>education</b> instructional time for elementary schools that met NHES recommendations. States with the strongest <b>health</b> <b>education</b> policies were characterized by mandatory and quantified <b>health</b> <b>education</b> instruction based upon the NHES and mandatory health educator qualifications. Conclusions: State <b>health</b> <b>education</b> policies are a critical aspect of comprehensive school health programs. Several states in this review have benchmark policies and resources for other states to emulate...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study aims to assess <b>health</b> <b>education</b> practice in {{sexually transmitted infection}} (STI) clinics in South Africa {{with a view to}} develop improved <b>health</b> <b>education</b> programs in such clinics. Health workers' knowledge of and attitudes towards <b>health</b> <b>education</b> practice, their perceived <b>health</b> <b>education</b> skills, the content of <b>health</b> <b>education</b> in STI clinics and the organizational structure as context for <b>health</b> <b>education</b> were investigated. In-depth interviews were conducted with 18 health care workers practicing in the area of STI control. A lack in knowledge and skills required for effective <b>health</b> <b>education</b> practice was reported. The constraints posed by health workers' current knowledge and skills around <b>health</b> <b>education</b> and the organizational structure in terms of the absence of policy and protocols to govern <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> limited time, space and resources, impede on the actual practice of <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> It seems that these obstacles to <b>health</b> <b>education</b> facilitate a biomedical approach to STI management. This approach is further portrayed in the power dynamics between the health workers as well as between health workers and patients. The data suggest that a <b>health</b> <b>education</b> intervention needs to be directed at an individual level namely at health workers and at the organizational level, i. e. the clinic that provides the context for <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> The newly adopted district health system which equally embraces medical care and health promotion augers well for a holistic management of STIs in South Africa. This would ensure the recognition of all categories of health workers' contributions to <b>health</b> <b>education</b> within their own functions, strengths and time limitations. ...|$|R

40|$|This book {{explores the}} complex nexus of discourses, {{principles}} and practices within which educators mobilise school-based <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> Through an interrogation {{of the ideas}} informing particular models and approaches to <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> the authors provide critical insights into the principles and practices underpinning approaches to <b>health</b> <b>education</b> policy, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Drawing on extensive literature and research, the book explores and considers what <b>health</b> <b>education</b> can and should do. Chapters examine {{the extent to which}} <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> past and present, has attended to the needs and interests of young people in school environments, as well as assess common pedagogical approaches and whether the outcomes tally with expectations. By considering the problems in teaching <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> curriculum making, <b>health</b> <b>education</b> pedagogies and porous classrooms, the book offers a knowledge base from which educators can consider how theories and models can sit together to shape curriculum and influence practice. School <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> in Changing Times will be of key interest to postgraduate students, researchers and academics in the field of <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> It will also be a valuable resource for teacher educators, current teachers, and those on professional development courses who want to navigate the moral minefield surrounding <b>health</b> <b>education...</b>|$|R

The study procedure involved drawing of relevant experiences from a review of related literature and discussing in the light of <b>health</b> <b>education</b> problems in Kenya to help make suitable conclusions and recommendations for improving the Kenyan situation. It was revealed that the National <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> programme in Kenya has many constraints which need priority attention through practical support from the Ministry of Health in the areas of resource allocation, management, reorganization of the Division of <b>Health</b> <b>Education</b> in order to introduce effective management capabilities, revival of training for <b>health</b> <b>education</b> officers; review of the training curricula for all health workers so that <b>health</b> <b>education</b> is introduced as a major subject of study, introducing incentives and attractive scheme of service for <b>health</b> <b>education</b> officers, and setting performance standards concepts, training models, educational materials and programme evaluations.

40|$|Recent {{alterations}} to the Key Stage 1 and 2 National Curriculum in England have located <b>health</b> <b>education</b> as {{a strand}} within a non-statutory framework of Personal, Social, <b>Health</b> <b>education</b> and Citizenship. Starting from {{the premise that}} <b>health</b> <b>education</b> should adopt a health-oriented approach, this paper finds the aforementioned health component lacking as a basis on which to operationalise primary school <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> Using medicines education as an example, a disease/risk factor-oriented programme is critiqued and an alternative, health-oriented perspective proposed. This alternative demonstrates how basing <b>health</b> <b>education</b> around every component of the personal, social and <b>health</b> <b>education</b> and citizenship framework can engender a health-oriented approach to <b>health</b> <b>education</b> at Key Stages 1 and 2. Finally, two cautionary notes are made concerning the adoption of this approach...|$|R
