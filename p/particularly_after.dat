5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, <b>particularly</b> <b>after</b> de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E

5|$|After its {{founding}} as a township, Teaneck saw {{rapid growth in}} its population {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. As Teaneck changed from a sparsely populated rural area into a suburb, <b>particularly</b> <b>after</b> development of property that had been part of the Phelps Estate started in the late 1920s, Teaneck's population grew rapidly, far outpacing the growth of Bergen County.|$|E
5|$|After the war, 53,000 Belgian {{citizens}} (0.6 {{percent of}} the population) were found guilty of collaboration, providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period. Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines.

5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} {{important}} events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, <b>particularly</b> <b>after</b> 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem Doina (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of London's rapid {{expansion}} during the early 20th century, and <b>particularly</b> <b>after</b> the area {{was connected to the}} London Underground in 1932, Noel Park became completely surrounded by later developments.

After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E

5|$|One {{month after}} her {{attempted}} suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed {{to undertake the}} long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties.

Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, <b>particularly</b> <b>after</b> the death of Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
