Since no parameters are estimated they are also known as "nonparametric tests" of consumer behaviour, though this notion is somewhat misleading. Indeed, in contrast to "nonparametric tests" in the usual sense of statistical hypothesis <b>testing,</b> revealed <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> are deterministic in nature.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{previous}} study was which toys and which bedding locations are preferred by laboratory dogs and how these enrichment objects influence the behaviour of the animals. Therefore <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> were made. Furthermore effects on the behaviour of the dogs were compared after providing certain bedding locations as enrichment {{in relation to the}} precondition. A total of 21 Beagles took part in the study. The <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out with three groups with a total of 12 animals. In a male group (n= 3 respectively 4) at the location Oberwiesenfeld, there were made four <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with toys and eight <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with bedding locations. At Gröbenried location six <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out in each case with bedding locations on a male and female group (both n= 4). In a following survey a precise budget of behaviour was compiled during the daytime period and in addition the use of bedding locations during the night was analyzed. These studies included four male and five female Beagles (which were divided in three groups). In the <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with toys, the dogs obtained toys containing feed, different objects of rawhide, toys of different categories and in a concluding <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> once again the previously preferred objects. In the <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with bedding locations, the dogs received commercial plastic beds in four different sizes filled with blankets. The two previously preferred sizes were taken over for further <b>preference</b> <b>tests.</b> In the <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with filling material in each case two beds with different filling materials were offered to the dogs. In each case the preferred quality was used for the next <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> and tested in comparison with a new component. The dogs had options between wood wool of different structures, fleece-blanket, pulp and rubber mat. Furthermore the dogs had the option between opened or closed beds (beds in a cave of wood) and between elevated beds or beds on the ground. During the survey three Beaglegroups received beds with fleece-blankets on the ground and elevated, each for two weeks. Objects of rawhide showed longest use (12, 6 % of the observed time per dog) in the <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with toys. Toys containing feed did have long use, too. In the <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> with toys of different categories the stick of aspen wood was favoured. Frequency of using the toys was highest during the first hour after positioning the enrichment in all <b>preference</b> <b>tests.</b> In the <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> with different sizes of beds, there were different sizes preferred according to the group. However, all groups preferred the medium size. Fleece-blanket as filling material was favoured in all groups and preferred to all other components. However, beds with filling-material pulp also showed long term of use. In one <b>preference</b> <b>test,</b> e. g. in the group at the location Oberwiesenfeld both pulp as fleece-blanket were accepted very well (pulp showed an average use of 28, 4 % per day per dog and fleece-blanket 28, 7 %). Rubber mat was avoided in the tests (time of daily use per dog 0, 6 % and 0, 4 %), whereas beds with fleece-blankets reached 56, 0 % time of the daily use and beds with pulp 56, 2 %. Beds with fleece-blanket or pulp showed significantly more time of use as beds with the filling-material rubber mat (p= 0, 04). Wood wool was also not accepted very well. Whether opened, closed, beds elevated or placed on the ground, all components were accepted well in the <b>preference</b> <b>tests.</b> The time of daily usage {{in the case of the}} open beds was 30, 7 %, and in the case of closed beds 32, 3 %. The elevated beds showed 26, 3 % time of daily use, the beds on the ground 40, 5 %. Both groups at the location Gröbenried preferred the fleece-blanket as filling-material to all other components. Here the male group preferred the opened beds to the beds in a cave, the female group did not draw a distinction. In the <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> “beds elevated or on the ground”, the elevated beds showed more time of daily use in the male group, however the beds on the ground in the female group. Also in the survey the dogs accepted the beds very well. During the night the average use of the supplied beds was 80, 1 % per dog. Here was significant more use of the beds than lying on the ground (p< 0, 001). No aggressive ways of behaviour were observed during the time the dogs had the beds as enrichment. The study showed, that laboratory beagles prefer soft filling-material, e. g. fleece-blankets or pulp when they choose their resting location. The supplied beds are used most of the time and consequently serve as a possibility for enrichment in keeping laboratory dogs. Toys, e. g. objects like rawhide, toys of composition rubber, sticks of aspen wood or cotton tugs offer variety to the dogs and help reducing environmental deprivation in the laboratory dog housing...|$|R

There is a tentative suggestion that embedded preference observations may be more widely accessible for this population.

40|$|Master of ScienceStatisticsSuzanne DubnickaPreference {{testing is}} a popular method of {{determining}} consumer preferences {{for a variety of}} products in areas such as sensory analysis, animal welfare, and pharmacology. However, many prominent models for this type of data do not allow different probabilities of preferring one product over the other for each individual consumer, called overdispersion, which intuitively exists in real-world situations. We investigate the Two-Parameter variation of the Item Response Model (IRM) in the context of replicated <b>preference</b> <b>testing.</b> Because the IRM is most commonly applied to multiple-choice testing, our primary focus is the interpretation of the model parameters with respect to <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> and the evaluation of the model’s usefulness in this context. We fit a Bayesian version of the Two-Parameter Probit IRM (2 PP) to two real-world datasets, Raisin Bran and Cola, as well as five hypothetical datasets constructed with specific parameter properties in mind. The values of the parameters are sampled via the Gibbs Sampler and examined using various plots of the posterior distributions. Next, several different models and prior distribution specifications are compared over the Raisin Bran and Cola datasets using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). The Two-Parameter IRM is a useful tool in the context of replicated <b>preference</b> <b>testing,</b> due to its ability to accommodate overdispersion, its intuitive interpretation, and its flexibility in terms of parameterization, link function, and prior specification. However, we find that this model brings computational difficulties in certain situations, some of which require creative solutions. Although the IRM can be interpreted for replicated <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> scenarios, this data typically contains few replications, while the model was designed for exams with many items. We conclude that the IRM may provide little evidence for marketing decisions, and it is better-suited for exploring the nature of consumer preferences early in product development...|$|E

40|$|Aim/Background: Current {{wisdom in}} the risk {{assessment}} of sexual offenders is that incest offenders have a small chance of re-offending. Previous {{research has shown that}} re-offense rates even for untreated offenders who choose victims from within the family, range from 4 - 10 %. Flowing from this belief are further assumptions that they are less dangerous and do not require intensive treatment, if they require any at all. Material/Methods: The paper summarizes the findings of two prior reports which examined a sample of in-patient child molesters attending treatment at the Phoenix Program. Results: Findings reveal a great deal of overlap between categories with incestuous offenders having numerous non-incestuous victims, and non-incestuous offenders also having incestuous victims. There was also a great deal of overlap between these two groups in terms of their erotic <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> responses. This was the finding even when biologically related fathers were examined separately, and when exclusively incestuous fathers were considered. Conclusions: If there were a “pure” form of incest offender who poses little risk to other children, {{it is virtually impossible to}} discriminate who fits this category at the outset of treatment. Neither index offense nor erotic <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> are very helpful in distinguishing this group from extrafamilial offenders. Beliefs about treatment requirements for incest offenders and their potential risk to victims outside their own family need to be reconsidered...|$|E

Mice subjected to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) before cocaine develop significantly greater conditioned place preference (CPP) for the drug-paired chamber than unstressed mice. Analysis of the dose dependency showed that FSS increased both the maximal CPP response and sensitivity to cocaine. To determine whether FSS potentiated CPP by enhancing associative learning mechanisms, mice were conditioned with cocaine in the absence of stress, then challenged after association was complete with the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist U 50, 488 or repeated FSS, before <b>preference</b> <b>testing.</b> Mice challenged with U 50, 488 60 [*]min before CPP <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> expressed significantly greater cocaine–CPP than saline-challenged mice.

Novel object recognition (NOR) performance was not affected by U 50, 488 given 60 [*]min before assay, but was impaired when given 15 [*]min before NOR assay, suggesting that KOR activation did not potentiate CPP by facilitating memory retrieval or expression. The results from this study show that the potentiation of cocaine–CPP by KOR activation does not result from an enhancement of associative learning mechanisms and that stress may instead enhance the rewarding valence of cocaine-associated cues by a dynorphin-dependent mechanism...|$|E
