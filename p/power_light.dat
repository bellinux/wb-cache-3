500|$|The Master System was {{produced}} in several variations. [...] Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, <b>power</b> <b>light,</b> expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system. [...] Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy. [...] A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic. [...] A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. [...] Another Master System, built as a handheld game console, was released under several brands including Coleco in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|It was an {{important}} supply base during the First World War and the Second World War. In January 1941 sixty German dive bombers made a massed attack on the dockyard {{in an attempt to}} destroy the damaged British aircraft carrier , but she received only one bomb hit. Incessant German and Italian bombing raids targeted Malta through March, opposed by only a handful of British fighters. Then in April 1942 the Admiral Superintendent of Malta Dockyard reported that due to German air attacks on Maltas naval base [...] "practically no workshops were in action other than those underground; all docks were damaged; electric <b>power,</b> <b>light</b> and telephones were largely out of action." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Philippine Air Force {{has signed}} a {{contract}} for eight AW109 <b>Power</b> <b>light</b> twin helicopters. These aircraft {{will be used to}} perform a range of duties including homeland security, armed reconnaissance and close support. Deliveries will start in 2014. The contract also includes initial logistics support and training for aircrew and maintenance personnel. [...] The Department of National Defense (Philippines) stated that the project involved the purchase of eight helicopters with full night operation capability, complete weapons system and integrated logistics support package. Two companies expressed their interest in the bidding process of the eight attack helicopters. Representatives of AgustaWestland and Eurocopter attended the pre-bid conference for the purchase of eight attack helicopters. Other companies including Bell Helicopter, FN Herstal, Elbit Systems and Boeing Company also sent representatives.|$|E
2500|$|Problems {{with the}} 10NES lockout chip {{frequently}} {{resulted in the}} console's most infamous problem: the blinking red <b>power</b> <b>light,</b> in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work. Dirty, aging and bent connectors would often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect. Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users attempted {{to solve this problem}} by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. These attempted solutions often became notable in their own right and are often remembered alongside the NES. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system. [...] In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.|$|E
