40|$|Abstract Background Pharmaceuticals are an {{integral}} component of health care systems worldwide, thus, regulatory weaknesses in governance of the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> negatively impact health outcomes especially in developing countries 1. Nigeria {{is one of a}} number of countries whose <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> has been impacted by corruption and has struggled to curtail the production and trafficking of substandard drugs. In 2001, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) underwent an organizational restructuring resulting in reforms to reduce counterfeit drugs and better regulate pharmaceuticals 2. Despite these changes, there is still room for improvement. This study assessed the perceived level of transparency and potential vulnerability to corruption that exists in four essential areas of Nigeria's pharmaceutical sector: registration, procurement, inspection (divided into inspection of ports and of establishments), and distribution. Methods Standardized questionnaires were adapted from the World Health Organization assessment tool and used in semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in the public and private <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system.</b> The responses to the questions were tallied and converted to scores on a numerical scale where lower scores suggested greater vulnerability to corruption and higher scores suggested lower vulnerability. Results The overall score for Nigeria's <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> was 7. 4 out of 10, indicating a system that is marginally vulnerable to corruption. The weakest links were the areas of drug registration and inspection of ports. Analysis of the qualitative results revealed that the perceived level of corruption did not always match the qualitative evidence. Conclusion Despite the many reported reforms instituted by NAFDAC, the study findings suggest that facets of the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> in Nigeria remain fairly vulnerable to corruption. The most glaring deficiency seems to be the absence of conflict of interest guidelines which, if present and consistently administered, limit the promulgation of corrupt practices. Other major contributing factors are the inconsistency in documentation of procedures, lack of public availability of such documentation, and inadequacies in monitoring and evaluation. What is most critical from this study is the identification of areas that still remain permeable to corruption and, perhaps, where more appropriate checks and balances are needed from the Nigerian government and the international community. </p...|$|E

40|$|Access to {{effective}} and affordable medicines (medical care) {{is considered an}} equitable right for all (European) citizens. Ensuring access to medical care is a challenge for governments and health care systems across the world. Choices {{need to be made}} about which medicine can be used and in what quantity because there are many (effective) medicines available on the market, but resources are limited. These choices may differ among countries and may be influenced by a (large) number of factors. In addition, it is likely that any given level of use of a specific medicine in one country is determined by a set of factors that might vary in another country. In the last decade an interest has arisen in studying the variation in medicines use in an integrated way, i. e. by including relevant <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> parameters, to enhance our understanding of causes and consequences of this variation. This thesis includes studies on cross-national variation in medicines use from a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> perspective. The level of medicines use in various countries and across multiple medical conditions is measured, while also taking into account <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> factors. An overview of national medicines policies and a global view on outpatient pharmaceutical consumption is followed by five comparative studies in Europe; two with regard to TNF alpha inhibitors (biologicals for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), two with regard to psychotropic medicines and one on time to market in relation to national participation to the European regulatory activity. These studies address the importance of the quality of data collection, and equal access to new medicines (TNFalpha inhibitors), the impact of cultural diversity and the impact of reimbursement delay and restrictions on medicines use (psychotropic medicines), and the contribution of EU member states to the regulatory process in light of the availability and uptake of medicines that received a granting of the market authorization in 2004. Finally, two studies focus on the impact of a single policy: the delisting of benzodiazepines in the Netherlands in 2009. One study describes the impact on volume of use in patients newly diagnosed with anxiety and or sleeping disorder, and one assesses the importance of information services for patients {{in the context of this}} policy intervention. The thesis identified two critical factors for performing a successful study on the extent and causes of cross-national variation in medicines use from a pharmaceutical perspective; a) to improve data harmonization and combine data(sources) and b) to have adequate information on the environmental context. By comparing and combining datasets researchers may detect more subtle and complex associations among variables, which in the end may improve the interpretation of variation caused by historical and societal developments – the contextual environment. Furthermore, it is essential to hypothesize why certain <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> factors may influence medicines use, and by which mechanisms. Finally, the studies in this thesis have shown that the currently available databases and epidemiological methods provide ample opportunities for studying cross-national variation in medicines use from a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> perspective...|$|E

After {{the social}} and {{economic}} changes in Eastern Europe since 1990 s, substantial changes were made in the health care systems in the countries. Most of them moved from centralized Semashko to decentralized health insurance systems of Bismark type. The latter also {{have an impact on the}} pharmaceutical systems and mostly on the way of financing, pricing and reimbursement of medicines. There is no historical overview of the basic changes in the health and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system</b> in Bulgaria till now that stimulated out interest towards the topic. This paper presents a historical legislation analysis of the main health care and pharmaceuticals regulatory acts. The Healthy and Safe Conditions of Labour Act, Health Act, Health Insurance Act, Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act were analysed, as well as the main regulations endorsed in the field. The analysis focused on the main changes that influenced the future of the health care and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>system.</b> The reforms in the sphere of health care are radical and substantial. They lead to regulation and protection of the rights in respect of the healthcare system, the rights of the patients, the rights of the citizens in relation to medical treatments, provided by the health institutions, as well as the rights of the health specialists when providing medical help and healthcare. These acts regulate the structure, activity, organization and management of the medical and pharmaceutical areas and their financing. The regulation of the pricing and reimbursement in Bulgaria was discussed. However, this paper was produced before the recent establishment of the National Council on Pricing and Reimbursement of Medicines which is expected to make the process more transparent, controlled and visible for the general public...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} today's {{manufacturing}} systems involves {{the integration of}} specialised components with specific properties and functionality. Indeed, {{it has been a}} formidable task for the manufacturing community to develop a useable system economically with enhanced efficiency. In view of the technological advances in developing complex manufacturing systems, a unified framework had been proposed by the authors of this paper to formalise the procedures for the development of such systems. This paper presents an extension to this framework that automates the simulation of system behaviour at the design level. This extended framework incorporates a frame-based representation of the abstract classes that are generated from the unified framework, so that an expert system shell can be used to generate the expected behaviour of higher level designs prior to subsequent developments. The advantages of the extended framework include a shortened cycle for the product design and greater ease for system designers to produce manufacturing systems that better conform to their original specifications.
