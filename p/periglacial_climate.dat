40|$|ABSTRACT: In the unglaciated {{parts of}} Southwestern Wisconsin, buried Terra Rossas are {{commonly}} found. These clayey, red soils are buried by loess and mainly found on ridges underlain by limestone. They have been eroded during <b>periglacial</b> <b>climates.</b> The red clay {{has implications for}} groundwater recharge as well as lateral flow through the landscape. This project focusses on a 50 km 2 watershed where some 400 augerhole observations have been made. The landscape was divided into different clusters based on terrain attributes to assess the relationship of environmental covariates with the occurrence of the subsoil clay. Several combinations of landscape attributes were combined but the absence or presence of the Terra Rossa clay is strongly related to elevation. The Terra Rossa is mainly found in the higher parts and absent in the lower parts of the landscape. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring the Last Glaciation, Western Europe {{witnessed}} recurrent millennial-scale {{episodes of}} <b>periglacial</b> <b>climates,</b> that had {{significant impact on}} Palaeolithic site preservation. After a review on the genesis and climatic meaning of sorted patterned grounds, examples of polygons, stripes and stone-banked solifluction lobes taken from archaeological contexts are described. Sorted features in Palaeolithic sites imply that caution should be taken in site patterning analysis for reconstructing past human behaviours, since spatial alteration of the original anthropogenic pattern took place. On low gradients, artefact movements remain limited but may increase dramatically on slopes when solifluction adds to sorting processes. Although these features are widespread in modern periglacial environments, archaeological examples remain scarce. Multiple factors are probably involved, including {{lack of knowledge of}} periglacial processes and landforms by archaeologists leading to misinterpretation, but also more or less complete obliteration of surface features by sedimentary processes upon burial. However, it is assumed that scarcity of clear anthropogenic patterning in French Palaeolithic sites before the Late Glacial is due for a large part to post-depositional disturbance by periglacial processes...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Greensand of {{south-west}} England can {{be divided}} on bulk lithology into two roughly equal parts, each 25 to 30 m thick. The lower part, the Foxmould Member, consists of weakly cemented glauconitic sandstones with low carbonate contents. The member weathers, largely by oxidation, to soft, loose, yellow and foxy brown sands. In contrast, the overlying Whitecliff Chert and Bindon Sandstone members consist of calcareous sandstones and sandy calcarenites with numerous chert-rich horizons. Dissolution, particularly during the warm humid climates of the Eocene and the <b>periglacial</b> <b>climates</b> of the late Pleistocene, has been the dominant weathering process in these two members. Karstic features observed on the east Devon and west Dorset outcrops include widespread pervasive dissolution that has locally reduced the in situ thickness of the Whitecliff Chert and Bindon Sandstone members to less than half their original thickness, along with deep solution pipes, and at one locality, caves. These discrete solution features occur beneath a thick capping of Chalk that is not markedly affected by dissolution.

5000|$|In cool climates with {{consistently}} high rainfall (on {{more than}} c. 235 days a year), the ground surface may remain waterlogged {{for much of}} the time, providing conditions for the development of bog vegetation. In these circumstances bog develops as a layer [...] "blanketing" [...] much of the land, including hilltops and slopes. Although a blanket bog is more common on acidic substrates, under some conditions it may also develop on neutral or even alkaline ones, if abundant acidic rainwater predominates over the ground water. A blanket bog cannot occur in drier or warmer climates, because under those conditions hilltops and sloping ground dry out too often for peat to form - in intermediate climates a blanket bog may be limited to areas which are shaded from direct sunshine. In <b>periglacial</b> <b>climates</b> a patterned form of blanket bog may occur, known as a string bog. In Europe, these mostly very thin peat layers without significant surface structures are distributed over the hills and valleys of Ireland, Scotland, England and Norway. In North America, blanket bogs occur predominantly in Canada east of Hudson Bay. These bogs are often still under the influence of mineral soil water (groundwater). Blanket bogs do not occur north of the 65th latitude in the northern hemisphere.|$|R

40|$|The Bargfeld-Stegen sandur area (Schleswig-Holstein) {{north of}} Hamburg is {{characterized}} by an intense periglacial shaping. Channel-like features, {{hereinafter referred to as}} channels, up to 26 meters wide and 3. 5 meters deep, as periglacial forms are incisive. Similar features can be observed in Itzehoe, Tangstedt (Norderstedt) and Schalkholz. Common features of these channels are: a usually shallow-convex cross section, an infill including re-deposited till, undercutting and other fluvial characteristics at the flanks, flat base eroded down to a boundary surface (permafrost), a diapir-like uplift of channel fillings in the upper channel parts and at the channel flanks, the parallel channel courses, sand-filled secondary channels and a linear progression of channels, preferably diagonally to the ice movement. The structures seem to appear mainly in slope positions in the marginal zones of the regional till-cover. Different forms of their generation have to be considered.

30|$|In recent decades, {{magnetic}} susceptibility {{has been widely}} applied in studies of loess/paleosoil sequence, lacustrine and marine sections as a good proxy of climate change (Heller and Liu, 1984, 1986; Kukla et al., 1988; Dekkers, 1997; Evans et al., 1997; Fang et al., 1999; Brachfeld and Banerjee, 2000; Brachfeld et al., 2002; Boës et al., 2005; Garcin et al., 2006). However, the links between susceptibility and climate variations can be complex and case-specific. In the Chinese Loess Plateau, {{magnetic susceptibility}} is lower in the loess and higher in the paleosoil, which correlates to the glacial and interglacial periods, respectively (Heller and Liu, 1984, 1986; Hovan et al., 1989; Bloemendal et al., 1995; Heslop et al., 2000). In comparison, the loess in Alaska shows high susceptibility values, and the paleosol from Lubin in Poland shows low values. In these two latter cases, the magnetic susceptibility of the former resulted from the relatively strong wind transporting coarse grain-size magnetite during the glacial period (Begét et al., 1990), while that of the latter is inferred to correlate with the cool-wet <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> when magnetic particles would have been destroyed through the gleying and eluviation (Heller and Evans, 1995).|$|E
40|$|The unglaciated part of {{southern}} England {{was subject to}} <b>periglacial</b> <b>climates</b> that lasted for more than 20 ka on at least eight occasions during the last 750 ka. There are large outcrops of Jurassic mudstones in south-west England, principally the Lias Group and the Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay formations, and extensive exposures of these beds in the cliffs on the Dorset coast. Notwithstanding the susceptibility {{of this type of}} mudstone to permafrost damage and deformation, there is no published record of large-scale folding in the region that has been attributed to periglacial disturbance. Three examples of folding are described here, in the Lias Group at Charmouth and Seatown in west Dorset, and in the Kimmeridge Clay on the Isle of Portland that are attributed to intermittent downhill creep of surface layers up to 20 m thick when in a partially frozen condition. The style of folding in the mudstones and the geometry of the disturbed deposits indicates that they are not tectonic in origin, nor were they formed by valley bulging or landsliding. These are the first large-scale structures of their kind to be recorded in southern England: similar folds elsewhere have been interpreted as valley bulges or tectonic in origin. At the Seatown and the Isle of Portland localities, the deformed mudstones have been preserved beneath younger landslides. The absence of similar structures elsewhere on the Dorset coast is attributed to the rapid removal of similarly weakened materials by marine erosion at times of high sea level during the last c. 6000 years...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} of the <b>periglacial</b> characteristics of <b>climate</b> and landforms in Finland. Mean annual air temperature (MAAT) in Finland ranges from + 5. 5 to - 3 °C, and frost sums {{in most parts}} of the country are large enough for active seasonal frost. Local conditions are more important in the formation of frost features than the overly general mean values of air temperature, however. Snow depth is the critical factor for most frost features, and permafrost is observed only in northern parts of the country, where thin snow cover supports frost activity. A brief description of features indicating frost activity is presented. Palsas, pounus, and string mires are peat landforms designed by frost. Fell slopes exhibit additional features of talus, slush flows and gelifluction lobes and terraces. Frost heave and contraction cracking are characteristic features occuring even in fields in southern Finland. Active frost-sorted patterned grounds are common in northern Finland, especially at the bottoms of shallow, seasonally dry ponds. Ground water close to the surface is essential for the formation of most frost features. Special forms of both aeolian and fluvial activity are part of the periglacial environment in Finland. Snow drift and deflation of sand surfaces formed by glaciofluvial processes during deglaciation are part of the periglacial environment in Lapland. Drastic spring floods with ice dams formed in river channels are typical for northern rivers. Proposals for further studies are made at the end of the paper...|$|R

The depositional relict of such environments is called Ice Complex (IC; ледовый комплекс [ledovyi kompleks] in Russian) permafrost. The IC archives preserve information of past <b>periglacial</b> and <b>climate</b> landscape conditions of mid- and late Pleistocene Beringian environments. In certain locations of the East Siberian Arctic, IC remnants of different age and extent are known. While using IC deposits as archives of palaeo-landscape and palaeo-environmental dynamics, summer and winter conditions over large time-scales are detectable. Commonly applied summer proxy include palaeontological proxy such as pollen, plant macrofossils, insect fossils and, most prominent, mammal fossils of the Mammoth fauna, while geochemical and stable isotope properties of ground ice allow for insights into freezing and winter conditions. IC chronologies are challenging because the deposition and post-sedimentary preservation of ice-rich permafrost are triggered by palaeo-relief settings and related processes {{as well as by}} the intensity of thermokarst. This complicates geochronological interpretations, as representatives of consecutive late Quaternary periods may be found at laterally different positions and altitudes in coastal and riverine exposures. Shifts between permafrost aggradation and degradation over time frequently cause gaps in sequences. Furthermore, numerical dating of IC mainly includes different approaches such as radiocarbon (14 C) dating of organic material, infrared and optically-stimulated luminescence (IRSL, OSL) dating on feldspar and quartz grains, radioisotope disequilibria of thorium- 230 to uranium- 234 (230 Th/U) dating of peat, and chlorine- 36 to chloride ratios (36 Cl/Cl) of ground ice. The application of various geochronologic methods to cover the age intervals of certain IC deposits implies that different permafrost components (organic, mineralic, ice) as well as different geochemical and physical properties have to be employed. At the southern coast of Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island at least four distinct IC strata were previously described and dated, which cover among the longest time interval of late Quaternary terrestrial permafrost deposition in East Siberia; starting about 200 kyr ago. With this contribution we seek to present and discuss our current understanding of IC chronologies preserved on the New Siberian Archipelago including MIS 2 Yedoma (Sartan) IC, MIS 3 Yedoma (Molotkov) IC, MIS 5 Buchchagy IC, and MIS 7 a Yukagir IC.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{process of}} recent gullies on Mars is currently under debate. This study aims {{to discriminate between}} the proposed formation processes - pure water flow, debris flow and dry mass wasting - {{through the application of}} geomorphological indices commonly used in terrestrial geomorphology. High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of Earth and Mars were used to evaluate the drainage characteristics of small slope sections. Data from Earth were used to validate the hillslope, debris-flow and alluvial process domains previously found for large fluvial catchments on Earth, and these domains were applied to gullied and ungullied slopes on Mars. In accordance with other studies, our results indicate that debris flow {{is one of the main}} processes forming the Martian gullies that were being examined. The source of the water is predominantly distributed surface melting, not an underground aquifer. Evidence is also presented indicating that other processes may have shaped Martian crater slopes, such as ice-assisted creep and solifluction, in agreement with the proposed recent Martian glacial and <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate.</b> Our results suggest that, within impact craters, different processes are acting on differently oriented slopes, but further work is needed to investigate the potential link between these observations and changes in Martian climate. © The Geological Society of London 2011...|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that pronival (protalus) ramparts can be formed by a snow-push mechanism and need not accumulate {{in the conventional}} manner {{as a result of}} supranival processes. Ridges in pronival positions up to 1. 2 m high and of unequivocal snow-push origin are described from two sites in Smørbotn cirque, Romsdalsalpane, southern Norway. The seven lines of evidence are: (1) parallel abrasion tracks on large boulders embedded in the substrate; (2) displaced surface and embedded clasts with proximal furrows; (3) corrugated (flute-like) substrate surfaces; (4) the sickle-shaped plan-form of the ridges; (5) generally asymmetrical ridge cross-profiles (shallow, concave proximal; steep, convex distal); (6) strong preferred orientations and dips of surface-embedded clasts on ridge proximal slopes; and (7) a subnival/pronival ridge comprising loosely packed diamicton forming along the contact zone between the snowbed and substrate. This evidence indicates ridge formation by snow sliding involving bulldozing of the substrate. Factors considered important in favouring snow push producing distinct pronival ramparts at the sites include: a maritime <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> with heavy winter snowfall and rapid snow-firn conversion producing snow densities of up to 900 kg m– 3; a deformable substrate with relatively small inputs of rockfall or avalanche debris; and a steep headwall susceptible to snow avalanching and hence enhanced snow supply.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the past}} 15 years, {{evidence}} for an ice-rich planet Mars has rapidly mounted, become increasingly varied {{in terms of}} types of deposits and types of observational data, and has become more widespread across the surface. The mid-latitudes of Mars, especially Utopia Planitia, show many types of interesting landforms {{similar to those in}} periglacial landscapes on Earth that suggest the presence of ice-rich permafrost. These include thermal contraction polygonal networks, scalloped terrains similar to thermokarst pits, debris flows, small mounds like pingos and rock glaciers. Here, we address questions concerning the influence of meltwater in the Utopia Planitia (UP) landscape using analogs of near-surface melting and drainage along ice-wedge troughs on Bylot Island, northern Canada. In Utopia Planitia, based on the identification of sinuous channel-like pits within polygonal networks, we suggest that episodic underground melting was possible under severe <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> conditions. In UP, the collapse pattern and morphology of unconnected sinuous elongated pits that follow the polygon crack are similar to underground melting in Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada). Based on this terrestrial analogue, we develop a thermal model that consists of a thick insulating dusty layer over ice-saturated dust during a period of slight climatic warming relative to today's climate. In the model, the melting point is reached at depths down to 150 m. We suggest that small-scale melting could have occurred below ground within ground-ice polygonal fractures and pooled in underground cavities. Then the water may have been released episodically causing mechanical erosion as well as undermining and collapse. After melting, the dry surface dusty layer might have been blown away, thus exposing the degraded terrain of the substrate layer...|$|E
40|$|Issue title: Quaternary Geology of the British Isles: Part 1 (David Bridgland and Nick Golledge (Eds) Sponsorship: BGS-University Funding InitiativeThis paper {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} description and interpretation of Late Devensian glacigenic deposits exposed in a 2 km-long cliff section at Tonfanau, Mid-West Wales. The section offers crucial insight concerning glacier dynamics and sedimentation on the eastern margin of the Irish Sea Basin. Six lithofacies are identified: diamicton, sandy gravel, well-rounded gravel, well-sorted sand, muddy sand, and laminites. Two diamicton horizons are present: an upper brown clast-rich sandy diamicton, and a lower grey clast-poor muddy diamicton, the latter being only sporadically exposed by wave action. Sand and gravel occur in close association, as well as minor mud and gravel successions. The sedimentary succession at Tonfanau records the dynamics and deposition of both Welsh and Irish Sea Ice. The lowermost part of the exposed section records Welsh ice extending into Cardigan Bay, depositing a diamicton originating from the adjacent hinterland to the West. As the Irish Sea Ice Stream flowed south, it impinged upon the present coastline at Tonfanau, depositing sediment with a northern provenance on top of predominantly Welsh material, as indicated by clasts from the Irish Sea Basin, Anglesey and the Ll?n Peninsula. The depositional environment for the Irish Sea materials is interpreted as one where a fluctuating ice margin generated a grounding-line fan complex in an ice-contact lake that merged laterally with lake sediments derived from suspension and turbidity currents. Succeeding facies indicate over-riding by Irish Sea Ice. Finally, the upper few metres of the succession was subjected to cryoturbation under a <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Black Ven-Spittles {{landslip}} {{complex is}} one of largest active landslip systems on the south coast of England. It was probably initiated in the Pleistocene in a <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate,</b> but then remained inactive {{for most of the}} Holocene. There is map and photographic evidence to show that it has been especially active in the last 100 years and that it is expanding westwards towards the Lyme Regis urban area. The landslip can be divided into two distinct parts; an upper Cretaceous-based part that behaves independently, and an underlying Jurassic-based part that is greatly influenced by movements in the Cretaceous part. The upper landslip is composed of collapsed Gault Formation clay (up to 5 m thick), overlain by a c. 75 m-thick succession of decalcified calcareous sandstones and calcarenites of the Upper Greensand Formation. Below this and extending to the sea, the 100 m-thick Jurassic Charmouth Mudstone Formation crops out in a series of low cliffs, each of which is capped by a thin bed of limestone. During the past 60 years, large-scale failures have occurred in the ‘Cretaceous’ landslip at less than 10 -year intervals, usually after prolonged periods of rain. Each of these has generated large sand-rich debris flows that have poured onto the Charmouth Mudstone Formation outcrop and initiated failures in the more clay-mineral-rich parts of the succession. The more calcareous parts of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation are not prone to failure and form stable ribs within the landslip complex. Large bedding-plane-initiated failures occur infrequently in the Charmouth Mudstone Formation at the seaward end of the complex, beneath The Spittles, where there is a low downslope dip.

40|$|International audienceOrganic carbon (OC) {{and total}} {{nitrogen}} (TN) concentrations and stable isotope ratios (d 13 C, d 15 N) of fine (< 50 µm) size fractions of deep-sea sediments {{from the central}} North Atlantic were employed to identify changes in sources of organic matter over the past 50 ka BP. Ambient glacial sediments are characterised by values that reflect mixtures of marine and terrestrial inputs (averages ± 1 s : OC/TN = 7. 6 ± 0. 8; d 13 C =- 22. 8 ± 1. 0 ‰; d 15 N = 5. 5 ± 0. 6 ‰). d 13 C, OC, and TN concentrations shift to higher values during the Holocene, indicating a gradual decrease of fine terrigenous supply to the North Atlantic. The unchanged d 15 N record between last glacial and Holocene stages indicates that the central North Atlantic region remained oligotrophic at least during the past 50 ka BP, but additional studies are required to support this result in terms of nitrogen oceanic budget. During the phases of enhanced ice-rafted detrital supply corresponding to prominent Heinrich events (HL 1, HL 2, HL 4, and HL 5), fine-sized sedimentary organic matter has lower OC and TN concentrations, contrasting sharply with those of ambient glacial sediments. Lower d 13 C (down to - 28 ‰) and d 15 N (down to + 1. 6 ‰) values and high OC:TN ratios (up to 14. 7 ± 1. 1) are found for HL 1, HL 2, and with lesser extent for HL 4. These values reflect enhanced detrital supply originating from poorly differentiated soil horizons that characterise <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> conditions and from organic matter– bearing rock sources of the underlying geological basement. During HL 5, only the d 13 C offset records the input of fine size ice-rafted organic matter.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} radiological risk to humans and the environment from a geological repository for radioactive waste, a safety assessment must be performed. This implies that the release and transfer of radionuclides from the repository into the surface environment are calculated and that the effects in the biosphere are evaluated for an assessment period up to one hundred thousand years according to Swedish regulations. This paper discusses the challenges associated with the modelling of surface ecosystems over such long time scales, using the recently completed assessment for {{the extension of the}} existing repository for the low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste (called SFR) in Forsmark, Sweden as an applied example. In the assessment, natural variation and uncertainties in climate during the assessment period were captured by using a set of climate cases, primarily reflecting different expectations on the effects of global warming. Development of the landscape at the site, due to post-glacial isostatic rebound, was modelled, and areas where modelling indicated that radionuclides could discharge into the biosphere were identified. Transfers of surface water and groundwater were described with spatially distributed hydrological models. The projected release of radionuclides from the bedrock was then fed into a biosphere radionuclide transport model, simulating the transport and fate of radionuclides within and between ecosystems in the landscape. Annual doses for human inhabitants were calculated by combining activity concentrations in environmental media (soil, water, air and plants) with assumptions on habits and land-use of future human inhabitants. Similarly, dose rates to representative organisms of non-human biota were calculated from activity concentrations in relevant habitats, following the ERICA methodology. In the main scenario, the calculated risk for humans did not exceed the risk criteria or the screening dose rate for non-human biota, indicating that the repository design is sufficient to protect future populations and the environment. Although the combination of radionuclides, land-uses/habitats, type of most exposed population and area of exposure that contribute most to the total dose shifts over time, the total calculated dose shows limited variability. Significant reductions in the dose only occur during submerged periods and under <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> conditions. As several different water and food pathways were equally important for endpoint results, it is concluded that {{it would be difficult to}} represent the biosphere with one or a set of simplified models. Instead, we found that it is important to maintain a diversity of food and water pathways, as key pathways for radionuclide accumulation and exposure partly worked in parallel...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin has been the site of intensive U exploitation with harmful impacts on groundwater quality. The understanding of groundwater flow and age distribution is crucial for the prediction of the future dispersion and impact of the contamination. State of the art tracer methods (3 H, 3 He, 4 He, 85 Kr, 39 Ar and 14 C) were, therefore, used to obtain insights to ageing and mixing processes of groundwater along a north–south flow line in {{the centre of the}} two most important aquifers of Cenomanian and middle Turonian age. Dating of groundwater is particularly complex in this area as: (i) groundwater in the Cenomanian aquifer is locally affected by fluxes of geogenic and biogenic gases (e. g. CO 2, CH 4, He) and by fossil brines in basement rocks rich in Cl and SO 4; (ii) a thick unsaturated zone overlays the Turonian aquifer; (iii) a <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> and permafrost conditions prevailed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and iv) the wells are mostly screened over large depth intervals. Large disagreements in 85 Kr and 3 H/ 3 He ages indicate that processes other than ageing have affected the tracer data in the Turonian aquifer. Mixing with older waters (> 50 a) was confirmed by 39 Ar activities. An inverse modelling approach, which included time lags for tracer transport throughout the unsaturated zone and degassing of 3 He, was used to estimate the age of groundwater. Best fits between model and field results were obtained for mean residence times varying from modern up to a few hundred years. The presence of modern water in this aquifer is correlated with the occurrence of elevated pollution (e. g. nitrates). An increase of reactive geochemical indicators (e. g. Na) and radiogenic 4 He, and a decrease in 14 C along the flow direction confirmed groundwater ageing in the deeper confined Cenomanian aquifer. Radiocarbon ages varied from a few hundred years to more than 20 ka. Initial 14 C activity for radiocarbon dating was calibrated by means of 39 Ar measurements. The 14 C age of a sample recharged during the LGM was further confirmed by depleted stable isotope signatures and near freezing point noble gas temperature. Radiogenic 4 He accumulated in groundwater with concentrations increasing linearly with 14 C ages. This enabled the use of 4 He to validate the dating range of 14 C and extend it to other parts of this aquifer. In the proximity of faults, 39 Ar in excess of modern concentrations and 14 C dead CO 2 sources, elevated 3 He/ 4 He ratios and volcanic activity in Oligocene to Quaternary demonstrate the influence of gas of deeper origin and impeded the application of 4 He, 39 Ar and 14 C for groundwater dating...|$|E
40|$|During the {{transition}} period between Pleistocene and Holocene, from 20 000 to 8000 BC, river valleys were subject {{to the impact of}} vistulian ice-sheet or to the influence of <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate.</b> Their development was dependent on their width and position in relation {{to the edge of the}} ice-sheet. In the southern part of the Polish Plain three areas where advanced river valley research is carried out can be distinguished (Fig. l). The frrst of these is the middle Vistula valley which was formed by water inflow from the upper montainous part of the basin and by the direct influence of the Scandinavian ice-sheet. The second area where research is the most advanced methodologically encloses the Prosna river valley and the middle Warta river valley. The Prosna valley was situated in a periglacial zone and the Proma base level changed according to the vistulian ice-sheet location. The middle Warta river valley was embraced by the Leszno stage zone and thus is of pradolina origin. The Łódź Upland situated on a watershed is the third area of valley studies. Here the research is concerned with the upper parts of small valleys, where climatic and glacial factors did not mingle with each other. Also investigations of denudational valley infI 1 l are valuable for the valley studies. During {{the transition}}al period three stages of river valley development (Fig. 2) can be recognized: 1. 20000 - 14 500 B. C. - the braided river phase with glacial, periglacial and mixed supplies. Aggradation of valley floors was characteristic of the phase and cut and built terace formation occured rarely. 2. 14 500 - 10 000 B. C. - the complex phase of valley floor cutting with simultaneous change from braided to widely meandering channel patterns. Present results show that the alternation did not occur at the same time in diITerent valleys or even fragments of valleys and was strongly dependent on local conditions. 3. 10000 - 8000 B. C. - the meandering river phase with decreasing meander proportions untill mezo-Holocene. In general the state of knowledge od valley development in non-glaciated regions of the Polish Plain in {{the transition period}} is regarded as advanced. That is, to a considerable extent, the result of various conditions in the areas where the studies are conducted. It is recommended that the research methods should be perfected and standardized. This would enable the distinction and comparision of local and general determinants of valley evolution to be made more precisely. Expansion of model application from the Warta river study area to others would speed the transition from quality to quantity characteristics of the process.

40|$|La {{couverture}} de limon carbonaté (loess) présente dans les régions du nord est issue de la sédimentation éolienne qui s’est développée sous climat périglaciaire au cours du Pléistocène. La décarbonatation des loess, active depuis 16000 BP, est essentiellement liée au climat. Ce processus, dans le contexte d’enclos circulaires de l’âge du Bronze sur le site de Lauwin-Planque (Nord), a montré un grand intérêt. Nous exposons ici l’idée selon laquelle, dans une séquence sédimentaire suffisamment épaisse, la limite de décarbonatation conserve l’image de la topographie contemporaine de ce processus. Dans le cas d’occupations anthropiques, les structures et la présence de matière organique liées aux activités humaines sont potentiellement capables d’influencer la décarbonatation. Si les structures ont été utilisées assez longtemps, elles ont pu modifier la profondeur de décarbonatation (en négatif dans les structures en creux et en positif pour les élévations). Afin de découvrir des informations relatives aux élévations des enclos funéraires, une méthode de fouille spécifique a été développée. Elle permet d’enrichir notre connaissance de ces vestiges dans une région où ils ne sont pas conservés, apportant des données équivalentes à celles connues en Angleterre où ils le sont. The {{layer of}} carbonated silt (loess) found in Northern France {{is the result}} of wind sedimentation which developed during the <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> of the Pleistocene. The decarbonatation of loess, active since 16, 000 BP, is mainly climate-related. This process, noticed on the circular enclosure from the Bronze Age at Lauwin-Planque (Nord) is extremely interesting. Fieldwork allowed the discovery of 10 funeral enclosures, one of them not yet excavated. Five of them are really close and could belong to a coherent group. Two others are not very far from the first group and the last two seem isolated. The enclosures are simple, from 19 to 34 m in diameter. The idea expressed here is that, in a thick enough sedimentary sequence, the limit of decarbonatation preserves the image of the topography, contemporary to that process. In the case of anthropic activity, the features and the presence of organic material related to human occupation could {{have an impact on the}} decarbonatation. If they lasted long enough, their implementation could have modified the level of decarbonatation (higher under a built-up feature and lower under dug-out features). In order to collect information on mounds associated with funeral enclosures, a specific excavation method has been developed. First, it is important to know the sedimentary context extremely well. The best solution is the presence of a specialist in the field at the beginning of the work to observe the nature of the ground. After that, all the features which appear on the surface inside and around the enclosure have to be studied, before test pits are placed regularly and all the material collected, with the data recorded in a classic manner. Then four trenches are dug in order to create a cross, in staggered rows from the centre of the circle to several metres outside it. These trenches have to reach the level under the limit of carbonated silt. Observation of the cross-sections provides information regarding potential mounds present inside or outside the enclosures. Finally, the whole enclosure is emptied. In Lauwin-Planque, the excavation allowed a modification of the level of decarbonatation to be observed under the circular Bronze Age enclosures. For enclosure 1, a central mound combined with an embankment is suggested. For enclosures 2 and 5, we can guess at a central mound (which is confirmed by the absence of decarbonatation under the central tomb in enclosure 2). There are two embankments, inside and outside the enclosure. The study of the third and the fourth enclosures showed the presence of a central mound inside and one embankment for the fourth. But these two enclosures do not have embankments outside. A central mound and an external embankment was observed for enclosure 6. The seventh was extremely levelled but the presence of an external embankment was seen. For the last one where observations were made, it is possible to confirm an embankment outside the enclosure and a probable mound inside but the whole area was levelled and a modern path passed through the monument. This entire method provides an opportunity to widen our knowledge of this type of feature by gathering data equivalent to those from Britain. The silt context is really important in collecting this information. The monumental aspect of these enclosures is brought to light by the presence of mounds and embankments. It is thus possible to consider the conception of funeral features in the Bronze Age. Leroy-Langelin Emmanuelle, Collette Olivier, Duvivier Hélène, Samuelian Clara.

40|$|The northeastern part of Eurasia {{represents}} one of Earth‟s most extreme <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> regions, characterized by the strongest seasonal temperature amplitudes on the northern hemisphere. The region is occupied by deep-reaching permafrost and covered by widespread taiga and tundra vegetation (Müller et al., 2010). Paleoenvironmental {{studies have been conducted}} close to the northern polar cycle in the Verkhoyansk Mountain Range and its western foreland to infer periglacial landscape dynamics in response to late Quaternary climate change. The distribution of preserved terminal moraines reveal several mountain glacier advances in the past (Stauch and Lehmkuhl, 2010). According to luminescence dating, the widest geologically documented glacial advence took place during the Saalian stage around 135 ka. Less extended glaciations to the foreland appeared during the early Weichselian at 100 - 120 ka and at 85 - 90 ka, while the youngest glaciation (> 50 ka) was confined to the mountain area. No regional glacial advance is evident for the late Weichselian and the last glacial maximum, a time which was characterized by aeolian loess formation (Stauch et al., 2007, Popp et al., 2007). Sediment cores from the 25 m deep Lake Billyakh (340 m a. s. l.), a former proglacial basin, document environmental changes of the last 50 kyr (Diekmann et al., 2007). Pollen records indicate a dry climate for the late Weichselian, indicated by a change from tundra towards cold steppe vegetation after 32 ka until 13. 5 ka BP (Müller et al., 2009, 2010). For the same time, sedimentological and diatom data indicate a lake level drop. Modelling experiments with a general circulation model suggest that the consecutive decline in the extent of mountain glaciers and increase in dryness through the Weichselian was dictated by the growing shielding effect of the western Eurasian ice sheets that prevented the supply of moist Atlantic air masses to eastern Siberia (Krinner et al., 2011). In addition, enhanced deposition of dust reduced the albedo and promoted ice and snow melting during summer (Krinner et al., 2011). Environmental changes towards interglacial conditions of the Holocene are documented in the Lake Billyakh deposits (Müller et al., 2009) as well as in a peat section at Dyanushka River (Werner et al., 2009). Both records show that climate amelioration started after 13. 5 ka BP with the quick return of larch trees that also persisted during the Younger Dryas cold spell, suggesting that the Verkhoyansk Mountain area possibly represented a plant refugium during the climate extremes of the last ice age (Tarasov et al., 2009). Reforestation continued since 11. 4 ka BP with the spread of boreal cold deciduous and taiga forests and reached a maximum extent after 7 ka BP. Limnological conditions of Lake Billyakh changed to a higher lake-level and increased biological productivity consistent with climate warming and increased humidity. Mean July air temperatures reconstructed by fossil aquatic chironomids, using a regional inference model (Nazarova et al., 2011), indicate warmest summer temperatures between roughly 9. 0 and 6. 6 ka BP. The stable-isotope composition of ice wedges in permafrost soils point to warmer winters during the early Holocene compared to the late Holocene (Popp et al, 2006). The recognition of a regional early Holocene climate optimum is consistent with long-term Holocene climate development in wide parts of northern Eurasia. References Diekmann, B., Andreev, A.

40|$|Sediments in the {{foreland}} of {{a mountain}} chain are sometimes suited to reconstitute the conditions in these mountains {{at the time of}} deposition of the sediments. The present study gives the results of a sedimentological investigation of the Tertiary and Quaternary deposits {{in a part of the}} Duero basin, situated south of the Cordillera Cantabrica, which supplied the sediments. The aim was to determine both the conditions in the source area, and the environments in the area of deposition. The investigated area is situated in the province of Palencia, between the rivers Pisuerga and Carrión. The area being a part of the so-called Meseta, has a simple relief. Two levels at different heights can be distinguished. The higher level, páramo, is strikingly flat, the lower, campiña, is more undulating. The Tertiary basin sediments are of various types, and can have six different facies. Along the mountain foot the sediments are chiefly conglomerates with some sandstones, united into the Cuevas facies. The pebbles consist of limestones derived from the Cretaceous limestones, which in the E occupy extensive areas but in the W are only exposed in a narrow strip along the southern border of the mountain chain. At that time they must have formed the southern flank of the Cantabrian Mountains. Pebble roundness and flatness indicate for the greater part a deposition as river fans in a warm and rather dry climate. These conglomerates have been brought into an overturned position in the W of the investigated area, and were strongly tilted in the E. This tectonic deformation is thought by several authors to have occurred during the Savian orogenic phase. The younger beds, having the Cuevas facies, are nearly horizontal, and were deposited during and after this folding as appears from the presence of sandstone pebbles derived from the sandstone layers within the folded conglomerates. South of the limestone conglomerate belt a wide zone with red beds occurs. These sediments, consisting of an alternation of quartzite conglomerates and sandy layers, represent the Vega de Riacos facies. The change of deposit from a limestone conglomerate into a quartzite conglomerate may be due to changes in the supply area, the Mesozoic limestones having been eroded and having become covered with soils, and the Palaeozoic quartzites and conglomerates becoming largely exposed. A typical feature is the absence in all basin sediments of pebbles derived from the Carboniferous limestone, the so-called Brezo-limestone, which at present froms a great part of the southern flank of the Cantabrian Mountains. The sediments presenting the Vega de Riacos facies were deposited in a warm and humid monsoon climate, as appears from (1) the red colour, (2) the shape of the quartz sand grains, and (3) the clay mineral associations. The remainder of the investigated area is characterized in the N by yellow sandy and clayey deposits, covered by similar, but yellow and red, sandy and clayey deposits, and in the S by yellow clayey deposits overlain by white and grey gypseous marls, alternating with limestones. The underling yellow sandy and clayey sediments, typical for the Carrión de los Condes facies, are dated as Vindobonian on account of the fossils found near Palencia and Saldaña. The upper yellow and red, sandy and clayey layers found in the N, having the Relea facies, have a Pontian age, based on fossils found near Saldaña and Relea. In the E of the investigated area this Relea facies shows a local divergent aspect, called Zorita facies, characterized by an alternation of red, sandy deposits and white, marly deposits. The gypseous marls and the limestones in the S, which show the Páramos facies, overlying the yellow clayey sediments in Carrion de los Condes facies, have a cover of a very hard, bluish limestone, the Páramos-limestone, which provided some freshwater molluscs indicating also a Pontian age. The sediments in the four last-named facies represent chiefly deposits of rivers and shallow temporary lakes (lagunas). A rather regular sedimentation went on from Vindobonian into Pontian times, meanwhile influenced by changes of climate in the basin. After the warm and humid climate in which the red beds were deposited, the climate became more arid, with an increased evaporation. First the yellow sediments in Carrión de los Condes facies were deposited, in the N being still sandy, in the S becoming more clayey. They are clearly deposits of rivers which did not supply very coarse material, but some deposition in temporary lakes must also have occurred. At the end of the Vindobonian evaporation became stronger, as can be concluded from the lime crusts found in the upper layers in the area of the Carrión de los Condes facies, and more to the S, in the area of the Páramos facies, from the deposition of gypsum bearing marls, when the drainage was more or less restricted. This climate persisted during the first part of the Pontian as can be concluded from lime crusts occurring in the lower beds in Relea facies, the depositional environment, that is rivers and lagunas, remaining the same. Later in the Pontian the humidity of the climate increased, as appears from the increasing number of red layers in this Relea facies. In the S this increasing humidity caused the precipitation of gypsum to cease, and at this time the Páramos-limestones were formed. The Zorita facies, which laterally replaces the Relea facies, is chiefly determined by a supply from a different source area, namely the Mesozoic calcareous rocks exposed a few kilometres N of the deposits in Zorita facies. The heavy mineral associations (chapter VIII, part 1) are monotonous, practically consisting of resistant minerals. They seem to indicate a supply from NW to SE. Also the pebble supply followed this direction, as may be concluded from their size distribution within the red beds having the Vega de Riacos facies. This NW—SE direction was the main drainage direction in Pre-Rhodanian times. The clay minerals in the sediments presenting the various facies allow to draw some conclusions on the climates at the times of deposition. For instance, the rather righ percentage of kaolinite in the sediments in the Cuevas and Vega de Riacos facies, may indicate a warm and rather humid climate during and after deposition. But later alterations also influenced the clay mineral associations, causing a preponderance of illite (see chapter VIII, part 3). After the deposition of the Páramos-limestones the Duero basin became a non-depositional area. During the Rhodanian orogenic phase the bordering mountains were uplifted, and the basin was tilted towards the W. This caused a switch of the drainage pattern which before was directed towards the Mediterranean, and now became directed towards the Atlantic Ocean. During the whole of the Pliocene strong bevelling occurred, through which the páramolevel in the basin and pediments at the foot of the mountain chains were formed. Next, a warm and dry climate characterized by sheetfloods must have prevailed all over the Meseta, causing the deposition of the angular quartzitic raña pebbles, so well exposed in the investigated area on the raña of Guardo. These rañas are presumed to be of Villafranchian age. Soon the influence of Quaternary changes of climate became evident. Certainly the younger river terraces, found at five various levels, are due to these Pleistocene climatic changes. Pebble analyses could confirm the opinion of various authors who admit only two real glaciations in the Spanish mountains, namely the last and the penultimate. Indeed, the two lower terraces contain pebbles which may have been formed in a <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate,</b> whereas the deposits of the three upper terraces only contain evidences of a humid, temperate climate. The sedimentological data on which the conclusions on the depositional environments, as given above, are based can be found in the following chapters: (a) grain size distribution (chapter V), (b) pebble analyses (chapter VI), (c) morphometrical sand analysis (chapter VII), (d) mineralogy of the sands (chapter VIII, parts 1 and 2), (c) clay minerals (chapter VIII, part 3). The development of the drainage pattern (see chapter IX) was reconstituted with the help of a number of captures, which can be observed in the field. In this way a gradual adjustment of the drainage to the present direction can be demonstrated. In the investigated area this adjustment occurred rather late during the Quaternary. At that time also the campiña-level was formed. Finally, in the last chapter (X), an attempt is made to establish the palaeoclimates, and the relief in the source area, though there remain many uncertainties. The Cordillera Cantabrica, being a mountain area, must always have had a more humid climate than the basin. Even during the Upper-Vindobonian and Lower-Pontian, while the basin was arid, the climate in the mountains must have been more humid. This appears from the clastic sediments supplied into the basin (Relea facies). Though the drainage was restricted, it will not have been totally interrupted, because only calcite and gypsum were deposited in the basin centre, and no halite. There will have been a certain relief in the source area during the whole time. The sediments give no indications for a fully developed peneplain. During the whole of Vindobonian and Pontian times clastic sediments have been supplied by the Cantabrian Mountains...|$|E
40|$|The {{site for}} CRP- 3, 12 km east of Cape Roberts (77. 006 °S; 103. 719 °E) was selecte to overlap the lower Oligocene strata cored in nearby CRP- 2 / 2 A, and {{to sample the}} oldest strata in the Victoria Land Basin (VLB) for Paleogene climatic and tectonic history. As it transpired there was {{underlap}} {{of the order of}} 10 s of metres. CRP- 3 was cored from 3 to 939 mbsf (metres below the sea floor), with a core recovery of 97 %. Coring took place from October 9 to November 19, 1999, on 2. 0 to 2. 2 m of sea ice and through 295 in of water. The Cenozoic strata cored were mostly g 1 acially influenced marine sediments of early Oligocene age, though they may be earliest Eocene near the base, where at 823 mbsf Devonian Beacon sandstone was encountered. Following CRP- 1 and CRP- 2 / 2 A, CRP- 3 completes the coring of 1500 m of strata on the western margin of the VLB. Core fractures and other physical properties, such as sonic velocity, density and magnetic susceptibility, were measured throughout the core. Down-hole logs for these and other properties were taken from 20 down to 900 - 919 mbsf. Also, vertical seismic profile data were gathered from shots offset both along strike and up dip from the hole. Sonic velocities in CRP- 3 are close to 2. 0 km/s in the upper 80 m, but become significantly faster below 95 mbsf, averaging 3. 2 + 0. 6 km/s {{to the bottom of the}} hole. An exception to this is an interval of dolerite conglomerate from 790 to c. 820 mbsf with a velocity of c. 4. 5 km/s. Dip of the strata also increases down-hole from 10 ° in the upper 100 m to around 22 ° at the bottom. Over 3000 fractures were logged through the hole, and borehole televiewer imagery was obtained for most of the hole for orienting core and future stress field analysis. Two high-angle crush zones, interpreted as faults, were encountered at c. 260 and c. 540 mbsf, but no stratigraphic displacement could be recognised. A third fault zone is inferred from a low angle shear zone in the upper part of a coarse dolerite conglomerate from 790 to 805 mbsf. Temperature gradient was found to be 28. 5 °. km- 1. Basement strata cored from 823 mbsf to the bottom of the hole are largely light-reddish brown medium-grained sandstone (quartz-cemented quartzarenite) with abundant well-defined parallel lamination. These features are comparable with the middle Devonian part of the Beacon Supergroup, possibly the Arena Sandstone. This interval also includes a body of intrusive rock from 901 to 920 mbsf. It has brecciated contacts and is highly altered but some tholeiitic affinity can be recognised in the trace element chemistry. Its age is unknown. Post-Beacon sedimentation began on deeply eroded quartzarenite with the deposition of a thin sandstone breccia and conglomerate, probably as terrestrial talus, followed by dolerite conglomerate and minor sandstone of probable fluvial origin to 790 mbsf. Sedimentation continued in a marine setting, initially sandstone and conglomerate, but above c. 330 mbsf the strata include mudstone and diamictite also. The older sandstone and conglomerate beds are seen as the products of rapid episodic sedimentation. They are interpreted by some as the product of glaciofluvial discharge into shallow coastal waters, and others as a result of sediment gravity flows, perhaps glacially sourced, into deeper water. The core above c. 330 mbsf has facies that allow the recognition of cyclic sequences similar to those in CRP- 2 A. Fourteen unconformity-bounded sequences have been recognised from 330 mbsf to the sea floor, and are interpreted in terms of glacial advance and retreat, and sea level fall and rise. Detailed lithological descriptions on a scale of 1 : 20 are presented for the full length of the core, along with core box images, as a 300 page supplement to this issue. The strata cored by CRP- 3 are for the most part poorly fossiliferous, perhaps as a consequence of high sedimentation rates. Nevertheless the upper 200 m includes several siliceous microfossil- and calcareous nannoplankton-bearing intervals. Siliceous microfossils, including diatoms, ebrideans, chrysophycean cysts and silicoflagellates are abundant and well-preserved in the upper 67 m - below this level samples are barren or poorly preserved, but contain residual floras that indicate assemblages were once rich. No siliceous microfossils were found below 193 mbsf. Calcareous nannofossil have a similar distribution but are generally well preserved. Foraminifera, marine and terrestrial palynomorphs, and marine macrofossils were found consistentlsy down to c. 330 mbsf and sporadically to 525 mbsf. The taxa suggest marine deposition in water depth of c. 50 to 120 m. Below 525 mbsf no microfossils were found, apart from mudstone with similar marine and terrestrial palynomorphs at 781 mbsf, and rare miospores in the conglomerate below 790 mbsf. The terrestrial miospore record, which include several species of Nothofagus and podocarpaceous conifers, suggest low diversity woody vegetation, implying a cold temperate to <b>periglacial</b> <b>climate</b> for the hinterland throughout the period recorded by CRP- 3. Important components of the warmer Eocene flora, known from erratics in southern McMurdo Sound, are missing, through the dominance of smectite in clay from strata below 650 mbsf suggests that the landscape prior to the timne of deposition had experienced a more temperate weathering regime. Biostratigraphy for ihe upper part of CRP- 3 is provided by diatoms and calcareous nannofossils. The first appearance of Cavitatus jouseanus at 48 mbsf suggests an age of arround 31 Ma for this horizon. The last appearance of Transverspontis pulcheroides at 114 mbsf in an interval of relatively high abundance indicates a reasonably sound age for this horizon at 32. 5 ± 0. 5 Ma. The absence of particular resistant diatoms that are older than 33 Ma supports an age that is younger than this for the upper 200 m of CRP- 3. Marine palynomorphs, which occur sporadically down to 525 mbsf and in a single occurrence at 781 inbsf, have biostratigraphical potential once the many new species in this and other CRP cores are described, and F 0 and LO datums established. The mudstone at 781 mbsf has a new clinocyst species, rare Lejeunecysta cysts and a variety of acritarchs and prasinophytes, a varied marine assemblage that is quite different from and presumably younger than the well known Transantarctic Flora of mid to late Eocene age. On this basis and for the moment we conclude that the oldest strata in CRP- 3 are earliest Oligocene (or possibly latest Eocene) in age - c. 34 Ma. Over 1 l 00 samples were taken for magnetic studies. Four magnetozones were recognisd on the basis of NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility, reflecting the change in sediment composition between quartz sand-dominated and dolerite-dominated. For this report there was time only to produce a magnetostratigraphy for the upper 350 m. This interval is largely of reversed polarity (5 normal intervals total 50 of the 350 m), in contrast to the dominantly normal polarities of CRP- 2 / 2 A, and is inferred to be Chron C 12 R. This extends from 30. 9 to 33 Ma. consistent with the biostratigraphic datums from the upper part of CRP- 3. The lower limit of reversed polarity has yet to be established. The short period normal events are of interest as they may represent cryptochrons or even polarity changes not recognised in the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale. Erosion of the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains through the Kirkpatrick Basalt (Jurassic tholeiitic flows) and dolerite-intruded Beacon Supergroup (Devonian-Triassic sandstone) into granitic basement beneath is recorded by petrographical studies of clast and sand grain assemblages from CRP- 3. The clasts in the lower 30 m of the Cenozoic section are almost entirely dolerite apart from a few blocks from the Beacon Supergroup beneath. Above this, however, both dolerite and granitoids are ubiquitous, the latter indicating that erosion had reached down to granitic basement even as the first sediment was accumulating in the VLB. No clasts or sand grains of the McMurdo Volcanic Group were found, but rare silt-size brown volcanic glass occurs in smear slides through most of CRP- 3, and is interpreted as distal air fall from alkaline volcanism in northern Victoria Land. Jurassic basalt occurs as clasts sporadically throughout the sequence: in the sand fraction they decline upwards in abundance. The influence of the Devonian Beacon Supergroup is most striking for the interval from 600 to 200 mbsf, where quartz grains, from 10 to 50 % of them rounded, dominate the sand fraction. Laminae of coal granules from the overlying Permian coal measures in all but the upper 150 in of the CRP- 3 sequence show that these also were being eroded actively at this time. CRP- 3 core completed the stratigraphical sampling of the western margin of the VLB by not only coring the oldest strata (Seismic Unit V 5) but also the basin floor beneath. This has several important tectonic implications: - most of the Kirkpatrick Basalt and the Beacon Supergroup with the sills of Ferrar Dolerite have been eroded by the time down-faulting displaced the Beacon to form the basin floor. - matching the Beacon strata at the bottom of CRP- 3 with the equivalent strata in the adjacent mountains suggests c. 3000 m of down-to-the-east displacement across the Transantarctic Mountain Front as a consequence of rifting and subsequent tectonic activity. - the age of the oldest Cenozoic strata in CRP- 3 (c. 34 Ma), which are also the oldest strata in this section of the VLB, most likely represents the initiation of the rift subsidence of this part of the West Antarctic Rift System. This age for the oldest VLB fill is much younger than previously supposed by several tens of millions of years, but is consistent with newly documented sea floor spreading data immediately north of the northern Victoria Land continental margin. These new data sets will drive a re-evaluation of the relationship between initiation of uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains (currently c. 55 Ma) and VLB subsidence...|$|E
