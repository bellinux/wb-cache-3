Walker Professor of Finance at The Owen School, was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the put-call parity in the article “The Relation between <b>Put</b> <b>and</b> <b>Call</b> Prices]].” The article has been called a “classic” that was the source of many innovations. Nicholas Bollen, the E. Bronson Ingram Associate Professor in Finance, focuses his research on hedge funds; he discussed the subject “Do Hedge Fund Managers Misreport Returns?” at the Oxford Finance Symposium in 2008. The research of William G. Christie, Frances Hampton Currey Professor of Management, led to reform of NASDAQ trading practices.|$|E

50|$|Because {{interest}} rate caps/floors are equivalent to bond <b>puts</b> <b>and</b> <b>calls</b> respectively, the above analysis shows that caps and floors can be priced analytically in the Hull-White model. Jamshidian's trick applies to Hull-White (as today's {{value of a}} swaption in HW is a monotonic function of today's short rate). Thus knowing how to price caps is also sufficient for pricing swaptions.|$|R

One well-known application is the semistatic hedging of path-dependent barrier options with European options.

50|$|Note: This fixed {{conversion}} ratio means {{the price of}} these hybrids react to the movement in the underlying share price. (The extent of the co-relation is {{sometimes referred to as}} a delta, and these typically have a delta of between 0.5 and 1)In addition, some of these securities include minimum and maximum conversion terms, effectively giving the holder a <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> option if the share price reaches a certain prices.|$|E
5000|$|Covered {{warrants}} {{are very}} similar to options—much more so than [...] "traditional" [...] warrants. This is because covered warrants, just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> warrants. They can also be created {{on a wide variety of}} underlying instruments not just equities and they are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges.|$|E
5000|$|A short {{straddle}} is a non-directional options trading {{strategy that}} involves simultaneously selling a put and a {{call of the}} same underlying security, strike price and expiration date. The profit {{is limited to the}} premium received from the sale of <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call.</b> The risk is virtually unlimited as large moves of the underlying security's price either up or down will cause losses proportional to the magnitude of the price move. A maximum profit upon expiration is achieved if the underlying security trades exactly at the strike price of the straddle. In that case both puts and calls comprising the straddle expire worthless allowing straddle owner to keep full credit received as their profit. This strategy is called [...] "nondirectional" [...] because the short straddle profits when the underlying security changes little in price before the expiration of the straddle. The short straddle can also be classified as a credit spread because the sale of the short straddle results in a credit of the premiums of the <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In London, <b>puts</b> <b>and</b> [...] "refusals" [...] (calls) {{first became}} {{well-known}} trading {{instruments in the}} 1690s {{during the reign of}} William III and Mary II. Privileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth century America, with both <b>puts</b> <b>and</b> <b>calls</b> on shares offered by specialized dealers. Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase.

Types of investments include: equity, debt securities, real estate, currency, commodity, token, derivatives such as <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> options, futures, forwards, etc. This definition makes no distinction between those in the primary and secondary markets.
