Ionization chambers and Geiger counters were first adapted for field use in the 1930s. The first transportable Geiger–Müller counter (weighing 25kg) was constructed at the University of British Columbia in 1932. H.V.

Subsequent models were the principal instruments used for uranium prospecting for many years, until geiger counters were replaced by scintillation counters.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{measuring}} illumination, the candela is not a <b>practical</b> <b>unit,</b> as it only applies to idealized point light sources, each approximated by a source small compared to the distance from which its luminous radiation is measured, also assuming that it is done so {{in the absence of}} other light sources. What gets directly measured by a light meter is incident light on a sensor of finite area, i.e. illuminance in lm/m2 (lux). However, if designing illumination from many point light sources, like light bulbs, of known approximate omnidirectionally-uniform intensities, the contributions to illuminance from incoherent light being additive, it is mathematically estimated as follows.

50|$|The B.A. {{system of}} <b>practical</b> <b>units</b> gained {{considerable}} international support, and was adopted - with one important modification - by the First International Conference of Electricians (Paris, 1881).
