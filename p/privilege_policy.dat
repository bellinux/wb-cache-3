This paper investigates women's participation in voluntary groups, utilising data from a postal survey of 968 female respondents and in-depth interviews with 30 women. Logistic regression was conducted to examine factors associated with frequency of women's group involvement. Not working full-time, living in a married relationship, and having a university education were all significantly associated with regular involvement. The qualitative data further illustrated {{some of the ways}} in which these three factors were linked with women's involvement in groups. We conclude that women who were able to regularly participate were those who already enjoyed levels of social and economic <b>privilege.</b> <b>Policies</b> to promote social capital via participation might focus on identifying what types of group involvement benefit women's health, and increasing the accessibility of such groups to include diverse groups of women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper will}} explore a {{curriculum}} framework that explicitly addresses {{the reduction of}} heterosexism {{as a means to}} produce students that are culturally competent to practice with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community. Van Den Bergh and Crisp (2004) place great importance on addressing beliefs/attitudes, knowledge, and skills when broaching culturally competent practice with the LGBTQ population. Beliefs/attitudes, knowledge, and skills in an educational approach will be advocated in this paper. Specifically, the creation of a constructivist environment will be endorsed as a means for students to critically assess their own beliefs/attitudes, knowledge, and skills. A curriculum framework that utilizes classroom activities related to heterosexual <b>privilege,</b> <b>policy,</b> and practice role plays will be discussed. This curriculum framework is intended to prepare social work students to work with LGBTQ clients...|$|E
40|$|Mobility systems raise {{multiple}} {{questions of}} justice. Work on mobility justice and policy often treats different {{elements of the}} debate separately, for example focussing on environmental justice or accessibility. This is problematic as it can <b>privilege</b> <b>policy</b> solutions without a {{full view of the}} winners and losers and the values implicit in that. Using analysis of current policy, we investigate how mobility justice can reconcile its different components, and find two major consequences. First, is doubt about the justice of the existing policy approach which tries to tackle transport pollution primarily through a shift to low emission vehicles. This approach privileges those with access to private vehicles and further privileges certain sets of activities. Second is a need to reassess which basic normative ideas should be applied in mobility justice. Work on mobility justice has tended to appeal to conceptions of justice concerned with access to resources including resources enabling mobility. These conceptions say little about how resources should be used. We show that avoiding stark inequalities means collectively thinking about how resources are used, about how we value activities involving mobility, and about what sorts of goods and services we create...|$|E

For an extension Ext and some specification Zrxt of a job to be done, we define Id:'riv(Ext, Zrxt) to be the policy that grants the minimum privileges needed for execution of Ext to satisfy Zrxt. (A policy here is a mapping from system histories to sets of privileges.) As an example, specification Zrxt of a spell-checker extension Ext for a word processor might specify that misspelled words be flagged in the word processor's open file F; we would then expect #Jiv(Ext, ZExt) to be a policy that permits the spell-checker read (but not write) access to F, read (but not write) access to a file containing a spelling dictionary, and read/write access to a file containing user-added spellings for local jargon term...|$|R

Using data for a sample of S&P 500 firms, we correct for the endogeneity of the environmental audit decision by estimating a bivariate probit model with 'compliance status’ and 'decision to self-audit’ as two discrete choice variables. Our empirical analysis controls for compliance and self-auditing incentives created by regulatory and community-based pressures. We find that those facilities belonging to firms that {{have been subject to}} inspections in the past, that face a stronger threat of liabilities for Superfund sites, and that are more visible due to size are more likely to undertake an environmental audit.

30|$|My {{intention}} in {{proposing to}} weaken the political aspect of these issues is to bring a new policy orientation to the regulating of ethnic relations in China. It doesn’t mean that ethnic relations are not political, nor {{does it mean that}} there are only cultural differences among groups in China, but by this new orientation we lead the people to consider the related issues as “less-political.” All issues about which minority elites and people care, such as group equality, political rights, policies for preferential opportunities, protection for cultures, do contain political meanings. What I suggest is to gradually lessen the “political color” of the 55 minority groups’ identities and the interactions between different groups. I hope that each group would not treat itself as exceptional compared to other groups, such as by demanding independent political identity, special political rights, or enjoying specific <b>privilege</b> <b>policies.</b> I hope that Chinese society would not approach inter-group relations from the perspective of “political bargaining,” “area distinction,” “rights division,” or “benefits clash.” I hope that Chinese people don’t bring group prejudice and the essentialist ways of thinking about nation/ethnicity to the twenty-first century to destroy the new opportunity of historical development and the close cooperation and co-prosperity of the Chinese nation.|$|R

30|$|The {{negative}} attitude some Han people in minority regions have toward local minorities comes partly from their discontent with “privilege policies for minorities”. For example, some Han think that preferential policies such as weighted scores that favor minority students’ university entrance exams are not fair. I frequently hear from Uyghur students coming from Xinjiang that Han in inland China {{are much more}} friendly than Han in Xinjiang. One reason for this might be that the latter feels that they and their children are discriminated against by such Xinjiang minority preferential policies. The minority students with scores {{more than one hundred}} points lower than Han students, for example, are admitted to key national universities, while the Han students fail to gain university admission and instead have to find work (Ma Rong, 2009). Psychologically, they feel this sharp contrast is unacceptable. The same type of situation can be observed from the judicial policy of “two less and one lenient (两少一宽)”. 2 In the same way we used to ask Han members to understand the minority’s situation and feelings from their positions, I would suggest members of minority groups also try to understand the feelings of Han and their situations from their positions. With such a transposition, when some minority scholars strongly propose to reinforce further <b>privilege</b> <b>policies</b> toward minorities, they should be more circumspect. Only when we are empathic toward each other, can we understand each other.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to answer the question: in the British state's {{relationship}} with its diverse minority ethnic communities, how have politics framed administrative allocation of language support services? The dynamics of policy development are investigated, a tangible effect of the shift from unofficial pragmatic multiculturalism towards community cohesion/“Britishness” having been a government focus on English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) rather than translation/interpreting. This change has revealed a tension between the demands of identity and equality for minority ethnic people: respect for cultural identity requires provision of translation/interpreting while creating (political) equality between majority and minority communities entails the latter having access to the political language so placing an emphasis on ESOL. Design/methodology/approach – An evidence synthesis is undertaken of policy documents relating to the British state's provision of language support services and data on the skill levels in English from government surveys. Findings – The relative contribution of financial constraints and new policy/ideological positions to changes in the direction of policy and provision is assessed. With respect to the “new approach to ESOL”, this process of discretionary allocation that <b>privileges</b> <b>policies</b> of integration and community cohesion rather than language need itself is viewed against the inadequacies of the data currently available on levels of English language proficiency in providing the basis for making policy decisions and allocating resources. Originality/value – The level of English language skills amongst Britain's minority ethnic groups and of government policy to address skill deficits has been substantially neglected.

The purposeful selection of certain skills and dispositions above others, as well as the translation of the work of advanced teachers into written performance indicators, <b>privileges</b> a <b>policy</b> discourse of skill over the oral discourse of practice preferred by teachers.

They thereby come to the fore of scholarly pursuits in communication and other fields; hence the dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s trans-disciplinary approach. The study assesses HDTV systemic conditions, organizational and institutional setting, and the actors 2 ̆ 7 policy discourse. It focuses on political economy of HDTV <b>policy</b> determination; it <b>privileges</b> <b>policy</b> process over policy outcomes. It argues that advisory process constitutes the critical phase in policy determination. The dissertation thereby makes a contribution to this neglected area of policy scholarship. The study contains five parts. The first two Parts introduce a three-pronged analytical scheme: the case-study, the system- and the systemic-level of HDTV politics. Part Three, describing fourteen critical policy events, supplants a rich body of detail about the ATV planning, system design, testing, and implementation issues as they have evolved over time. Part Four, Organized Interests and HDTV Policy Process, identifies HDTV industry, government, and academic actors. Next, via a taxonomy of 2 ̆ 2 issue publics, 2 ̆ 2 it aggregates the actors 2 ̆ 7 interests into two policy camps [...] the N-HDTV and B-HDTV interest formations (HDTV in a narrow and broad sense). It further differentiates among the interests allied with the production, transmission, and display domains. The ensuing 2 x 3 matrix helps discern the motives that govern HDTV actors to cooperate and compete in policy process. It also illuminates discussion about how actors negotiate several broad themes (trade, competitiveness, technology, national security) at the level of HDTV public policy formation. This is the space of so called HDTV industrial policy debate. Part Five, Technology between State and Market, targets the systemic conditions under which institutional agents respond to the advent of HDTV. The following two questions structure the conclusions: Was the US state able to determine HDTV policy objectives; Was it successful in devising effective policy instruments to effectuate such objectives? The answers reinforce the interim findings about an emerging and significant change in the mix of US modes and forms of governance, in which HDTV regulatory and public policy processes are being perceived as an important beachaed. ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the history of}} laws and policies regulating consumption of alcoholic beverages by {{young people in the}} United States, and examines youth drinking patterns that have emerged over time. Currently, all 50 states have a minimum drinking age of 21. Various rationales are offered for the 21 drinking age, such as the claim that earlier drinking hinders cognitive functions, and the claim that earlier drinking increases the lifetime risk of becoming an alcoholic. While there is sufficient evidence to support the claim {{that it would be better}} for adolescents and young adults if they did not drink prior to age 21, research shows that vast numbers of underage persons consume alcoholic beverages, often in large quantities. The Article discusses the question of why underage drinking laws have not been able to effectively stop underage drinking. Normally, discussions of underage drinking focus on persons under age 21 as one group. This Article breaks underage drinkers into two groups: minors (i. e. drinkers under the age of 18) and young adults (i. e. drinkers between the ages of 18 and 21). The Article goes on to separately analyze the drinking patterns and reasons for drinking. The article concludes that prohibitions on drinking by minors could be made more effective, because restrictions on activities by minors are expected and normally honored by parents, law and society. The Article also concludes, however, that the enforcement of a drinking prohibition for young adults between the ages of 18 and 21 is doomed to remain largely ineffective because the drinking ban is wholly inconsistent with other legal policies aimed at that age group. The Article discusses three areas (health care decisions, educational decisions, and smoking) where persons over the age of 18 have virtually unfettered personal discretion, and applies the reasoning of those situations to the decision about whether to consume alcoholic beverages. The Article also compares the total drinking ban for young adults with the graduated <b>privilege</b> <b>policies</b> applied to drivers 2 ̆ 7 licensing. The Article concludes that the total prohibition of alcohol consumption for young adults is inconsistent with other policies affecting young adults, and this inconsistency, coupled with harms that may come from the 21 drinking age; make the current policies ineffective and ill-advised for young adults between the ages of 18 and 21...|$|R
