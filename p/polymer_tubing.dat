50|$|Ultrapure {{water is}} easily {{contaminated}} by traces {{of carbon dioxide}} from the atmosphere passing through tiny leaks or diffusing through thin wall <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> when sample lines are used for measurement. Carbon dioxide forms conductive carbonic acid in water. For this reason, conductivity probes are most often permanently inserted directly into the main ultrapure water system piping to provide real-time continuous monitoring of contamination. These probes contain both conductivity and temperature sensors to enable accurate compensation for the very large temperature influence on the conductivity of pure waters. Conductivity probes have an operating life of many years in pure water systems. They require no maintenance except for periodic verification of measurement accuracy, typically annually.|$|E
5000|$|Tygon is a {{brand name}} {{for a family of}} {{flexible}} <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> consisting of a variety of materials to be used [...] "across a range of specialized fluid transfer requirements". The specific composition of each type is a trade secret. Some variants have multiple layers of different materials. Tygon is a registered trademark of Saint-Gobain Corporation. It is an invented word, owned and used by Saint-Gobain and originated in the late 1930s. Tygon products are produced in three countries, but sold throughout the world. Tygon tubing is used in many markets, including food and beverage, chemical processing, industrial, laboratory, medical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor processing. There are many formulations of clear, flexible, Tygon tubing. The chemical resistance and physical properties vary among the different formulations, but the tubing generally is intended to be [...] "so resistant to chemical attack that it will handle practically any chemical", whether liquid, gas, or slurry. [...] Users should be cautious to match the characteristics of the tubing being considered with their own specific requirements.|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of ammonia}} onto <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> used in pollutant stream conveyance was assessed for possible systematic losses. An experimental design with three replications of 32 trials was completed {{to investigate the}} adsorption of ammonia based on two nominal temperatures (25 and 37 o C), two nominal tubing lengths (15 and 46 meters), six nominal inlet concentrations (2, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 parts per million), and two tubing materials, (Teflon and low density polyethylene,LDPE). For a given length, mean ammonia adsorption on Teflon tubing {{was found to be}} statistically less than that from LDPE. The effect of tubing length on ammonia adsorption was not significant for Teflon, but was significant for LDPE. There were significant differences between inlet and outlet concentrations of LDPE at nominal inlet concentrations of 5 and 15 ppm (α= 0. 05). Overall, ammonia adsorption to Teflon was approximately 1 ppm regardless of the magnitude of inlet concentration. This loss on to the Teflon surface was well within the measurement sensitivity of the ammonia analyzer. Ammonia adsorption onto LDPE tubing increased with increasing inlet concentration, temperature and length of the tubing...|$|E

40|$|Microfluidics is an {{engineering}} tool {{used to control}} and manipulate fluid flows, with practical applications for lab-on-a-chip, point-of-care testing, and biological/medical research. However, microfluidic platforms typically lack {{the ability to create}} a fluidic duct, having an arbitrary flow path, and to change the path as needed without additional design and fabrication processes. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective approach for facile, on-demand reconfiguration of microfluidic channels using flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing.</b> The tubing provides both a well-defined, cross-sectional geometry to allow reliable fluidic operation and excellent flexibility to achieve a high degree of freedom for reconfiguration of flow pathways. We demonstrate that microparticle separation and fluid mixing can be successfully implemented by reconfiguring the shape of the tubing. The tubing is coiled around a 3 D-printed barrel to make a spiral microchannel with a constant curvature for inertial separation of microparticles. Multiple knots are also made in the tubing to create a highly tortuous flow path, which induces transverse secondary flows, Dean flows, and, thus, enhances the mixing of fluids. The reconfigurable microfluidics approach, with advantages including low-cost, simplicity, and ease of use, can serve as a promising complement to conventional microfabrication methods, which require complex fabrication processes with expensive equipment and lack a degree of freedom for reconfiguration. ope...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A hollow-cathode microplasma {{was used}} to modify the lumenal surface of small-diameter {{polyethylene}} (PE). We make use of two microplasma diagnostics to monitor the plasma proper-ties during the treatment process. A microwave cavity {{was used to}} measure the density of the microplasma. Emitted light from the microplasma was fed into a monochromator at various positions along the PE tube to assess uniformity of the microplasma. Ef-fectiveness of plasma treatments were evaluated using the capil-lary-rise method at various positions along the tubing. We show a correlation between the properties of the inner surface of the PE tubing and the light emitted from the plasma. A Poly(ethy-lene oxide) (PEO) surfactant was immobilized to the lumenal sur-face of the PE tubing using the microplasma discharge. An in vitro blood-circulation loop was constructed to test the hematocompat-ibility of the PE tubes. After blood exposure, scanning electron microscope images were taken to assess the density of adhering platelets {{along the length of the}} tubes. The plasma-treated tubing showed fewer blood adherents than the untreated tubing. By suit-ably controlling the pressure drop along the tube, the uniformity of the microplasma treatment along the tubing can be optimized.

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} measure ammonia emission concentrations from dairies using an isolation flux chamber. A hybrid dairy in Comanche county, Texas, was measured for one week each during August 2002 and January 2003. Sixty total ammonia samples {{were taken from the}} free stall barn, open lot, mixing tank, separated solids, compost, and two lagoons using the developed protocol. The ammonia concentration measurements were made using a chemiluminescence analyzer located inside a mobile laboratory. From the emission concentrations recorded, it was estimated that 9. 68 metric tons of ammonia were produced from this dairy per year. An emission factor of 13. 34 ? 28. 80 kilograms per day per thousand head of cattle (kg/day/ 1000 head) was estimated for this dairy (? 95 % confidence intervals) during summer conditions. For winter conditions the emission factor was 12. 05 ? 12. 89 kg/day/ 1000 head. The 11 % difference of the emission factors from summer to winter conditions was predominantly from the change in ambient and control volume temperatures (a mean difference of approximately 25 degrees Celsius), differences in source temperatures, and seasonal variability in husbandry. The adsorption of ammonia onto different <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> used in pollutant stream conveyance was researched for possible systematic losses. Teflon and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were tested for ammonia losses with treatments of: temperature, length, and inlet concentration. Inlet concentration and temperature were significant factors used to describe ammonia adsorption for Teflon, whereas LDPE was also affected by tubing length. These factors were used to create a model to correct the summer dairy measurements for ammonia losses, resulting in an emission factor increase of 8. 3 % over the original value obtained from the flux chamber. A nitrogen mass balance was performed to estimate the amount of nitrogen available for ammonia formation as excreted - 177. 5 kilograms per year per animal (wet basis). The amount of ammonia excreted per year was also estimated to be 26. 63 kilograms per year. The measured ammonia emitted from the dairy was five times less than the ammonia excreted and thirty-six times less than the total nitrogen excreted...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of biological samples in clinical or research settings often requires measurement of analytes from complex and limited matrices. Immunoaffinity separations in miniaturized formats offer selective isolation of target analytes with minimal reagent consumption and reduced analysis times. A prototype capillary-based microfluidic {{system has been}} developed for immunoaffinity separations in biological matrices with laser-induced fluorescence detection of labeled antigens or antibodies. The laboratory-constructed device was assembled from two micro syringe pumps, a microchip mixer, a micro-injector, a diode laser with fused-silica capillary flow cell, and a separation capillary column. The columns were prepared from <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> and packed under negative pressure with a stationary phase that consisted of biotinylated antibodies attached to streptavidin-silica beads. A custom software program controlled the syringe pumps to perform step gradient elution and collected the signal as chromatograms. The system performance was evaluated with flow accuracy, mixer proportioning, pH gradient generation, and assessment of detectability. A direct labeling/direct capture immunoaffinity separation of C-reactive protein (CRP) was demonstrated in simulated serum. CRP, a biomarker of inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk assessment, was fluorescently labeled in a one-step reaction and directly injected into the system. A quadratic calibration model was selected and precision and accuracy were reported. Parathyroid hormone was also analyzed by the direct capture approach, but displayed nonspecific binding of human plasma matrix components that limited the useful assay range. Capillary sandwich assays of CRP in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid were performed using both capture and detection antibodies. The detection antibody was labeled and purified offline to minimize signal from labeled matrix components. Four parameter logistic functions were used to model the data and precision and accuracy were evaluated. During the study, 250 nL injection volumes 2. 0 µL/min flow rates were employed, minimizing sample and reagent consumption. The microfluidic system was capable of separating antigens from biological matrices and is potentially portable for patient point-of-care settings. Additionally, the flexible design of the separation capillary allows for the {{analysis of}} different clinical markers by changing the antibodies and the low assay volume requirements could lead to less invasive patient sampling techniques.

40|$|ObjectiveAlthough {{technological}} improvements {{continue to}} advance the designs of aortic stent grafts, miniaturization of the required delivery systems would allow their application {{to be available to}} a wider range of patients and potentially decrease the access difficulties that are encountered. We performed this feasibility study to determine if thin-film NiTi (Nitinol) {{could be used as a}} covering for stent grafts ranging from 16 mm to 40 mm in diameter. Specifically, we wished to determine the profile reduction attainable and improve the flexibility of our design. MethodsUsing a novel hot-sputter deposition technique, we created sheets of thin-film NiTi (TFN) with a tensile strength of > 500 Megapascal (MPa) and thickness of 5 - 10 microns. TFN was used to cover stents, which were then deployed in vitro. Patterned thin film was fabricated via a lift-off technique; grafts were constructed with stents ranging from 16 - 40 mm and deployed in a pulsatile flow system from the smallest diameter <b>polymer</b> <b>tubing</b> into which the stent and TFN would fit. The bending/stiffness ratio vs similar sized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) -covered stents was also determined. ResultsTFN was created in both non-patterned and patterned forms, with a tensile strength of > 100 MPa for the latter. We created devices that were successfully deployed via delivery systems half the size of fabric-covered stent grafts (ie, the 16 mm stent graft that originally was delivered via a 16 French (F) system was reduced to 8 F, and the 40 mm stent graft delivered via a 24 F system was reduced to 12 F). No migration of the devices was observed with deployment in both straight and curved tubing, which was sized so that the stent grafts were oversized by 20 %. Both forms of the thin-film were noted to be more flexible than the same sized ePTFE stent graft, and the patterned graft had an additional 15 - 30 % flexibility vs the non-patterned film. ConclusionThese in vitro results demonstrate the feasibility of TFN for covering stent grafts designed for placement in the aorta. The delivery profile can be significantly reduced across a wide range of sizes, while the material remained more flexible than ePTFE. Clinical RelevanceThis article describes a basic science/engineering project with clear implications for clinical application of an aortic endograft. Our continuing projects along these lines will be reported as these data become available. The clinical relevance is also addressed within the body of the manuscript, particularly in the discussion...|$|E
