40|$|The IRMM- 1027 is a {{certified}} reference material for nuclear material control and accountancy. Each individual spike contains about 50 mg uranium (m(235 U) /m(U) ~ 20 %) and about 1. 8 mg plutonium (m(239 Pu) /m(Pu) ~ 98 %) in dried form. They are used for the determination of U and Pu content of spent fuel solutions with isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) by plant operators and safeguards authorities. The dried uranyl and <b>plutonium</b> <b>nitrates</b> are embedded in an organic substance, which provides a stable layer {{at the bottom of}} the vial and preserves the integrity of the spike during storage and transport. Cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) with 19 wt% butyryl content has been applied on the IRMM- 1027 spikes for the last decade. However, the cellulose matrix containing the spike material tends to flake off after about two years. In order to prolong the shelf life of the spikes, JRC-IRMM has been investigating CABs with higher butyryl contents – 35 wt% and 52 wt% –, to optimize the chemical stability and to achieve a longer lasting layer. Empirical tests have shown that the higher the butyryl content, chemically the more stable and the more resistant the CAB is. Accordingly, future series of LSD spikes will be prepared with CAB containing 35 wt% butyryl, which should remain intact for at least 4 years. Furthermore, JRC-IRMM together with CPMT is investigating the chemical and mechanical properties of the three different CABs to further improve understanding on their stability and durability. JRC.

40|$|The {{authors are}} {{developing}} multi-functional anion-exchange resins that facilitate anion uptake by carefully controlling {{the structure of}} the anion receptor site. The new ion-exchange resins interface the rapidly developing field of ion-specific chelating ligands with robust, commercial ion exchange technology. The overall objective of the research is to develop a predictive capability which allows the facile design and implementation of multi-functionalized anion exchange materials which selectively sorb metal complexes of interest from targeted process, waste, and environmental streams. The basic scientific issues addressed are actinide complex speciation along with modeling of the metal complex/functional site interactions in order to determine optimal binding-site characteristics. Their approach uses a thorough determination of the chemical species both in solution and as bound to the resin to determine the characteristics of resin active sites which can actively facilitate specific metal-complex sorption to the resin. The first year milestones were designed to allow us to build off of their extensive expertise with <b>plutonium</b> in <b>nitrate</b> solutions prior to investigating other, less familiar systems. While the principle investigators have successfully developed actinide chelators and ion-exchange materials in the past, the authors were fully aware that integration of this two fields would be challenging, rewarding and, at times, highly frustrating. Relatively small differences in the substrate (cross-linkage, impurities), the active sites (percent substitution, physical accessibility), the actinide solution (oxidation state changes, purity) and the analytical procedures (low detection limits) can produce inconsistent sorption behavior which is difficult to interpret. The potential paybacks for success, however, are enormous. They feel that they have learned a great deal about how to control these numerous variables to produce consistent, reliable analysis of actinide sorption behavior with the new and baseline anion-exchange materials. The four Year 1 (FY 97) milestones are listed below along with an update on the progress towards their completion. ...|$|R

40|$|In October and November of 1981 {{thirteen}} approach-to-critical {{experiments were}} performed on a remote split table machine (RSTM) in the Critical Mass Laboratory of Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) in Richland, Washington, using planar arrays of polyethylene bottles filled with <b>plutonium</b> (Pu) <b>nitrate</b> solution. Arrays of up to sixteen bottles were {{used to measure the}} critical number of bottles and critical array spacing with a tight fitting Plexiglas{reg_sign} reflector on all sides of the arrays except the top. Some experiments used Plexiglas shells fitted around each bottles to determine the effect of moderation on criticality. Each bottle contained approximately 2. 4 L of Pu(NO 3) 4 solution with a Pu content of 105 g Pu/L and a free acid molarity H+ of 5. 1. The plutonium was of low 240 Pu (2. 9 wt. %) content. These experiments were performed to fill a gap in experimental data regarding criticality limits for storing and handling arrays of Pu solution in reprocessing facilities. Of the thirteen approach-to-critical experiments eleven resulted in extrapolations to critical configurations. Four of the approaches were extrapolated to the critical number of bottles; these were not evaluated further due to the large uncertainty associated with the modeling of a fraction of a bottle. The remaining seven approaches were extrapolated to critical array spacing of 3 - 4 and 4 - 4 arrays; these seven critical configurations were evaluation for inclusion as acceptable benchmark experiments in the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Project (ICSBEP) Handbook. Detailed and simple models of these configurations were created and the associated bias of these simplifications was determined to range from 0. 00116 and 0. 00162 {+-} 0. 00006 ?keff. Monte Carlo analysis of all models was completed using MCNP 5 with ENDF/BVII. 0 neutron cross section libraries. A thorough uncertainty analysis of all critical, geometric, and material parameters was performed using parameter perturbation methods. It was found that uncertainty in the impurities in the polyethylene bottles, reflector position, bottle outer diameter, and critical array spacing had the largest effect.

In the present study, we evaluated the early lung damage and macrophage activation after pulmonary contamination of plutonium of various preparation modes which produce different solubility and distribution patterns. Whatever the solubility properties of the contami-nant, macrophages represent a major retention compartment in lungs, with 42 to 67 % of the activity from broncho-alveolar lavages being associated with macrophages 14 days post-contamination. Lung changes were observed 2 and 6 weeks post-contamination, showing inflammatory lesions and accumulation of acti-vated macrophages (CD 68 positive) in plutonium-contaminated rats, although no increased proliferation of pneumocytes II (TTF- 1 positive cells) was found. In addition, acid phosphatase activity in macrophages from contaminated rats was enhanced 2 weeks post-contamination as compared to sham groups, as well as inflammatory mediator levels (TNF-α, MCP- 1, MIP- 2 and CINC- 1) in macrophage culture supernatants.

40|$|The Additional Protocol (AP) authorizes {{safeguards}} {{authorities to}} verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities {{in all parts of}} a state’s nuclear fuel cycle as well as any other location where nuclear material is or may be present. As a part of the Additional Protocol, environmental sampling has become an important tool for the detection of non-declared nuclear activities. In environmental sampling, swipe samples are collected for bulk and particle analysis. Considering the potential consequences of the analyses, these measurements need to be subjected to a rigorous quality management system. The Nuclear Signatures Inter-laboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (NUSIMEP) was established in 1996 to support the growing need to trace and measure the isotopic abundances of elements characteristic for the nuclear fuel cycle present in trace amounts in the environment. NUSIMEP- 8 focused on measurements of low-level uranium and <b>plutonium</b> in synthetic <b>nitrate</b> solution aiming to support EURATOM safeguards (DG ENER), the IAEA Network of Analytical Laboratories (NWAL) for bulk analysis of environmental samples and laboratories in the field. The NUSIMEP- 8 solution was prepared from mixed oxide fuel dissolved in nitric acid with addition of natural uranium and diluted to an environmental level. Participating laboratories in NUSIMEP- 8 received one sample solution with undisclosed values of n(238 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(240 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(241 Pu) /n(239 Pu), n(242 Pu) /n(239 Pu) and n(234 U) /n(238 U), n(235 U) /n(238 U), n(236 U) /n(238 U) amount ratios. Those isotope amount ratios were measured by participating laboratories using their routine analytical procedures. Measurement of the major isotope ratios n(235 U) /n(238 U) and n(240 Pu) /n(239 Pu) were obligatory; measurement of the minor isotope ratios were optional. 25 laboratories registered for NUSIMEP- 8, three withdrew the registration while one laboratory encountered problems with the shipment of the sample. Finally, 19 participants have reported measurement results using different analytical techniques, among those 10 NWAL laboratories. Two participants did not report their results due to technical problems. The participant measurement results have been evaluated against the certified reference values by means of z-scores and zeta-scores in compliance with ISO 13528 : 2005.

CID of complexes of the general formula PuO x (NO 3) y − resulted in the elimination of NO 2 to produce PuO x+ 1 (NO 3) y− 1 −, which in most cases corresponds to an increase in the oxidation state of plutonium. Plutonyl species, Pu V O 2 (NO 3) 2 − and Pu VI O 2 (NO 3) 3 −, were produced from Pu III (NO 3) 4 − and Pu IV (NO 3) 5 −, respectively, by the elimination of two NO 2 molecules. CID of Pu VI O 2 (NO 3) 3 − resulted in NO 2 elimination to yield PuO 3 (NO 3) 2 −, in which the oxidation state of plutonium could be VII, a known oxidation state in condensed phase but not yet in the gas phase. Density functional theory confirmed the nature of Pu V O 2 (NO 3) 2 − and Pu VI O 2 (NO 3) 3 − as plutonyl(V/VI) cores coordinated by bidentate equatorial nitrate ligands. The computed structure of PuO 3 (NO 3) 2 − is essentially a plutonyl(VI) core, Pu VI O 2 2 +, coordinated in the equatorial plane by two nitrate ligands and one radical oxygen atom. The computations indicate that in the ground spin-orbit free state of PuO 3 (NO 3) 2 −, the unpaired electron of the oxygen atom is antiferromagnetically coupled to the spin-triplet state of the plutonyl core. The results indicate that Pu(VII) is not a readily accessible oxidation state in the gas phase, despite that it is stable in solution and solids, but rather that a Pu(VI) -O• bonding configuration is favored, in which an oxygen radical is involved...|$|E
