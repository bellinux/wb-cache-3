5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E

40|$|Closed chest {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR), having {{been so successful}} after its introduction {{in the operating room}} for saving lives of anesthetized patients, was adopted for use in the intensive care units, then hospital-wide, and finally to out of hospital patients.

In this review, the Ethical principles on which physicians, hospitals, patients, and surrogate decision makers rely in order to apply their perceived moral obligations to provide patient safety, comfort, and treatment are examined with particular emphasis on do not resuscitate orders (DNR). It is clear that DNR does not equate with do not treat. </p...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} British {{plan was}} replaced by Operation Sinbad which was acceptable to the Iraqis and was executed from September 2006 to February 2007. Along with other Coalition commanders, Stirrup viewed Sinbad as insufficient {{because it did not}} involve directly attacking the militias. [...] Believing that it would not deliver the level of improvements in security that the British wanted, Stirrup began looking at the high risk strategy of withdrawing British troops from inside Basra which would have left the Iraqis in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> either <b>having</b> <b>to</b> deal with the security problems themselves or losing control of Iraq's second city.|$|R

Zach voices to Kendall that he arranged the blackout to sabotage her chances of surrogacy {{because he wanted to}} protect her from a dangerous Ryan. Kendall does not care for Zach's reasons and breaks off her romantic ties to him, just as she is not feeling the maternal instinct. Zach also loses his son, Ethan, to death around this same time, and loses Kendall as well.|$|E
25|$|John Stansbury {{took over}} a school whose numbers were declining rapidly. Numbers were down from 150 {{at the end of}} 1976 to 102 and dwindled still further {{in the course of the}} year. Boys from Zambia and Malawi were being {{withdrawn}} as a result of the security situation and by 1979, economic sanctions meant that parents were not permitted to transfer money to pay the school fees. Others were finding places in schools closer to Harare. Despite his dedicated efforts to recruit new pupils, the head was in the unenviable <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reduce staff numbers as the school scaled down.|$|E
25|$|The secret {{protocols}} caused Hitler {{to be in}} the humiliating <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, the Volksdeutsche, who {{had lived}} in Finland and the Baltic countries for centuries, while officially condoning the invasions. While the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them. In August, Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them Bukovina. Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety, guarantees for 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.|$|E

25|$|On 3 November Brauchitsch visited Rundstedt's {{headquarters}} at Poltava, where Rundstedt {{told him that}} the armies must halt and dig in for the winter. But Hitler drove his commanders on, insisting on an advance to the Volga and into the North Caucasus, to seize the oilfields at Maikop. These demands put Rundstedt under severe strain. The Germans were more than 300km from Maikop and 500km from the Volga at Stalingrad. On the other hand, they were over 1,000km from their starting point in eastern Poland, and even further from their supply bases in Germany. The Russian winter set in with full force in mid-November. The Germans were short of food, fuel, ammunition, vehicles, spare parts and winter clothing. Partisan activity was growing in their rear areas, threatening their supplies. Rundstedt was now 65 and not in good health – he was a heavy smoker, and in October in Poltava he suffered a mild heart attack. He increasingly resorted to drink to cope with the strain. He was now in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> launch a new offensive against his better judgement, with exhausted troops in very adverse conditions. This was a recipe for defeat, but Rundstedt obeyed Hitler's orders.|$|E

500|$|Elagabalus and {{his entourage}} spent the winter of 218 in Bithynia at Nicomedia, where the emperor's {{religious}} beliefs first presented themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian Cassius Dio suggests that Gannys was in fact killed by the new emperor because he pressured Elagabalus to live [...] "temperately and prudently". To help Romans adjust to having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess Victoria in the Senate House. This placed senators in the awkward <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.|$|E
500|$|In the series' {{first story}} arc, Khan faces off against Mr. Edison / the Inventor, {{an amalgam of}} man and bird.

500|$|Isenhour was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf, and became Wolf's senior campaign adviser during his 2014 campaign, {{at a time when}} state Representative Allyson Schwartz and state Treasurer Rob McCord were considered to have better chances of winning. Isenhour, who had long been acquainted with Wolf, had not intended to become involved with a lengthy and work-intensive gubernatorial campaign, but said she was convinced to do so after an hour-long phone conversation with Wolf in 2013, after which she was convinced he was the right man for the job: [...] "I've been in politics 30 years and I've never had a candidate like this." [...] Isenhour maintained other clients during his campaign, but said Wolf was [...] "my main focus for the next year and a half". After Wolf's successful election, Isenhour co-chaired his inaugural committee, then worked as his Secretary of Legislative Affairs, serving as a liaison during negotiating sessions at the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and providing key planning during the governor's budget strategy. Political reporter John L. Micek wrote of Isenhour: [...] "She is in the unique <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> work with Republicans she once ran campaigns against." [...] Her annual salary in the position was $145,018. Isenhour developed a reputation for communicating and building relationships with legislative leaders and staff members from both parties.|$|E

500|$|As the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, Nansouty {{soon found}} himself in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> take {{provisional}} command of the whole 9th Cavalry Regiment, as he was the most senior chef d'escadron (Lieutenant-Colonel) of the regiment when the commander, Colonel Badda de Bodosalva, fell ill at the end of May 1792. His regiment {{was a part of the}} [...] "Army of the Rhine" [...] and was integrated in General Custine's Corps, which was to march towards the Palatinate, where the first military manoeuvres took place. As Colonel Badda de Bodosalva died at the end of October that year, Nansouty naturally expected to be appointed commander of the regiment in his place. However, Custine appointed the more senior Lieutenant-Colonel Loubat de Bohan as commander of the 9th Cavalry and, despite Nansouty's protestations, maintained his decision. With Loubat in command, the 9th saw action against the Prussians in an engagement at Ober-Flörsheim on 30 March 1793. After a first successful charge, Nansouty's 1st squadron was counter-charged by enemy hussars; the remaining squadrons under Loubat quickly caught up with Nansouty's squadron and together they broke the enemy. Corps commander Custine was then called up to command the Army of the North but, before leaving his command, he attempted a last daunting move against the Habsburg army. This required a night march, not usually undertaken by cavalry, and poorly coordinated manoeuvres of cavalry, infantry and artillery. This led to total failure of the action of 17 May. During this action, though, the initial charge of the corps cavalry, which included the 9th, successfully took a number of enemy guns. However, a Habsburg counter-charge forced them back in disorder, which spread panic among the ranks of oncoming infantry.|$|E

50|$|For a {{structure}} that consists of corner-linked tetrahedra (such as the SiO4 tetrahedra in silica, SiO2) we can count the numbers of constraints and degrees of freedom as follows. For a given tetrahedron, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> any corner <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its three spatial coordinates (x,y,z) match the spatial coordinates of the corresponding corner of a linked tetrahedron. Thus each corner has three constraints. These are shared by the two linked tetrahedra, so contribute 1.5 constraints to each tetrahedron. There are 4 corners, so we <b>have</b> a total <b>of</b> 6 constraints per tetrahedron. A rigid three-dimensional object <b>has</b> 6 degrees <b>of</b> freedom, 3 translations and 3 rotations.

30|$|For drift {{correction}} in super-resolution localization microscopy, the spatial <b>position</b> <b>of</b> fiducial markers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be particularly stable within the gel matrix {{for the whole}} acquisition time. We verified this by tracking the trajectory of single fiducial markers {{with respect to the}} trajectories of the other markers. For that purpose, the distance of a specific fiducial marker to the center of mass of the remaining fiducial markers was calculated. This procedure was repeated for every fiducial marker, and allowed us identifying and removing those that showed an independent movement with respect to the other fiducial markers. In a representative experiment with 33 fiducial markers, we found two which matched these criteria and removed them from further analysis (Additional file 3 : Figure S 3).|$|R
