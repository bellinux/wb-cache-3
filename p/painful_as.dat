5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E

25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural process that will occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about as <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external fixator.|$|E

500|$|The three-act play {{examines}} the failures, successes, and relationships of six black steel mill workers in Chicago as they transition from blue-collar {{jobs to the}} white-collar professions. The time is 1973, 1978, and 1983, and the scene is a Chicago basement apartment where the characters meet to socialize over cards and drinks. Racial themes relating to the disparity of life at the steel mill are presented, and dreams about possibilities represented by the upscale Pill Hill neighborhood in Chicago are examined. [...] The conflicts are <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> the characters deal with leaving the comfortable life of the mill {{to embark on a}} road of uncertainty while pursuing professional aspirations.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley and {{her husband}} Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four {{children}} died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley [...] "a country which memory painted as paradise", as she put it. The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine [...] and Midas. Mary Shelley {{had always wanted to}} return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. The return was <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{complained that}} Conan copied many ideas from God of War. [...] Game Informer {{referred}} to this imitation as [...] " [...] groveling at Kratos' feet, begging for gameplay wisdom". [...] A few reviewers, however, found this forgivable and stated that the game was made to be fun without any higher ambitions. [...] Conans camera system irritated several critics for failing to provide an adequate view of the situation at certain critical moments. [...] Its puzzles were oversimple and lacked clear directions for proceeding to the next step. [...] The artificial intelligence for the adversaries in the game {{was found to be}} predictable and flawed by a few critics. [...] In addition, they found the final encounter with Graven to be overlong and frustrating. [...] Calling the fight [...] "as <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> a trip to the proctologist", IGN and Game Informer judged it {{to be one of the}} worst boss fights in video game history.|$|E

[...] Each member of the band plays a character working in the salon, pampering and making-up a variety of men.

It is a broken toy, a burst soap bubble popped by careless kids, unaware that they are damaging themselves, their health and their childhood dreams as well...It's all the more <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> we had almost begun to believe in the Tour again... in these soap-and-water cyclists who we were so ready to love.

2500|$|In August 1919, {{at the age}} of nine, Capp was {{run down}} by a [...] trolley car and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee. According to his father Otto's {{unpublished}} autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed. He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> he grew older. The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp’s cynical worldview, which, funny as it was, was certainly darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist. [...] "I was indignant as hell about that leg," [...] he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in Time magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Suspension, {{like the}} short drop, causes death {{by using the}} weight of the body to tighten the noose around the trachea and neck structure. Prisoners are {{reported}} to have little or no struggle before they go limp because their jugular vein and carotid arteries are blocked and blood flow to the brain is reduced. The person slowly dies of strangulation, which typically takes between ten and twenty minutes, resulting in a considerably more elongated and painful death as compared to the standard or long drop hanging. [...] "If the airway is constricted, and full suspension achieved (feet fully off the floor), this method, at least initially, is likely to be very <b>painful,</b> <b>as</b> the person struggles for air against the compression of the noose and against {{the weight of the}}ir own body, being supported entirely by the neck and jaw." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time since {{becoming}} eligible to play for England, Hick was omitted from the winter tour parties altogether, an omission particularly <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> the programme was to include not only a return to New Zealand but the first ever Tests between Zimbabwe and England. In the event Hick did play in the country, but only as part of Worcestershire's own tour; he took six wickets in their match against a Matabeleland Invitation XI in what must have been a bittersweet experience. The 1997 English season was the first for seven years in which Hick had no international duties to perform, and he averaged 69 in scoring over 1,500 first-class runs, the highlight being an unbeaten 303 in the final match of the season against Hampshire, sharing in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 438 with Tom Moody, an English record for that wicket ...|$|E

2500|$|On 21 November, having {{allowed herself}} {{six weeks to}} recover from her illness, Wellington set a new world record for an Ironman-branded race over the full Ironman {{distance}} in Tempe, Arizona of 8:36:13. Her time was the third-fastest female ironman-distance time to date, beaten only by her two records in Roth. Despite riding the last two miles of the bike course on a flat tyre, she beat the previous course record by 35minutes, and runner-up Linsey Corbin's time by 29minutes. Her marathon time was only 4:44 slower than the fastest men's run, and her swim time only 32seconds slower than the men's winner, Timo Bracht. Commentator Timothy Carlson quoted Wellington's boyfriend as saying, [...] "It's {{a sign of a}} true champion that she can pick herself up after something as <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> her withdrawal at Hawaii. Six weeks later, all the issues from Hawaii were behind her, and today she was phenomenal", to which Carlson added, [...] "Phenomenal might have been an understatement." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 1975, {{the shah}} {{dissolved}} the Iran Novin Party and its opposition elements {{in creating a}} single party system headed by the Rastakhiz (Resurgence/Resurrection) Party. In relation to Hoveyda, {{it is believed that}} the shah was being threatened by the growing influence wielded by party officials, Hoveyda being the most notable. The growth of an independent apparatus was contrary to the Shah's contrivance involving the consolidation of all power. Hoveyda's inability to garner any type of power base in government allowed him to concentrate much of his energy on developing the Iran Novin Party. The networks he had slowly developed over the years came to trouble the monarch. Although Hoveyda would be coerced into relinquishing his position as PM, he accepted a temporary intermediary role as secretary general of Rastakhiz before a new Prime Minister can be appointed. Nevertheless, the Shah still saw Hovedya as a trusted (if not pliable) figure, and he was appointed to be minister of court. In her memoirs, Queen Farah wrote that asking Hoveyda to leave the post of prime minister was as <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> [...] "giving birth to a baby".|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of the}} series' {{trademark}} humor {{received a}} mixed response. In one regard, some critics such as Team Xbox praised the voice work of Jon St. John, who did an [...] "excellent job as always with Duke's persona", whilst others such as Machinima.com appreciated the comedic gameplay tips and pop culture references; however, the same critic also noted that [...] "parts of the narrative and dialogue show clear evidence of the game's elongated development. Many pop culture references refer to media in the early 2000s, with one-liners co-opted from 'guy' movies like Old School, Highlander, and Commando, which in itself could cause blank stares {{from most of the}} current potential audience." [...] Australian gaming website PALGN felt the game was [...] "saved only by its humor and nostalgic value." [...] Official Xbox Magazine UK thought that the humor [...] "isn't so much offensive or misogynistic as just suffering from an adolescent fixation with boobs and crowbarred-in innuendo." [...] Joystiq noted that the game's multiplayer mode [...] "Capture the Babe", involving [...] "spanking a woman into submission", [...] "really is as <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> it sounds". Many critics conversely criticized the characterization of Duke Nukem, declaring his decidedly one-dimensional personality juvenile and outdated in comparison to more recent video game heroes.|$|E
