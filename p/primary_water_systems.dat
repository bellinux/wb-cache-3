40|$|AbstractDissimilar metal {{welded joints}} {{are used in}} <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> of {{pressurized}} water reactor in nuclear power plant. They are mainly used to connect the ferritic steel pipe-nozzles of the pressure vessels such as reactor pressure vessels, steam generators and pressurizers with the austenitic stainless steel safe end. Thus, maintaining integrity of such joints is critical to ensure their safe service. As local wall thinning may probably appear at safe end to due to erosion and corrosion, assessment methods with local wall thinning are urgently needed. In this paper, three-dimensional finite element analysis models with and without considering local wall thinning were built for dissimilar metal welded joints connected the safe end to pipe-nozzle of the reactor pressure vessel. A detailed analysis {{has been carried out}} to the limit load research of this structure. Results show that the bending load is the main factor influencing the stress distribution change and limit load. According to finite element results, the depth of local wall thinning should be the most important factor influencing limit load solution, while circumferential local wall thinning shows very small variation. Based on the finite element results prediction equations of limit loads for safe end with local wall thinning have been proposed...|$|E

In addition to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the 105 -KE Basin, extensive quantities of debris and a substantial amount of sludge have accumulated in the basin. The 105 -KE Basin fuel and sludge are not encapsulated and, as a result, corroding fuel has produced contamination products that are deposited on the basin walls, floor, and equipment. contamination products produce radiation dose exposures to the workers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{majority}} of the Dutch population is living on land reclaimed from the sea, below the high water levels of the sea, large rivers and lakes. Seventy {{percent of the gross}} national product is earned in these vulnerable areas. Therefore, the safety of the <b>water</b> defense <b>systems</b> (WDS) is of paramount importance to sustain Dutch society. Failure can have catastrophic humanitarian and socio-economic consequences. The <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> defense <b>systems</b> form a protection against flooding from the sea, the main rivers, and the large lakes, for which failure would have dramatic consequences. Monitoring the status of WDS is particularly difficult, partly because of their large extent: 17000 km in the Netherlands. Inspection methods rely largely on expert observers, who perform yearly manual (visual) inspections, a method that has been unchanged since the centuries. Consequently, such observations are infrequent, subjective and qualitative. Here we show that satellite radar interferometry, using a new methodology derived from earlier results on persistent scatterer interferometry, is able to detect more than 90 % of the <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> barriers around the main open waters of the Netherlands; the Waddenzee and the IJsselmeer.

Methods: The study was conducted in south-eastern Slovenia between October 2003 and October 2004, thereby eliminating the influence of the seasons. Four-hundred-and-sixty-eight samples of drinking water were included in the study. Results: The results of the samples included in this study suggest (p < 0. 05) that the first flush samples do not contain Escherichia coli more often than the samples after flushing and the sample from the <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> distribution <b>system.</b> The results also show that the heterotrophic plate count is significantly higher in the first flush samples (p < 0. 001).

Beginning in the 1930 `s, the Columbia River has been significantly modified by construction of 30 major dams on the river {{and its tributaries}}, along with dozens of non-Federal projects. Construction and subsequent operation of these water development projects have contributed to eight primary uses of the river system, including navigation, flood control, irrigation, electric power generation, fish migration, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and water supply and quality considerations. Increasing stress on the water development of the Columbia River and its tributaries has led primary Federal agencies to undertake intensive analysis and evaluation of the operation of these projects. These agencies are the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, who operate the large Federal dams on the river, and the Bonneville Power Administration who sells the power generated at the dams.

50|$|About halfway {{along its}} course the Old River passes by the Clifton Court Forebay, where water is pumped from the Delta to support California's two <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> supply <b>systems,</b> the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. Because both {{projects}} derive their sources from the Sacramento River further north, pumping {{results in a}} reverse flow in the Old River as water flowing through the Delta Cross Channel is drawn southward through the Delta and up the Old River. (Naturally, the Old River would have flowed in a northerly direction). During dry summers, this often results in saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay. The reverse flow also confuses migrating salmon in the San Joaquin River which {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the species in the 20th century. Since the 1960s, the California Department of Water Resources has maintained temporary barrier dams to control the flow of <b>water,</b> a <b>system</b> which has improved water quality and circulation.

40|$|VEGGIE is a {{plant growth}} {{facility}} that utilizes {{the phenomenon of}} capillary action as its <b>primary</b> <b>watering</b> <b>system.</b> A cloth made of Meta Aramid fiber, known as Nomex is used to wick water up from a reservoir {{to the bottom of}} the plants roots. This root mat system is intended to be low maintenance with no moving parts and requires minimal crew interface time. Unfortunately, the water wicking rates are inconsistent throughout the plant life cycle, thus causing plants to die. Over-wicking of water occurs toward the beginning of the cycle, while under-wicking occurs toward the middle. This inconsistency of wicking has become a major issue, drastically inhibiting plant growth. The primary objective is to determine the root cause of the inconsistent wicking through experimental testing. Suspect causes for the capillary water column to break include: a vacuum effect due to a negative pressure gradient in the water reservoir, contamination of material due to minerals in water and back wash from plant fertilizer, induced air bubbles while using syringe refill method, and material limitations of Nomex's ability to absorb and retain water. Experimental testing will be conducted to systematically determine the cause of under and over-wicking. Pressure gages will be used to determine pressure drop during the course of the plant life cycle and during the water refill process. A debubbler device will be connected to a root mat in order to equalize pressure inside the reservoir. Moisture and evaporation tests will simultaneously be implemented to observe moisture content and wicking rates over the course of a plant cycle. Water retention tests will be performed using strips of Nomex to determine materials wicking rates, porosity, and absorptivity. Through these experimental tests, we will have a better understanding of material properties of Nomex, as well as determine the root cause of water column breakage. With consistent test results, a forward plan can be achieved to resolve the issue and give valuable insight for the next generation of VEGGIE...|$|R

40|$|Advisor: Charisse BuisingSeveral {{different}} carbon-based {{materials are}} contenders {{for use as}} an absorbent {{in the first stage}} of the Lightweight Contingency <b>Water</b> Recovery <b>System</b> (LWC-WRS). Granular activated carbon has been proven as an effective adsorbent, and is commonly used in water filtration. However, studies have shown that carbon molecular sieve membranes outperform the activated carbon in adsorption capacity and efficiency. The adsorption capability of the carbon molecular sieve was examined to determine its ability to remove contaminants, primarily urea and ammonia, from wastewater through the LWCWRS. In addition, the endurance of both the activated carbon and the molecular sieve was tested to determine the volume of fluid that can be filtered through each matrix before adsorbent saturation. Preliminary data from column and batch tests run over a period between 4 to 12 hours showed the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal capability of the molecular sieve to be twenty times that of the activated carbon, with over 99 % removal. After 11 hours and 1 L of urine processed, the molecular sieve continued to remove over 97 % of the TOC in the initial urine volume. However, in line with its performance, the molecular sieve is ten times more expensive per kilogram, than the activated carbon.

To meet this objective, the AES LSS Project is developing technologies to recover water from wastewater brine; highly concentrated waste products generated from a <b>primary</b> <b>water</b> recovery <b>system.</b> The state of the art system used aboard the International Space Station (ISS) has the potential to recover up to 85 % water from unine wastewater, leaving a significant amounts of water in the waste brine, the recovery of which is a critical technology gap that must be filled in order to enable long duration human exploration. Recovering water from the urine wastewater brine is complicated by the concentration of solids as water is removed from the brine, and the concentration of the corrosive, toxic chemicals used to stabilize the urine which fouls and degrades water processing hardware, and poses a hazard to operators and crew. Brine Residual in Containment (BRIC) is focused on solids management through a process of "in-place" drying - the drying of brines within the container used for final disposal. Application of in-place drying has the potential to improve the safety and reliability of the system by reducing the exposure to crew and hardware to the problematic brine residual.
