40|$|In recent time piled {{foundations}} are extensively applied {{due to an}} increase of storeys in buildings constructed in Minsk and load increment on the soil. Preference is given to this approach even in the case when relatively firm soil occurs in the top part of the foundation bed. In this case maximum usage of the foundation bed bearing capacity and reduction of foundation cost are considered as top-priority tasks for designers. One {{of the ways to}} increase the bearing capacity of {{piled foundations}} is the necessity to take into account resistance of foundation bed soil located under raft bottom. The raft as well as a shallow foundation is capable to transfer a significant part of building load into the soil. Such approach makes it possible to reduce a number of piles in the foundation or shorten their length. Then it results in shortening of the construction period and significant reduction in zero cycle. However up to the present moment reliable calculation methods that permit to take into account soil resistance in the raft base. An analysis of previous investigations on the matter executed by various researchers and a number of field investigations have been carried out with the purpose to develop the proposed methods. The paper presents results of field investigations on foundations consisting of short stamped tapered piles which are joined together {{with the help of the}} raft fragment. Strength and deformation characteristics of the bases are increasing while making such foundations in the fill-up soil. In this case the filled-up ground layer becomes a bearing layer both for piles and rafts as well. Improvement of high-plastic clay-bearing soil properties is ensured by ramming dry concrete mix under <b>pile</b> <b>foot.</b> The paper describes an experience on application of the piled-raft foundation in complicated engineering and geological conditions while constructing the Orthodox Church in Minsk. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{technology}} of stabilization of loose soils through the employment of silt-cement piles, or the so-called deep soil stabilization technology. It is applicable to various types of loose soils, including clay, sapropel, silt and peat. However, geotechnical and chemical properties of soils surely affect the stabilization efficiency and the choice for the stabilization material. The authors provide {{a brief overview of}} the soil stabilization technology employing silt-cement piles and based on the principle of dry mixing of water-saturated natural soil with cement. Thus, dry powder enters into the chemical reaction with the stream of water to reduce the content of water in the soil. The research into the bearing capacity of siltcement piles and the stabilized territory of moorings was performed in the Temryuk port. The co-objective of the research was to identify the operating conditions of cargo moorings in the Temryuk port constructed on loose soils. All conclusions were based on the field data, seismometric and laboratory tests. The analysis of and research into the operating conditions of moorings demonstrate the efficiency of the long-term operation of berthing facilities constructed on the soils stabilized by silt-cement piles. This methodology can be used to stabilize port territories, road beds of railways and highways constructed on loose soils. The authors also elaborate on the potential upgrade of categories of cargo moorings constructed on loose soils and stabilized by silt-cement piles. Calculation results and researches demonstrate that it is quite difficult to significantly upgrade loading categories in respect of open warehouse spaces, as silt-cement piles of the pre-set diameter cannot provide for the bearing capacity corresponding to the first category loading. The solution may consist in the change of the stabilization design with account for the thixotropic properties of clay soils. Structural solutions may consist in the selection of the <b>pile</b> <b>foot</b> designs that may stabilize loose clay soils, on the one hand, and meet the loading requirements, on the other hand.

40|$|Although {{the design}} concept {{based on the}} idea of {{limiting}} the settlement of footings by settlement-reducing piles is gaining more and more support, there have been very few experimental studies of the behaviour of piled footings in non-cohesive soil. The influences of the contact between the pile cap and the soil on the capacity and the load-settlement behaviour of a <b>piled</b> <b>footing</b> are considerable but this has not been well understood. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the overall interaction between the piles, the cap, and the soil in piled footings with friction piles in non-cohesive soil. The major part of the study consists of three extensive series of large-scale field model tests on single piles, free-standing pile groups, shallow footings and piled footings. The field tests were carried out in loose to dense sand, and with pile spacings of four, six and eight times the pile width. By performing the field model tests, the Author has tried to create a better understanding of the load-transfer mechanism and of the load-settlement behaviour of a <b>piled</b> <b>footing</b> in non-cohesive soil. The most important factors influencing the behaviour of piled footings have been investigated. The study shows that in cap-pile interaction, the increase in the pile shaft resistance is most important and more pronounced than the increase in the pile base resistance and the change in the cap capacity. It is also found that the load-settlement behaviour of the cap in a <b>piled</b> <b>footing</b> is very similar to that of a shallow footing with the same geometry under equal soil conditions. This remark is used as the basis for the proposed simplified methods of predicting settlement of a friction <b>piled</b> <b>footing</b> in non-cohesive soil. The results calculated using the proposed methods are in good agreement with the measured values. The reduction in settlement of a <b>piled</b> <b>footing,</b> in relation to a corresponding shallow footing, depends clearly on the relative cap capacity. With a high value of the relative cap capacity, i. e. when the capacity of the cap is predominant over that of the piles, the contribution of the piles has a clear effect in reducing the settlement of the footing...|$|R

40|$|High {{numbers of}} deep {{depressions}} are found specifically within {{the immediate area}} of man);' main cities across the UK and are increasingly becoming the target of major reclamation schemes. Clayey fills are Jenerally placed and compacted in an unsaturated state to facilitate ease of placement and are commonly misconstrued to possess desirable features. However if the fill was to become saturated, the volumetric response whether swelling or collapse compression can induce excessive displacements within the soil. Such soil behaviour can potentially have a detrimental effect on suspended piled foundations. The present study carried out a physical small scale model of a single <b>piled</b> <b>footing</b> supported on a compacted clay bed, under a constant axial load and subjected to wetting. The project focused {{on the development of}} a novel chamber capable of testing large cylindrical un-engineered and engineered clay samples under suction controlled conditions and confining pressure. Element tests indicated that in both samples simultaneous axial yelling and lateral collapse occurred during wetting. LC yield loci were therefore considered separately in the axial and radial plane. An instrumented pile model was implemented into the main testing programme and its performance (relating to various methods of pile installation) was evaluated on the basis of axial load distribution and settlement determined from local strain instrumentation. Under wetting conditions a differing profile of axial displacement occurred within various clay bed zones causing variable development of skin friction along the pile shaft, resulting in pile uplift and excessive settlement throughout the period of wetting. Lateral swelling and collapsing was postulated to control intermittent load share at the pile-soil interface thus influencing the degree of axial displacement observed in clay bed. Pile performance is shown as dependent upon the magnitude of the foundation load, degree of initial adhesion, and compactive effort of the clay bed.
