2500|$|The Royal Aircraft Factory {{conducted}} spinning {{tests on}} the type, concluding that the R.E.8 was quite hard to spin and recovered easily; but the fin was redesigned with slightly increased area to improve spin recovery. [...] The modification resulted in the production version being no less stable than the B.E.2e; and while this was an advantage for artillery observation and photography it gave the R.E.8 little chance to out-manoeuvre enemy fighters. A larger fin was fitted to some R.E.8s used as trainers. Some pilots flew the R.E.8 with an empty reserve fuel tank (or even filled the <b>tank</b> with <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher</b> fluid) to avoid a perceived tendency of R.E.8s to burn on crashing. None of these measures {{would have made the}} aircraft any [...] "safer", if the problem was one of poor stalling characteristics. Several pilots who flew the type mentioned that they had no problems but were careful to keep the airspeed well above stalling point.|$|R

The only real difference between the medic engine and the standard engine is that the medic engines are capable of advanced life support with a firefighter also being a fully trained ALS paramedic.|$|R
