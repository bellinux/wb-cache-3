40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} of pinned cold-formed plain channel columns of different width-to-thickness ratios {{is presented in}} this paper. The study is focused not only on axially loaded columns, but also on eccentrically loaded columns. The general purpose finite element software ABAQUS 6. 12 was used, and the force controlled loading was adopted. Geometric and material nonlinearities were incorporated in the finite element model. The ultimate loads are compared with the direct strength method (DSM) for axially loaded columns. Also, a parametric study is done by varying {{the length of the}} column and width of the unstiffened element. It is observed that the results correlate better with the DSM values for columns having unstiffened elements of lower bf/t ratios. The change in ultimate load is studied only in ABAQUS, as the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> moves towards the free edge and the supported edge of the unstiffened element. A parametric study is done by varying the nonuniform compression factor for the columns.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} are reported for compression of an aluminum cylinder with monotonic and cyclic die rotation. When the die is monotonically rotated, a higher angular velocity or a lower compression speed of the tool leads to a greater load reduction in comparison of that seen with a stationary die. The test results also show that cyclic die rotation causes a cyclic fluctuation in the load-displacement curve. During the die deceleration phase, the compression load increases until it reaches the level obtained in conventional compression with stationary dies. However, the compression load is observed to reduce to levels lower than those obtained in monotonic rotating compression tests during the die acceleration phase.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of suspended cable structures is initial shape change under the action of non uniform load. The problem can be solved by increasing of weight of construction or by using of prestressing. But this methods cause increasing of materials consumption and make difficult usage of modern materials with increased specific strength. The cable truss usage is another way how the problem of shape change under the action of non uniform load can be fixed. The cable trusses with the vertical and inclined suspensions, cross web and single cable were analyzed as the main load-bearing structures of suspension bridge. The suspension bridge was checked under the action of a different variants of non uniform loading in longitudinal and transversal directions. It was shown, that usage of cable truss as the main load-bearing structures of suspension bridge allows reducing the vertical displacements up to 32 % {{in comparison with the}} single cable in case when the traffic load is applied to the half of suspension bridge span and the relation of traffic load and permanent load is equal to 1. 4.

This paper reports {{an attempt to}} simulate the damage process in the lab and Package Collapse Loads measured for this load case. Packages were compressed by a concentrated load. The <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> application was varied along a line parallel to a crease and the package was rotated {{in order to test}} the influence of the height of the load carrying panel. Force and displacement were recorded and the damage evolution during the test was studied. The damage produced was examined using x-ray tomography. The nature of damage at different stages of damage evolution was studied. Both the visual appearance of the damage and the force-displacement curve were similar in all tests. The Package Collapse Load has little dependence on where along a line parallel to a crease of the package the point load is applied. Damage started developing at the crease and a yield line perpendicular to the crease and parallel to the direction of the load developed. When the displacement increased further, a parabolic yield line, symmetric around the previous one, developed. The start of the damage development was associated with at peak in the force-displacement curve. Stiffness was more geometry dependent than strength. On macro scale, the visual appearance of the damage due to concentrated loads shows no significant dependence on geometry...|$|E
40|$|Thesis purpose - {{investigate}} the load size and position of seams puckering. The main tasks: to {{investigate the}} influence {{of the size of the}} load on the seam puckering, to analyze {{the influence of the}} <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> on the seam puckering, to analyze the influence of mechanical properties of seam puckering parameters, the seam pucker was evaluated after sewing immediately, then after 24 h. Seam puckering is the subject of many scientific studies, but evaluation of seam puckering parameters dependence on the load is not. The samples of two fabrics were used: 100 % silk and 100 % viscose. Samples came to different ends of load weight: 50 g, 100 g, 200 g, 300 g. For some samples the load was fixed in front, for others in the back, and in yet others, on both ends of the sample. The samples are made at two different speeds and were monitored sewed, with seam puckering immediately and after 24 h. Investigating how loading influenced the number of pucker, pucker height and length, pucker sharpness and coefficient. It was found that the load has a significant impact on the seam puckering. Seam puckering decreases at higher loads and under the load on both ends of the sample. Samples sewn at higher speeds had puckering increased by more than 50 %. In addition the length of the samples was measured immediately after sewing, after 24 hours, and after drying. It was observed that the length of a specimen was decreasing with a decreasing load, and after 24 hours, and after drying the length of the sample is reduced even further...|$|E
