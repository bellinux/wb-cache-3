40|$|A chronic illness, such as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), has {{an impact}} on the whole family, {{especially}} on parents caring for the ill child. Therefore the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate parental Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and parental perceptions of child vulnerability (PPCV) and associated variables in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with JIA. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> all JIA patients (0 - 18 years) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, were eligible. HRQOL was measured using the TNO-AZL Questionnaire (TAAQOL) and PPCV using the Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS). The HRQOL <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with JIA was compared to a norm population, and differences between <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with JIA and active arthritis versus <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with JIA without active arthritis were analyzed (ANOVA). For PPCV, <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with JIA were compared to a norm population, including healthy and chronically ill children (Chi(2), Mann-Whitney U test). Variables associated with PPCV were identified by logistic regression analyses. 155 parents (87. 5 % mothers) completed online questionnaires. JIA parents showed worse HRQOL than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children on one out of twelve domains: fine motor HRQOL (p[*] <[*]. 001). <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with active arthritis showed worse HRQOL regarding daily activities (p[*] <[*]. 05), cognitive functioning (p[*] <[*]. 01) and depressive emotions (p[*] <[*]. 05) compared to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children without active arthritis. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with JIA perceived their child as more vulnerable than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy child (p[*] <[*]. 001) and <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chronically ill child (p[*] <[*]. 001). <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with active arthritis reported higher levels of PPCV (p[*] <[*]. 05) than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children without active arthritis. <b>A</b> higher degree <b>of</b> functional disability (p[*] <[*]. 01) and shorter disease duration (p[*] <[*]. 05) were associated with higher levels of PPCV. The HRQOL <b>of</b> JIA <b>parents</b> was comparable to the HRQOL <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy child.

40|$|Background: Coping in {{parents with}} a higher stress level has been a {{neglected}} research topic so far. Method. Multivariate analyses of variance are computed to compare stress and coping between three groups <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> (N = 150) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 6 - to 14 -year-old child (43 couples <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normally developed child, 53 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with Down syndrome and 54 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with externalizing behavior problems). Results: <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with Down syndrome reported more family related stress and stress with regard to social isolation, but reported also the highest scores <b>of</b> dyadic coping. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child with externalizing behavior problems perceived more parenting stress, psychological distress and <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> dyadic coping. Conclusion: Dyadic coping reveals {{to be an important}} issue in parent's coping with daily hassles...|$|R

500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were the <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no way they could have known how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E

However, Wise felt that the end result was [...] "beautiful", and that it left him and his character [...] "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.|$|E

500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E
