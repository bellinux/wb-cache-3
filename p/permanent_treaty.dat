25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 prompted {{a number of}} reforms in the eurozone. One was a u-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy {{that led to the}} creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a <b>permanent</b> <b>treaty</b> basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.|$|E

Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than <b>permanent</b> <b>treaties,</b> with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the central government was granted substantially more power than before; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti-federalists that there would be some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government, providing a check on the power of the federal government.|$|R

Krig og terrorisme har preget denne regionen mer enn noe annetog dette har ført til enorme lidelser på begge sider av konflikten. Til tross for dette bledet satt i gang hemmelige fredsforhandlinger mellom PLO og Israel høsten 1992. Forhandlingene førte frem til en fredsavtale og til etableringen av en palestinskselvstyremyndighet på Vestbredden. I 1994 kunne Yasser Arafat, formann i PLO, etter 46 år i landflyktighet igjen sette fot på palestinsk jord. Til tross for en tilsynelatendegod vilje fra begge partene sin side, har 8 år med selvstyre for palestinerne ikke førtdem nærmere en løsning på konflikten med Israel.

Once Israel was admitted to the UN, it retreated from the protocol it had signed, because it was completely satisfied with the status quo, and saw no need to make any concessions with regard to the refugees or on boundary questions.
