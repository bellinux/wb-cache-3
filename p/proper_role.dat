Tohei left {{as a result of a}} disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> of ki development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization that governs it, the Ki Society (Ki no Kenkyūkai).|$|E
5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E

First, we show that the major recent efforts to delineate appropriate roles for values in science would be strengthened by making clearer distinctions among cognitive attitudes.

The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E

25|$|Opponents of the FMA {{argue that}} it would violate the states' rights to {{regulate}} marriage by federalizing the issue, which they say {{should be left to}} the states.

25|$|In poetry, {{the early}} 18th century was {{an age of}} satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the {{developing}} novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, the pathetic she-tragedy of {{the turn of the}} 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and {{what it meant to be}} gentry: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> of those who serve.|$|E

25|$|A keen {{controversy}} {{arose in}} France and England {{as to the}} merits of the two astronomers. There was much criticism of Airy in England. Adams was a diffident young man who was naturally reluctant to publish a result that would establish or ruin his career. Airy and Challis were criticised, particularly by James Glaisher, as failing to exercise their <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> as mentors of a young talent. Challis was contrite but Airy defended his own behaviour, claiming that the search for a planet was not the role of the Greenwich Observatory. On the whole, Airy has been defended by his biographers. In France the claims made for an unknown Englishman were resented as detracting from the credit due to Le Verrier's achievement.|$|E

25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
25|$|The {{dismissal}} fell {{heavily on}} the still vibrant, energetic Konstantin, leaving him adrift without any <b>proper</b> <b>role.</b> He was an enthusiastic chess player and his chess problems were published in international journals, {{but that was not}} a substitute for the position he once had at the center of affairs. He spent increasingly more time with his second family, further humiliating his legitimate wife. With nothing left to do, Konstantin retired to Pavlovsk, spending most of his time abroad or on his Crimean estate of Oreanda. In August 1881 a fire completely destroyed Oreanda. The palace was never rebuilt and Konstantin lived from then on in a wooden pavilion. Tragedy struck him again while living there. In April 1885, his two surviving illegitimate sons died days apart of scarlet fever. Of the five children Constantin had had with Kousnetzova, only the two daughters, Marina and Anna, thrived; Konstantin showered them with affection. He was also particularly close to his eldest daughter Olga whom he visited in Greece in 1883. His grandson Prince Christopher of Greece remembered him for his sharp and loud voice, which Konstantin enjoyed using, usually for new servants and preferably in the presence of guests. Without any reason he would glare at the new servant and then scream the servant's name. Some were used to the trick and remained calm, while others dropped the dishes in terror, which amused him.|$|E

500|$|Ancient Egyptian temples {{were meant}} as places for the gods to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} temple building, ḥwt-nṯr, means [...] "mansion (or enclosure) of a god". A god's presence in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> in nature. They were therefore {{a key part of the}} maintenance of maat, the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.

McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a clear separation between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over the <b>proper</b> <b>roles</b> of civilian and military leaders.|$|R

Here we consider examples of the arguments and counter- arguments that have shaped this discussion. We suggest that much of the controversy hinges on several misunderstandings, including unwarranted fears of a general attempt at overthrowing the Modern Synthesis paradigm, and some fundamental conceptual confusion about the <b>proper</b> <b>roles</b> of phenotypic plasticity and natural selection within evolutionary theory...|$|R
