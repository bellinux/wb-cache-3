500|$|McIlwraith's {{first issue}} was dated April 1940. [...] She was {{assisted}} by Lamont Buchanan, {{who worked for}} her as associate editor and art editor for both Weird Tales and Short Stories. [...] August Derleth also provided assistance and advice, although he had no formal connection with the magazine. [...] Most of McIlwraith's budget went to Short Stories, since that was the more successful magazine; the <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> for fiction in Weird Tales by 1953 was one cent per word, well below the top rates of other science fiction and fantasy magazines of the day. [...] War shortages also caused problems, and the page count was reduced, first to 112 pages in 1943, and then to 96 pages the following year.|$|E
500|$|The piece-rate {{approach}} to wages {{had been introduced}} in the first Five-Year Plan in 1928 and had changed very little since then. In practice the piece-rate system led to many inefficiencies in Soviet industry. One issue was the vast bureaucracy that was involved in administering wage payments. Each Soviet ministry or government department would set its own rates and wage scales for work in the factories or enterprises {{for which they were}} responsible. Within one ministry there could be great variation in pay rates for jobs requiring largely identical responsibilities and skills, based on what the factory was producing, the location of the factory and other factors that Moscow considered important. Basing payments on these central directives often led to long and costly processes in the calculation of wages. Historian Donald Filtzer wrote of one 1930s machinist who in one month completed 1,424 individual pieces of work. Amongst these had been 484 differing tasks, all of which had been assigned a basic individual <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> of between 3 and 50 kopeks each (1 ruble was equal to 100 kopeks). To calculate this worker's wage, his employer had to process 2,885 documents which had required some 8,500 signatures on [...] of paper, costing the factory 309 rubles, a fifth of what they would pay the worker, whose total earnings for the labour amounted to 1,389 rubles.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Among the 9 states and 35 services examined, GAO found that all states varied Medicaid payments {{for at least some}} services. However, the states differed in the number of services for which they varied payments, in the factors that accounted for variation, and in the magnitude of the variation. Many of the states varied <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> by {{at least one of the}} factors GAO was able to explore in detail: provider type, service setting, and/or patient age. Some states also varied their <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> for other reasons, such as by geographic region or by physician specialty. GAO also found that most of the median Medicaid <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from claims data generally confirmed <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> published in studies of fee schedules conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Urban Institute; however, some of the published fee schedule rates were rarely used in practice. Collectively, GAO's findings demonstrate that Medicaid fee-for-service claims data can be a useful source of information for analyzing provider payments. These data have the potential to provide a more complete representation of provider payment than do fee schedules, as claims data can capture both the distribution and frequency of actual payments to providers. ...|$|R
40|$|Alternatives {{for using}} multivariate {{regression}} to adjust prospective <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> by Steven H.

In this article, the application of regression for adjusting Medicare's prospective rates is discussed, and the implications that differing specifications could have for these adjustments are demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|The {{incentive}} {{payments are}} direct payments made under the National Wool Act (P.L. 83-690, Title VII) to producers of wool and mohair, which {{were similar to}} deficiency payments made to producers of grains and cotton. The incentive <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> was the percentage needed to bring the national average return to producers (the market price plus the incentive payment) up to the annually set national support price. Each producer’s direct payment was the <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> times the market receipts. Producers with higher market receipts got larger support payments.
