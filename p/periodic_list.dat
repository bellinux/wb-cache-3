We propose that nominations to the same level court be collected in <b>periodic</b> <b>lists</b> and voted upon individually with Storable Votes, allowing each senator to allocate freely a fixed number of total votes. Although each nomination is decided by simple majority, storable votes {{make it possible for}} the minority to win occasionally, but only when the relative importance its members assign to a nomination is higher than the relative importance assigned by the majority. Numerical simulations, motivated by a game theoretic model, show that under plausible assumptions a minority of 45 senators would be able to block between 20 and 35 percent of nominees.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} class of {{periodic}} ﬁnite-type (PFT) shift spaces, {{which can be used}} to model time-varying constrained codes used in digital magnetic recording systems. A PFT shift is determined by a ﬁnite list of periodically forbidden words. We show that {{the class of}} PFT shifts properly contains all ﬁnite-type (FT) shifts, and the class of almost ﬁnite-type (AFT) shifts properly contains all PFT shifts. We establish several basic properties of PFT shift spaces of a given period T, and provide a characterization of such a shift in terms of properties of its Shannon cover (i. e., its unique minimal, deterministic, irreducible graph presentation). We present an algorithm that, given the Shannon cover G of an irreducible soﬁc shift X, decides whether or not X is PFT in time that is quadratic in the number of states of G. From any periodic irreducible presentation of a given period, we deﬁne a <b>periodic</b> forbidden <b>list,</b> unique up to conjugacy for that period, that satisﬁes certain minimality properties.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem inhibiting the wide {{acceptance of a}} Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in the Internet {{is the lack of}} a mechanism that provides scalable certificate revocation. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism called Windowed Revocation. In windowed revocation, certificate revocation is announced for short periods in <b>periodic</b> Certificate Revocation <b>Lists</b> (CRLs). Due to the assurances provided by the protocol over which certificates are retrieved, we bound {{the amount of time that}} any certificate is cached by users. Thus, we can limit the announcement of revocation only to the time in which the certificate may be cached; not until its expiration. Because the time in which certificate are announced is short, CRLs are similarly small. By limiting the size of CRLs, we are able to integrate other mechanisms that increase the scalability of the PKI. One such mechanism is the use of "pushed" CRLs using multicast. We include a proof of the correctness of our approach. 1 Introduct [...] ...|$|R

MedShare is ranked as one of the “Best in America” charities by Independent Charities of America. In 2008, they received the Technology Innovation Award from TechBridge for the best use of technology for mission delivery by a nonprofit for our inventory system that enables beneficiaries to select exactly what they need. They were also awarded the 2008 Revolutions Award from the Georgia Center for Nonprofits recognizing the Nonprofit of the Year. In 2010, the Atlanta Business Chronicle named them the Green Giving Champion at the Environmental Business Awards. In 2010, MedShare's Western Region earned their Green Business Certification from Bay Area Green Business Program and was the Bay Area Excellence in Volunteer Management Award Winner. They've also been named a 2010 and 2011 Waste Reduction Awards, Program (WRAP) winner by the State of California’s Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery CalRecycle.

40|$|Allison Erhardt is an Electronic Resources Access Specialist at the University of Manitoba Libraries in the Electronic Resources Department. Responsibilities include keeping SFX up {{and running}} for the Library System and {{maintaining}} access to the electronic journal collection for all patrons of the University of Manitoba Libraries. Graduated in 2001 with a Library and Information Technology degree from Red River College in Winnipeg. Evelyn Bruneau works as an Electronic Resources Access Specialist in the Electronic Resources Unit at the University of Manitoba and has a degree in Human Ecology. Evelyn joined the University of Manitoba in 1994 and {{has been working with}} electronic resources since 1998. Evelyn is responsible for providing access to the Libraries over 17, 000 electronic resources, including ordering, payment, activation, renewal, cataloguing, and statistics gathering. She serves as primary Administrative and Technical contact person as well as Systems Administrator for the Libraries’ linking programme, UM Links (SFX). As the University of Manitoba Libraries (UML) collection of electronic journals rapidly increased it became evident that we needed a way to distribute Document Delivery license restrictions to designated library staff. Initially this done by providing Document Delivery staff with <b>periodic</b> spreadsheets <b>listing</b> individual publishers and the applicable license terms. In November 2003, UML implemented SFX. As expected, use of electronic journals increased rapidly, and had an immediate impact on many library units and departments, including Document Delivery. In the absence of a commercial ERM, the Electronic Resources Unit at UML developed a system for distributing the status of Document Delivery rights to designated library staff on a title by title basis using SFX. Using this application, designated staff are now able to enter Document Delivery requests into the SFX Citation Linker and find the current license terms and conditions for Document Delivery, in addition to links to the full text (or print copy) of the citation. We would like to present to the conference attendees the procedures that we developed for setting up customized targets within the linking software, our categorization of licensing language, procedures for making sure that only the Document Delivery Staff can see these rights, how the system works, and the improvements we made to our Linking Software while setting up the system, for example, a new way to search PubMed ID (PMID) numbers from the Citation Linker. Attendees will learn how to use their institutions Link Resolver to implement a Document Delivery Rights Project...|$|R
40|$|Medical Devices’ include {{everything}} from highly sophisticated, computerized, medical equipment, {{right down to}} simple wooden tongue depressors. Regulations embody the public expectations for how buildings and facilities are expected to perform and as such represent public policy. Regulators, who develop and enforce regulations, are empowered {{to act in the}} public’s interest to set this policy and are ultimately responsible to the public in this regard. Standardization contributes to the basic infrastructure that underpins society including health and environment, while promoting sustainability and good regulatory practice. The international organizations that produce International Standards are the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). With the increasing globalization of markets, International Standards (as opposed to regional or national standards) have become critical to the trading process, ensuring a level playing field for exports, and ensuring that imports meet the internationally recognized levels of performance and safety. The development of standards is done in response to sectors and stakeholders that express a clearly established need for them. An industry sector or other stakeholder group typically communicates its requirement for standards to one of the national members. To be accepted for development, a proposed work item must receive a majority support of the participating members, who verify the global relevance of the proposed item. The regulatory authority (RA) should provide a method for the recognition of international voluntary standards and for public notification of such recognition. The process of recognition may vary from country to country. Recognition may occur by <b>periodic</b> publication of <b>lists</b> of standards that a regulatory authority has found will meet the Essential Principles. In conclusion, International standards, such as, basic standards, group standards, and product standards, are a tool for harmonizing regulatory processes, to assure the safety, quality, and performance of medical devices. Standards represent the opinion of experts from all interested parties, including industry, regulators, users, and others...|$|R
