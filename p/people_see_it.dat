There are multiple activists {{that are trying}} to make the Swedish government recognise Jamtish as a minority language just as Yiddish or Sami have become one. The claimers say to look at the different words and pronunciations of them. Whether or not it is its own language has been widely debated since the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|In {{discussing}} his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic. [...] In a 1967 interview, he explained [...] "Most ballads come across in different ways. [...] Sometimes you {{see things in}} different ways than other <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> [...] So then you write it in a song. [...] It could represent anything". [...] In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs [...] "I Don't Live Today", [...] "May This Be Love", and [...] "Little Wing". [...] He described [...] "Little Wing" [...] as being [...] "based on a very, very simple Indian style", perhaps referring to some Native American mythologies in which spirits inhabit nature and animals, including birds. [...] In one interview, he saw it as self-explanatory: [...] "That's exactly what it's about, like 'She's walking through the clouds'", ...|$|E
500|$|Watership Downs {{universal}} motifs {{of liberation}} and self-determination {{have led to}} the tendency of minority groups to read their own narrative into the novel, despite the author's assurance (in 2005) that it [...] "was never intended to become some sort of allegory or parable." [...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book...some <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. [...] Watership Down can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres." [...] Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and Watership Down for its [...] "motifs [...] hit home in every culture...all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype." ...|$|E

[...] "A {{lot of it is}} about asking questions or questioning all that <b>people</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It's</b> not all about religion. [...] "Out Of Control" [...] is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything".|$|R
500|$|... "Dancing With Myself" [...] is McHale's {{first solo}} {{performance}} on the show. Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to [...] "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" [...] and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually [...] "a very secure guy" [...] who does not care about others' opinions of him, [...] "Wheels" [...] sees his friends take his disability for granted: [...] "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is who I am, and this is who I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am {{to be able to get}} up between each take and walk around. I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before we went on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf HÃ¼tter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} right to privacy is not {{explicitly}} stated in many constitutions of [...] sovereign nations, many <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as foundational to a functioning democracy. In general {{the right to}} privacy can be found to rest on the provisions of habeas corpus, which first found official expression under Henry II in 11th century England, but has precedent in Anglo-Saxon law. This provision guarantees the right to freedom from arbitrary government interference, as well as due process of law. This conception of {{the right to privacy}} is operant in all countries which have adopted English common law through Acts of Reception. The Law of the United States rests on English common law by this means.|$|E

2500|$|Built as a {{monument}} to the westward expansion of the United States, the arch typifies [...] "the pioneer spirit {{of the men and women}} who won the West, and those of a latter day to strive on other frontiers." [...] The arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis, appearing in many parts of city culture. In 1968, three years after the monument's opening, the St. Louis phone directory contained 65 corporations with [...] "Gateway" [...] in their title and 17 with [...] "Arch". Arches also appeared over gas stations and drive-in restaurants. In the 1970s, a local sports team adopted the name [...] "Fighting Arches"; St. Louis Community College would later (when consolidating all athletic programs under a single banner) name its sports teams [...] "Archers". Robert S. Chandler, an NPS superintendent, said, [...] "Most [...] are awed by the size and scale of the Arch, but they don't understand what it's all about.... Too many <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as just a symbol of the city of St. Louis." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{one day he}} {{happened}} to see a beautiful golden bottle of a strange shape, all set with diamonds, and he opened it. There was in it a sweet-smelling water, as clear as crystal, and he poured it into his hand, and passed {{his hand over his}} eyes. Now this water had the power to destroy the [...] "glamour" [...] in Fairyland, and make <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as it really was. And when Randal touched his eyes with it, lo, everything was changed in a moment. He saw that nothing was what it had seemed.

60|$|Admirable though Father was, he couldn't sit still. He {{was wearing}} a {{decorative}} new traveling cap, very smart and extensive and expensive, shaped like a muffin, and patterned with the Douglas tartan and an Etruscan border. He rather wanted to let <b>people</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> He was no Pilkings clerk now, but a world-galloper. With his cap clapped down {{on one side and}} his youthful cigarette-holder cocked up on the other, and in his buttonhole a carnation jaunty as a red pompon, with the breeze puffing out the light silver hair about his temples and his pink cheeks glowing in the westering sun, he promenaded round and round the hurricane-deck and stopped to pat a whimpering child. But always he hastened back, lest Mother get frightened or lonely. Once he imagined that two toughs were annoying her, and he glared at them like a sparrow robbed of a crumb.|$|E
