5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered <b>propfan</b> technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by <b>propfan</b> engines. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|E
5|$|The German government, for {{political}} reasons, preferred the An-70-based solution. During a separate German Ministry of Defence {{evaluation of the}} An-7X, the aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to the A400M designed by the military branch of Airbus. According to AirTruck, the Defence Ministry estimated the An-7X to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival, would provide industrial benefits as Germany would receive substantial workshare, and was deemed to be technically superior, due mainly to its new <b>propfan</b> technology; however, a Defence Ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached. On the other hand, DASA preferred the A400M, and refused to be the prime contractor for the An-70 if {{it was to be}} chosen. In the meantime, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK, were tentative members of the FLA programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft; Russia and Ukraine themselves were looking to acquire 210 An-70s. Other contenders for the FLA were the C-17 and C-130J. In April 2000, the German government, the strongest supporter of the An-70, stated that it was committed to buying the same aircraft as the other countries. In the end, the A400M was chosen for the FLA project; had the An-70 been chosen, fifty percent of the aircraft would have been manufactured by Airbus.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} unsteady aerodynamic {{analysis is}} described for predicting the time-dependent flow about ducted and unducted <b>propfans</b> operating at angle of attack. Although the freestream {{is assumed to}} be uniform, the flow relative to the rotating blades varies with circumferential position, resulting in an inherent unsteadiness due to the nonaxial inflow. The time-dependent Euler equations are solved utilizing a Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme. The analysis is based on a finite-volume discretization employing a multiple-block grid network. To permit the use of large calculation time steps, an implicit residual smoothing scheme previously tested for unsteady flow calculations in two dimensions is extended to three spatial dimensions. For unducted <b>propfans,</b> a single H-type grid block is used for each blade passage to determine the time-periodic flowfield. For ducted <b>propfans</b> (ultra-high bypass fans) a body-centered C-type grid is wrapped about the cowl to improve the accuracy of the analysis in the high gradient flow region near the cowl leading edge. Numerical results are compared with available data for both ducted and unducted <b>propfans</b> operating at angle of attack...|$|R

25|$|NASA {{contracted}} Lockheed-Georgia {{to modify}} one G-II as the <b>Propfan</b> Test Assessment aircraft (N650PF, cn 118). The aircraft had a nacelle {{added to the}} left wing, containing an 6000hp Allison 570 turboprop engine (derived from the XT701 turboshaft developed for the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 program), powering a 9-foot diameter Hamilton Standard SR-7 <b>propfan.</b> The aircraft, so configured, first flew in March 1987. After an extensive test program, the modifications {{were removed from the}} aircraft and the aircraft became a Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA).|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, easyJet {{announced}} plans for construction of its own airliner, dubbed EcoJet. Featuring <b>propfan</b> engines, the EcoJet would feature an improvement in fuel efficiency. It would be constructed with extensive use of carbon fibre composite material. The date for the first flight was to be in 2015. As of October 2014, no concrete information has been released on the proposed airliner.|$|E
40|$|The {{turbomachinery}} aeroelastic {{effort is}} focused on unstalled and stalled flutter, forced response, and whirl flutter of both single rotation and counter rotation <b>propfans.</b> It also includes forced response of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbopump blades. Because of certain unique features of <b>propfans</b> and the SSME turbopump blades, {{it is not possible}} to directly use the existing aeroelastic technology of conventional propellers, turbofans or helicopters. Therefore, reliable aeroelastic stability and response analysis methods for these propulsion systems must be developed. The development of these methods for <b>propfans</b> requires specific basic technology disciplines, such as 2 -D and 3 -D steady and unsteady aerodynamic theories in subsonic, transonic and supersonic flow regimes; modeling of composite blades; geometric nonlinear effects; and passive and active control of flutter and response. These methods are incorporated in a computer program, ASTROP. The program has flexibility such that new and future models in basic disciplines can be easily implemented...|$|R
50|$|In 2012 GE {{expected}} that <b>propfans</b> could meet noise regulations by 2030, when new narrowbody generations from Boeing and Airbus become available. Airlines consistently ask for low noise, and then maximum fuel efficiency.|$|R
500|$|An-70T-100: A {{proposed}} lighter {{version of}} the An-70T with two D-27 <b>propfans</b> and simplified landing gear for civilian use. The variant was intended to haul [...] of cargo over a distance of , or [...] for [...]|$|R
25|$|The second {{generation}} of the DC-9 was originally called the DC-9-80 series or the DC-9 Super 80 but later marketed as the MD-80 and entered service in 1980. McDonnell Douglas began studies into shorter derivatives of the MD-80 in 1983, these studies eventually becoming known as the MD-90. While for several years, McDonnell Douglas proposed powering the MD-90 with two <b>propfan</b> engines, by 1989, {{it was clear that}} there was insufficient interest in prop fan powered aircraft, and reworked their proposals to feature the IAE V2500 turbofan instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine <b>propfan</b> lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|E
500|$|The An-70 is a {{monoplane}} with a high-mounted wing {{design that}} features four distinctive <b>propfan</b> engines. Designed by the Progress Design Bureau, {{each of the}} D-27 engines is rated at 13,800shp (which can be uprated to 16,000shp), {{which is used to}} drive the SV-27 [...] contra-rotating scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the front propeller and six on the aft propeller. The <b>propfan</b> engines deliver slipstream to the supercritical wings that feature double-slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds. The modernisation of the aircraft during 2010–12 saw upgrades to the engines, including the incorporation of FADEC, and the further separation of the two propellers. The aircraft's cruise speed is 750km/h (405kt) at an operational altitude of Antonov claimed in 1997 that the aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850km/h (460kt, or Mach0.8), which would have compared favourably with Mach0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to DASA's evaluation, the <b>propfan</b> engines were 10percent more efficient than conventional turboprops.|$|E
50|$|A Search {{and rescue}} version {{designed}} {{to replace the}} Beriev Be-12PS, {{in response to the}} K-278 disaster. Construction of a prototype began, but was suspended in 1993.

50|$|Competing {{with the}} 7J7 for airline {{interest}} was the McDonnell Douglas MD-94X, also powered by <b>propfans,</b> and the Airbus A320.

2500|$|The General Electric F404 and F412 are {{a family}} of {{afterburning}} turbofan engines in the [...] class (static thrust). The series are produced by GE Aviation.

50|$|In {{a bid for}} {{increased}} efficiency with speed, a development of the turbofan and turboprop known as a <b>propfan</b> engine was created that had an unducted fan. The fan blades are situated outside of the duct, so that it appears like a turboprop with wide scimitar-like blades. Both General Electric and Pratt & Whitney/Allison demonstrated <b>propfan</b> engines in the 1980s. Excessive cabin noise and relatively cheap jet fuel prevented the engines being put into service. The Progress D-27 <b>propfan,</b> developed in the U.S.S.R., was the only <b>propfan</b> engine equipped on a production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies {{developed}} the <b>propfan</b> concept {{in the early}} 1970s. Numerous design variations of the <b>propfan</b> were tested by Hamilton Standard, in conjunction with NASA in this decade.This testing led to the <b>Propfan</b> Test Assessment (PTA) program, where Lockheed-Georgia proposed modifying a Gulfstream II to act as in-flight testbed for the <b>propfan</b> concept and McDonnell Douglas proposed modifying a DC-9 for the same purpose.NASA chose the Lockheed proposal, where the aircraft had a nacelle added to the left wing, containing a 6000 hp Allison 570 turboprop engine (derived from the XT701 turboshaft developed for the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 program), powering a 9-foot diameter Hamilton Standard SR-7 <b>propfan.</b> The aircraft, so configured, first flew in March 1987.

50|$|Turbine engines {{need not}} be used as jets (see below), but may be geared to drive a {{propeller}} {{in the form of a}} turboprop. Modern helicopters also typically use turbine engines to power the rotor. Turbines provide more power for less weight than piston engines, and are better suited to small-to-medium size aircraft or larger, slow-flying types. Some turboprop designs mount the propeller directly on an engine turbine shaft, and are called <b>propfans.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Euler solver is {{coupled with}} a three-dimensional structural dynamics model to investigate flutter of <b>propfans.</b> An implicit-explicit hybrid scheme is used to reduce computational time for the solution of Euler equations.

40|$|Among {{trends in}} airbreathing propulsion, the {{priority}} {{is shown to}} belong to the goal of quieting engines to a level no greater than the natural background noise level of the environment in which they operate. For military engines, not so severely noise-constrained, the possibility of stoichiometric gas-turbine engines is shown to be within reach. Very high bypass ratio <b>propfans</b> are especially suitable for V/STOL aircraft.

50|$|In 1994, Antonov {{produced}} the An-70, a heavy transport aircraft. It {{is powered by}} four Progress D-27 <b>propfan</b> engines driving contra-rotating propellers.

5000|$|A <b>propfan</b> engine (also called [...] "unducted fan", [...] "open rotor", or [...] "ultra-high bypass") is a {{jet engine}} that uses its gas {{generator}} to power an exposed fan, similar to turboprop engines. Like turboprop engines, propfans generate {{most of their}} thrust from the propeller and not the exhaust jet. The primary difference between turboprop and <b>propfan</b> design is that the propeller blades on a <b>propfan</b> are highly swept {{to allow them to}} operate at speeds around Mach 0.8, which is competitive with modern commercial turbofans. These engines have the fuel efficiency advantages of turboprops with the performance capability of commercial turbofans. While significant research and testing (including flight testing) has been conducted on propfans, no <b>propfan</b> engines have entered production.|$|E
