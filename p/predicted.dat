By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried on the line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the <b>predicted</b> patronage.

5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is <b>predicted</b> to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these {{elements}} has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is <b>predicted</b> to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also <b>predicted</b> to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E

5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research <b>predicted</b> {{that there}} would be an eastwards shift in {{activity}} during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were <b>predicted</b> to experience a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were <b>predicted</b> to experience an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were <b>predicted</b> to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas <b>predicted</b> to experience an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was <b>predicted</b> to experience below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now <b>predicted</b> to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions that had {{occurred}} between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation caused by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he <b>predicted</b> that it would appear again in 1758–9. Halley's <b>predicted</b> return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who <b>predicted</b> the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When the comet returned as <b>predicted,</b> it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). It will next appear in 2061.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} examine whether conformity to masculine norms and conformity to feminine norms <b>predict</b> minority stress, anti-effeminacy attitudes, and internalized homophobia among gay men. The participants (N= 239) completed the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory- 46, Conformity to Feminine Norms Inventory- 45, Negative Attitudes Toward Effeminacy Scale, Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionnaire, and Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale. Analyses indicated that conformity to feminine norms <b>predicts</b> minority stress, that conformity to masculine norms does not <b>predict</b> minority stress, that conformity to masculine norms <b>predicts</b> anti-effeminacy, that conformity to feminine norms does not <b>predict</b> anti-effeminacy, that conformity to masculine norms <b>predicts</b> internalized homophobia, that conformity to feminine norms does not <b>predict</b> internalized homophobia, that anti-effeminacy does not <b>predict</b> minority stress, and that internalized homophobia does not <b>predict</b> minority stress. Components of conformity to masculine and feminine norms that <b>predict</b> minority stress are explored. The results suggest that gay men who conform to feminine norms may face increased minority stress and that gay men who conform to masculine norms may face increased internalized homophobia and anti-effeminacy. These results can inform efforts to reduce minority stress among gay men. Further investigation with a more racially and ethnically diverse sample is suggested...|$|R
