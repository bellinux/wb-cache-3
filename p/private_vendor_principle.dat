40|$|Prior {{research}} in marketing documents {{the prevalence of}} so-called psychological (or odd) pricing. Unlike earlier studies that focused on prices of professional vendors, we also consider prices of <b>private</b> <b>vendors</b> in our analyses. Relying on a sample of prices for second-hand cars and employing three alternative ways to bare the phenomenon, our results present unequivocal evidence of psychological pricing being significantly more common among prices of professional vendors. Moreover, whereas findings based on all three methods are consistent with odd pricing for the sub-sample of professional vendors, only one method yields significant indications of psychological pricing for the sub-sample of <b>private</b> <b>vendors.</b> Consistent with humans’ reliance upon cognitive reference points, zeroes are found to dominate prices of both professional and <b>private</b> <b>vendors.</b> Nevertheless, round prices are significantly more common among <b>private</b> <b>vendors.</b> Our findings also indicate that <b>private</b> <b>vendors</b> tend to round their posted number of kilometers significantly more often, whereas professional vendors seem to provide more accurate numbers of kilometers. Finally, we provide some evidence of professional vendors strategically setting their sales prices just below pre-defined price thresholds {{that can be used}} to narrow search results in the online database employed for the current study.

40|$|The {{research}} addresses {{questions about}} the desirability of privatizing {{a key component of}} the child support enforcement process, namely, the serving of legal documents or “service of pro-cess ” for cases in which the noncustodial parent is living in another state. Child support enforce-ment cases that require this type of “long arm ” service of process were randomly assigned to a <b>private</b> <b>vendor</b> and to out-of-state sheriff offices using an experimental research design. The author finds that although there is no difference in the time it took the two groups to process cases, the <b>private</b> <b>vendor</b> was more successful, on average, at performing this function. Further-more, he finds that the higher success rate of the <b>private</b> <b>vendor</b> is sufficient to produce a substan-tively important increase in collections in child support enforcement cases. Additional {{questions about the}} suitability of privatizing “service of process ” and other like services are also discussed...|$|R

Moving people from welfare to work became a primary goal of federal welfare policy with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program it created.
