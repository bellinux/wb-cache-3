50|$|Thrust-collar type MJTs {{are used}} in {{applications}} where {{it is difficult to}} use threaded tensioners, such as on rolling mills where the joint would typically need to be tightened by crane wrenching. Jackbolts push a threadless nut against a retainer ring, which is fitted into a groove and transfers the jacking force to the main bolt or stud. Because there are no threads, they can also be used in <b>press</b> <b>column</b> applications, eliminating the problems and hassles associated with large nut threads.|$|E

5000|$|Before a poor {{attendance}} of 9,631, Offaly's seismic 3-17 to 5-10 victory was as glorious for {{the manner in}} which it was achieved as for the way it overturned the Faithful County's seven previous defeats at this stage. Offaly won because, apart from the character that allowed them to shrug off the five Kilkenny goals, they had the fitness to harry the aristocrats mercilessly for the entire seventy minutes, and the skill and economy to convert most of their own scoring chances. Kilkenny full forward Matthew Ruth's quicksilver display continued to trouble the Offaly defence even after the introduction of substitute Eugene Coughlan. Nonetheless, it was the rattled Kilkenny mentors who rang in the changes at the start of the second half. Offaly had gone three points down when they were awarded a penalty, which Pádraig Horan blasted shoulder-high. Although Sekhan parried, the talismanic Brendan Bermingham (Lusmagh) pounced to level the match. A minute later Horan sent to Johnny Flaherty, who hand-passed to the net. Ruth got a goal back as Kilkenny almost pulled off a Houdini act; but Ger Henderson's 80-yard free drifted wide and the underdogs clung on. In his Evening <b>Press</b> <b>column</b> the following day, Con Houlihan depicted the post-match scene: ...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} optimize the guiding device on hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>column.</b> Axiomatic design plays a very important role in the optimization design of mechanical products, and it provides a basic scientific framework for the research and design by mapping different domains and refining design process. In this paper, we analyze the guiding device on a large tonnage hydraulic press, and we create the axiomatic design framework of guiding device on hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>column</b> by mapping and refining layer by layer. Through the analysis of the coupling, we optimize the structure of guide device and improve the lower speed precision stamping conditions of hydraulic press...|$|E

It focuses on two salient pictures of her which represent the roles she successfully performed during her first eleven months in office (from April 2008 to March 2009) : minister mother, and hybridly-gendered military officer/minister. The study reveals how Chacón’s success as a politician seems to be proportionate to her closeness to the socially sanctioned feminine role of mother, or to the powerful social roles of minister and military officer, performed from hybridly-gendered identities. It reveals as well that identities are becoming more fluid, and {{a new way to}} be feminine is pushing its way in the new order...|$|R

The results showed that the performance of the experimental group were distant not only from those of the norm group but also from the illustrative descriptors of the CEFR for C 1 and C 2 proficiency levels. Research on the field of language learning methods and strategies was necessary in order to design reading activities that would enable the students to deepen reading comprehension. The second phase of testing leads to the conclusion that, with this group of subjects, the methodological choices implemented throughout the reading lessons that were held between both testing moments led to an improvement in reading processing...|$|R
