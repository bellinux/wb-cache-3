5000|$|<b>Pedal</b> <b>feel</b> - Brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> {{encompasses}} subjective {{perception of}} brake power output {{as a function}} of pedal travel. Pedal travel is influenced by the fluid displacement of the brake and other factors.|$|E
50|$|Brake fluids must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel.</b> As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.|$|E
5000|$|From 1998 through 1999 the 626 {{was given}} an engine {{overhaul}} to give it better <b>pedal</b> <b>feel.</b> However, as most car reviews attested, it is a bland vehicle with softer handling and fewer features than the 1993-1997 version. Here is one such quote from Edmunds: [...] "A bland, bread-and-butter sedan that's not big enough for families and not sporty enough for enthusiasts." [...] Along with a nearly invisible facelift, front side airbags were new options for 2000, as were larger wheels, four-wheel discs, and rear heat ducts. The four-cylinder engine was also upgraded by [...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{reduction}} of friction termed brake fade is caused {{when the temperature}} reaches the [...] "kneepoint" [...] on the temperature-friction curve and gas builds up between disc and pad. All brake lining is cured under mechanical pressure following a heating and cooling curve backstroke, heating the friction material up to 450 F to [...] "cure" [...] (cross-link) the phenolic resin thermoset polymers: There is no melting of the binding resins, because phenolic resins are thermoset, not thermoplastic. In this form of fade, the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feels</b> firm but there is reduced stopping ability. Fade can also be caused by the brake fluid boiling, with attendant release of compressible gases. In this type of fade, the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feels</b> [...] "spongy". This condition is worsened when there are contaminants in the fluid, such as water, which most types of brake fluids are prone to absorbing to varying degrees. For this reason brake fluid replacement is standard maintenance.|$|R

50|$|Eliminator (2000 Series) - Pearl's mid-ranged line of pedals and {{the most}} {{versatile}} line of pedals in Pearl's lineup. Eliminator pedals feature Pearl's patented QuadBeater which allow the player to choose between four distinct sounds, six interchangeable cams which affects the <b>pedal's</b> <b>feel</b> and response, and a customizable traction plate. For 2012, the Eliminator II (2100 series) line of pedals were introduced by Pearl Japan, sporting features from the Demon series such as Ninja bearings, Z-link universal joints (limited edition only), and the Control Core beater, and bridges {{the gap between the}} Eliminator and Eliminator Demon lines. The Eliminator II is currently only sold in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{like the}} Systems Engineer, the {{development}} engineer {{is concerned with}} the interactions of all systems in the complete automobile. While there are multiple components and systems in an automobile that have to function as designed, they must also work in harmony with the complete automobile. As an example, the brake system's main function is to provide braking functionality to the automobile. Along with this, it must also provide an acceptable level of: <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> (spongy, stiff), brake system “noise” (squeal, shudder, etc.), and interaction with the ABS (anti-lock braking system) ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} {{is available on}} the Corolla L and S grades. Drive modes that offer re-calibrated throttle, transmission and steering responses are available on the Corolla LE Eco and Corolla S. For ECO drive mode on the LE Eco, the initial throttle inputs are less sensitive to help encourage more fuel-efficient driving and eliminate sudden starts. On the S grade, the SPORT mode software helps make the accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> more responsive to input along with CVTi-S shifting logic that enhances acceleration feel. In sport mode, Corolla's electronic power steering is programmed to offer a more positive steering feel.|$|E
5000|$|Dan Prosser, in a 2016 {{review for}} the British {{magazine}} EVO, praised the vehicle's performance, styling and torque vectoring system, but criticized its small cabin {{size and the}} brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel,</b> giving it 3½ out of 5 stars. He nontheless stated [...] "The Concept One does lack the soundtrack and the dramatic power delivery of a conventional supercar, but {{in the way it}} accelerates and in the way its torque vectoring system picks apart a corner it is enormously entertaining to drive quickly" [...] and concluded that the car [...] "proves EVs can be spectacular to drive".|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to producing drums, Pearl has also produced hardware for its drum and percussion instruments {{as well as}} pedals. One of Pearl's major improvements was {{the introduction of the}} Uni-Lock tilter on their tom mounts and cymbal stands. Introduced in 1982, the Uni-Lock tilter uses a frictionless, gearless tilter, allowing the player to make more precise angle adjustments to their toms and cymbals. This was further improved with the introduction of the Gyro-Lock tilters which rotate a full 360 degrees. Most of Pearl's pedals come equipped with PowerShifter heel plates, which allow the player to adjust the <b>pedal's</b> <b>feel</b> by sliding the plate either forwards or backwards.|$|R
5000|$|A {{brake booster}} is an {{enhanced}} master cylinder setup {{used to reduce}} the amount of pedal pressure needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the master cylinder to give higher hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a brake booster push-rod. The brake booster usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force applied by the pedal on to the master cylinder, or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it. Without the engine running the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feels</b> very hard and ineffective on the braking capability. An [...] "active" [...] booster is a non [...] "conventional" [...] booster where a solenoid is used to open the booster air valve to automatically push the master cylinder forward to perform some forms of dynamic stability control. Brake boosters come in either a single diaphragm or tandem diaphragm (which is generally used for bigger vehicles and trucks). They can be [...] "cabin-breathers" [...] (taking clean filtered air from inside the cabin thus may be more noisy) or [...] "engine-breathers" [...] (less noisy but more at risk for becoming clogged with mud/ice if not protected properly).|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} replaces traditional components {{such as the}} pumps, hoses, fluids, {{belts and}} vacuum servos and master cylinders with electronic sensors and actuators. Drive-by-wire technology in automotive industry replaces the traditional mechanical and hydraulic control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as <b>pedal</b> and steering <b>feel</b> emulators.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 (for the 2014 model year), the 4Runner {{received}} a facelift, consisting of revised {{front and rear}} fascia with projector headlamps and clear-lensed, LED tail-lamps, {{as well as other}} minor exterior cosmetic changes. The interior was also updated, with soft-touch door trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, revised dashboard and center stack, and the inclusion of Toyota's Optitron instrument cluster as standard across all trim levels. Brake lines were upgraded for improved <b>pedal</b> <b>feel,</b> and electronic Trailer Sway Control programming included. No driveline changes were made. All 2014 model year 4Runner models are powered by a 4.0-liter V-6 engine with intelligent Variable Valve Timing (VVT-i) that can develop [...] and 278 ftlb Nm of torque. It is mated to a five-speed automatic ECT transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} RAV4 EV combines a Tesla-designed and produced battery and electric powertrain with Toyota’s SUV model. The electric motor supplied by Tesla is an AC induction motor, {{a departure from}} Toyota’s practice of using synchronous permanent-magnet motors in their hybrid electric vehicles. A fixed-gear open-differential transaxle has a gear ratio of 9.73. The RAV4 EV weighs 4030 lb, 470 lb heavier than a front-wheel drive RAV4 Limited with the V-6 engine. [...] Peak power output of the motor is , with peak torque in normal mode of 296 Nm, and peak torque in sport mode of 370 Nm. The RAV 4 offers two drive modes: Normal and Sport. Maximum vehicle speed in Normal mode is 85 mph, and maximum in Sport mode, which also has a more aggressive accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>feel,</b> is 100 mph. The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the RAV4 EV combined fuel economy at 76 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (76 mpg), with an equivalent 78 mpg in city driving and 74 mpg on highways.|$|E
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study has}} been conducted in a fixed-base research simulator to assess the directional handling qualities for various rudder <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> characteristics for commercial transport airplanes. That is, the effects of static pedal force at maximum pedal travel, breakout force, and maximum pedal travel on handling qualities were studied. An artificial maneuver with a severe lateral wind shear and requiring runway tracking {{at an altitude of}} 50 feet in a crosswind was used to fully exercise the rudder pedals. Twelve active airline pilots voluntarily participated in the study and flew approximately 500 maneuvers. The pilots rated the maneuver performance with various rudder <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> characteristics using the Cooper- Harper rating scale. The test matrix had 15 unique combinations of the 3 static <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> characteristics. A 10 -term, second-order equation for the Cooper-Harper pilot rating {{as a function of the}} 3 independent <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> parameters was fit to the data. The test matrix utilized a Central Composite Design that is very efficient for fitting an equation of this form. The equation was used to produce contour plots of constant pilot ratings as a function of two of the parameters with the third parameter held constant. These contour plots showed regions of good handling qualities as well as regions of degraded handling qualities. In addition, a numerical equation solver was used to predict the optimum parameter values (those with the lowest pilot rating). Quantitative pilot performance data were also analyzed. This analysis found that the peak values of the cross power spectra of the pedal force and heading angle could be used to quantify the tendency toward directional pilot induced oscillations (PIO). Larger peak values of the cross power spectra were correlated with larger (degraded) Cooper-Harper pilot ratings. Thus, the subjective data (Cooper-Harper pilot ratings) were consistent with the objective data (peak values of the cross power spectra) ...|$|E
50|$|The crescendo pedal is {{typically}} used only in certain repertoire, and, generally speaking, the organ's expression pedal(s) are more commonly used. Because the crescendo pedal both resembles and is {{adjacent to the}} expression pedal(s), it may confuse beginning organists, such as pianists who are filling in at the church organ, who intend to use the expression pedal(s) rather than the crescendo pedal. To avoid this danger, the organist should look at the pedals before playing to ascertain if they are labeled, as well as practice locating the correct <b>pedal</b> by <b>feel.</b> When feeling for a pedal while playing, the organist should remember that the crescendo pedal is normally the right-most of the volume pedals, and that its surface is often raised slightly above the expression pedal(s) so as to help the organist to avoid selecting it by mistake.|$|R
50|$|Drive by wire, DbW, by-wire, Steer-by-wire, or {{x-by-wire}} {{technology in}} the automotive industry {{is the use of}} electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. This technology replaces the traditional mechanical control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as <b>pedal</b> and steering <b>feel</b> emulators. Components such as the steering column, intermediate shafts, pumps, hoses, belts, coolers and vacuum servos and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the fly-by-wire systems used widely in the aviation industry.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake <b>pedal</b> that <b>feels</b> soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R
40|$|Customer {{perception}} of brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> quality, {{as related to}} the {{perception of}} the brake pedal feeling soft or mushy, depends on both the customer's subjective judgment of quality and the actual build quality of the brake system. This project analyzed the different factors contributing to the soft brake condition using a fishbone diagram. A low cost tool to objectively measure brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> was developed and tested. Using this tool we found a negative linear correlation between residual air in the brake system and brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel.</b> Even in the worst-case, a residual air level of 0. 9 mL or greater is required before the brake pedal force drops 10 %. The air evacuation step in the brake fluid filling process was investigated by the addition of a vacuum accumulator tank, and we found the air evacuation to depend on the brake system cross-sectional area (i. e. tube diameter) and not on the vacuum pressure. Organizational process issues were analyzed, and we found that greater cross-functional communication and collaboration are needed between manufacturing and external groups such as design and marketing. by Jeffrey T.

40|$|The NADS {{models and}} cab {{for a class}} 8 tractor/trailer have {{recently}} been reviewed, enhanced, and implemented for a NHTSA study. A panel from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) reviewed {{the status of the}} NADS simulation capabilities and made several recommendations for improving its fidelity and realism. This paper is devoted to describing recent enhancements made to the models, visuals, and cab to address the recommendations from the FMCSA review, with a general introduction to the tractor/trailer model. In addition, some capabilities were added to support a NHTSA study on braking that was completed in early 2007. One of the noted problems was a lack of synchronicity between the transmission and engine model running locally on the cab computer (CFS), and the transmission and engine model running under vehicle dynamics (VDS). This was addressed by porting the CFS model into VDS, to obtain completely synchronous simulations. Another noted problem was the lack of accurate trailer visualization, which was addressed up to the current capabilities of the NADS visual system. Other enhancements include new brake model data, validation of the steering system and brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel,</b> and a new vibration model providing motion feel through the hexapod and dome vibration actuators. In conclusion, the work to provide a realistic tractor/trailer simulation experience is ongoing; with the current state-of-the-art being appropriate and sufficient for certain types of heavy truck studies...|$|E
40|$|Brake <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> is very {{important}} in modern passenger car braking systems. This feeling is determined by the relationship between the force applied on the pedal by the driver’s foot, the movement of the pedal and the deceleration of the vehicle. It is such an important parameter in terms of the driver interface that the movement and deformation of the component parts of the system, which affects the force/travel relationship, must always be estimated or predicted at the design stage, or measured from previous similar installations. This last way is chosen by Applus+ IDIADA to perform these measurements. The project is carried out in Applus+ IDIADA facilities as an ideada internal project. The first part of the project is to define the techniques and the different parts to design and manufacture the test rig. The main objective of this part is to understand the problem and select the main components to build the rig in order to determine different values of fluid consumption by each part of the brake system. These components should be dimensioned to withstand specifications and ensure the proper functioning of the test. Once the materials are selected, the second step will be the design of the test rig, taking into account the materials and components selected on the first step. The test rig will be designed with CAD software. The last step will be the assembly of the CAD design and the different elements that compound the hydraulic circuit to carry out the test. Therefore, this design is going to be tested and validated with different configurations of brakes and different elements such as hoses, pipes, calipers, etc. Finally, after performing validation tests, the test rig will be used in the brakes laboratory to carry out different absorption brake tests, as part of commercially-focused projects conducted by Applus+ IDIADA...|$|E
40|$|Short {{range of}} {{electric}} vehicles {{is one of}} the stumbling blocks in the way of electric cars to gaining wide user acceptance and becoming a major market player. The possibility to recover vehicle energy otherwise lost as heat during braking is an inherent advantage of a hybrid electric or a fully electric vehicle. Regeneration has the potential to answer this problem by aiding in range extension with recuperation of vehicle energy during braking. The control and dynamics of braking undergoes a major change as compared to a conventional vehicle with friction braking, due to the addition of motor-generator. In this research two regenerative braking concepts namely serial and parallel have been studied and implemented on an electric vehicle. Also a point of interest is to find if any additional states are required from the TNO Vehicle state estimator (VSE) which would aid in regeneration. From the results obtained we try to draw a conclusion on the difference in energy recuperation level in the two strategies with consistent <b>pedal</b> <b>feel</b> in mind. The proposed brake torque distribution strategy has been tested through the simulation on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) drive cycle and straight line braking scenario. Care has been taken to observe and adjust brake torque such that wheel lock up is prevented and hence regeneration is un-interrupted. The research couldn’t come with any additional parameters to be added to VSE. However, it would be worthwhile to employ VSE to achieve a more accurate estimation of the braking force, which may aid in prolonging regeneration time and hence more energy recuperation. The results provide a good case to invest more time and money into developing serial regenerative braking as it clearly out-performs parallel regenerative braking strategy. The simulation tests conducted in this research are for a longitudinal braking scenario. Further investigation is required to study effects with lateral motion and cornering maneuvers...|$|E
