In the investigation, Hal Meadow told the investigation board that the three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to the US during a previous sensitive business trip to Singapore in 1971, contradicting the Meadows' earlier claim of the foundation cats' origin. Apparently Tommy Meadow lied about it to conceal the secret trip. The CFA found no wrongdoing and kept the Singapura's status as a natural breed. CFA's Joan Miller said that [...] "Whether they mated on the streets of Singapore or whether they mated in Michigan, it doesn't really matter."

2500|$|All {{printers}} have {{in recent}} years been given a technical brief on printing Machin stamps from Royal Mail and Cartor {{would have had the}} same brief. [...] To reduce the risk of any mistakes the brief would set the standard for every element of the stamp including the typeface to be used for the value. [...] The standard typeface used currently throughout the Machin Series is the Jeffery Matthews drawn typeface. This error 5p Garamond typeface value made an appearance on the 5p Deep Ash Pink value of the Classic Album Covers pane of 7 January 2010, as well as the 54p Rust value from the same book, though it has since been corrected on all other printings. What in effect happened was that the digital artwork for this value was omitted from the material sent to Cartor for Booklet Panes DP411 and DP416 as well. Rather than ask Royal Mail for it, the printer tried to match the Jeffery Matthews typeface but made the wrong choice (The printer chose a Garamond one), although the letter “P” was correct. The error wasn’t <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> proof stage and was spotted only after the finished product samples were delivered. A “suitable process” was put into place to avoid a repetition of this kind of mistake. Differences in typeface fonts are not new and can easily be seen on the early NVI gold issues.|$|E

The soiled clothes, <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> customer's house by “special cars”, were disinfected and bleached with ozone, then placed in a revolving drum worked by electricity and soaked in a [...] solution, in order to remove the starch and make the linen whiter, subsequently washed in soap and water, afterwards in a solution of ammonia to remove the soap, then whitened, starched, [...] and hand ironed. The process was considered a model both for the quality of the output and for the care taken of the health of the workers. A [...] "surprising" [...] amount of laundry was sent over by British customers. Like many other foreign customers, William Stewart Halsted and William H.

In 1906, a branch of the laundry was opened at 1, rue du Colisée, near the Champs-Élysées. During World War I, Charvet significantly reduced the price of its laundry services to keep sufficient work for all his employees. Towards the end of the war, the shortage of coal severely hit Charvet's laundry activity.

[...] With the victory, Froome became the first British rider to win the Vuelta, the third man to successfully complete the Tour-Vuelta double in the same year joining Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault, and the first man to achieve the feat since the Vuelta moved to its current position on the racing calendar. [...] He then competed at the 2017 UCI Road World Championships in Bergen only about a week after his Vuelta victory and won two bronze medals: one in the men's team time trial with Team Sky, the other in the men's individual time trial for Great Britain.
