5|$|Blast Corps is a 1997 action {{video game}} for the Nintendo 64 in which the player uses {{vehicles}} to destroy buildings in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> runaway nuclear missile carrier. In the game's 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was developed by Rare, published by Nintendo, and released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed {{at the end of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) {{agrees to}} take his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) back to the day her father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) died in 1987. When Rose intervenes and pulls her father out of the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car, time is wounded and dangerous Reapers attack, threatening to erase history. Pete eventually learns that {{to get rid of}} the Reapers, he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1779, Charles Messier {{recorded}} Pallas on a star chart he used to track the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comet (now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode)) that he observed {{in the spring of}} 1779, but apparently assumed it {{was nothing more than a}} star.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E
5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary {{in the way they}} clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming into the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link {{to the rest of}} Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E

5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hyperbola, {{and as such}} they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the Sun, to a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, the {{corridor}} {{of what is}} now MD194 was the HanoverFrederick portion of the Monocacy Road, a migration route that connected Philadelphia and Winchester, Virginia via York, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport. The Frederick County portion of the highway later became the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair of turnpikes. The Woodsboro and Double Pipe Creek Turnpike connected the namesake town and creek; the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike extended from Woodsboro south to the junction with the Liberty and Frederick Turnpike in Ceresville. The two turnpikes issuing from Ceresville were connected to Frederick by the Frederick and Woodsboro Turnpike. The Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike was the last privately maintained toll road in Maryland when it was purchased by the Maryland State Roads Commission, the predecessor to the Maryland State Highway Administration, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{best known}} for his work in applied {{philosophy}} concerning refugees, immigration policy and genocide, Adelman published a major study entitled Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda (1996) as part of the 5 volume study International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience. In 1999, he co-edited The <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire, already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces‚Äîthose that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law‚Äîhave {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E
5|$|USAF F-105s were {{escorted by}} F-4s {{to protect them}} against enemy fighters. However, the Thunderchief was officially {{credited}} with 27.5 air-to-air victories against North Vietnamese aircraft {{at the cost of}} 17 aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to have shot down an additional 23 F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF). All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs‚Äîone by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly into the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprised MiG.|$|E

Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E
