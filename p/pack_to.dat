5|$|The {{beginning}} {{to the race}} highlighted {{the dominance of the}} Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading <b>pack</b> <b>to</b> come from outside the two historically strong nations.
