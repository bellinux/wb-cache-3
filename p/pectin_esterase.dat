40|$|The {{importance}} of many factors for the cloud stability {{of orange juice}} was investigated. By the determination of methanol, cloud loss of orange juice could be ascribed directly to the action of <b>pectin</b> <b>esterase.</b> However, clarification only occurs if calcium ions are available to precipitate the low methoxy pectin formed by <b>pectin</b> <b>esterase.</b> This mechanism was confirmed when the addition of pectic acid clarified the orange juice artificially.

30|$|Biological {{conversion}} of plant biomass into commercially valuable products {{is one of}} the highly studied subjects in the last two decades. Studies were continuously being conducted to understand and develop efficient enzymes for the breakdown and {{conversion of}} plant cell-wall components into valuable commercial products. Naturally, plant cell-wall components are differentially esterified to protect from the invading microorganisms. However, during the process of evolution, microorganisms have developed special set of enzymes to de-esterify the plant cell-wall components. Among the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), carbohydrate esterases stand first during the process of enzymatic conversion of plant biomass, as these enzymes de-esterify the plant biomass and make it accessible for the hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases, hemicellulases, ligninolytic and pectinases. In this article, we have extensively discussed about the structural and functional properties of <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases,</b> feruloyl, cinnamoyl and glucuronoyl esterases which are required for the de-esterification of pectin and lignin–carbohydrate complexes. <b>Pectin</b> <b>esterases</b> are classified among CE 8, CE 12, CE 13 and CE 15 carbohydrate esterase class of CAZy database.

The methods utilized in the preparation of enzyme extracts were by (1) the preparation of acetone powder (2) the preparation of acetone powder in the presence of polyethylene glycol and (3) by extraction in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone. The following conclusions were made: (1) Cranberry protein extracts were found to exhibit polygalacturonase activity. (2) The cranberry polygalacturonase extract obtained by the use of polyethylene glycol exhibited a 40. 3 percent loss in viscosity over one percent pectave solution in citrate buffer at pH 5. 0 and 30 °C during the initial hour of the reaction. A 22. 1 and 8. 6 percent loss in viscosity was found when the polyvinylpyrrolidone extract and the acetone powder extract were used as the source of enzyme respectively. (3) Cranberry polygalacturonase may be classified as an endo- type polygalacturonase which catalyzes a random hydrolysis of both low and high methoxyl pectic substances.

Growth behavior of the isolates was investigated. All strains could grow at 2 °C. Addition of glucose to pectin-containing culture medium had a repressive effect on enzyme production except for C. aquaticus, which showed increased polygalacturonase activity. Optimal temperature for enzyme production for the Cystofilobasidium strains was 14 °C, while that for the Cryptococcus strains was lower. Among the isolates, C. lari-marini S 3 B produced highest levels of enzyme activity at pH 3. 2. Preliminary characterization of the polygalacturonases in the culture supernatant showed the enzyme from Cystofilobasidium strains to be optimally active at 40 °C and pH 5, and that from the Cryptococcus strains at 50 °C and pH 4.

40|$|Tomatoes (cv. Tradiro), {{harvested}} at two maturity stages, {{were stored}} at four different temperatures during {{up to four}} weeks. The lowest storage temperature was known to cause chilling injury, the three other temperatures were regarded save. During storage Near Infrared spectra of intact tomatoes were recorded and samples were taken at regular time intervals to determine {{the activities of the}} pectolytic enzymes polygalacturonase, <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterase</b> and ß-galactosidase. The maturity stage of the tomatoes at harvest, followed by storage at the four different temperatures affects the activities of these enzymes. To describe the change in activity of these enzymes kinetic models were built based on fundamental laws of chemical kinetics using assumed, but plausible reaction mechanisms. For the models developed, a fixed and a variable enzyme activity were observed for these three enzymes. For polygalacturonase, this fixed amount of enzyme activity was dependent on maturity stage at harvest. For <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterase</b> and ß-galactosidase the maturity at harvest had almost no effect on this fixed amount of enzyme activity. The variable part of the enzyme activity could either increase in time (polygalacturonase), followed by denaturation (ß-galactosidase), or only decay in time (<b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterase).</b> For the activity of polygalacturonase, a self-initiated, autocatalytic production of this enzyme was assumed. ß-Galactosidase was formed, but inactivated in time. <b>Pectin</b> methyl <b>esterase</b> activity decayed exponentially in time.

30|$|Commercially, <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases</b> are majorly {{applied in}} {{association}} with pectinases in food and beverage processing industries. The presence of pectin leads to cloudiness of the fruit juices; pectinase preparations are applied industrially for clarifying and reducing the viscosity of fruit juices and eases the process of concentration and filtration (Demir et al. 2001). Pectinases are applied in combinations with cellulases; hemicellulases were applied for the disruption of plant cell walls and commercially used to produce juices from tropical fruits (Alkorta et al. 1998; Massiot et al. 1997; Wicker et al. 2002). Industrial processes used for preservation {{of fruits and vegetables}} such as blanching, washing, freezing, dehydration, sterilization and pasteurization lead to severe physical damage of plant cellular tissues including primary cell wall and middle lamella. However, recently, these traditional methods were replaced with vacuum infusion methods using <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases</b> and calcium chloride mixture to overcome the negative effects of fruits- and vegetables-processing methods (Suutarinen et al. 2000, 2002). Based on its degree of esterification, pectin is divided into low-methoxylated (LM) and high-methoxylated (HM) (Kohli et al. 2015). The HM pectin is generally used for the production of high-sugar jams and jellies. As the HM pectin follows a hydrophobic interaction and dehydration at low pH for its gelling and to achieve proper gelling of the HM pectin, higher sugar concentrations are essential (Kohli et al. 2015). Contrastingly, LM pectin follows different gelling mechanisms through ionic interactions as it contains calcium (divalent cations) which interacts with the free carboxylic acid groups resulting in a successful cross linkage; therefore, LM pectin does not require higher concentrations of sugar for gelling. Thus, industrially LM pectin is used for the production of low-sugar jellies and jams suitable for the consumption of diabetic patients (Kohli et al. 2015). The apple- and orange-peel wastes are rich in pectin; thus, it is industrially used as gelling and thickening agents. However, the degree of esterification significantly affects the thickening and gelling property of the <b>pectin.</b> <b>Pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases</b> are used for retrieving pectin with lower degree of esterification (Kohli et al. 2015; Morris et al. 2000).|$|R

40|$|An RNA {{fingerprinting}} {{study of}} potato leaf protoplasts {{was performed to}} explore its suitability for identifying candidate genes involved in primary cell wall biosynthesis. Microscopic analysis, using calcofluor white to stain cellulose, showed that the protoplasts generated a new cell wall in the first 18 h after transfer to a culture medium. Complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) was used to visualise differential gene expression at five distinct time-points within these first 18 h. In vitro plants (with and without exposure to severe physical damage) served as controls. Around 8500 transcript derived fragments (TDFs) were visualised which showed varying expression patterns in the protoplasts and controls. In total 156 TDFs were isolated, sequenced and used to search for homologies. Over 50 % of these TDFs showed homology to described genes, involved in several general plant processes. However, only one cell wall related TDF (a <b>pectin</b> <b>esterase)</b> was found. Our results {{showed that even though}} the protoplasts actively regenerate a new cell wall, this did not result in highly increased expression of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis or modification.

40|$|Sweet potato (Ipomea batatas L.) is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} crop with limited storage techniques. Some endogenous spoilage enzymes and antioxidant biomolecules in the treated tubers were employed to assess the effectiveness of treating the tuber with calcium chloride dip, bemul-wax and {{combinations of the two}} at 2 weeks interval for improving its qualities during 10 weeks low-temperature (10 °- 15 °C and 91 - 96 %RH.) storage. A significant weight reduction (P< 0. 05) in the tubers treated with bemul-wax and the combined treatments was manifested in 10 weeks. The tubers also exhibited a reduced tendency to sprout, as evidenced by the significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in α-amylase activities for 4 weeks. A significant reduction (P< 0. 05) also occurred in the polyphenol oxidase activities of the tubers treated with bemul-wax, combination treatment and calcium chloride dip over 4, 4 and 10 weeks of storage, respectively. The ascorbic acid levels, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, alcohol dehydrogenase and <b>pectin</b> <b>esterase</b> activities were relatively stable in all treated tubers. The combination of the two treatments, which could provide a non-genetic approach to eliminate or reduce sprout development, seems to be the most effective treatment for preventing spoilage under these storage conditions...|$|E
30|$|Enzymes {{required}} for the breakdown of pectin can be majorly classified into three categories as protopectinases (involved in breaking insoluble protopectin and results in soluble polymerized pectin), depolymerizing enzymes ({{required for}} breaking down α(1 [*]→[*] 4) glycosidic linkages of <b>pectin)</b> and <b>esterases</b> ({{required for the}} de-esterification and de-acetylation of pectin) (Gonzalez and Rosso 2011). Pectinolytic enzymes are widely observed among plants, bacterial and fungal species {{and most of the}} <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases</b> can be divided based on their optimum pH; bacteria and plant PME exhibit an optimum pH range between 6 and 8 and PME secreted by fungi exhibit a pH 4 – 6 (Gonzalez and Rosso 2011; Jayani et al. 2005). Pectin-degrading enzymes have attained high commercial importance since early 1930 s in wine and fruit juice industries; pectinolytic enzymes secreted by Aspergillus species are highly used in industries (Alkorta et al. 1998). Pectin present in vegetable tissues and majorly in fruits contains complex hetero polysaccharides at a molecular weight ranging between 25 and 360  kDa. Calcium and magnesium pectate forms the major constituent of the plant cell walls especially in middle lamella (Jayani et al. 2005). The gelling property of pectin majorly employed in the food industries is directly dependent on its degree of esterification; pectins with higher degree of esterification gel around pH 3.0 in the presence of sugar, whereas pectins with low degree of esterification gel in the presence of calcium ions under wide pH ranges and with or without sugar (Fu and Rao 1999, 2001; Gonzalez and Rosso 2011).|$|R
40|$|Five {{isolates}} of pectolytic fluorescent pseudomonads {{were obtained}} from a rotted onion bulb and identified as Pseudomonas marginalis. At both 4 and 25 oC, all isolates caused soft rot to detached plant parts of onion and to carrot, celery, cucumber, pepper, spinach, tomato and turnip (but not garlic). They did not however cause any symptoms in living plants of these same species. These {{results suggest that the}} onion isolates are a postharvest pathogen which is not destructive in the field but becomes a threat to fresh vegetables stored at low-temperature. Analysis of cellulosolytic and pectic enzymes revealed that pectic lyases, but not polygalacturonases, <b>pectin</b> methyl <b>esterases</b> and cellulases were produced in culture by each isolate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases (STYKs) {{commonly}} found in eukaryotes have been recently reported in many bacterial species. Recent studies elucidating their cellular functions have established their roles in bacterial growth and development. However functions {{of a large number}} of bacterial STYKs still remain elusive. The organisation of domains in a large dataset of bacterial STYKs has been investigated here in order to recognise variety in domain combinations which determine functions of bacterial STYKs. Results Using sensitive sequence and profile search methods, domain organisation of over 600 STYKs from 125 prokaryotic genomes have been examined. Kinase catalytic domains of STYKs tethered to a wide range of enzymatic domains such as phosphatases, HSP 70, peptidyl prolyl isomerases, <b>pectin</b> <b>esterases</b> and glycoproteases have been identified. Such distinct preferences for domain combinations are not known to be present in either the Histidine kinase or the eukaryotic STYK families. Domain organisation of STYKs specific to certain groups of bacteria has also been noted in the current anlaysis. For example, Hydrophobin like domains in Mycobacterial STYK and penicillin binding domains in few STYKs of Gram-positive organisms and FHA domains in cyanobacterial STYKs. Homologues of characterised substrates of prokaryotic STYKs have also been identified. Conclusion The domains and domain architectures of most of the bacterial STYKs identified are very different from the known domain organisation in STYKs of eukaryotes. This observation highlights distinct biological roles of bacterial STYKs compared to eukaryotic STYKs. Bacterial STYKs reveal high diversity in domain organisation. Some of the modular organisations conserved across diverse bacterial species suggests their central role in bacterial physiology. Unique domain architectures of few other groups of STYKs reveal recruitment of functions specific to the species. </p...|$|R
