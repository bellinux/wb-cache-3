40|$|Phytosanitary {{regulations}} {{and the provision}} of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> still rely mainly on long and laborious culture-based methods of diagnosis, which are frequently inconclusive. DNA-based methods of detection can circumvent many of the limitations of currently used screening methods, allowing a fast and accurate monitoring of samples. The genus Xanthomonas includes 13 phytopathogenic quarantine organisms for which improved methods of diagnosis are needed. In this work, we propose 21 new Xanthomonas-specific molecular markers, within loci coding for Xanthomonas-specific protein domains, useful for DNA-based methods of identification of xanthomonads. The specificity of these markers was assessed by a dot blot hybridization array using 23 non-Xanthomonas species, mostly soil dwelling and/or phytopathogens for the same host plants. In addition, the validation of these markers on 15 Xanthomonas spp. suggested species-specific hybridization patterns, which allowed discrimination among the different Xanthomonas species. Having in mind that DNA-based methods of diagnosis are particularly hampered for unsequenced species, namely, Xanthomonas fragariae, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, and Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. fuscans, for which comparative genomics tools to search for DNA signatures are not yet applicable, emphasis was given to the selection of informative markers able to identify X. fragariae, X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli, and X. fuscans subsp. fuscans strains. In order to avoid inconsistencies due to operator-dependent interpretation of dot blot data, an image-processing algorithm was developed to analyze automatically the dot blot patterns. Ultimately, the proposed markers and the dot blot platform, coupled with automatic data analyses, have the potential to foster a thorough monitoring of phytopathogenic xanthomonads...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to map the distribution of pork retail outlets as well as assess their role in food borne disease transmission. Using a structured questionnaire, practices associated with hygiene related to infrastructure, workers, and equipment were assessed. Sources of pork were assessed to determine whether pork had undergone inspection, as were socio economic determinants of hygiene outcomes and risk factors for foodborne disease. There were 158 pork outlets in the five divisions of Kampala. Overall, 68 % of the pork was from places where slaughtering was not authorized (ungazetted) and meat inspection not carried out. Worker hygiene score was highest (average 71 %), followed by infrastructure (68. 2 %) and equipment (47. 3 %). There was a significant relation between good hygiene and the presence of a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> However only 42 % of the outlets had a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> Holding a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate</b> is an important predictor of good practices.

5000|$|However, {{since this}} {{did little to}} reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to {{consider}} prostitution as a necessary evil {{that had to be}} tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special <b>health</b> <b>certificates.</b> In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of [...] "free love" [...] without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married.

40|$|The United Kingdom has a {{long history}} of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> {{programs}} and policies. The first legislation granting direct statutory authority (at that point to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) for <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> protection was the Destructive Insects Act of 1877, which had the objective of preventing the introduction and establishment of the Colorado Beetle. Early <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy was aimed at specific pests considered to be of particular concern due to the potential damage and the apparent threat of entry. Some measures were created for specific pests but then expanded to include other species of concern. The current European-wide programme incorporates a notification and pest management regime for over 472 harmful organisms that have entered into European Union (EU) 1 jurisdiction 2. Most countries have followed a similar course of focusing a <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy on pests of particular concern, and eventually creating more general authorities and methodologies for protecting national <b>plant</b> <b>health.</b> In the United Kingdom, the <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Act is the primary legislative vehicle for ensuring the sound delivery of optimal <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy.

Drawing on a Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) -funded project on the growing risk of plant diseases in the UK, current and future challenges to <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> are discussed. It is well recognized that farmers {{have an important role}} in shaping <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policies at a time of major structural changes in agricultural industries. However, the role of consumers has also much potential to improve sustainability of plant disease management options. The phytosanitary legislation is catching up with the many recent developments in <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> but needs to be integrated with policies aimed at achieving animal and human health. Interdisciplinary approaches in research on <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> as well as an increasing involvement of stakeholders in the management of plant epidemics, are to be welcomed. Plant diseases also influence (and are influenced by) land use and environmental regulations in general. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of new plant disease outbreaks, particularly when combined with globalization of trade, intensification of land use and structural evolution of the agricultural sector. To tackle the many challenges to <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> it is mandatory to ensure long-term funding for interdisciplinary <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> research and managemen...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer, an instrument to measure the general phytosanitary situation {{on a national level}} (Belgium) and on a yearly basis and to monitor its evolution over time, is described. The elaboration of a set of 13 <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> indicators (PHI’s) {{as the basis for the}} <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer is discussed. These indicators were weighted by experts - including scientists, policy makers and agroindustrial representatives - to determine their relative impact in the barometer. The result of the barometer is expressed as a comparison with the previous year. Based on the results of the 13 PHI’s, it is concluded that the general <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> in Belgium shows a positive evolution from 2007 until 2010 and a negative evolution from 2010 until 2012. The <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer provides a overview of the phytosanitary situation of plants and plant products in Belgium and is a tool to communicate in an intelligible, comprehensible manner on aspects of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> to consumers and professional stakeholders in the plant production chain. Together with the food safety barometer and the animal <b>health</b> barometer, the <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer is one of the three instruments to provide a overview on the general status of the safety of the food chain in Belgium.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSources of {{data used}} in France to {{routinely}} monitor vaccination coverage, {{such as the}} Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and school surveys, allow reliable estimations, but data are not made available with long delays. To rapidly identify recent changes, we have explored the feasibility and relevance of using vaccine reimbursement data. MethodsWe used the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries, {{a representative sample of}} the National Health Insurance Information System, which contains data on health spending reimbursement of {{the vast majority of the}} population. We first validated this new source by comparing measles vaccine coverage between Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries. We present herein the results on hepatitis B, meningococcal C, and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) coverage. ResultsMeasles vaccine coverage estimated with the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries (91. 4 %) is very close to the estimation obtained through Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> (90. 6 %). For children born in 2011, hepatitis B vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 88. 7 % for one dose and meningococcal vaccination coverage was 56. 4 % for one dose in December 2013. Of girls born in 1997, 20. 1 % had received the full HPV vaccination series on their 16 th birthday.
