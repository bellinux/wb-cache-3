The Pavilion is positioned in a heavy traffic area just a few feet north of the South Ferry (ferry) and next to the South Ferry - Whitehall Street (New York City Subway) making this a busy intersection that is crossed by approximately 70,000 residents and visitors on a daily basis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{family of}} {{machines}} known as [...] "Robinsons" [...] were {{built for the}} Newmanry. These used two paper tapes, along with logic circuitry, to find the settings of the χ <b>pin</b> <b>wheels</b> of the Lorenz machine. The Robinsons had major problems keeping the two paper tapes synchronized and were relatively slow, reading only 2000 characters per second.The most important machine was the Colossus of which ten were in use by the war's end, the first becoming operational in December 1943. Although not fully programmable, they were far more efficient than their predecessors, representing advances in electronic digital computers. The Colossus computers were developed and built by Tommy Flowers, of the Dollis Hill Post Office Research Station, using algorithms developed by W.T. Tutte {{and his team of}} mathematicians. Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine.|$|R
40|$|During field surveys, three peanut green mosaic virus {{isolates}} differing in symptomatology on groundnut and a {{few other}} hosts were collected. Ultrathin sections of infected groundnut leaflets showed cytoplasmic inclusions with <b>pin</b> <b>wheels</b> and scrolls. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay they reacted strongly with antisera to peanut green mosaic and soybean mosaic virus antisera, and moderately with adzuki bean mosaic and peanut stripe virus antisera. All isolates also reacted positively with antisera to peanut eye spot, blackeye cowpea mosaic, pea seed-borne mosaic, potato virus Y and tobacco etch viruses, and did not react with antisera to peanut mottle, bean yellow mosaic, bean common mosaic, clover yellow vein and sugarcane mosaic viruses. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified virus preparations of the three isolates showed a single polypeptide with mol. wt. of 34, 500 daltons.

50|$|A {{carriage}} control tape was a loop of punched tape {{that was used}} to synchronize rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A <b>pin</b> <b>wheel</b> moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|E
50|$|Some {{influential}} figures {{had doubts}} about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus {{did not have a}} stored program, and was programmed through plugboards and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz χ <b>pin</b> <b>wheel</b> settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an optical reader which, at 5000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons' and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper tape sprocket holes, completely eliminated the Robinsons' synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers's ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} the envelope theorem for the geometric design of a cycloidal speed reducer. Specifically, it proposes two designs for a mathematical model with tooth differences: a <b>pin</b> <b>wheel</b> epitrochoid meshing- which is a cycloidal wheel (internal rotor) profile equidistant to an epitrochoid (or extended epicycloid) curve and a cycloida! wheel is generated by a <b>pin</b> <b>wheel</b> (external rotor) - and a <b>pin</b> <b>wheel</b> hypotrochoid meshing. These two contrasting structures differ in their equidistance to the epitrochoid (or extended epicycloid) curve and hypotrochoid (or extended hypocycloid) curve. Using the design result parameters, the analysis also compares contact forces and assesses curvature to determine whether the cycloidal wheel has a non-undercutting or continuous condition...|$|E

5000|$|A trumpeter clock can {{be found}} in several {{different}} variations. The most common examples are known to collectors as a [...] "blowers" [...] or [...] "German buglers". These examples use a modified cuckoo type movement that produces a simple trumpet like call. Instead of using a wooden cuckoo pipe, these examples have small reed/horn assemblies. This varies from the large trumpeter clocks that use a large bellows system that feeds air into a wind chest.

40|$|This article investigates a {{mechanism}} to tolerate malicious nature of sequencer in moving sequencer based atomic broadcast in distributed systems. Various mechanisms are already given for moving sequencer based atomic broadcast like RMP [1], DTP [2], <b>Pin</b> <b>Wheel</b> [3] and mechanism proposed by Srivastava et al. [4]. But none of these mechanisms are efficient to tolerate different failure. Scholarly observation is that, these algorithms can tolerate only crash failure but not capable to tolerate omission or byzantine (malicious) failure. This work proposes {{a mechanism}} to tolerate byzantine failure (malicious nature) of sequencer in moving sequencer based atomic broadcast. The model and design refined model {{in order to fulfill}} objective. Since it relies on unicast broadcast hence it will introduce a very less number of messages in comparison to previous mechanisms [5]. B [6] formal technique has been used for development of this model and Pro B [7] model checker tool for constraint based checking to discover errors due to invariant violation and deadlocks, thereby, validating the specifications. The models have been verified for invariant violations, errors and deadlock occurrence. The B machine animated through Pro B worked very well.

Exames mais detalhados dessas bandas revelaram serem elas constituídas pela justaposição de lamelas delgadas (10 - 15 m¼ de espessura), as quais parecem eventualmente desprender-se e formar outros tipos de inclusão, como as de perfil {{circular}} e em forma de catavento, comumente associadas à infecção provocada por vírus do grupo Y da batata. Ocasionalmente, partículas do VMC foram observadas nas proximidades dessas inclusões. As dimensões das bandas densas atingiram até 0,l- 0, 2 ¼ x 3 - 4 ¼, visíveis mesmo em exames ao microscópio convencional. Além da ocorrência dessas inclusões, pôde também ser observada a presença de grande número de vesículas no citoplasma, aparentemente associadas a uma atividade do complexo de Golgi. A virus, inducing mosaic and malformation of carrot leaves (Daucus carota L.), {{was found}} in Piedade, SP. It was termed carrot mosaic virus (CMV), and is both mechanically and aphid transmitted. Morphologically {{it belongs to the}} potato virus Y group (15 m¼ x 740 m¼). Electron microscopic examination of thin sections of leaf tissues from carrot or coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) infected with CMV demonstrated the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions, usually in the form of dense bands. They could reach sizes up to 0. 2 ¼ x 4 ¼ and were detectable even under light microscopic examination. These bands, at higher magnification, showed to be built up of thin lamella (10 - 15 m¼ thick), closely apposed. Occasionally individual or group of lamella appeared to loose from the bands, producing other type of profile, such as <b>pin</b> <b>wheels</b> and rings. CMV particles were sometimes observed in the vicinity of these inclusions, often laying parallel to their surface. These inclusions are identical to those observed in tissues infected with other components of the potato Y virus group, and their detection seems to corroborate the previous inclusion of CMV in this group, basead on particle morphology. Besides these cytoplasmic inclusions, some cells contained a large number of vesicles in the cytoplasm, apparently associated with Golgi complex activity...|$|R

It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or French farthingale (called in England a bum roll) held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale.
