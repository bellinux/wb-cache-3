40|$|Many {{economic}} {{relationships are}} non-linear. Hence, when analysing economic data {{it is important}} to identify any non-linearity. The primary type of non-linearity examined by economists is the ARCH-class model. However, other types of non-linear processes may be expected in economic and financial data. One of these is the threshold-class autoregressive process. This paper finds that the power of standard ARCH <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> for detecting threshold type non-linearity is very poor under certain parameter specifications; and that ARCH may be 'detected' in a significant number of cases even though the true process is of the threshold class. Thus care should be taken when interpreting ARCH pre-tests in economic series that are likely to contain threshold boundaries. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{comparing}} two distributions, it {{is often}} helpful to learn at which quantiles or values there is a statistically significant difference. This provides more information than the binary "reject" or "do not reject" decision of a global goodness-of-fit test. Framing our question as multiple testing across the continuum of quantiles τ∈(0, 1) or values r∈R, we show that the Kolmogorov [...] Smirnov test (interpreted as a multiple testing procedure) achieves strong control of the familywise error rate. However, its well-known flaw of low sensitivity in the tails remains. We provide an alternative method that retains such strong control of familywise error rate while also having even sensitivity, i. e., equal pointwise type I error rates at each of n→∞ order statistics across the distribution. Our one-sample method computes instantly, using our new formula that also instantly computes goodness-of-fit p-values and uniform confidence bands. To improve power, we also propose stepdown and <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> that maintain control of the asymptotic familywise error rate. One-sample and two-sample cases are considered, as well as extensions to regression discontinuity designs and conditional distributions. Simulations, empirical examples, and code are provided.

Hence, based on social cognitive theory this study aims to identify the antecedents of moral disengagement by investigating the individual differences (gender and personality) and environmental influence (organizational ethical climate). ANCOVA and hierarchical regression were applied to test the hypotheses. There was a moderate gender difference in the level of moral disengagement between male and female employees.

One ad {{in each of the}} four behaviours was an expensive TAC ad ($A 200 000 or more). The testing procedure assessed respondents ’ self-reported impact of the ad on their future intentions to comply with the road safety behavior advocated in the ad. Just under 1000 appropriately screened motor vehicle drivers license holders were recruited via street intercept methods and randomly allocated to one of the twelve ad exposure conditions. The results showed that while the two best performing ads were highly dramatic TAC ads showing graphic crash scenes, these were also the most expensive ads to produce, and, being 60 and 90 s, the most expensive to air. In several cases, 30 s low cost talking heads testimonials performed equally as well as their far more expensive counterparts. We conclude that big production budgets may not be necessary to create effective road safety advertising. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study whether it is {{possible}} to gain power by pre-testing, and to give insight in when this occurs, to what extent and at which price. <b>Pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> consist of a preliminary test which tests a particular property of a given restricted model, followed by a main test for the main hypothesis regarding the parameter of interest. After acceptance by the preliminary test, a basic main test is used in the restricted model. If the preliminary test rejects,however, a more general main test is used which does not use prior information about the underlying distribution. The procedure is analyzed in the model against which the preliminary test protects. For classes of tests including the standard first order optimal tests, a transparent expression is given for the power and size difference of the pre-test procedure compared to the power and (correct) size of the second main test. This expression is based on second order asymptotics and gives qualitative and quantitative insight in the behavior of the procedure. It shows that substantial power gain, not merely due to size violation, is possible if the second main test really differs from the basic main test. The smaller the correlation between the two main tests, the larger the power gain...|$|E
40|$|The Effects of an Injury Prevention Program in an Aquatic Environment on Landing Technique Samantha E. Scarneo, University of Connecticut Context: Musculoskeletal and {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have accounted {{for a majority of}} sports and recreational related injuries and are of major concern to the physically active population. Injury prevention programs (IPP) have proven to improve landing technique, decreasing vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) resulting in injury risk reduction. Injury prevention programs in an aquatic-based environment may potentially elicit the same improvements as land-based programs. Objective: To examine the effects of a six week aquatic-based IPP on Landing Error Scoring System scores and VGRF. Design and Setting: All participants completed an aquatic-based IPP three times a week for six weeks in the pool. Participants: Participants were females, 163 centimeters or taller, able to swim, no LE injuries, and were screened to have poor landing technique (LESS-RT of 4 or more). Main Outcome Measures: Pre- and Post- test procedures including measuring landing technique was measured using the Landing Error Scoring System and VGRF. <b>Pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> were completed prior to program implementation.

This study assessed physicians' knowledge, attitude and perception of their role towards testing for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer. Design: A mail-in survey was sent to all general practitioners, internists, obstetrician-gynecologists and oncologists in private practice in Geneva county, Switzerland. Questions included socio-demographic variables, knowledge about hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, attitude towards testing and assessment of their role in the pre- and post-test procedure. Results: Two hundred fifty-nine (65 %) of four hundred questionnaires were returned of which two hundred forty-three (61 %) were analysed. Response rates were similar between specialties; women answered more frequently. The majority of the respondents (87 %) approved of genetic susceptibility testing. The most common objection to testing was the absence of approved strategies for the prevention and detection of early breast cancer. Most physicians felt they had an active part to play in the <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedure,</b> the disclosure of results, and especially the consultants' long-term care and support (99 %). Physicians correctly answered a third (32 %) of the knowledge questions. The abstention rate for individual items ranged from 13 % to 60 %. Scores varied by specialty. Oncologists were more knowledgeable than gynecologists, internists and general practitioners. Conclusions: The majority of the primary care physicians in this study have a favourable attitude and are ready to play a prominent role in genetic counseling and testing for breast-ovarian cancer predisposition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{prediction}} equation for peak oxygen uptake using the Modified BSU Ramp protocol. Thirty-four subjects (14 men and 20 women, age 32 - 83 years) completed the standard Ball State University Adult Physical Fitness Program quiet and exercise testing sessions, with the maximal exercise test conducted with the Modified BSU Ramp protocol. The modified ramp protocol increases speed and grade every 20 seconds, and it increases by - 0. 15 METs every increment for the first 6 minutes and [...] 0. 3 METs per increment thereafter. The Modified BSU ramp protocol was developed to allow for reasonable exercise test times from a standardized ramp protocol with individuals with low functional capacities < 10 METs. <b>Pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> included height and weight measurements, resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, body fat measures, a blood lipid profile, and resting electrocardiogram (ECG). Exercise testing included ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure that were recorded prior to, during, and in the recovery phase of exercise. Subjects were instructed to continue exercise until fatigue, and respiratory gases were collected to determine V 02. Data was then analyzed using multiple regression techniques. Gender, age, body weight, and treadmill test time were the significant predictors, which were used in the regression equation (R 2 = 0. 586, SEE = 3. 54 ml-kg-'. min'). An equation was developed from the lone predictor, treadmill test time with R 2 =. 37 and SEE = 4. 1 ml•kg'•min'. The equation is as follows: VOA = 4. 932 + 1. 934 (test time (min)). Of the tests conducted on the Modified BSU ramp protocol, 82 % were within an "ideal" test time window of 812 minutes, and 97 % were within an "acceptable" test time window of 6 - 15 minutes. In conclusion, VOA can be estimated with acceptable accuracy (i. e. SEE - ± I MET) from the Modified BSU Ramp protocol, and for clinical purposes it is a suitable protocol to use when testing low fit individuals. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the extent of burnout condition among counsellors in Kenya. The sources of burnout were explored and personality style {{was positively correlated with}} burnout development. Impact of burnout on counsellor wellness and productivity was also established. It examined whether counsellor supervision was an appropriate strategy in the management of counsellor burnout. The study utilized a pluralistic design that combined both qualitative and quantitative methods (Howard, 1983). The qualitative design permitted collection of rich data from study subjects' experiential and perceptual fields. This ensured study findings would be relevant and applicable to specific counsellor situations. The study population comprised 20 counsellors and 9 Kenya Counselling Association (KCA) accredited counsellor supervisors. The counsellor sample was drawn from 2 Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) centres, 2 rehabilitation centres and 2 educational institutions. This diverse population was a helpful representation in terms of generalizability of the study. Three data collection instruments utilized were: Questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The study's validity and reliability were ensured through the two sample populations (counsellor and counsellor supervisors), test re-test and <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedures</b> for questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Tallying identified items checked content validity. The study findings showed that burnout seriously affected practitioner effectiveness and led to malpractice and client harm. The study predictably established that supervision is an appropriate strategy in the management of counsellor burnout. The metaphor of motor vehicle maintenance was utilized {{in the development of the}} Holistic Burnout Supervision Model (HBSM) that focussed on wellness maintenance of the counsellor in a lifecycle. HBSM identified two levels in wellness maintenance: Preventative (servicing) and curative (repair). The study recommended that counselor - training institutions should incorporate in their curriculum burnout and supervision modules. This would create awareness about burnout and appropriate prevention strategies at counsellor formation stages. People care agencies should also institutionalize the burnout supervision facility in order to ensure counsellor resiliency and vitality. PsychologyD. Phil (Psychology...|$|E
40|$|Establishing the {{reproducibility}} of {{a measurement}} {{is essential for}} repeated testing to ensure that any systematic change {{is a result of}} an external influence (i. e. intervention), as oppossed to normal random variation. Although some degree of error is inherent in any measure, a measurement tool should yield consistent results that do not fluctuate to an unacceptable degree from one test to another. Creatine kinase (CK) is consistently measured in the blood as a marker of exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD). However, its usefulness as a predictive tool to examine the temporal pattern, and magnitude of muscle damage has been questioned. PURPOSE:The main aim {{of the present study was}} to employ a variety of reproducibility statistics in order to examine the typical level of measurement error for CK. METHODS: Fifty (36 male, 14 female), apparently healthy participants completed three trials on three separate occasions with each trial separated by 48 - 72 h. The initial trial served as a familiarisation. During trials 2 and 3 (48 h), CK measures were obtained using standard fingerprick technique, and analysed in duplicate immediatley using a colorimetric assay procedure. Each participant completed their trials at the same time of day, following identical <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedures.</b> RESULTS: The intra-test coefficient of variation (CV) within our laboratory was 9 %. Dependent t-tests indicated there was no systematic bias between trials (p = 0. 82). The interdian CV displayed low reproducibility (20 %). Furthermore, the 95 % limits of agreement (LoA) were - 69. 7 to 63. 5 iµ/L. However, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0. 90, which can be clasified as displaying ‘high’ reproducibility. CONCLUSION: The interdian CV demonstrates that under identical resting conditions (48 h apart), CK displays inherent low absoulte reproducibility, which may obscure a true experimental effect. However, interpretation of the ICC, suggests that CK has high relative reproducibility. The high range of observed CK values is thought to have increased the size of the correlation. Subsequently, an indivdual change in CK following EIMD may not be indicative of the magnitude of damage, and may simply be a result of the inherent variation (e. g. biological). Therefore, it is advised that caution should be taken when using CK within experimental research, and as an indication of when an athlete has recovered, and is able to recommence training...|$|E

40|$|Everyday {{communication}} occurs mostly through speech, thus learners {{who have}} little or no functional speech (LNFS) need to augment their communication by using additional communication strategies to ensure that they are able to participate in the interaction process. The use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) can and should {{play an important role in}} assisting learners with LNFS to access information and services and to communicate. Graphic symbols form an important part of most AAC users’ communication systems. Therefore studies which focus on increasing understanding of the way different graphic symbols are learnt and retained by children and adults, are pivotal for a better understanding of the processes involved in graphic symbol learning. Iconicity and learnability of symbols are two important factors to consider when choosing an appropriate graphic symbol set/system. The purpose of the current study was to determine how accurately typically developing urban, 6 -year-old Afrikaans-speaking children could firstly, identify 16 PCS presented thematically on a commercially available communication overlay, and secondly, recognize these symbols following exposure to a learning experience. Forty-six participants, divided into 2 cohorts, were each presented with 16 copies of a 16 -matrix overlay and required to match a symbol with a spoken Afrikaans label. The participants were then divided into two groups, one group receiving training in the meaning of the symbols and the other group receiving no training. Finally the test-procedure was repeated with the cohorts. The results indicated that the 16 PCS symbols had an iconicity of between 12. 5 % (accuracy score > 50 %) and 25 % (accuracy score > 75 %) for the combined group. Results further indicated a significant improvement in both the experimental and the control groups’ post-test results. The significant difference between the two groups’ post-test results does, however, indicate that the experimental group recognized more symbols during the post-test administration than the control group and they had thus benefited from the training session. The control group’s better post-test results can be attributed to the single exposure through the <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedure.</b> The participants made use of the information afforded them by the postural cues implying motion. They did not, however, make full use of the arrow cues or the direction of the arrows, which also implied motion. Once the participants of the experimental group were made aware of the arrows, they seemed to use the information the arrows offered to help them remember the symbol meanings during the post-test procedure.

A particular {{attention is paid to}} the theoretical basis of helicopter vibrations, definition of working frequency, regime and profile of flight during the test. The results of the vibration measurement are shown in the frequency domain. Introduction Nowadays, possibility of defining loads and vibrations {{is one of the most}} important requests in the design and modification of processes on helicopters. The loads occuring on the main rotor during flight are the basic source of vibrations on the helicopter. Possibilities to satisfy international standards in the area of structural and human vibrations are based on continuous and adequate measurement and analysis of the vibration levels on all elements of helicopters. This paper shows the procedures of vibration measuring and analyzing in order to define efficiency of vibration damping using a modern acquisition system NetdB 12 and its software dBFA Suite. Theoretical analysis of vibration sources on the helicopter main rotor The helicopter rotor operates in a complex aerodynamic flow field. The aerodynamic loads on the rotor blade vary considerably as it moves around the rotor disc, and in steady flight these loads are periodic. A particular attention is paid to a theoretical basis of vibration sources on a helicopter. A complex aerodynamic field in the plane of the helicopter main rotor during different profiles of flight is shown and explained. This part of the paper gives the equations of force and moments on the main rotor with the aim to define basic working frequencies. Sources of vibrations and the determination of working frequencies on the gazelle helicopter The sources of vibrations on the Gazelle helicopter (main rotor, tail rotor and engine) are described as well as the vibration transfer from the sources to the structure through the helicopter transmission and the structure as a receiver of vibrations. The working frequencies of the Gazelle helicopter are defined and the causes for avoiding the low vibration frequency range are explained. Methodology and procedure of vibration testing on the gazelle helicopter The procedure of vibration testing has a few steps (pre-test, test and post test step), given in Fig. 5. After the determination of working frequencies and the testing point, the next step is selecting test equipment and installment of the accelerometers and other probes. After these preparations, the last step in the <b>pre-test</b> <b>procedure</b> is choosing the flight profiles in which the vibrations are measured. The results of testing and analysis of vibration damping at the structure - pilot seat connecting point The testing results are collected in the test phase. The results of the vibration measurement are shown in the time and frequency domain for the chosen flight conditions of the Gazelle helicopter. The results are given for two profiles of flight (for acceleration and for the left and right turn). The analysis must give an answer about the efficiency of vibration damping at the structure - pilot seat connecting point. The conclusions must not be ambiguous and must give enough elements for making a decision about subsequent actions. Vibration levels of in the acceleration phase For this phase of flight, all helicopter flight parameters are recorded and given as a function of time (velocity, altitude, drift of commands, loads und angular velocity) while the vibrations are given in the frequency domain. The vibrations at the tested connecting point are analyzed in the function of velocity, followed by the conclusions and comments about the level of vibrations in the phase of acceleration. Level of vibrations during the left and the right turn For this profile of flight, the frequency spectrum for both turns is given and the fundamental difference in that spectrum is explained. The analysis of these two turns reveals the increase of the vibration level at the test point at a particular frequency. Conclusion The illustrated methodology and the procedures of measuring and analyzing the low-frequency vibration range on the Gazelle helicopter can be applied for all types of aircraft which are in operational use in the Serbian Air Forces. The shown procedure can be used for measuring and analyzing vibrations on all elements of helicopter systems, aiming at meeting international standards, continuous system developing, modifying technical systems and detecting potential failure elements in the systems in operational service...|$|R

DESIGN: thematic analysis of narrative interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: sample recruited nationally for two wider studies of experiences of antenatal screening (n= 47) and experiences of ending a pregnancy for fetal abnormality (n= 40). Of these, 31 women had experienced amniocentesis and/or CVS at least once. FINDINGS: most women found the procedures less painful than expected. A smaller group were shocked or surprised at the sensation, and were worried that they had jumped and that the needle might have damaged the baby. A few found it very painful, using vivid imagery of being stabbed or punctured. However, even those who found it worse than expected felt {{it was worth the}} pain to get a definite diagnosis. Women identified a range of factors affecting their experience, including levels of anxiety, prior experience or knowledge of the procedures, levels of information provided, trust in the skill of the operator, or reassurance and empathy of the staff involved.

40|$|International audiencePersonal agency {{within the}} area of {{learning}} may be construed as a process wherein learning objectives are achieved through volitional direction and tacit involvement in learning. Within the present study, perceived agency {{is the degree to}} which learners believe that the efforts they are putting into the language-learning process is sufficient with respect to the learning objective. Some learners assume that attending classes assiduously generates an entitlement to pass the course, thereby believing that the learning goal has been achieved. In other words, their perc eption is that they have displayed a high degree of agency in spite of what may sometimes prove to be a very low degree of personal involvement. Behaviours of this type are observed regularly among French learners of English in university language courses. This article reports on a study that investigated agency and motivation among second language university learners in a large research university in eastern France.

40|$|Mathematical {{finite element}} models (FEMs) of {{spacecraft}} are relied upon for the prediction of loads experienced during launch and flight events. It is essential that the spacecraft is able to survive the launch environment without sustaining damage which could inhibit its ability {{to carry out its}} mission. Therefore, ensuring that these FEMs give a realistic representation of the physical spacecraft structural dynamics is an important task. To achieve a high level of confidence in the FEM in question, a correlation activity is conducted. This is the process of applying various metrics to compare computational results, from analysis of the FEM, with corresponding data derived from measurements taken of the physical hardware during vibration testing. Subsequently, updates are applied to the FEM where necessary to achieve an acceptable level of correlation. It is possible for spacecraft FEM correlation exercises to take a considerable amount of time and effort without necessarily achieving an appreciable improvement in the final FEM. As such, this project has been conducted to address the need to ensure that the procedures being applied are as effective and efficient as possible. Various aspects of the spacecraft FEM correlation process have been investigated separately, and interactions between the different stages in the process have also been considered. Two large, unique, scientific spacecraft have been used as example applications in order to carry out these studies. As well as making use of computational results from the spacecraft FEMs, this project has also included comparisons to the results from the corresponding base-shake sine-sweep test campaigns conducted on these structures. A number of noteworthy, and industrially beneficial, findings relating to the effectiveness of the spacecraft FEM correlation process have resulted from these studies: the most appropriate techniques of modal parameter estimation for the considered spacecraft applications have been established; the potential benefits and relative merits of different <b>pre-test</b> sensor placement <b>procedures</b> have been explored; inaccuracies introduced {{through the use of a}} commonly applied FEM reduction method have been demonstrated and a superior alternative identified. In addition, the efficiency of the correlation and update process has also been addressed. This has mainly been achieved through investigations concerning the applicability of commonly used target mode selection criteria to spacecraft applications, and the potential benefits of a less widely applied method which takes into consideration the expected loading scenarios to be experienced by the considered structures...|$|R

Detonation gun coatings of tungsten carbide have been widely recognised {{as one of the}} most effective anti-wear coatings for oilfield applications. However, very little fundamental tribological information exists for the material, which hinders coating development and the evolution of correct specifications. This study redresses this problem by conducting adhesive, abrasive and erosive tests upon the coating and relating the findings to the coated microstructure. The intention has been to simulate the in-service behaviour of parallel gate valves, which are used primarily to control flow in remote locations where reliability and freedom from maintenance are essential. Although problems with such valves are rare, costs associated with replacement are exceptionally high and therefore a high research priority has been placed on valves of this type. Currently, new designs of valve are tested using a pipe loop rig at BP Research Centre. However, such tests are both expensive and time consuming and with the increasing desire to bring products to market more quickly an alternative is sought. Probably, the area offering most scope for improvement is in material specification of the sealing surfaces and this work sets out to produce a first stage selection procedure for candidate materials. Uniquely, the study has taken one component, systematically categorised its failure mechanisms using non-destructive replication techniques and then reproduced them in the laboratory. The failure analysis has pointed to three-body abrasion, erosion and adhesion being the dominant failure modes and therefore, a suite of tribo-test methods have been developed to replicate them These are namely reciprocating diamond-on-flat, slurry erosion and reciprocating pin-on-plate tests. The material studied was a proprietary detonation gun coating of tungsten carbide, LW 45, which is currently the most popular seal facing material specified for gate valves. A conformal contact geometry was chosen for the reciprocating pin-on-plate tests and problems with alignment were overcome by using a <b>pre-test</b> running-in <b>procedure</b> with 1 μm metallographic paste. Wear of LW 45 occurring during the pin-on-plate test was not affected by test speed over the range selected, but was highly dependent upon load. Four different categories ranging from minimal wear to catastrophic wear have been identified. Extensive post test analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy has further classified the failure that occurs into two groups, termed mild and severe. In the mild regime wear occurs by preferential removal of the binder phase, which is minimised on further sliding by protruding carbide particles. Eventually sufficient binder is removed for carbide fall-out to occur, upon which the cycle is repeated. A greater wear volume is produced by the severe wear mechanism which is caused by the interlinking of cracks present within the microstructure of the coating. To ensure operation in the mild regime, continuous sliding under operating pressures of above 7. 84 MPa should be avoided. Abrasive wear simulated by the diamond-on-flat test increased with load. However, the failure mechanisms produced were independent of load and consist of a combination of plastic deformation and brittle fracture with plastic deformation representing the rate controlling step in the wear process. Slurry erosion tests have shown that LW 45 wears by a brittle erosive mechanism and is therefore best able to resist erosion at low impingement angles. The volume loss per particle impact for LW 45 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the impinging particles. The failure mechanism involved the growth of cracks in the microstructure by a fatigue action eventually leading to crack interlinking and material fall out. For all wear conditions, it is suggested that the removal of microcracking from the coating microstructure will lead to significant improvements in wear performance. A simplified design guide has been produced that gives a weighted importance to the various failure modes attributable to the respective tests. A significant improvement in performance was recorded by LW 45 in comparison to typical substrate materials such as AISI 410 and Ferralium F 255 stainless steels. SER...|$|R
