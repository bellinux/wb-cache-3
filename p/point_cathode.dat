40|$|When {{the tip of}} a <b>point</b> <b>cathode</b> is locally heated by a laser or {{electron}} beam irradiation to a high temperature below the melting point, the cathode can be operated at a fairly high emission current density {{for a long period of}} time because the cathode evaporation is locally confined to the tip. The temperature distribution and the shape variation of a straightened tungsten wire cathode are examined with a numerical method under different heating conditions. When a portion of the conical tip of the cathode is kept at a constant high temperature, evaporation occurs from the cone apex, although the portion is near the cone base. During evaporation, the tip maintains a conical shape, and the apex temperature is nearly constant. The same results are obtained when an incident heat energy is given in a large area of the cathode tip. There are large allowances in the heating position and area, which promise a long lifetime of the cathode. Numerical method and results are described.

40|$|Electrical {{breakdown}} in {{air in a}} point-plane topology involves complex processes that are still not fully understood. Unlike uniform-field topologies, the highly-divergent fields produced by point-plane topologies create pre-breakdown corona with volumetric space charge. It is known that space charges developed by corona discharge have significant impacts on the breakdown voltage in non-uniform electrode topologies. With large inter-electrode gaps (>cm) the breakdown voltage for a HV <b>point</b> <b>cathode</b> in air at atmospheric pressure is noticeably larger than a HV point anode. However, this paper shows that in shorter point-plane gaps in air (less than ~ 10 mm), in the air pressure range 0. 1 - 0. 35 MPa, an HV point anode has a similar breakdown voltage which eventually is surpassed by the HV <b>point</b> <b>cathode</b> as the inter-electrode gap is increased.

40|$|Effects of electron-attaching and electron-releasing {{additives}} in cyclohexane on {{the initiation}} and propagation {{of positive and}} negative non-breakdown streamers have been studied qualitatively and quantitatively. Fast impulses (< 20 ns, < 40 kV) were applied to the plane electrode of a 10 mm point-to-plane gap and studied by shadowgraphic imaging and a 0. 1 pC sensitive differential charge measurement technique. The additives studied are 1, 1 -difluorocyclopentane, perylene, perfluoromethylcyclohexane, perfluoro- 1 -heptene, trichloroethene, perfluoro- n -hexane, 1, 4 -benzoquinone, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1 -methylnaphthalene,di- n -propylether, toluene, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -butene, indole, N, N -dimethylaniline,tetramethyl- p -phenylenediamine and tetrakis-dimethylamino-ethylene. The characteristic of the additives. Electron-attaching additives facilitate the propagation of negative streamers, whereas the most effective electronreleasing additives reduce initiation voltages and facilitate the propagation of positive streamers. Depending on the reactivity and concentration of the additives, streamer filaments become thinner and fewer while propagating faster and further. 1, 1 -difluorocyclopentane is the only additive without a measurable effect in either point polarity. The results follow expectations, considering <b>point</b> <b>cathode</b> streamers to be governed mainly by injection of epithermal electrons from a gaseous phase, and point anode streamers to be governed mainly by more energetic (hot) electrons, extracted from the liquid at higher electric fields. The Townsend–Meek theory for streamer inception in gases has been adapted to a solution and applied to analyze the voltage dependence of the positive streamer propagation. Results show a quantitative dependency on the ionization potential and additive concentration in agreement with experimental trends. This implies that electron avalanches in the liquid phase are responsible for a particularly fast propagation mode. The fast mode extends from initiation until terminated by a slower mode which is not affected by the additives. Transient conduction currents of measurable magnitudes in the nano- to microampere range are observed for voltages around initiation for both point polarities, and may be induced by ions left behind by the avalanches that are not sufficiently developed to initiate streamers.   In another part of this thesis work, the time-averaged optical emission from fast, filamentary, and luminous positive and negative streamers in chlorocarbons liquids under pulsed divergent field conditions have been studied. The liquids were dichloromethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, tetrachloromethane, trichloroethene, and tetrachloroethene. Light emitted from the first 10 – 15 μm trail of a few thousand streamers were accumulated. Atomic lines of hydrogen, chlorine and carbon as well as excited states of C 2 radicals (Swan bands) have been observed, and with sufficient resolution for evaluating line and band-shapes. The characteristic broadening, shift and asymmetry of atomic lines varied significantly between the liquids. Differences between the two streamer polarities were comparatively small. Densities of electrons and neutrals in the illuminated phase have been deduced from broadening of atomic lines, atomic excitation temperatures from absolute line intensities, and rotational and vibrational temperatures from the Swan bands. The gas densities of the propagating streamers were generally very high (~ 10 % of critical) and {{with a high degree of}} ionization (~ 1 ‰). Dichloromethane and 1, 2 -dichloroethane produced re-illuminating streamers with densities close to atmospheric conditions, in agreement with a rapid pressure relaxation. Rotational temperatures were high and in the range 2 x 103 – 6 x 103 K for the different liquids. Results can be interpreted to suggest a partial local thermodynamic equilibrium in the streamer plasmas. It is believed that the high pressure and the high electron density help equilibrate the temperatures of the various particles. The energy-consumption and qualitative chemical composition of the illuminated phase are similar to that of an equivalent system in complete thermodynamic equilibrium.           PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} stray currents on durability and reinforcement corrosion of underground concrete structures. Cathodic protection of underground pipelines are stationary sources of stray current interference with concrete, and rail traction systems are non-stationary sources. The soil is the electrolyte that conducts stray current to the concrete structure and absorbs current from it. The current passes through the concrete cover at entry <b>points</b> (<b>cathodes),</b> via the reinforcement and again through the cover at exit points (anodes). Polarization of steel occurs at these points. Anodic polarization can break down the normal passivation of steel in concrete and initiate corrosion. A quantitative model for this mechanism is proposed. An empirical relationship was derived from literature data relating the time to initiation of corrosion to the anodic current density and the chloride content of the concrete. At chloride contents below 0. 4 % by mass of cement, corrosion may be initiated {{in a year or}} less by exit currents of 1 A/m 2 or higher. At chloride contents of 0. 4 % or higher, the initiation time for 1 A/m 2 is short (days). For lower current densities, extrapolating from the experimental results is necessary. The distribution of current between concrete elements and soil can be calculated from geometrical considerations and their resistivities. Inside the concrete, the cathodic steel surface may be larger than the anodic surface. The cathode/anode ratio constitutes a concentration factor which may be between 1 and 100. If the soil contains chloride ions, migration of chloride into the concrete at anodic sites may further reduce the time to initiation of corrosion. The empirical model was applied to a bored tunnel lining segment. Critical (cathodic) stray current densities were calculated for a (mean) initiation time of 100 years, depending on the initial chloride content. The time between initiation of corrosion and cracking of concrete is relatively short (days). The time to complete dissolution of reinforcing bars may be as short as days for high stray current densities or as long as decades for low current densities. The results indicate that stray current interference is significant with regard to durability of underground concrete structures and should be further studie...|$|R

The route to ever higher coating speeds is complicated in that layers coated at high rates have a marked columnar structure. This makes them unsuitable for many applications. The effect {{is caused by}} the low energy of the vapor particles with EBHD.

However, the reverse current is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the reverse current on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed.

The ratio between the current density at {{the part of the}} cathode nearest to the anode and the one furthest away were taken as a measure for the estimation of the current density distribution.

Also, the distribution should be better under total activation control or total diffusion control rather than at mixed activation-diffusion-Ohmic control of the deposition process. On the contrary, changes in the exchange current density should not affect it. These results, being in agreement with common knowledge about the influence of different parameters on the current distribution in an electrochemical cell, demonstrate that a quick estimation of the current distribution can be performed by a simple comparison of the current density at the <b>point</b> of the <b>cathode</b> closest to anode with that at furthest point...|$|R

If the glow discharge seen in the gas of Crookes tubes was produced by the moving cathode rays, the light radiated from them in the direction they were moving, down the tube, would be shifted in frequency due to the Doppler effect. This could be detected with a spectroscope because the emission line spectrum would be shifted. He built a tube shaped like an [...] "L", with a spectroscope pointed through {{the glass of the}} elbow down one of the arms. He measured the spectrum of the glow when the spectroscope was <b>pointed</b> toward the <b>cathode</b> end, then switched the power supply connections so the cathode became the anode and the electrons were moving in the other direction, and again observed the spectrum looking for a shift. He did not find one, which he calculated meant that the rays were traveling very slowly. It is now recognized that the glow in Crookes tubes is emitted from gas atoms hit by the electrons, not the electrons themselves. Since the atoms are thousands of times more massive than the electrons, they move much slower, accounting for the lack of Doppler shift.|$|R
40|$|Scannerless (flash) {{lidar system}} based on streak camera is able to realize {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) multi-spectral fluorescence imaging and 3 D imaging polarimetry. Compared with conventional lidar system, the flash lidar system overcomes image distortions caused by the motion between the target and the sensor platform. Other advantages of the flash lidar system are higher image update rates {{and the potential for}} creating a miniaturized lidar system. To meet the requirements for developing this new technology, a super small-sized, large photocathode area and meshless streak tube with spherical cathode and screen is designed with the aid of computer simulation technology (CST) software. The tube with nearly 28 mm wide photocathode work area contains two electrostatic focusing lens, a pair of deflection plates, and a 50 mm diameter output screen. The external dimension of the tube is merely 50 mm x 100 mm. And its electromagnetic fields are calculated in the CST Particle Studio based on the finite integration theory. Some dynamic properties of the tube are analyzed via observing different electron trajectories launched from a number of different <b>points</b> on the <b>cathode.</b> The influences of the deflector position on deflection sensitivity and spatial resolution are analyzed. Increasing the distance between the deflector and the anode pin hole leads to a worse deflection sensitivity but a better spatial resolution. As for the temporal resolution, three electron pulses separated by 30 ps can be well resolved by the streak tube in the dynamic mode. Thus, the dynamic temporal resolution of the streak tube is better than 30 ps. And a 10 lp/mm spatial resolution across the 28 mm long slit on the photocathode can be obtained by estimating modulation transfer functions of the electron trajectories. Temporal distortions at the entire photocathode working area are evaluated, and the data reveal that the larger the photocathode working area, the bigger the temporal distortions are. Also, the temporal distortion is present mainly in the photocathode-to-deflection plates region. In addition, the slit image of the streak tube working in the dynamic mode is simulated and presented. The phenomenon that the slit image is curved due to the temporal distortion is analyzed. Two rectangular electron pulses separated by 50 ps are well resolved by the streak tube. Therefore, the temporal resolution of this small-size steak tube is better than 50 ps with a rectangular slit dimension of 30 mm x 50 mu m on the photocathode, and its electron-optic magnification is 1. 2...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} theoretical and experimental studies on an argon-fed multichannel hollow cathode. In particular, it investigates the physical processes which take place inside the hollow cavity. These include the cathode voltage drop, the surface temperature and the plasma penetration depth. An {{insight into the}} ignition mechanisms is outlined as well. Moreover, the erosion process is studied by measuring the erosion rate of the cathode walls after continuous operations at fixed mass flow rate and discharge current. Thus, this research {{is divided into two}} main activities: the experimental campaign and the theoretical study. For the experimental study, a multichannel hollow cathode with a main tube inner diameter of 10 mm and 36 rods was designed. It was tested at discharge currents in the range 20 - 160 A and at mass flow rates between 1 and 5 mg/s. It was propelled with argon gas. In order to identify the nominal operative <b>points,</b> the <b>cathode</b> underwent a characterization test which was followed by an endurance test at continuous operations for 100 hours. This test aimed at understanding the erosion mechanism of the cathode. Then, a second characterization test was performed, which permitted to assess the effect of the erosion on the cathode performance. The cathode surface temperature was measured at different values of discharge current and mass flow rate. The measurements were gathered by using an optical pyrometer that was mounted outside the vacuum chamber. Temperature profiles with respect to the cathode axis are presented. It was found that the surface temperature of the multichannel hollow cathode is different from that in the single channel hollow cathode, since the maximum value is placed at the cathode exit cross section for all operative conditions. The ignition process of the cathode was investigated. The cathode was capable to sustain a discharge current of 20 A with a few channels ignited. In addition, it was noted that a specic discharge current value exists to ignite all channels. This value is considered as the transition point between the multi-step ionization process and the single-step ionization process. However, since a plasma diagnostic system was not available during the experimental campaign, this hypothesis cannot be proved in this study. In addition, an insight into the design and manufacture of the multichannel hollow cathode is given. The design procedure is outlined, as well as the method for scaling-down the cathode dimensions. The assembly process is described with a focus on the technical issues that were solved. The second part of this research deals with two theoretical models which were developed and validated with the experimental data. The first model {{is the product of a}} joint research programme between the RIAME-MAI and Alta. It can be adapted to multichannel hollow cathodes with an indefinite number of channels. Cathode operative parameters such as the cathode voltage drop and the surface temperature are calculated. In addition, the model is capable to predict the main plasma parameters: the electron and ion temperatures, the particles number density and the plasma potential. The results are provided as functions of the cathode axial coordinate. Furthermore, the erosion rate of the cathode is computed for each cross section, thus providing the effective channel erosion along its length. The second numerical model was developed during the experimental campaign and represents a valid basis for future improvements. It is a mono-dimensional code, therefore the multichannel hollow conguration is studied by adapting the plasma penetration length in case of many channels to a single channel hollow conguration. The model is capable to predict the discharge voltage and the surface temperature as functions of the cathode axis. However, it requires the discharge current profile as an input.

Weir 1, FACSM 1 University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of {{the brain}} {{has been shown to}} have {{profound}} effects on many physiological and psychological processes, including effects on the autonomic nervous system and fatigue. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects tDCS on parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system modulation and their influence on a maximum effort fatiguing exercise protocol. METHODS: Twenty recreationally active subjects (10 male; 10 female) volunteered to participate in this study. Each individual visited the lab on four occasions. The first visit was a familiarization visit. Visits two through four consisted of a sham treatment, an anodal parasympathetic stimulation treatment, and an anodal sympathetic stimulation treatment, in random order. The subjects sat in a dark, quiet environment for 30 -min while receiving the appropriate stimulation. The anode was placed on the T 3 area, equidistant between the ear and the CZ <b>point,</b> while the <b>cathode</b> was placed on the contralateral side of the skull, just supraorbital. Following stimulation, the subject completed 50 maximum intensity isokinetic (Biodex medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, New York) leg extensions at an angular velocity of 180 °s- 1, followed my passive flexion. Autonomic modulation was quantified using time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability. The data were analyzed using 1 x 3 repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: For the heart rate variability data there were no significant effects for high frequency power (F 1. 8, 33. 2 = 0. 80, p = 0. 44, Eta 2 = 0. 04), low frequency power (F 1. 9, 35. 4 = 0. 98, p = 0. 38, Eta 2 = 0. 05), inter-beat interval (F 1. 8, 35. 0 = 0. 58, p = 0. 55, Eta 2 = 0. 03), root mean square of successive differences (F 2. 0, 38. 0 = 1. 32, p = 0. 28, Eta 2 = 0. 07), variance (F 2. 0, 38. 0 = 1. 69, p = 0. 20, Eta 2 = 0. 08), or SD- 1 (F 2. 0, 38. 0 = 1. 32, p = 0. 28, Eta 2 = 0. 07). Likewise, there was no significant effect of tDCS on mean torque (F 2. 0, 37. 5 = 0. 73, p = 0. 49, Eta 2 = 0. 04) or peak torque (F 2. 0, 38. 0 = 0. 22, p = 0. 80, Eta 2 = 0. 01). CONCLUSION: In contrast to previously published studies, the results of this study showed no effects of tDCS on cardiovascular autonomic modulation or fatigue during high intensity exercise. Discrepancies between these results and other studies may be due to differences in stimulation protocol, brain area of stimulation, and/or exercise modality...|$|R
