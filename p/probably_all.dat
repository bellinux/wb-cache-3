5|$|The {{historical}} {{question of}} whether Jefferson {{was the father of}} Hemings' children is known as the Jefferson–Hemings controversy. Following renewed historic analysis in the late 20th century and a 1998 DNA study that found a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Hemings' last son, Eston Hemings, there is a near-consensus among historians that Jefferson fathered her son Eston Hemings and <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> her children. A small number of historians disagree.|$|E

5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago. They made {{most of the}} engravings and <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> the paintings. 2,000 to 2,500 years ago the Khoikhoi, an ethnic group related to the San (Bushmen), occupied the valley, then known under its Damara/Nama name ǀUi-ǁAis (jumping waterhole). The Khoikhoi also produced rock art which can clearly be distinguished from the older engravings.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. <b>Probably</b> <b>all</b> these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
5|$|Molecular dating {{indicates}} the caballoid lineage diverged from the non-caballoids 4 mya. Genetic {{results suggest that}} all North American fossils of caballine equines, as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus), belong to E. ferus. Remains attributed {{to a variety of}} species and lumped together as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, and E. quinni) <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> belong to a second species that was endemic to North America. The possible causes of the extinction of horses in the Americas (ca. 12,000 years ago) have been a matter of debate. Hypotheses include climate change and overexploitation by newly arrived humans. Horses only returned to the American mainland {{with the arrival of the}} conquistadors in 1519.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> became extinct {{due to a}} {{combination}} of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} side of Timsbury basin was the terminus for the tramroads which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line {{were still in}} use in 1873, <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> carrying horse-drawn wagons of coal. Tramroads on the southern side of the Paulton basin served Brittens, Littleborrok, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill terminating at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius is {{widespread}} throughout the lower {{unit of the}} Dinosaur Park Formation. In it, Corythosaurus {{was found to be}} closely associated with the ceratopsid Centrosaurus apertus. Their associating was found in the Dinosaur Park, Judith River, and Mesaverde formations, and also in the Wind River Basin and the Wheatland County area. Corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus, Edmontonia and Dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages of the formation, Dyoplosaurus, Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus in the middle age, and Euoplocephalus alone in later stages of the formation. Studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco-space. The only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as Corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus.|$|E

25|$|The typical plesiosaur had a broad, flat, {{body and}} a short tail. Plesiosaurs {{retained}} their ancestral two pairs of limbs, which had evolved into large flippers. Plesiosaurs {{were related to the}} earlier Nothosauridae, that had a more crocodile-like body. The flipper arrangement is unusual for aquatic animals in that <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> four limbs were used to propel the animal through the water by up-and-down movements. The tail was most likely only used for helping in directional control. This contrasts to the ichthyosaurs and the later mosasaurs, in which the tail provided the main propulsion.|$|E
25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and <b>probably</b> <b>all</b> wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC {{analyses}} provide only limited insight.

Since useful null hypotheses, that potentially hold true, can extremely seldom be put forward in the context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is far more important than the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer model features (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
