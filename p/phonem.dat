Reducing this expense by hypothesizing the words embedded in the speech signal is the goal of the hypothesizing process proposed.

The sequence of these <b>phonems</b> and their time distances within the speed signal is an appropriate criterion for hypothesizing and selecting of references from the lexicon. It is shown that this method can be applied successfully to isolated and connected word recognition on word and subword level reducing the classification expenditure by a great amount (120 to 2860 for isolated words).

This section showed some significant differences between some phonemes' frequencies. Then, all Persian monosyllabic words extracted from the Mo ‘in Persian dictionary.

As used in Puerto Rico or Borikén, it refers to [...] "La gente de la montaña" [...] or [...] "mountain people", being jíbaro or uajiro is to be natives or descendants from the jiba of the main caracoel, one of the [...] "hermanitos gemelos" [...] ("twin brothers"), recalled in the native mythology, the one called Temiban caracoel, also transcribed from the chronicle as Deminan. As related in the native oral story, on Temiban caracoel's back grew a jiba. Then, one of his brothers hit his back with a thunder axe. Then, from the jiba out came the turtle woman, CaUahNa (Caguana, in Spanish), whose symbol can be found carved in the Ceremonial Center of Caguana in Utuado, a native sacred area. So, as for the native people of Borikén or other islands of the Caribbean, jíbaro, or uajiro is the same, which is xíbalo, and it means [...] "to be descendants from the male of the jiba", which is the mountain or dzemí (cemí), from where the native people came. All these native terms can be defined by Yucatecan Maya, as was explained in the linguistic and etymological studies of Óscar Lamourt Valentín, Huana N. Martínez and Uahtibili Báez, native descendants of Borikén. They analyzed more than 500 words, common [...] "tahino" [...] words and others that are attributed to Spanish or African origin, as bakiné, yanhotau. Lamourt Valentín was the first linguist and anthropologist to analyze the word jíbaro and other words from the jíbaro language, taking into consideration the historical and anthropological context. The native of Borikén is the jíbaro. The word taíno or tayno as it was obtained from the chronicle refers to a condition or an expression, not to the ethnic name for the native group. It must be noted that this term was used by archaeologists as a word for classification purposes. As such, it must be clarified that the word tayno does not refer to the ethnic group that inhabited the island, but the word jíbaro is the right word to use to refer to the natives of Borikén. Many new analyses have been conducted since this study was made known, but none have the strong data to be considered academically sound. Therefore, these studies engage in mere speculation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{multi-level}} {{model of}} speech motor control including the word, syllable and <b>phonem</b> level is proposed, which {{takes into account}} linguistic, technical, biological, physiological and developmental aspects. Crucial point is the double function of the vowel onset, which serves to control vowel length and also to synchronize the serialization of words into temporal strings of syllables. In (long) stressed syllables this is done via auditory feedback (re-afferent control), while the utterance of unstressed syllables is automatized using internal signals (efferent control). Young children's problem when crossing from infantil to adultlike speech is to learn to inhibit re-afferent and to apply efferent control of unstressed syllables. If this task is learned incompletely, the model predicts stuttering, e. g. speech blocks, or repetitions and prolongations of syllables or phonems. Because all these control and learning processes refer to low level motor control, the model also contributes to unburden persons who stutterer and their parents from personal responsibility for the occurence of this communication disorder...|$|E

The systematic relationships between units of these two systems are collectively referred to as the Alphabetic Principle.

40|$|Speech therapy {{consists}} {{in a wide}} range of services whose aim is to prevent, diagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most important conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the "immersing" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at home, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to become habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of human SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main distinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based Speech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The inability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to inadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this "unresponsive" behaviour is perceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children, leads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we propose an original emotions recognition framework - named <b>PhonEM</b> - to be integrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality {{consists in}} both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only subjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy representation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task a difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted speech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our CBST.
