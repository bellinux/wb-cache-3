50|$|In {{addition}} to the track-two data on the magnetic stripe, EMV cards generally have identical data encoded on the chip, which is read {{as part of the}} normal EMV transaction process. If an EMV reader is compromised {{to the extent that the}} conversation between the card and the terminal is intercepted, then the attacker may be able to recover both the track-two data and the PIN, allowing construction of a magnetic stripe card, which, while not usable in a Chip and <b>PIN</b> <b>terminal,</b> can be used, for example, in terminal devices that permit fallback to magstripe processing for foreign customers without chip cards, and defective cards. This attack is possible only where (a) the offline PIN is presented in plaintext by the PIN entry device to the card, where (b) magstripe fallback is permitted by the card issuer and (c) where geographic and behavioural checking may not be carried out by the card issuer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{carbonization}} pattern and operation characteristics of an MCCB. The MCCB is consisted of the actuator lever, actuator mechanism, bimetallic strip, contacts, up and down operator, arc divider or extinguisher, metal operation <b>pin,</b> <b>terminal</b> part, etc. When the actuator lever of the MCCB is at the top or the internal metal operation pin is in contact with the front part, the MCCB is turned on or off. It means trip state if the actuator lever or the internal metal operation pin moves to back side. In the UL 94 vertical combustion test, white smoke occurred from the MCCB when an average of 17 ~ 24 seconds elapsed after the MCCB was ignited and black smoke occurred when an average of 45 ~ 50 seconds elapsed. It took 5 ~ 6 minutes for the MCCB surface to be half burnt and took an average of 8 ~ 9 minutes for the MCCB surface to be entirely burnt. In the UL 94 test, the MCCB trip device operated when an average 7 ~ 8 minutes elapsed. If the MCCB trip has occurred, it may have been caused by an electrical problem such as a short-circuit, overcurrent, etc., as well as fire heat. From the entire part combustion test according to KS C 3004, it was found that the metal operation pin could be moved t...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, E. F. Rent, an IBM employee, found a {{remarkable}} trend {{between the number}} of <b>pins</b> (<b>terminals,</b> T) at the boundaries of integrated circuit designs at IBM and the number of internal components (g), such as logic gates or standard cells. On a log-log plot, these datapoints were on a straight line, implying a power-law relation , where t and p are constants (p < 1.0, and generally 0.5 < p < 0.8).|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} digitally - programmable analogue Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is presented. The {{design of}} some new functional blocks and {{the improvement of}} others aim towards speed optimisation with a reasonable accuracy, as it is needed in several analogue Signal Processing applications. A nine-rules, two-inputs and one-output prototype was fabricated and successfully tested using a standard CMOS 2. 4 microns technology showing good agreement with the expected performances, namely: 5. 26 Mflips (Mega fuzzy logic inferences per second) at the <b>pin</b> <b>terminals</b> (@CL= 13 pF), 933 @W power consumption per rule (@Vdd= 5 V) and 5 to 6 bits of precision.

50|$|The {{terminal}} uses a CVM list {{read from}} the card to determine the type of verification to perform. The CVM list establishes a priority of CVMs to use relative to {{the capabilities of the}} terminal. Different terminals support different CVMs. ATMs generally support online <b>PIN.</b> POS <b>terminals</b> vary in their CVM support depending on type and country.|$|R
40|$|A {{digitally}} - programmable analogue Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is presented. Input {{and output}} signals are processed in the analog domain whereas {{the parameters of}} the controller are stored in a built-in digital memory. Some new functional blocks have been designed whereas others were improved towards the optimisation of the power consumption, the speed and the modularity while keeping a reasonable accuracy, as it is needed in several analogue signal processing applications. A nine-rules, two-inputs and one-output prototype was fabricated and succesfully tested using a standard CMOS 2. 4 technology, showing good agreement with the expected performances, namely: from 2. 22 to 5. 26 Mfiips (Mega fuzzy logic inferences per second) at the <b>pin</b> <b>terminals</b> (@CL= 13 pF), 933 W power consumption per rule (@Vdd= 5 V) and 5 bits of resolution.

50|$|The BS 6312 {{specification}} {{defines the}} terminal numbering of a socket-outlet {{in the opposite}} direction to the pin numbers of the socket. Thus terminal 1 is connected to <b>pin</b> 6, <b>terminal</b> 2 to <b>pin</b> 5 and so on. The pins of the 631A plug are numbered in ascending order from left to right with the contacts facing upwards and the latch on the right hand side.|$|R
50|$|Some audiophile equipment, such as amplifiers, {{continues}} to be point-to-point wired using <b>terminal</b> <b>pins,</b> often in very small quantities. Point-to-point wiring {{is used as a}} design feature rather than a result of the economics of very-small-scale production.|$|R

50|$|RS-232 devices may be {{classified}} as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, male connectors have DTE pin functions, and female connectors have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and <b>pin</b> definitions. Many <b>terminals</b> were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.|$|R
50|$|The task of all routers is the same. They {{are given}} some {{pre-existing}} polygons consisting of <b>pins</b> (alsocalled <b>terminals)</b> on cells, and optionally some pre-existing wiring called preroutes. Each of these polygonsare {{associated with a}} net, usually by name or number. The primary task of the router is to creategeometries such that all terminals assigned to the same net are connected, no terminals assigned to differentnets are connected, and all design rules are obeyed. A router can fail by not connecting terminalsthat should be connected (an open), by mistakenly connecting two terminals {{that should not be}} connected(a short), or by creating a design rule violation. In addition, to correctly connect the nets, routersmay also be expected to make sure the design meets timing, has no crosstalk problems, meets any metaldensity requirements, does not suffer from antenna effects, and so on. This long list of often conflicting objectives is what makes routing extremely difficult.|$|R

One motor switch did not transfer and main bus A remained energized until the battery bus-tie circuit breakers were opened after landing. Analysis revealed that residual catalyst caused the <b>terminal</b> <b>pin</b> seals to revert to a gummy state. Resulting reversion products then migrated to the motor commutator and caused brush degradation, increased and erratic commutator resistance, and reduced motor torque. The motor stalled when available motor torque was reduced below that required to drive through the maximum torque point of the switch...|$|R
50|$|All triodes have a {{hot cathode}} {{electrode}} heated by a filament, which releases electrons, and a flat metal plate electrode {{to which the}} electrons are attracted, with a grid consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current. These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10−9 atm. Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to <b>terminal</b> <b>pins</b> which plug into a socket. The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{reduction}} of parasitic linear subcircuits {{is one of}} many issues in model order reduction (MOR) for VLSI design. This issue is well explored, but recently the incorporation of subcircuits from different modelling sources into the circuit model has led to new structural aspects: so far, the number of elements in the subcircuits was significantly larger than the number of connections to the whole circuit, the so called <b>pins</b> or <b>terminals.</b> This assumption is no longer valid in all cases such that the simulation of these circuits or rather the {{reduction of}} the model requires new methods. In [6, 15, 17], the extended singular value decomposition based model order reduction (ESVDMOR) algorithm is introduced as a way to handle this kind of circuits with a massive number of terminals. Unfortunately, the ESVDMOR approach has some drawbacks because it uses the SVD for matrix factorizations. In [5, 21] the truncated SVD (TSVD) {{as an alternative to the}} SVD within the ESVDMOR is introduced. In this paper we show that ESVDMOR as well as the modified approach is stability, passivity, and reciprocity preserving under reasonable assumptions. ...|$|R
50|$|Gravity {{comes into}} play on the {{remaining}} effects. One of them is easily taken away, namely heavy points on the balance wheel. This leaves <b>pinning</b> point and <b>terminal</b> curve. Both of these add a lot of variation to the regulation of a watch; assembly, regulation adjustments by the watchmaker, positioning in the watch, and later position changes by the owner. As the balance wheel goes from one extreme position to the other in its swing back and forth, the hairspring's coils extend and contract a great deal, leading to problems that are extremely hard to counteract. Some have tried using hairsprings that are cylindrical or even spherical instead of flat as is prominent today. Some variations of Breguet's overcoil {{have been developed to}} counteract the effects of the terminal curve. As for the pinning point, Grossmann, Berthoud, Breguet, Caspari and Leroy tried many different possibilities, but not much improvement was gained.|$|R
40|$|As {{the clock}} {{frequencies}} {{used in industry}} increase, the timing requirements on high-speed boards become very tight. Since wire length is directly proportional to wire delay of the buses that connect each chip on high-speed boards, each wire in the bus has to be tightly bounded by the maximum and minimum lengths during routing. These rigid requirements cause challenges for automatic routing. Therefore, more aggressive routing algorithms are required for current industrial circuits. This thesis intends to improve Ozdal and Wong's previous work, which is an algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing on high-speed boards. Their routing algorithm assumes {{that there are no}} boundaries in the grid during routing, and the maximum-length bound for each net is always met. This thesis modifies their code so that it does not make those assumptions. As a result, the program can now handle boundaries with wire snaking to meet the minimum-length bound and use diagonal wires if the Manhattan distance between the two <b>terminal</b> <b>pins</b> cannot satisfy the maximum-length bound...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} composable behavioral {{models and}} a schematic-based simulation methodology to enable top-down design of electrokinetic (EK) lab-on-a-chip (LoC). Complex EK LoCs are {{shown to be}} decomposable into a system of ele-ments with simple geometry and specific function. Parameterized and analytical models are developed to describe the electric and biofluidic behavior within each element. Electric and biofluidic <b>pins</b> at element <b>terminals</b> support the communication between adjacent elements in a simulation schematic. An analog hardware description language implementation of the models is used to simulate LoC subsystems for micromixing and electrophoretic separation. Both direct current (dc) and transient analysis can be performed to capture the influence of system topology, element sizes, material properties, and operational parameters on LoC system performance. Accuracy (relative error generally less than 5 %) and speedup (> 100 ×) of the schematic-based simulation methodology are demonstrated by comparison to experimental measurements and continuum numerical simulation.

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} structure of the protein PhoH 2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Thermobispora bispora have been unsuccessful producing diffraction data to low resolution. The thermophilic organism Caldalkibacillus thermarum was thought to be an advantageous option from which to clone, express and purify PhoH 2 from for the purpose of structure determination. PhoH 2 consists of two domains, an N <b>terminal</b> <b>PIN</b> domain, known for its toxic properties as part of many toxin-antitoxin systems present in M. tuberculosis, and a C-terminal PhoH domain, an RNA helicase suspected to be involved in phosphate starvation responses. The cloning and expression of three variations of recombinant C. thermarum PhoH 2 was successful in Escherichia coli. However the purification of PhoH 2 continues to yield insoluble protein, despite the range of purification buffer conditions screened, thus preventing downstream biochemical characterisation and structural investigations. Multiple options exist to overcome this insolubility problem; including alternate plasmids for protein expression and purification that alter the tag location and type such as C-terminal His-tags and alternative fusion tags...|$|R
40|$|Modern smartcards, {{capable of}} {{sophisticated}} cryptography, provide a high assurance of tamper resistance {{and are thus}} commonly used in payment applications. Although extracting secrets out of smartcards requires resources beyond the means of many would-be thieves, {{the manner in which}} they are used can be exploited for fraud. Cardholders authorize financial transactions by presenting the card and disclosing a <b>PIN</b> to a <b>terminal</b> without any assurance as to the amount being charged or who is to be paid, and have no means of discerning whether the terminal is authentic or not. Even the most advanced smartcards cannot protect customers from being defrauded by the simple relaying of data from one location to another. We describe the development of such an attack, and show results from live experiments on the UK’s EMV implementation, Chip & PIN. We discuss previously proposed defences, and show that these cannot provide the required security assurances. A new defence based on a distance bounding protocol is described and implemented, which requires only modest alterations to current hardware and software. As far as we are aware, this is the first complete design and implementation of a secure distance bounding protocol. Future smartcard generations could use this design to provide cost-effective resistance to relay attacks, which are a genuine threat to deployed applications. We also discuss the security-economics impact to customers of enhanced authentication mechanisms. ...|$|R
