Thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated in terms of Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy at different molar ratio and temperatures. Both pseudo first and second order irreversible kinetics were applied {{to a wide range of}} experimental data. However, according to regression coefficient (R 2) the second order described better experimental behavior of kinetic data...|$|E

A low-value by-product of palm oil refining, the <b>palm</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>distillate</b> (PFAD), was utilized as a feedstock for biodiesel preparation {{with the aid of}} a solid acid catalyst, SO 42 −/TiO 2 –SiO 2. A central composite design is applied to optimize the major influential manipulate variables. The analysis of variance identifies the methanol/PFAD molar ratio as having a dominant effect on methyl ester conversion, followed by catalyst amount and reaction time respectively. The utilization of PFAD {{with the aid of a}} solid acid catalyst results in 93. 3 ± 1. 02 % conversion at the most optimized reaction conditions of 2. 97 ± 0. 04 wt% for the catalyst amount, 5. 85 ± 0. 14 methanol/PFAD molar ratio and 3. 12 ± 0. 14 h of reaction time...|$|E

The optimum reaction conditions for esterification of <b>palm</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and 1 (2 -hydroxyethyl piperazine) were found to be 170 °C reaction temperature and 150 mmHg pressure. The obtained esteramide was subjected to quaternization with different molar ratios of DMS. The consequences revealed that esteramide to DMS ratio of 1 : 0. 95 and duration of quaternization for 2 h yielded esteramide quat of maximum cationic content, i. e., 64. 9 %. The instrumental analysis, viz. FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR verified the esterification and subsequent quaternization of the obtained esteramide quat. Furthermore, the surface-active and performance properties of synthesized esteramide quat were also evaluated.

40|$|Abstract—There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in biodiesel (<b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> methyl ester or FAME) because of the similarity in its properties when compared to those of diesel fuels. Diesel engines operated on biodiesel have lower emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, particulate matter, and air toxics than when operated on petroleum-based diesel fuel. Production of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> methyl ester (FAME) from rapeseed (nonedible oil) <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>distillate</b> having high free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (FFA) was investigated in this work. Conditions for esterification process of rapeseed oil were 1. 8 % H 2 SO 4 as catalyst, MeOH/oil of molar ratio 2 : 0. 1 and reaction temperature 65 °C, {{for a period of}} 3 h. The yield of methyl ester was> 90 % in 1 h. The amount of FFA was reduced from 93 wt % to less than 2 wt % {{at the end of the}} esterification process. The FAME was pureed by neutralization with 1 M sodium hydroxide in water solution at a reaction temperature of 62 ˚C.
