25|$|The first production-standard {{aircraft}} {{to leave the}} Seville final assembly line (FAL), since the grounding was enacted by the Spanish authorities on 9 May, was delivered to the French Air Force {{on the same day}} that the suspension of flight was lifted on 19 June. This aircraft, MSN019, is the seventh to be delivered to France and the 13th to be delivered in all. The FAL has also completed the build of four aircraft for the United Kingdom, which will now undergo <b>pre-delivery</b> checks and trials before being flown to Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.|$|E
500|$|The only {{supersonic}} airliner {{in direct}} competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed [...] "Concordski" [...] by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde. It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts {{had resulted in}} the theft of Concorde blueprints, supposedly {{to assist in the}} design of the Tu-144. As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things, a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on Concorde, and low-bypass turbofan engines with too-high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes. The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show, and another during a <b>pre-delivery</b> test flight in May 1978.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft, {{serial number}} MSN023, {{was on its}} first <b>pre-delivery</b> test flight and was {{scheduled}} to be the third A400M to be delivered to the Turkish Air Force.

The pilots had reported that the plane had a technical fault and asked permission to land, but hit an electricity pylon while attempting an emergency landing. Tracking data from the Flightradar24 website indicated the plane had veered to the left before coming down and that it had reached a maximum altitude of [...] before descending at a constant speed of about [...] As of May 2015, Airbus has delivered just 12 of the 174 ordered so far and the programme has been plagued by persistent quality issues, both in the final assembly facility in Spain, and in Germany.|$|E

50|$|Luteomas are {{not often}} {{detected}} before delivery. Most luteomas are found during surgery if a caesarean section is performed or when some other surgery is performed. <b>Pre-delivery</b> detection is not effective for many reasons. Some tests, {{that can be}} performed <b>pre-delivery,</b> measure the amount of testosterone in the blood; however, {{this is not a}} very useful detection method since normal pregnancies have increased amounts of testosterone. Another method that would be useful to determine if a fetus is being exposed to testosterone is to test the placenta and umbilical cord for testosterone. The placenta has a mechanism for converting hormones from the mother into hormones that the fetus needs. If the amount of testosterone in the umbilical cord is higher than normal, the gene type of the fetus should be determined to see if the fetus is male or female. If the fetus is female then the high levels of testosterone in the umbilical cord could be an indicator that a luteoma is present. Unfortunately, this procedure can't be safely performed until after the fetus has undergone differentiation (when the sex of the fetus becomes apparent). But by this time the damage has already been done.|$|E
50|$|Four vessels {{were built}} for rotation, with 2 vessels being {{deployed}} to Hong Kong at a time. The fifth vessel {{has been involved}} in two navigation incidents.

In June 2006, it crashed again, this time with a Chinese freighter, and sank immediately, 13 servicemen going missing in the accident. The vessel was later refloated and sent to the shipyard for repair.|$|E
50|$|In certain countries, {{such as the}} U.S., {{customary}} enema usage {{went well}} into the 20th century; it was thought {{a good idea to}} cleanse the bowel in case of fever; also, pregnant women were given enemas prior to labor, supposedly {{to reduce the risk of}} feces being passed during contractions. Under some controversial discussion, <b>pre-delivery</b> enemas were also given to women to speed delivery by inducing contractions. This latter usage has since been largely abandoned, because obstetricians now commonly give pitocin to induce labor and because women generally found the procedure unpleasant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pre-delivery</b> inspection, which {{generally}} applies to newly built homes, {{is a real}} estate term that means the buyer has the option (or requirement, depending upon how the real estate contract is written) to inspect the property prior to closing or settlement. These inspections generally take place {{up to a week}} before a closing, and they generally allow buyers the first opportunity to inspect their new home. Additionally, the inspection is to ensure that all terms of the contract have been met, that the home is substantially completed, and that major items are in working order.|$|E
