5|$|All {{berkelium}} isotopes have a half-life far {{too short}} to be <b>primordial.</b> Therefore, any <b>primordial</b> berkelium, that is, berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.|$|E
5|$|Future {{gravitational}} waves observatories {{might be able}} to detect <b>primordial</b> {{gravitational waves}}, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly <b>primordial</b> and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear {{reactions}} of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief <b>primordial</b> isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of the variation of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Primordial</b> lead—which {{comprises}} the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208—was mostly {{created as a}} result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the s- and r-processes.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are <b>primordial</b> and 11 occur only in decay chains of <b>primordial</b> elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
5|$|An epic {{atmosphere}} {{is characteristic of}} some folk metal bands like <b>Primordial,</b> Moonsorrow, Turisas and the music project Folkearth. Groups like Ensiferum and Wintersun {{are known to have}} a melodious side while bands that favor a more blistering or brutal approach can be found in groups like Finntroll and Månegarm.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it the most distant and <b>primordial</b> galaxy yet seen.|$|E
5|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle predicts {{that during the}} inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the <b>primordial</b> fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the <b>primordial</b> {{elements}}, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only <b>primordial</b> elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lanthanum {{is made up}} of two isotopes, {{the stable}} 139La and the <b>primordial</b> long-lived radioisotope 138La. 139La {{is by far the most}} abundant, making up 99.910% of natural lanthanum: it is produced in the s-process (slow neutron capture, which occurs in low- to medium-mass stars) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture, which occurs in core-collapse supernovae). The very rare isotope 138La is one of the few <b>primordial</b> odd-odd nuclei, with a long half-life of 1.05×1011years: it is one of the proton-rich p-nuclei which cannot be produced in the s- or r-processes. 138La, along with the even rarer 180mTa, is produced in the ν-process, where neutrinos interact with stable nuclei. All other lanthanum isotopes are synthetic: with the exception of 137La with a half-life of about 60,000years, all of them have half-lives less than a day, and most have half-lives less than a minute. The isotopes 139La and 140La occur as fission products of uranium.|$|E
5|$|Other source {{minerals}} for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), {{and sometimes}} hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With {{the exception of}} wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the <b>primordial</b> zinc sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, <b>primordial</b> protons and {{neutrons}} formed from the quark–gluon plasma {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the <b>primordial</b> protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} the <b>primordial</b> Solar System. They have {{undergone}} considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few {{tens of millions of}} years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} common {{isotopes}} of americium, 241Am and 243Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, any <b>primordial</b> americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, {{also known}} as C cells, {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} calcitonin, are derived from neural crest cells, which migrate to the pharyngeal arches. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the <b>primordial</b> thyroid gland during its descent to its final location.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} neutral atoms formed from {{a sea of}} <b>primordial</b> ions, space became {{transparent}} to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age {{due to the lack}} of stellar energy sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the <b>primordial</b> chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the <b>primordial</b> chaos.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd <b>primordial</b> nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with all}} {{elements}} having atomic weights {{higher than that}} of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. <b>Primordial</b> thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid neutron capture), because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant <b>primordial</b> uranium isotopes, 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E
5|$|Among all of these, {{the only}} {{isotopes}} {{that occur in}} sufficient quantities in nature to be detected in anything more than traces and have a measurable contribution to the atomic weights of the actinides are the <b>primordial</b> 232Th, 235U, and 238U, and three long-lived decay products of natural uranium, 230Th, 231Pa, and 234U. Natural thorium consists of 0.02(2)% 230Th and 99.98(2)% 232Th; natural protactinium consists of 100% 231Pa; and natural uranium consists of 0.0054(5)% 234U, 0.7204(6)% 235U, and 99.2742(10)% 238U.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a <b>primordial</b> giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only <b>primordial</b> isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. <b>Primordial</b> beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the <b>primordial</b> composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{traditional}} Daoist {{ideas were}} retained in Lingbao cosmology, {{such as the}} idea that the world originated from a type of <b>primordial</b> qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings form the basis for the later classification of texts in the Daozang.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of <b>primordial</b> cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the <b>primordial</b> atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the <b>Primordial</b> Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the earth}} goddess Bhudevi {{falls in love}} with her rescuer Varaha. Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi, making her one of the consorts of Vishnu. In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in {{vigorous}} embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints, sinking a little in the <b>primordial</b> ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of <b>primordial</b> hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of <b>primordial</b> gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In verses 8 through 14, the {{gathered}} gods acknowledge Devi's answer. They accept, states Devi Upanishad, {{that she is}} the Shakti, the Maha-vidya (the great knowledge), the Vedas, the power of Vishnu, she is the inspirer, she is the reason that gods were born, she is the love in the universe, the <b>primordial</b> source of universe, the bearer of thunderbolt, the cave, the wind, the cloud, the enchanting, the power of Self. This part of the Upanishad {{is the same as the}} Devi Stuti in Devi Gita 1.44–1.48.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its <b>primordial</b> internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little <b>primordial</b> matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the <b>primordial</b> planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the <b>primordial</b> Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter the case against the Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on <b>primordial,</b> pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E
5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have passed since {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of <b>primordial</b> technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E
