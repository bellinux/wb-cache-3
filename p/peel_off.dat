5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E

25|$|On 30 January, Kepford led {{one of four}} VF-17 {{divisions}} flying {{cover for}} dive and torpedo bombers striking Simpson Harbor, New Britain. Enemy fighters from Rabaul circled the harbor to intercept the bombers. The roving high cover division led by Blackburn was able to operate with the altitude advantage against enemies, but Kepford's division at 15,000′ was attacked from above by around a dozen enemy fighters, including at least one Tony. Kepford waited until a Japanese plane broke formation to make a gunnery run on a nearby Corsair. When the lone Zero turned to trail the American plane, Kepford followed and riddled the enemy's engine and wing root from behind, causing the plane to catch fire. Kepford was forced to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> quickly thereafter due {{to the number of}} enemy planes around him. One of these, a Tony, came at him front the front. The plane's guns—of a larger caliber than those typically found on the Zero—tore into Kepford's right wing and caused the ammunition within to explode. During all of this, Kepford continued firing with the guns in his left wing, leaving the Tony flaming as it passed him by. Kepford hastened back to base with a wrecked wing and damaged hydraulic system, forcing him to land on one wheel and leading the plane to ground loop, causing its loss. Kepford walked away from the crash landing unhurt.|$|E

25|$|While {{there have}} been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period. The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig (Ficus) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are {{considered}} sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper. Primary species used include F. cotinifolia, F. padifolia and F. petiolaris, the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as Morus celtidifolia, Citrus anurantifolia and Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose. However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate. The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well. Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> more easily. The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark. These bark collectors generally come to the village {{at the end of the}} week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors. The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.|$|E

Other mixtures were more innovative; the defenders at Chester in 918 boiled a mixture of water and ale in copper tubs and poured it over the Viking besiegers, causing their skin to <b>peel</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

500|$|In Pottstown, a {{large portion}} of the roof of a four-story {{building}} was blown off, forcing residents to evacuate the building. An [...] pillar was knocked down at the First Moravian Church in Easton. In Northampton County, a fire sparked by fallen power lines destroyed a barn and partially melted a nearby metal shed.

In Philadelphia, the roof of a portable classroom began to <b>peel</b> <b>off,</b> forcing the forty students inside to evacuate to a safer structure. A large tree fell through one house and severely damaged the roof of a nearby home. Numerous major highways and local streets were shut down for several hours to allow cleanup crews to clear debris. Throughout the state, damages from the storm system amounted to $3.7million.|$|E
500|$|On June 15, 1953, Houtteman {{was traded}} by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, they {{developed}} a reputation for shooting a lot of three-point shots and for not turning over the basketball. [...] The team ranked among the national leaders in three-point shots made per game. The ballhandling ability was a function of the Michigan lineup which often employed four guards and one center/forward, which meant that at any time the team had several adept ballhandlers on the court. By the end of the season, the starting lineup usually included four players [...] or shorter and Sims who is [...] [...] As a team that relied on the three-point shot, it was streaky and was susceptible to hot and cold stretches. The team relied on a deep bench and had 10 players who averaged 10 minutes per game. Even the eleventh player averaged 9.6 minutes. [...] The offense used patient ball movement with backdoor cutters and slashers, which necessitated that defenses chase shooters and <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> picks. The offense resulted in a shot mix that employed three-pointers for about 48% of its shots.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat, head {{writer of}} the new series, said before {{broadcast}} {{that this would be}} one of the darkest openers to a series ever done for Doctor Who. Director Toby Haynes believed that the darker episodes like [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] would allow the series to get into [...] "more dangerous territory." [...] The creation of the Silence was partly inspired by the figure from the Edvard Munch painting The Scream. Introducing the alien villains became a [...] "big challenge" [...] for the producers; it would tie in with the loose [...] "silence will fall" [...] arc that carried through the fifth series. Moffat did not wish to end the arc in the previous series, as he felt it would be [...] "more fun" [...] to continue it. Elsewhere in the episode, Delaware was written to be deceptively antagonistic towards the protagonists, which was based on actor Mark Sheppard's past as villains for his work in American television. Moffat was also keen on the idea of having the Doctor imprisoned with a beard in Area 51. Smith wore a glued-on beard, which was difficult to <b>peel</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
500|$|Peter and Chris set up traps {{for each}} other as they fight. Lois then gets sick of the boys fighting, so the monkey tricks Peter and Chris into coming to dinner together. Chris and Peter admit they don't hate each other and vow to spend more time together. As they are doing this, they see Brian and Stewie running away from the chaotic Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and {{attempts}} to talk her out of her rampage (as well as her career), but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him {{to the top of a}} nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts escalating. The monkey falls out of her hands and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley's skin, hair and clothes <b>peel</b> <b>off,</b> revealing her android skeleton and she tries to kill Peter and Quagmire with a rock, but fails. Eventually, she is pummelled off the top. Afterwards, the monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before he hits the road far below. Stewie and Brian then see the broken Miley, where Stewie says Brian can now have sex with her, but Miley blows up seconds later. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian wags his tails in excitement and tells Stewie that it's not too late to have sex with her, anticipating what's to happen with him next with her hand. Monkey then moves out of Chris's closet, and his friendly attitude also parts ways with him, saying he will [...] "go where he's needed", and moves to Tom Tucker's upside-down-faced son Jake's closet as his new haunt.|$|E
