5000|$|In Islam, honesty implies {{maintaining}} sincerity and truthfulness in all actions, interactions, and transactions, and {{the issue}} of honesty touches almost all aspects of human life. Here, honesty serves as a umbrella term having some basic components like speaking truth; fulfilling commitments, whether written or verbal; remaining truthful to one's word; rendering the assigned duty sincerely and as meticulously as possible; imparting everyone's due rights without the person's asking for it; being objective in evaluating any case and giving judgments; avoiding falsehood, deception, and favoritism. Selection and <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> in an organization based on merit and not on favoritism is also a part of honesty. As Islam is a God-centered religion, honesty demands that it be maintained not only in public but also in private, not only when supervised but also when not supervised. Honesty has particularly been emphasized in business transactions, not only in selling and buying but in issues like pricing and advertising policies. Correct measurement is to be maintained. Again, Muhammad has instructed that the sellers should put the commodities of poorer quality in clear display so that the customers are not deceived. Hiking the price to gain more profit or lowering the price to put the competitors at trouble are considered unethical. [...] Similarly, exaggerated claims and suppression of unfavorable information in advertising are discouraged. Honesty is regarded by Muslim scholars as one of the five essential qualities for any Muslim accountants.|$|E

40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) in 1999, the EU aimed to tackle challenges in the field of security by deploying various military, police, justice and rule of law missions in troubled crisis areas. The Lisbon Treaty put the instrument of CSDP Missions on a new height, putting it under the umbrella of the European External Action Service with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy / Vice -President of the European Commission as their highest representative. CSDP Missions - while dealing with civilian crisis management in conflict and post- conflict countries - are operating in a highly political environment with demands and direction coming from the EU Member States, the EU institution s, the Host Nations and other international actors. Common values and norms applying to CSDP Missions are underdeveloped and not well communicated. Mandates are often not clearly defined. The work force is mainly seconded by the Member States and highly di verse in respect to culture, professional background and experience and language. Women are strongly underrepresented. Even though leadership is crucial in such a challenging environment, it has never been addressed within the CSDP structures until very recently. This thesis analysis the complexities of CSDP Missions and demands put on leadership in such an environment. Furthermore, it defines best practices and closes with recommendations on how the leadership culture in CSDP Missions can be improved. Results are generated by using literature analysis, interviews with key stakeholders, online questionnaires and the authors own work experience in a CSDP Mission. For CSDP Missions to become even more successful a stronger emphasis on the development of leadership culture seems appropriate. Starting from creating a leadership development strategy, defining standard guidelines and principals for recruitment and <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> addressing the problem of gender imbalance, importance should be also put on defining a favored leadership style and common values.

This project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the 6 th Framework Programme, has been defined in order to optimise {{the use of the}} available means and to constitute sustainable research groups in the European Union. SARNET tackles the fragmentation that may exist between the different national R&D programmes, in defining common research programmes and developing common computer tools and methodologies for safety assessment. SARNET comprises most of the organisations involved in SA research in Europe, plus Canada. To reach these objectives, all the organisations networked in SARNET contributed to a Joint Programme of Activities, which consisted of: 	Implementation of an advanced communication tool for accessing all project information, fostering exchange of information, and managing documents; 	Harmonization and re-orientation of the research programmes, and definition of new ones; 	Analysis of the experimental results provided by research programmes in order to elaborate a common understanding of relevant phenomena; 	Development of the ASTEC code (integral computer code used to predict the NPP behaviour during a postulated SA), which capitalizes in terms of physical models the knowledge produced within SARNET; 	Development of Scientific Databases in which all the results of research programmes are stored in a common format (DATANET); 	Development of a common methodology for Probabilistic Safety Assessment of NPPs; 	Development of short courses and writing a text book on Severe Accidents for students and researchers; 	<b>Promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> mobility amongst various European organisations. This paper presents the major achievements after {{four and a half years}} of operation of the network, in terms of knowledge gained, of improvement of the ASTEC reference code, of dissemination of results and of integration of the research programmes conducted by the various partners. After this first period (2004 - 2008), co-funded by the EC, a further contract SARNET 2 with the EC for the next four years started in April 2009 as part of the 7 th Framework Programme.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent of political influence upon Police Chiefs and Sheriffs, in the State of Nebraska, when making specific administrative decisions. Pursuant to this purpose an attempt was made to determine the source of these influences. ^ The hypotheses selected were: (1) There will be differences in the amount of political influence exerted upon the police administrator in cities governed by a mayor-council form of government as compared to cities with a city-manager form of government; (2) There will be a difference in the amount of political influence exerted upon the law enforcement administrator by individual citizens or interest groups in the community as compared with government officials; and, (3) There will be a difference in the amount of political influence exerted upon the law enforcement administrator in the decision areas of budget and personnel practices as compared with operational decisions. ^ A total of (N = 76) Police Chiefs and (N = 60) Sheriffs, in the State of Nebraska, made up the population of this study. A survey instrument was developed and distributed to all respondents. The collected data were coded and analyzed by use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. ^ Hypothesis Number One was not supported due to an insufficient number of city-manager forms of government reported in the study. The relationship hypothesized between government officials, local citizens, and interest groups was supported. The data indicated there was more influence exerted by the Board of Commissioners, City Council, the Mayor, and City-Manager upon the law enforcement administrator than by Individual Citizens or Interest Groups in the Community. Individual analysis revealed there was a greater percentage of influence directed toward the Police Chief by the City Council than toward the Sheriff by the Board of Commissioners/Supervisors. In addition, Police Chiefs indicated they received more influence from Interest Groups and Individuals than did the Sheriffs. ^ Hypothesis Number Three was also supported by the data, which indicated there was more political influence exerted on the law enforcement administrator in the decision areas of the budget (Increasing Departmental Authorized Strength, Purchase of Police Vehicles/Cruisers, and, Purchase of Police Equipment), and Personnel variables (hiring of New Police Officers/Deputy Sheriffs, Police-Union Management Negotiations, and <b>Promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel</b> to Supervisory or Administrative Positions), than Operational Decisions (allocation of Personnel to Duty Assignments, Community Relations Programs in the Community, and Treatment of Minorities in the Community). ^ Personnel decisions ranked second in the amount of influence exerted upon the law enforcement administrator. Also, Police Chiefs indicated a slightly stronger degree of influence exerted upon them than did the Sheriffs in all three decision areas. ^ Overall, Police Chiefs indicated more influence exerted upon them than did Sheriffs. This factor may be attributed to differing law enforcement philosophies of Police Chiefs and Sheriffs. The former is appointed and the latter elected, suggesting that one responds more to citizen input than the other. ^ The author recommends a continual effort be made by law enforcement administrators to analyze and interpret their organizational philosophy to insure compatibility with community desires. ...|$|E

But {{most of them}} focuces on interrelationships between educational credentials and employment or <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnels</b> in modern organisations. The subjects of those studies are mainly male. However, this paper focuses on clarifying the meaning of educational credentials for female. During the pre-war period a main goal for women was marriage. Most women prepared for marriage with serving as a housekeeper to learn housekeeping skills and sewing after elementary school. From {{the end of the}} Meiji era, secondary education began to play a role to prepare for marriage among middle class women. Middle class consisted of many kinds of occupational groups such as from wealthy farmars in rural areas and wealthy marchants to white coller workers in urban areas. Secondary education for female developped rapidly aiming at the nurture of "Good Wives and Wise Mothers" during the Taisho era. Secondary education for female was deeply embedded in middle class culture. According to culture of those occupational groups, there were different types of institutions with various years of learning and diverse curricula. The diversity of institutions is characteristic of secondary education for female. Unlike for boys'secondary school, secondary schools were actually the highest stage of education for most female. That is only a few women entered colleges. Secondary education didn't prepare female students for a college entrance examination. Female students enjoyed extra-curricura activities and their school life without pressures from entrance examination. This is another characteristic of secondary education for female. By exploring (1) detailed processes of establishing a women's secondary school in Tanba Sasayama area, and clarifying (2) social function of this school and (3) it's culture, we argue how educational credentials were permiated in the "life world" of women during the pre-war period...|$|R
