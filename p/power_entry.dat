25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation {{to a degree that}} allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|E
50|$|Medical devices {{can and do}} take {{advantage}} of <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> modules. <b>Power</b> <b>entry</b> modules are available with electromagnetic interference filters with very low leakage current ratings, even those suitable for direct patient contact in accordance with UL 544 and IEC 60601-1. Shock-safe fuseholders have also been integrated into <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> modules. These devices require a tool to remove the fuse for replacement.|$|E
50|$|Since most <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> modules {{connect to}} the AC powerline, {{they are subject to}} safety {{standards}} set by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (VDE), and many other safety standards agencies such as the BSI Group (BSI). <b>Power</b> <b>entry</b> module manufacturers take on the responsibility of producing <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> module products {{in such a way that}} they meet the standards of one or more of these safety standard agencies, so that equipment manufacturers using them need not take responsibility for the internal details of safety certification. <b>Power</b> <b>entry</b> module manufacturers also pay independent testing labs to test their products against the safety standards, so that the products can carry the safety agency’s approval mark.|$|E

50|$|The global {{recession}} of 1975 affected Schurter, {{and the company}} was forced to abandon the fuse cartridge and screw business. In 1981 Bruno Schurter established Schurter, Inc. in California. By 1984 {{more than two-thirds of}} sales from Switzerland were exported to other countries. Rolf's son Hans-Rudolph, the current President of the company, joined in 1986. In the following year, Rolf Schurter turned management of the company over to Hans-Rudolph Schurter. In 1990, all activities were consolidated under the umbrella of Schurter Holding AG. This move facilitated the series of acquisitions that are still taking place today. In that year Schurter SSRO was established in the Czech Republic to expand production of <b>power</b> <b>entry</b> module products.|$|E

40|$|In a {{bilateral}} oligopoly, Ghosh and Morita (‘Social desirability of free entry: {{a bilateral}} oligopoly analysis, 2007, IJIO) show that entry is always socially insufficient if the upstream agents have sufficiently strong bargaining power. We {{show that this}} conclusion is very much dependent {{on the use of}} “efficient bargaining” model in their analysis. Using a “right-to-manage” model, we show that, even if the upstream agents have full bargaining <b>power,</b> <b>entry</b> is excessive in a bilateral oligopoly if the cost of entry is not very high. Hence, whether the anti-competitive entry regulation is justified under bilateral oligopoly depends on the bargaining structure between the upstream and the downstream agents.
