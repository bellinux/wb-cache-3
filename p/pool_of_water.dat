5|$|Voyage (1999), by Jean-Michel Folon, {{depicts a}} boat sitting amid a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The boat has two passengers: {{a man with}} a hat—the everyman—on one end, and a {{sleeping}} cat on the other end.|$|E
5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is shot at night {{with the sounds of}} a storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches. Over each ditch {{is a series of}} hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net-covered hoops is known as a pipe.|$|E
50|$|Park's work explores {{visualizing}} emotive {{states and}} the subconscious. In Eunoia and Eunoia II, she controlled <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with her brain-waves. This was accomplished by having electroencephalography (E.E.G.) data to create sound-waves which were pushed through <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> causing them to ripple. Park sat in the center <b>of</b> the <b>pools</b> as this occurred. For Eunoia, Park separated the E.E.G. data into five emotions, each of which fed into one <b>of</b> five <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> For Eunoia II, she expanded her conception of brain activity to cover forty-eight <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> matching the forty-eight emotions described by philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Also, while Park strove to control her emotions in Eunoia {{in order to keep}} the <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> still, she changed her approach in Eunoia II to focus on expressing emotions.|$|R

5|$|Like many zoo animals, hippos were {{traditionally}} {{displayed in}} concrete exhibits. In {{the case of}} hippos, they usually had a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and patch of grass. In the 1980s, zoo exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. The Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium, features a 360,000 gallon pool. In 1987, the Toledo Zoo saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo. The exhibit was so popular, the hippos became the logo of the Toledo Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Scar makes a brief cameo {{appearance}} in the film in Simba's nightmare. In the nightmare, an adult Simba runs down the cliff where his father died, attempting to rescue him. Scar intervenes, however, and then turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff. Scar makes another cameo {{appearance in}} a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> as a reflection, after Kovu is exiled from Pride Rock.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E

5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a {{dark wood}} with a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches {{on the left}} is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, {{to a secret}} {{government}} facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body {{under the watchful eye}} of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Back at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Washout toilets have a flat {{platform}} with a shallow <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> They are flushed by a {{jet of water}} from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|E
