5000|$|The {{use of the}} {{polarization}} ratio generally includes an implicit assumption that the particles in the volume are randomly oriented. The polarization properties of oriented particles cannot be properly represented by the depolarization ratio. Ice crystals are known to horizontally orient when they are large enough that drag forces overcome the randomizing effects of Brownian motion. Rain is also generally oriented, where drag forces flatten the drops along the fall direction. In such cases, the measured depolarization ratio may depend on the particular polarization state used by the lidar system. Some polarization lidar systems can measure the entire backscatter <b>phase</b> <b>matrix,</b> thereby avoiding the ambiguity of the depolarization ratio when oriented particles are present.|$|E
50|$|With recent device advances, newer {{forms of}} cyclo{{converters}} are being developed, such as matrix converters. The first {{change that is}} first noticed is that matrix converters utilize bi-directional, bipolar switches. A single phase to a single <b>phase</b> <b>matrix</b> converter consists of a matrix of 9 switches connecting the three input phases to the tree output phase. Any input phase and output phase can be connected together at any time without connecting any two switches from the same phase at the same time; otherwise this will cause a short circuit of the input phases. Matrix converters are lighter, more compact and versatile than other converter solutions. As a result, {{they are able to}} achieve higher levels of integration, higher temperature operation, broad output frequency and natural bi-directional power flow suitable to regenerate energy back to the utility.|$|E
50|$|Ion-exchange {{chromatography}} separates molecules {{based on}} their respective charged groups. Ion-exchange chromatography retains analyte molecules on the column based on coulombic (ionic) interactions. Essentially, molecules undergo electrostatic interactions with opposite charges on the stationary <b>phase</b> <b>matrix.</b> The stationary phase consists of an immobile matrix that contains charged ionizable functional groups or ligands. The stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups (R-X) that interact with analyte ions of opposite charge. To achieve electroneutrality, these inert charges couple with exchangeable counterions in the solution. Ionizable molecules {{that are to be}} purified compete with these exchangeable counterions for binding to the immobilized charges on the stationary phase. These ionizable molecules are retained or eluted {{based on their}} charge. Initially, molecules that do not bind or bind weakly to the stationary phase are first to wash away. Altered conditions are needed for the elution of the molecules that bind to the stationary phase. The concentration of the exchangeable counterions, which competes with the molecules for binding, can be increased or the pH can be changed. A change in pH affects the charge on the particular molecules and, therefore, alters binding. The molecules then start eluting out based on the changes in their charges from the adjustments. Further such adjustments can be used to release the protein of interest. Additionally, concentration of counterions can be gradually varied to separate ionized molecules. This type of elution is called gradient elution. On the other hand, step elution can be used in which the concentration of counterions are varied in one step. This type of chromatography is further subdivided into cation exchange chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. Positively charged molecules bind to anion exchange resins while negatively charged molecules bind to cation exchange resins. The ionic compound consisting of the cationic species M+ and the anionic species B- can be retained by the stationary phase.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dense media {{radiative}} transfer (DMRT) theory {{is used to}} study the multiple-scattering effects in active microwave remote sensing. Simplified DMRT <b>phase</b> <b>matrices</b> are obtained in the 1 – 2 frame. The simplified expressions facilitate solutions of the DMRT equations and comparisons with other <b>phase</b> <b>matrices.</b> First-order, second-order, and full multiple-scattering solutions of the DMRT equations are obtained. To solve the DMRT equation, we decompose the diffuse intensities into Fourier series in the azimuthal direction. Each harmonic is solved by the eigenquadrature approach. The model {{is applied to the}} active microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. Full multiplescattering effects are important as the optical thickness for snow at frequencies above 10 GHz often exceed unity. The results are illustrated as a function of frequency, incidence angle, and snow depth. The results show that cross polarization for the case of densely packed spheres can be significant and can be merely 6 to 8 dB below copolarization. The magnitudes of the cross polarization are consistent with the experimental observations. The results show that the active 13. 5 -GHz backscattering coefficients still have significant sensitivity to snow thickness even for snow thickness exceeding 1 m.

40|$|Two data {{reduction}} algorithms developed using the scattering and <b>phase</b> <b>matrix</b> approaches are described. In the scattering matrix approach, the scattering matrices of four consecutive along-track pixels are averaged {{and in the}} <b>phase</b> <b>matrix</b> approach, the phase matrices of four consecutive along-track pixels are averaged. The basic procedures necessary to generate a synthetic polarization image from original data sets are discussed. The two algorithms are evaluated in terms of data volume reduction {{and the number of}} errors introduced in the synthesized images. It is observed that the reduced data set produced by the scattering matrix algorithm is smaller than that generated by the <b>phase</b> <b>matrix</b> algorithm; however, greater errors are introduced into the data set by the scattering matrix algorithm than the phase algorithm.

40|$|The {{effects of}} close spacing between small {{scattering}} spheres were examined {{by keeping the}} distance-dependent terms in the expressions for the transverse scattered fields.

Computed results were compared with those obtained when the <b>phase</b> <b>matrix</b> was specialized to the far-field condition. It was found that the use of the far-zone condition tended to underestimate both the level of the copolarized backscattering and the cross-polarized backscattering. In emission computations, the use of the far-zone condition overestimated the level of the brightness temperature. These effects decreased with a decrease in the volume fraction or an increase in the exploring frequency, as expected.

40|$|We {{present a}} new remote sensing {{technique}} to infer the average asymmetry parameter of ice crystals near cloud top from multi-directional polarization measurements. The method is based on previous findings that (a) complex aggregates of hexagonal crystals generally have scattering <b>phase</b> <b>matrices</b> resembling those of their components and (b) scattering <b>phase</b> <b>matrices</b> systematically vary with aspect ratios of crystals and their degree of microscale surface roughness. Ice cloud asymmetry parameters are inferred from multi-directional polarized reflectance measurements by searching for the closest fit in a look-up table of simulated polarized reflectances computed for cloud layers that contain individual hexagonal columns and plates with varying aspect ratios and roughness values. The asymmetry parameter of the hexagonal particle {{that leads to the}} best fit with the measurements is considered the retrieved value. For clouds with optical thickness less than 5, the cloud optical thickness must be retrieved simultaneously with the asymmetry parameter, while for optically thicker clouds the asymmetry parameter retrieval is independent of cloud optical thickness. Evaluation of the technique using simulated measurements based on the optical properties of a number of complex particles and their mixtures shows that the ice crystal asymmetry parameters are generally retrieved to within 5 %, or about 0. 04 in absolute terms. The retrieval scheme is largely independent of calibration errors, range and sampling density of scattering angles and random noise in the measurements. The approach can be readily applied to measurements of past, current and future airborne and satellite instruments that measure multi-directional polarized reflectances of ice-topped clouds...|$|R
