40|$|During {{the last}} decades a growing concern about {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from fossil fuels has arisen. Nuclear power is an energy source with a low contribution to the greenhouse effect and is in this sense therefore a better alternative for electricity production. The waste from nuclear power is however highly radiotoxic {{and has to be}} stored for more than 100000 years until the radiotoxicity has decreased to an acceptable level. With <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> the purpose is to separate the nuclides that contribute most to the long-term radiotoxicity and to transform them into short lived or stable nuclides. If <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> are successfully applied the storage time for nuclear waste can be reduced to less than 1000 years. Essential for the <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> is an efficient separation of the minor actinides. In this work, group separation of the trivalent lanthanides and actinides from a PUREX raffinate has been demonstrated by means of solvent extraction, using the TODGA extracting agent.

500|$|With 58 nuclear {{reactors}} contributing about 75% of its electricity, {{the highest percentage}} of any country, France has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there. Some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel, but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel. France also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries, but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin. Radioactive waste from reprocessing French spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository, pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research. Under this legislation, <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> of long-lived elements, immobilization and conditioning processes, and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by [...] the Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique (CEA).

40|$|<b>Partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> (P-T) {{is perhaps}} the most elegant means of high level waste disposal. Currently, the cost of fuel {{obtained}} from reprocessing spent fuel exceeds the cost of fuel obtained by mining. This has resulted in the once through fuel cycle dominating the US nuclear industry. Despite this fact P-T continues to be examined and debated by the US as well as abroad. The US first seriously considered P-T between approximately 1976 and 1982 but rejected the concept in favor of reprocessing. More recently, since about 1989, {{as a result of the}} once through fuel cycle and the growing problems of waste disposal, studies concerning P-T have resumed. This essay will seek to outline the incentives and goals of <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> as it would apply to the disposal of spent fuel in the US. Recent proposals by various US national laboratories for implementing <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> as a high level waste management and disposal device will also be discussed. The review will seek to examine the technical concepts utilized in each of the proposals and their feasibility. The major focus of this essay will be the transmutation methods themselves, while the partitioning methods will be discussed only briefly.

Actinides (Pu, Am, Cm, etc), MLFP (Sr, Cs) and RMFP (Ru, Rh, Pd, Tc, etc) shall be highly separated and purified to meet well with the forward treatments like nuclide transmutation and/or utilization. Toward the total utilization of RMFP, CEE (catalytic electrolytic extraction) method was innovated to separate them from high-level liquid wastes of the nuclear spent fuel. The CEE, utilizing catalytic effect of Pd 2 + vs. RuNO 3 +, and that of Rh 3 + vs. RuNO 3 + and ReO 4 - ions, could effectively separate Ru, Re, Tc as well as Pd from the nitric acid solution. The CEE of Rh 3 + and Pd 2 + vs. TcO 4 - were also probably. The RMFP-deposited Pt electrodes showed highly catalytic properties for electrolytic hydrogen production, about twice {{higher than that of}} smooth Pt in alkaline and sea waters.

40|$|It {{has been}} an {{attractive}} idea {{for some time to}} reduce the long-term potential hazard of the waste by chemical removal of the actinides as well as some long-lived fission products and their subsequent transmutation in an intense neutron flux. Transmutation would thus shorten the required containment period of radioactive material in a repository. It is estimated, however, that development of such technology would take at least 40 years because facilities would be required to perform a clean actinide and fission product isolation and to fabricate the fuel elements that contained the separated nuclides. This latter requirements would involve a major expansion of new chemical process steps which are not available as yet. Development of new equipment to maintain occupational exposures as low as reasonably achievable and to minimize releases of radioactivity to the environment would also be necessary. <b>Partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> should be introduced, if at all, as a long-term decision about new nuclear power technology as a future energy source.

Transmutation study at JAERI is focused on dedicated transmutors and directed toward two approaches; actinide burner fast reactor and proton accelerator-based transmutation system. The conceptual design study of an accelerator-based transmutation system with a spallation target and a subcritical actinide-loaded core is discussed.

40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{contains}} several long-lived radionuclides {{that must be}} stored in a safe manner for a long time. Transmutation of these radionuclides into short-lived or stable nuclides reduces the necessary storage time by several orders of magnitude. The nuclides most suitable for transmutation {{are those of the}} actinides. The products obtained from <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> are, however, radioactive. <b>Partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation</b> (P&T) should therefore be considered as a complement to a final storage. The connection between <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmutation,</b> is presented. Generally, it can be concluded that the transmutation efficiency and the separation yield should be high if P&T should be a preferable option. Liquid-liquid extraction is one separation technique suitable to achieve the necessary separation yield. One group of extractants that can be used is the long-chained quaternary ammonium salts. In this work, the extractant Aliquat- 336 has been investigated. The extraction behaviour of several elements, Sc, Fe, Zr, Nb, Tc, In, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Th, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm and nitric acid have been investigated. Aliquat- 336 shows high extraction of tetravalent elements and anions. The extraction of multivalent cations was found to decrease in the order:. A separation process based on Aliquat- 336 for separation of technetium, neptunium and plutonium in connection with the Reversed Talspeak process is presented. The process is designed with respect to the number of stages and volume flow ratios needed to achieve at least 99. 9 % separation. The crucial stage was found to be the stripping of plutonium(IV). Aliquat- 336 has potential to achieve the necessary separation of technetium, neptunium and plutonium. A kinetic study of the oxidation of uranium(IV) to uranium(VI) by oxygen was done. It was found that the oxidation rate is a combination of a first order and an autocatalytic reaction mechanism. The reactive species in the acid interval investigated are the first and second hydrolysed uranium(IV) complexes.
