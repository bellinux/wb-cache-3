50|$|The aging {{algorithm}} is {{a descendant of}} the NFU algorithm, with modifications to make it aware of the time span of use. Instead of just incrementing the counters of <b>pages</b> <b>referenced,</b> putting equal emphasis on <b>page</b> <b>references</b> regardless of the time, the reference counter on a page is first shifted right (divided by 2), before adding the referenced bit {{to the left of}} that binary number. For instance, if a <b>page</b> has <b>referenced</b> bits 1,0,0,1,1,0 in the past 6 clock ticks, its referenced counter will look like this: 10000000, 01000000, 00100000, 10010000, 11001000, 01100100. <b>Page</b> <b>references</b> closer to the present time have more impact than <b>page</b> <b>references</b> long ago. This ensures that <b>pages</b> <b>referenced</b> more recently, though less frequently referenced, will have higher priority over <b>pages</b> more frequently <b>referenced</b> in the past. Thus, when a page needs to be swapped out, the page with the lowest counter will be chosen.|$|R

BSD was widely distributed in source form so that others could learn from it and improve it; this style of software distribution has now led to the open source movement, of which BSD is now recognized {{to be one of}} the earliest examples.

5000|$|Hundreds of {{articles}} in Rees are very long, and the work is unpaginated, so <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> is not easy. The following convention {{was adopted by the}} Rees Project, and is based on the method described by R. B. McKerrow. Each gathering has 8 pages, and each page 2 columns. The reference is cited by volume or half-volume details with accurate date between 1802 and 1820, article title, and then the gathering's identifier, the page, and the column, separated by colons. The page containing the gathering identifier (e.g., [...] "B") is page 1 in each gathering (e.g., page [...] "B:1"). Page 3 in each gathering typically contains the gathering identifier plus the figure 2 and should be ignored (e.g., [...] "B2" [...] appears on page [...] "B:3").|$|E

What {{we have here is}} a typical D&D Companion Set adventure. It starts (can you guess?) in an inn. Something Suspicious Happens and the party get a rumour. They follow up the rumour and find (gasp!) a Wizard's Tomb, complete with the Far Freaking Weird Powerful Magic Item, the Standard Non-Existent <b>Page</b> <b>Reference</b> and the standard TSR Glaring Inconsistency. The party follow up on a lead; they get here and, harassed by NPCs, finally get to the Endless Stair..." [...] Wallis commented more seriously: [...] "This adventure is competently written, apart from a couple of minor errors, and would doubtless make an enjoyable week-end's play. The trouble is that it lacks and kind of variety from standard D&D fare; it could be a first-level adventure except for the powerful NPCs, magic items and monsters. ... It's a pity that products of the qualify of The Grand Duchy of Karameikos coming out for D&D, this is the best that can be done in the way of adventures." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Definition of Man", {{the first}} essay of his {{collection}} Language as Symbolic Action (1966), Burke defined humankind as a [...] "symbol using animal" [...] (p. 3). This definition of man, he argued, means that [...] "reality" [...] has actually [...] "been built {{up for us}} through nothing but our symbol system" [...] (p. 5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call [...] "reality," [...] Burke stated, is actually a [...] "clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present [...] [...] [...] a construct of our symbol systems" [...] (p. 5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university's catalogue [...] "are in effect but so many different terminologies" [...] (p. 5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion's symbol system, inhabit a reality {{that is different from}} the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality (no <b>page</b> <b>reference).</b>|$|E
40|$|Flash {{solid-state}} drives (SSDs) {{provide much}} faster {{access to data}} compared with traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). The current price and performance of SSD suggest it can be adopted as a data buffer between main memory and HD-D, and buffer management policy in such hybrid systems has attracted more and more interest from research commu-nity recently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage the buffer in flash-based hybrid storage system-s, named Hotness Aware Hit (HAT). HAT exploits a <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue to record the access history {{as well as the}} status of accessed pages, i. e., hot, warm and cold. Addition-ally, the <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue is further split into hot and warm regions which correspond to the memory and flash in general. The HAT approach updates the page status and deals with the page migration in the memory hierarchy ac-cording to the current page status and hit position in the <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue. Our empirical evaluation on bench-mark traces demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategy against the state-of-the-art competitors...|$|E
