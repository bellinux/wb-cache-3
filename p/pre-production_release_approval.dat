40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the path to yield {{improvement}} of a high-throw-count handset switch in the <b>pre-production</b> <b>release</b> phase. This work was necessitated by lower than expected initial yields found {{to be due to}} excessive off state current of the switch die. Failure analysis was performed leading to the generation of a die sort test plan specific to the switch. After tracing the origin of the failure mode back to the fab, we started a systematic approach to removing fab defects from the process. Defect reduction leading to improved yields was accomplished by employing Automated Optical Inspection intimately with process auditing and line partitioning at targeted steps in the fabrication process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This pre-conceptual {{engineering}} {{study is}} intended to assist in supporting the critical decision (CD) 0 milestone by providing {{a basis for the}} justification of mission need (JMN) for the handling and disposal of liquid effluents. The current ETF baseline strategy, to accommodate WTP requirements, calls for a solidification treatment unit (STU) {{to be added to the}} ETF to provide the needed additional processing capability. This STU is to process the ETF evaporator concentrate into a cement-based waste form. The cementitious waste will be cast into blocks for curing, storage, and disposal. This pre-conceptual engineering study explores this baseline strategy, in addition to other potential alternatives, for meeting the ETF future mission needs. Within each reviewed case study, a technical and facility description is outlined, along with a preliminary cost analysis and the associated risks and benefits.
