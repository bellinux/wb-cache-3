5|$|The White Stripes had a {{carefully}} constructed image built around lore they created {{for themselves and}} visual motifs.

5|$|Battle Network {{was created}} amidst {{the success of}} Nintendo's {{portable}} RPG franchise Pokémon. According to producer Keiji Inafune, the development team wanted Battle Network to identify specifically with younger gamers by creating a setting resembling {{the real world and}} a gameplay model that mixes traditional action and RPG elements.

However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media.|$|E

Twenty-five <b>presentations</b> <b>were</b> conducted at twelve different community centers. <b>Presentations</b> <b>were</b> conducted by chiropractic interns.

The nomination of the Heerespersonalamt (HPA—Army Personnel Office) was ready for signature but the process was never completed. In similar instances the AKCR had argued that the <b>presentation</b> <b>was</b> {{in accordance with the}} Dönitz-decree. This is illegal according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) and lacks legal justification. Scherzer claims that the AKCR forgot to list him.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot <b>presentation</b> <b>was</b> recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E

5|$|Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition, {{and most}} reviewers were {{impressed}} with the images produced by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques.

Reviewers, however, found its <b>presentation</b> <b>was</b> too confusing to follow; several of them felt it worsened the show by detracting from the strength of its art.|$|E
