Toxicity {{can be reduced}} through lime application to raise soil pH, however this amendment does not remedy subsoil acidity, and liming {{may not always be}} practical or cost-effective. Addition of organic acids to plant nutrient solutions alleviates phytotoxic Al effects, presumably by chelating Al and rendering it less toxic. In an effort to increase organic acid secretion and thereby enhance Al tolerance in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), we produced transgenic plants using nodule-enhanced forms of malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase cDNAs {{under the control of the}} constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. We report that a 1. 6 -fold increase in malate dehydrogenase enzyme specific activity in root tips of selected transgenic alfalfa led to a 4. 2 -fold increase in root concentration as well as a 7. 1 -fold increase in root exudation of citrate, oxalate, malate, succinate, and acetate compared with untransformed control alfalfa plants. Overexpression of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>enzyme</b> specific activity in transgenic alfalfa did not result in increased root exudation of organic acids. The degree of Al tolerance by transformed plants in hydroponic solutions and in naturally acid soil corresponded with their patterns of organic acid exudation and supports the concept that enhancing organic acid synthesis in plants may be an effective strategy to cope with soil acidity and Al toxicity...|$|E

We investigated {{the effectiveness of}} alternative vineyard strategies to prevent Fe chlorosis in grapevines. Methods and Results: An experiment was conducted over two consecutive seasons on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted on the Fe-chlorosis susceptible Vitis riparia grown in pots filled with calcareous soil. Intercropping with Festuca rubra enhanced leaf chlorophyll index and reduced the root activity of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>enzyme,</b> a physiological marker of Fe deficiency. This response {{was similar to that}} of supplying Fe-ethylenediamine- N,N’-bis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid to soil. Application of ammonium with 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (a nitrification inhibitor) increased leaf chlorophyll index and stomatal length, and induced root biochemical responses similar to those with Fe-ethylenediamine-N,N’-bis(2 -hydroxyphenylaceticacid) application. Leaf-applied Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid induced a high root citric acid concentration, suggesting a limited translocation of Fe from leaves to roots. Intercropping with Festuca rubra decreased the leaf fluorescence-derived parameters in the first year and increased the leaf stomata conductance in the second year of the experiment. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential for preventing grapevine Fe chlorosis more sustainably through managing ammonium nutrition and adopting intercropping with Fe-efficient grasses. Significance of the Study: The data provide evidence of the effectiveness and physiological responses of agronomic strategies, alternative to synthetic Fe chelates, for preventing Fe deficiency in the grapevine...|$|E

In this study, exogenously applied abscisic acid (ABA), at micromolar concentrations, could partially substitute for water stress in induction of CAM in this species.

Rate of {{photosynthesis}} {{and activities}} of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle enzymes were determined in pods (siliqua), whereas rate of dark CO 2 fixation, oil content {{and activities of}} enzymes involved in dark CO 2 metabolism were measured in seeds of Brassica campestris L. cv. Toria {{at different stages of}} pod/seed development. The period between 14 and 35 days after anthesis corresponded to active phase of seed development during which period, seed dry weight and oil content increased sharply. Rate of pod photosynthesis and activities of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle enzymes were maximum in younger pods but sufficiently high levels were retained up to 40 days after anthesis. The rate of dark 14 CO 2 fixation in seeds increased up to 21 days after anthesis and declined thereafter but maintaining sufficiently high rates till 35 days after anthesis. Similarly various <b>enzymes</b> viz., <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> NAD+-malate dehydrogenase and NADP+-malic enzyme, involved in dark CO 2 metabolism retained sufficient activities during the above period. These enzyme activities were more than adequate to maintain the desired supply of malate which mainly arises from dark CO 2 fixation in seeds and further translocated to leucoplasts for onward synthesis of fatty acids. Enzyme localization experiments revealed <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and <b>enzymes</b> of sucrose metabolism to be present only in cytosol, whereas enzymes of glycolysis were present both in cytosolic and leucoplastic fractions.

The methylation pattern of the CCWGG sequences is not changed in both the 5 ′-promoter region of the gene of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> the key <b>enzyme</b> of C 4 -photosynthesis and CAM, and in the nuclear ribosomal DNA.

To reach an integrative view on the many roles played by this enzyme, we characterized a homozygous gapc- 1 null mutant and an as-GAPC 1 line of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Both mutant plant lines show a delay in growth, morphological alterations in siliques, and low seed number. Embryo development was altered, showing abortions and empty embryonic sacs in basal and apical siliques, respectively. The gapc- 1 line shows a decrease in ATP levels and reduced respiratory rate. Furthermore, both lines exhibit a decrease in the expression and activity of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase and reduced levels of pyruvate and several Krebs cycle intermediates, as well as increased reactive oxygen species levels. Transcriptome analysis of the gapc- 1 mutants unveils a differential accumulation of transcripts encoding for enzymes involved in carbon partitioning. According to these studies, some enzymes involved in carbon flux decreased (<b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> NAD-malic <b>enzyme,</b> glucose- 6 -P dehydrogenase) or increased (NAD-malate dehydrogenase) their activities compared to the wild-type line.

40|$|The pathway of {{autotrophic}} CO 2 fixation was {{studied in}} the phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus and in the aerobic thermoacidophilic archaeon Metallosphaera sedula. In both organisms, none of the key enzymes of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle, the reductive citric acid cycle, and the reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway were detectable. However, cells contained the biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase as well as <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase.</b> The specific <b>enzyme</b> activities of the carboxylases were high enough to explain the autotrophic growth rate via the 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle. Extracts catalyzed the CO 2 -, MgATP-, and NADPH-dependent conversion of acetyl-CoA to 3 -hydroxypropionate via malonyl-CoA and the conversion of this intermediate to succinate via propionyl-CoA. The labelled intermediates were detected in vitro with either 14 CO 2 or [14 C]acetyl-CoA as precursor. These reactions {{are part of the}} 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle, the autotrophic pathway proposed for C. aurantiacus. The investigation was extended to the autotrophic archaea Sulfolobus metallicus and Acidianus infernus, which showed acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylase activities in extracts of autotrophically grown cells. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity is unexpected in archaea since they do not contain fatty acids in their membranes. These aerobic archaea, as well as C. aurantiacus, were screened for biotin-containing proteins by the avidin-peroxidase test. They contained large amounts of a small biotin-carrying protein, which is most likely part of the acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylases. Other archaea reported to use one of the other known autotrophic pathways lacked such small biotin-containing proteins. These findings suggest that the aerobic autotrophic archaea M. sedula, S. metallicus, and A. infernus use a yet-to-be-defined 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle for their autotrophic growth. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase are proposed to be the main CO 2 fixation <b>enzymes,</b> and <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> may have an anaplerotic function.

The hybrids incorporated from 57 to 88 % of the 14 C assimilated in a 10 -s exposure into C 4 acids compared with 26 % for the C 3 -C 4 species Flaveria linearis, 91 % for the C 4 species Flaveria trinervia, and 87 % for the C 4 -like Flaveria brownii. Those plants with high percentages of 14 C initially fixed into C 4 acids also metabolized the C 4 acids quickly, {{and the percentage of}} 14 C in 3 -phosphoglyceric acid plus sugar phosphates increased for at least a 30 -s exposure to 12 CO 2. This indicated a high degree of coordination between the carbon accumulation and reduction phases of the C 4 and C 3 cycles. Synthesis and metabolism of C 4 acids by the species and their hybrids were highly and linearly correlated with discrimination against 13 C. The relationship of 13 C discrimination or 14 C metabolism to O 2 inhibition of photosynthesis was curvilinear, changing more rapidly at C 4 -like values of 14 C metabolism and 13 C discrimination. Incorporation of initial 14 C into C 4 acids showed a biphasic increase with increased activities of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and NADP-malic <b>enzyme</b> (steep at low activities), but turnover of C 4 acids was linearly related to NADP-malic enzyme activity.

40|$|The {{physical}} and kinetic properties of multiple forms of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> were studied in leaves of C 4 and C 3 species, their F 1 and F 3 hybrids, in greening maize leaves, in Crassulacean acid metabolism plants, and in nongreen root tissues. Four different forms are suggested: a C 4 photosynthetic <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> with high Km for phosphoenolpyruvate (∼ 0. 59 mm), Km Mg (∼ 0. 5 mm), and Vmax (∼ 29 micromoles per minute per milligram of chlorophyll); a C 3 photosynthetic <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> with low Km for phosphoenolpyruvate (∼ 0. 14 mm), Km for Mg (∼ 0. 097 mm), and Vmax (1. 5); a Crassulacean acid metabolism type with low Km for phosphoenolpyruvate (0. 14 mm), and high Vmax (14 micromoles per minute per milligram of chlorophyll); and a nongreen or nonautotrophic type with low Km for phosphoenolpyruvate, Km for Mg, and low Vmax. In {{closely related species}} or within species, the types can be differentiated by anion exchange column chromatography. Each of the four forms {{is associated with a}} different metabolic pathway: the <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> of C 4 species for malate generation as a photosynthetic intermediate, the <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> of C 3 species in malate generation as a photosynthetic product, the <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> of Crassulacean acid metabolism species in malate generation as a CO 2 donor for photosynthesis during the subsequent light period, and a nongreen or root type producing malate for ionic balance and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate generation.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that allow plants {{to respond to}} variable and reduced availability of inorganic phosphate is of increasing agricultural importance because of the continuing depletion of the rock phosphate reserves {{that are used to}} combat inadequate phosphate levels in the soil. Changes in gene expression, protein levels, enzyme activities and metabolite levels all point to a reconfiguration of the central metabolic network in response to reduced availability of inorganic phosphate, but the metabolic significance of these changes can only be assessed in terms of the fluxes supported by the network. Steady-state metabolic flux analysis was used to define the metabolic phenotype of a heterotrophic Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture grown on a Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0, 1. 25 or 5 mm inorganic phosphate. Fluxes through the central metabolic network were deduced from the redistribution of 13 C into metabolic intermediates and end products when cells were labelled with [1 - 13 C], [2 - 13 C], or [13 C 6]glucose, in combination with 14 C measurements of the rates of biomass accumulation. Analysis of the flux maps showed that reduced levels of phosphate in the growth medium stimulated flux through <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and malic <b>enzyme,</b> altered the balance between cytosolic and plastidic carbohydrate oxidation in favour of the plastid, and increased cell maintenance costs. We argue that plant cells respond to phosphate deprivation by reconfiguring the flux distribution through the pathways of carbohydrate oxidation to take advantage of better phosphate homeostasis in the plastid...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} {{which of the two}} reactions (i. e. phosphorylation or dephosphorylation) involved in the establishment of the phosphorylated status of the wheat leaf <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and sucrose phosphate synthase protein responds in vivo to NO 3 − uptake and assimilation. Detached mature leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Fidel) were fed with N-free (low-NO 3 − leaves) or 40 mm NO 3 − solution (high-NO 3 − leaves). The specific inhibition of the enzyme-protein kinase or phosphatase activities was obtained in vivo by addition of mannose or okadaic acid, respectively, in the uptake solution. Mannose at 50 mm, by blocking the kinase reaction, inhibited the processes of NO 3 −-dependent <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activation and sucrose phosphate synthase deactivation. Following the addition of mannose, the deactivation of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and the activation of sucrose phosphate synthase, both due to the enzyme-protein dephosphorylation, were at the same rate in low-NO 3 − and high-NO 3 − leaves, indicating that NO 3 − had no effect per se on the enzyme-protein phosphatase activity. Upon treatment with okadaic acid, the higher increase of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and decrease of sucrose phosphate synthase activities observed in high NO 3 − compared with low NO 3 − leaves showed evidence that NO 3 − enhanced the protein kinase activity. These results support the concept that NO 3 −, or a product of its metabolism, favors the activation of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and deactivation of sucrose phosphate synthase in wheat leaves by promoting the light activation of the enzyme-protein kinase(s) without affecting the phosphatase(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Bryophyllum fedtschenkoi is a Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} plant whose <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> {{is regulated}} by reversible phosphorylation {{in response to}} a circadian rhythm. A partially purified protein kinase phosphorylated <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> in vitro with a stoichiometry approaching one per subunit and caused a concomitant 5 - to 10 -fold decrease in the sensitivity of the carboxylase to inhibition by malate. The sites phosphorylated in vitro were identical to those phosphorylated in intact tissue. The activity of the protein kinase was controlled in a circadian fashion. During normal diurnal cycles, kinase activity appeared between 4 and 5 h after the onset of darkness and disappeared 2 [...] 3 h before the end of darkness. Kinase activity displayed circadian oscillations in constant environmental conditions. The activity of protein phosphatase 2 A, which dephosphorylates <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> did not oscillate. Treatment of detached leaves with the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide blocked the nocturnal appearance of the protein kinase activity, maintained phosphoenolypyruvate carboxylase in the dephosphorylated state and blocked the circadian rhythms of CO 2 output that is observed in constant darkness and CO 2 -free air.

40|$|The role of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> in {{photosynthesis}} in the C 3 plant Nicotiana tabacum {{has been}} probed by {{measurement of the}} 13 C content of various materials. Whole leaf and purified ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are within the range expected for C 3 plants. Aspartic acid purified following acid hydrolysis of this ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase is enriched in 13 C compared to whole protein. Carbons 1 - 3 of this aspartic acid are in the normal C 3 range, but carbon- 4 (obtained by treatment of the aspartic acid with aspartate β-decarboxylase) has an isotopic composition in the range expected for products of C 4 photosynthesis (− 5 ‰), {{and it appears that}} more than half of the aspartic acid is synthesized by <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> using atmospheric CO 2 /HCO 3 −.

40|$|C 4 {{plants have}} {{developed}} a unique mechanism to suppress the undesirable effects of photorespiration by separating primary and secondary CO 2 fixation in two different leaf tissues. The primary fixation step {{takes place in the}} mesophyll cytoplasm and is controlled by <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> (PEPC). The <b>enzyme</b> catalyses the formation of oxaloacetate from bicarbonate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In maize, the reaction product is rapidly converted to malate and transported into the bundle sheath where it is decarboxylated to pyruvate. The liberated CO 2 is available for refixation by ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and PEP is recycled from pyruvate in the mesophyll. By this, CO 2 is concentrated inside the bundle sheath and the intrinsic oxygenase activity of RUBISCO is inhibited. We analyzed alterations in the chromatin structure on the promoter of the C 4 specific isoform of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase</b> (PEPC) after illumination of seedlings. A protocol was established that facilitates the preparation of nuclei from maize leaves with intact chromatin structure and resistance to DNA degradation during prolonged incubation at high temperatures. The presence of non-spliced transcripts from the C 4 -PEPC gene inside the nuclei was proven by RT-PCR. The chromatin was partially digested with restriction endonucleases. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed a clear increase in the accessibility of the promoter chromatin to restriction dependent on illumination of the seedlings. The data indicate chromatin remodeling on the C 4 -PEPC promoter during activation. In {{the second part of the}} work the technology of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was established with the purpose of investigation of histone modifications. Several experimental approaches were comparatively examined, resulting in establishing a protocol for use the ChIP in the maize system. The method was successfully applied in order to examine exemplary changes in acetylating the histone H 3 and H 4. The obtained data speak strongly for an anew exposure-dependent acetylation of the histones H 4 on the PEPC promoter. Discussion of the data obtained contains their critical analysis in the light of the state of the published biological knowledge. On basis of these findings a model for the activation of the promoter of the C 4 specific PEPC in the chromatin organisation was constructed...|$|R
