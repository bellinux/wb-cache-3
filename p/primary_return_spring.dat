40|$|A non-collinear valve {{actuator}} includes a primary actuating {{system and a}} <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system with each applying forces to a linkage system in order to regulate the flow of a quarter-turn valve. The primary actuating system and <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system are positioned non-collinearly, which simply means the primary actuating system and <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system are not in line with each other. By positioning the primary actuating system and <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system in this manner, the primary actuating system can undergo a larger stroke while the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system experiences significantly less displacement. This allows {{the length of the}} <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to be reduced due to the minimization of displacement thereby reducing the weight of the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> system. By allowing the primary actuating system to undergo longer strokes, the weight of the primary actuating system may also be reduced. Accordingly, the weight of the non-collinear {{valve actuator}} is reduced...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{identification}} of systems with high dry friction and/or <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b> Identified models are optimised by Parameter Estimation toolbox.

50|$|SLR ("Shimano Linear Response") - Integration of a <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> {{into the}} brake lever, pushing the brake cable {{back when the}} lever is released. The idea behind this was that the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> in the actual brake could be {{designed}} to be weaker, thus giving an overall feeling of easier operation.|$|R
50|$|As the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>returns</b> to its {{uncompressed}} state, {{it pushes}} the bolt body backward with sufficient force to cycle the action. The bolt body unlocks and retracts the bolt head, extracts and ejects the cartridge, cocks the hammer, and compresses the <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b> Once the bolt reaches {{the end of}} its travel, the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> provides the force to chamber the next round from the magazine, and lock the bolt closed.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the wheel cylinders are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum. This means that the very common hybrid disc/drum systems only brake with the discs on light pedal pressure unless extra hardware is added. In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|R

50|$|The valves in {{a typical}} {{four-stroke}} engine allow the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder {{at the beginning of}} the cycle and exhaust gases to be expelled at the end of the cycle. In a conventional four-stroke engine valves are opened by a cam and closed by <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b> An engine using desmodromic valves has two cams and two actuators, each for positive opening and closing without a <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another common {{application}} is {{the control of}} the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to pull back and close the throttle.|$|R

50|$|The {{method used}} {{to lock the}} drum against the device frame is {{by the use of}} two {{straight}} knurl edge discs that are thrown outwards by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum's enclosed outer periphery. Two light <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> act as centrifugal force trips and as <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame's lock ring.|$|R

50|$|Many {{languages}} allow, {{through one}} mechanism or another, a function to return multiple values. If this is available, the function can be redesigned {{to return a}} boolean value signalling success or failure, {{in addition to its}} <b>primary</b> <b>return</b> value. If multiple error modes are possible, the function may instead return an enumerated return code (error code) in addition to its <b>primary</b> <b>return</b> value.|$|R

50|$|The older {{mechanically}} designed accelerator pedals {{not only}} provided a <b>spring</b> <b>return,</b> but the mechanism inherently provided some friction. This friction introduced mechanical hysteresis into the pedal force versus pedal position transfer function. Put more simply, once the pedal {{was set at}} a specific position, the friction would help keep the pedal at this setting. This {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain a pedal position. For example, if the driver's foot is slightly jostledby a bump in road, the accelerator pedal would tend to stay at its setting. While these old purely mechanical designs did have somefriction, the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> force was always designed to overcome this friction with a considerable safety margin. The <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> force ensured that throttle returned to zero if the pedal force applied by the driver was reduced or removed.|$|R
50|$|Other {{problems}} may be {{implicated in the}} case of older vehicles equipped with carburetors. Weak, disconnected, or mis-connected throttle <b>return</b> <b>springs,</b> worn shot-pump barrels, chafed cable housings, and cables which jump their tracks in the throttle-body crank can all cause similar acceleration problems.|$|R

50|$|The {{overhead}} valves had single springs {{but there were}} <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the rockers to the pushrods.

Blowback action (no barrel grip with a bolt, locking the barrel reached the mass closure and force the <b>return</b> <b>spring).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{blowback}} system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets. Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts {{to keep the}} breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical. For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a 500 lb bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel {{during the first few}} milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> is limited to 60 lbf N or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.|$|R
50|$|The ZB-26 was a gas-operated, air-cooled, {{selectively}} fired, machine gun. It has a finned, quick-detachable {{barrel and}} fires {{from an open}} bolt. Its action {{is powered by a}} long-stroke gas piston, located below the barrel. The gas block is mounted at the muzzle end of the barrel and also serves as the front sight base. The action is locked by tipping the rear of the bolt (breechblock) upwards, and into a locking recess in the receiver. The <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> is located in the butt of the weapon, and is connected to the bolt carrier/gas piston via a long rod; additionally, there is a short spring buffer located around the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> at the juncture of the receiver and butt, which softensthe impact of the bolt group {{at the end of its}} rearward stroke.|$|R
