5000|$|Saint Palladius of Embrun (Pallade, <b>Pélade,</b> Patllari, Pal·ladi) (d. ca. 541 AD) was a 6th-century {{bishop of}} Embrun. Born to a Christian family, he studied under Catulin, bishop of Embrun, who had {{attended}} the Council of Épaone in 517. [...] When the Arians and Sigismund of Burgundy opposed the council, Catulin was exiled to Vienne. [...] Palladius accompanied him there, {{and took the}} opportunity to extensively study Scripture. [...] Palladius was ordained a priest and, according to legend, gained the gift of prophecy. [...] He is said to have predicted the fall and death of Sigismund. [...] Catulin died around 518, and Palladius would later be elected bishop of Embrun. During his episcopate he built numerous churches, in Chorges, Sauze, and Rama, as well as sanctuaries dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, and Saints Vincent, Orontius, and Victor, as well as to Genesius of Arles. [...] One source states that Palladius [...] "possessed an exceptional efficacy in obtaining whatever he petitioned God for." [...] Many miracles were attributed to him, and, besides the gift of prophecy, he enjoyed a [...] "mystical familiarity with the angels... and successfully defeated the machinations of the devil simply by making the sign of the cross." ...|$|E

40|$|Silk fibres from {{different}} {{components of the}} Antheraea pernyi silkworm cocoon, namely peduncle, outer floss, and cocoon shells (outermost layer and <b>pelade</b> layer) were studied in detail to gain insights into the structure-property-function relationship. Among the fibres {{from different}} components, peduncle fibres are the softest with the largest viscoelastic lag, which may reduce the oscillation amplitude when a cocoon hangs on a twig. Fibres from the outermost layer are the toughest and have the largest breaking energy. Outer floss fibres have the highest content of sericin (about 11. 98 %) but their hardness and elasticity are intermediate. <b>Pelade</b> fibres are shape - preservable and stable with superior hardness and elasticity. The understanding of the properties of different silk fibres is essential for understanding their respective roles in the function of a silk cocoon and will also inspire new designs of protective materials under stringent environmental conditions...|$|E

It is characterized by asymptomatic, solitary or multiple, annular areas of noninflammatory alopecia. Scrapings and cultures are negative, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsies taken from early lesions, which reveal accumulations of lymphocytes around the bulbs of anagen hair follicles. There is no known effective and practical treatment for affected cattle.

40|$|Conserved regions about 420 bp long of the <b>pelADE</b> cluster {{specific}} to Erwinia chrysanthemi were amplified by PCR {{and used to}} differentiate 78 strains of E. chrysanthemi that were obtained from different hosts and geographical areas. No PCR products were obtained from DNA samples extracted from other pectinolytic and nonpectinolytic species and genera. The pel fragments amplified from the E. chrysanthemi strains studied were compared by performing a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. On the basis of similarity coefficients derived from the RFLP analysis, the strains were separated into 16 PCR RFLP patterns grouped in six clusters, These clusters appeared to be correlated with other infraspecific levels of E. chrysanthemi classification, such as pathovar and biovar, and occasionally with geographical origin. Moreover, the clusters correlated well with the polymorphism of pectate lyase and pectin methylesterase isoenzymes. While the pectin methylesterase profiles correlated with host monocot-dicot classification, the pectate lyase polymorphism might reflect the cell wall microdomains of the plants belonging to these classes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{have used}} filter {{hybridization}} and nucleotide sequencing to analyse {{the relationship between the}} three genes of the <b>pelADE</b> cluster in the Erwinia chrysanthemi (Ech) strain B 374. This cluster encodes for three of the five pectate lyase proteins that are involved in the maceration and soft-rotting of plant tissue, an important trait in Ech pathogenicity. Southern hybridization revealed homology between each of the three pel genes. A 3560 bp DNA fragment containing the pelE and pelD genes was sequenced. These two genes show extensive homology in the coding regions but only low homology in the 5 ' and 3 ' non-coding regions. However both genes exhibit sequences homologous to the Escherichia coli CAP-binding site consensus sequence upstream of the start codon and an inverted repeat sequence which may act as a rho-independent transcriptional terminator after the translational stop. The pel genes of Ech B 374 were also compared with the already sequenced pel genes of EC 16, another Ech strain. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePectinolytic {{bacteria}} {{have been}} recently isolated from diseased potato plants exhibiting blackleg and slow wilt symptoms {{found in a}} number of European countries and Israel. These Gram-reaction-negative, motile, rods were identified as belonging to the genus Dickeya, previously the Pectobacterium chrysanthemi complex (Erwinia chrysanthemi, on the basis of production of a PCR product with the <b>pelADE</b> primers, 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl esterase analysis, the production of phosphatases and the ability to produce indole and acids from alpha-methylglucoside. Differential physiological assays used previously to differentiate between strains of E chrysanthemi, showed that these isolates belonged to biovar 3. Eight of the isolates, seven from potato and one from hyacinth, were analysed together with 21 reference strains representing all currently recognized taxa within the genus Dickeya. The novel isolates formed a distinct genetic clade in multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using concatenated sequences of the intergenic spacer (IGS), as well as dnaX, recA, dnaN, fusA, gapA, purA, rpIB, rpoS and gyrA. Characterization by whole-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, pulsed field gel electrophoresis after digestion of whole-genome DNA with rare-cutting restriction enzymes, average nucleotide identity analysis and DNA DNA hybridization studies, showed that although related to Dickeya dadantii, these isolates represent a novel species within the genus Dickeya, for which the name Dickeya solani sp. nov. (type strain IPO 2222 (T) =LMG 25993 (T) =NCPP 134479 (T)) is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} {{genetic analysis}} (J. W. Willis, J. K. Engwall, and A. K. Chatterjee, Phytopathology 77 : 1199 - 1205, 1987) had revealed a tight linkage between pel- 3 (pel, pectate lyase gene) and peh- 1 (peh, polygalacturonase gene) within the chromosome of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. Nucleotide sequencing, transcript assays, and expression of enzymatic activities in Escherichia coli have now confirmed that a 3, 500 -bp segment contains the open reading frames (ORFs) for Pel- 3 and Peh- 1. The 1, 041 -bp pel- 3 ORF and the 1, 206 -bp peh- 1 ORF {{are separated by}} a 579 -bp sequence. The genes are transcribed divergently from their own promoters. In E. coli and E. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71, peh- 1 is better expressed than pel- 3. However, plant signals activate the expression of both the genes in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. A consensus integration host factor (IHF) -binding sequence upstream of pel- 3 appears physiologically significant, since pel- 3 promoter activity is higher in an E. coli IHF+ strain than in an IHF- strain. While peh- 1 has extensive homology with plant and bacterial peh genes, pel- 3 appears not to have significant homology with the pel genes belonging to the pelBC, <b>pelADE,</b> or periplasmic pel families. Pel- 3 also is unusual {{in that it is}} predicted to contain an ATP- and GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) not found in the other Pels...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of potato blackleg in Israel, caused by Dickeya spp., on plants grown from seed tubers imported from Northern Europe, {{are of a}} great concern. The warm climatic conditions {{during the growing season}} favour disease expression, and may result in the establishment of the pathogen in the potato ecosystem and a spread to weeds and other crops (Tsror et al., 2009). Until recently, most of Dickeya spp. strains found in association with potato blackleg in Europe were characterised as D. dianthicola (biovars 1 or 7). These strains have a relatively lowgrowth temperature compared with other Dickeya spp. and seem to be more adapted to cool European climate conditions. However, during the last three years, Dickeya spp. strainsbelonging to a new biovar 3 clade, probably constituting a newspecies, have been isolated from potato tubers inseveral countries in Northern Europe (Slawiak et al., 2009 and references therein). To study dissemination to weeds, surveys were conducted in potato fields where Dickeya-infected potato plants were detected during two consecutive spring seasons (2009 and 2010). Symptomless plants of 12 species of local weeds were randomly collected: Cyperus rotundus,Orobanche aegyptiaca, Amaranthus spinosus, Polygonum equisetiforme, Chenopodium sp., Heliotropium sp., Centaurea iberica, Sorghum haepense, Malva nicaeensis, Cynodon dactylon, Amaranthus blitum and Solanum elaeagnifolium. Roots or tubers (in the case of C. rotundus) of 15 plants of each weed were washed, surface sterilised and then sample homogenates were plated on crystal violet pectate medium (CVP). Cavity forming bacteria were transferred to nutrient agar and analysed. Dickeya spp. were isolated only from the perennial weed C. rotundus. Incidence of infected plants was 6. 7 and 14. 3 % in 2009 and 2010, respectively). DNA extracted from the bacteria isolated from C. rotundus was positive in a PCR amplification procedure using <b>pelADE</b> specific primers which are specific for E. chrysanthemi (Nassar et al., 1996). Isolates were identified by biochemical assays as biovar 3 (Palacio-Bielsa et al., 2006). They were characterised as the new genetic clade, using dnaX sequence (Slawiak et al., 2009) and REP-PCR analyses (Tsror et al., 2009). These isolates caused maceration of potato tubers at 30 °C (Laurila et al., 2008) and formed clear haloes on a polygalacturonic acid medium (Collmer et al., 1988). This is the first report of Dickeya spp. latent infection {{in one of the most}} prevalent weeds in potato fields in Israel. C. rotundus is difficult to control because of resistance to most herbicides. Therefore, it may serve as an alternative host for Dickeya spp. allowing the pathogen to survive in the absence of a host crop...|$|E
