The mixed core configurations {{are made by}} replacement of the low enriched uranium control fuel elements with highly enriched uranium control fuel elements in the reference core. The MTR_PC package, a nuclear reactor analysis tool, is used to perform the analysis. Simulations were carried out to compute effective delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>fraction</b> and <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> lifetime. Calculation of kinetic parameters is necessary for reactivity and power excursion transient analysis. The results of this research show that effective delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>fraction</b> decreases and <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> lifetime increases with the fuels burn-up.

The best-estimate values for the total delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>fraction</b> from fission products are 0. 00665 and 0. 00661 for the HEU fueled core at startup and end-of-cycle, respectively. For the LEU fuel the best estimate values are 0. 00650 and 0. 00648 at startup and end-of-cycle, respectively. The present recommendations for the delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>fractions</b> from fission products are smaller than the value reported previously of 0. 00726 for the HEU fuel. The best-estimate values for the contribution from photoneutrons will remain as 0. 000316, independent of the fuel or time in the cycle. The values of the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> lifetime as calculated with MCNP 5 - 1. 60 are compared to values calculated with two other independent methods and the results are in reasonable agreement with each other. The recommended, conservative values of the neutron lifetime for the HEU fuel are 650 {micro}s and 750 {micro}s for the startup and end-of-cycle conditions, respectively. For LEU fuel the recommended, conservative values are 600 {micro}s and 700 {micro}s for the startup and end-of-cycle conditions, respectively. In all three calculations, the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> lifetime was determined to be longer for the end-of-cycle equilibrium condition when compared to the startup condition.

In this context {{the present paper}} is focusing on the even–odd effects (in both Zand N) appearing in <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> and gamma ray emission. The study of even–odd effects in the prompt emission of four fissioning nuclei with even Zand even N, 233, 235 U(nth, f), 239 Pu(nth, f) and 252 Cf(SF), shows that these effects are mainly due to the Zeven–odd effects in fragment distributions and charge deviations and the Neven–odd effect in average neutron separation energies. The most pronounced even–odd effect in prompt emission is for the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity. The average multiplicity {{as a function of}} Z, ν(Z), has a sawtoothshape and exhibits a visible staggering for asymmetric fragmentations. The size of the global even–odd effect in <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity shows a decrease with increasing fissility. The Neven–odd effect in average neutron separation energy influences the global even–odd effect in <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity often in an opposite way compared to the Zeven–odd effect. The average <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity as a function of TKE shows an increase of the Zeven–odd effect with increasing TKE and this effect is decreasing for heavier fissioning systems. The Zeven–odd effects in the average prompt γ-ray energy and the average <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> energy have comparable sizes and are lower than the even–odd effects in <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity.

A more generalized form of the fission fragment residual nuclear temperature distribution and a possible anisotropy effect of the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> emission in the center-of-mass system are taken into account, too. The multi-modal fission parameters entering the <b>prompt</b> fission <b>neutron</b> spectrum model are determined {{on the basis of the}} experimental data concerning the fission frament total kinetic energy TKE(A) and mass distribution Y(A) measured at IRMM. The calculated <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> spectrum is obtained in better agreement with the standard point-wise evaluation of Mannhart and compared to other evaluations made with different models.

40|$|The <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> {{averaged}} {{number and}} the dependence of <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> yield on fragment mass ν(A) of photofission of actinide nuclei 235 U and 238 U in the giant dipole resonance energy range has been parameterized. This allows us to describe the observed changes of saw-tooth behavior of neutron yield from the light and heavy fragments using few energy and nucleon composition dependent free parameters and to predict ν(A) for other actinide isotopes.

40|$|The double-energy double-velocity (2 E- 2 v) method allows {{assessing}} fission-fragment mass yields {{prior to}} and after <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> emission with high resolution. It is, therefore, considered as a complementary technique to assess average <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity {{as a function of}} fragment properties. We have studied the intrinsic features of the 2 E- 2 v method by means of event-wise generated fission-fragment data and found severe short-comings in the method itself as well as in some common practice of application. We find that the 2 E- 2 v method leads to large deviations in the correlation between the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity and pre-neutron mass, which deforms and exaggerates the so called `sawtooth' shape of ν̅(A). We have identified the treatment of <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> emission from the fragments as the origin of the problem. The intrinsic nature of this deficiency, risk to render 2 E- 2 v experiments much less interesting. We suggest a method to correct the 2 E- 2 v data, and recommend applying this method to previous data acquired in 2 E- 2 v experiments, as well. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
