40|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>protionamide</b> with alizarin red S (ARS) and its analytical application were carefully investigated in this contribution. The interaction conditions were carefully studied and optimized by cyclic voltammetry. Under the optimum conditions, the cyclic voltammetry curve of ARS showed an oxidation peak with the peak potential of 0. 57 [*]V. After {{the addition of}} <b>protionamide</b> to the ARS solution, the peak potential was negatively moved, and meanwhile the oxidation peak current decreased apparently to the concentration of <b>protionamide</b> and then a new method for the <b>protionamide</b> determination was established. The linear equation between the decreasing current (Δip) and <b>protionamide</b> concentration was got as Δip (μA) = 0. 01514 C (mg/L) − 0. 01553 [*][*](n= 9;[*]r= 0. 991) with the linear range of 10. 0 ~ 50. 0 [*]mg/L, and the detection limit (3 σ) was got as 8. 25 [*]μg/mL. The effects of coexisting substances on the determination were carefully investigated and the <b>protionamide</b> artificial and tablet samples were detected with satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{stability}} and the kinetics of thermal decomposition of <b>protionamide</b> were studied by thermogravimetry. Activation energy E-a of thermal decomposition of this substance was obtained to be 54. 65 kJ center dot mol(- 1) by Kissinger method and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method. Kinetics model function and frequency factor A of <b>protionamide</b> were predicted with the Malek method, which were f(alpha) =alpha(0. 391) (1 -alpha) (0. 145) and InA= 13. 12, respectively.

40|$|AbstractWith mycobacteriosis increasing, {{the study}} of non-tuberculous {{mycobacteria}} is imperative for clinical therapy and management. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are naturally resistant to most anti-tuberculosis drugs. Accordingly, {{it is important to}} decipher the biology of the novel non-tuberculous mycobacteria through complete genomic analysis of novel pathogenic mycobacteria. We describe Mycobacterium sinense JDM 601, a novel, slow-growing mycobacterium of the Mycobacterium terrae complex resistant to nine antibiotics, by clinical presentation, cultural and biochemical characteristics, minimal inhibitory concentrations, and genome-sequencing analysis. JDM 601 is closest to Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum according to mycolic acid composition, but closest to Mycobacterium algericum sp. nov according to 16 S rDNA. JDM 601 is resistant to isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, euteropas, <b>protionamide,</b> capromycin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin and levofloxacin but not ethambutol. The clinical information, mycolic acid composition, and virulence genes indicate that JDM 601 is an opportunistic pathogen...|$|E
40|$|The BACTEC MGIT 960 system, a fully automated, nonradiometric, noninvasive {{system for}} {{detection}} and drug susceptibility testing of mycobacteria, was evaluated for {{the ability to}} test susceptibilities to second-line drugs. In this study, which {{was carried out in}} three phases (phase I, mostly susceptible strains; phase II, mostly resistant strains; phase III, final testing of the optimal drug concentrations found in phases I and II), we established the critical concentrations for seven drugs to be tested in the BACTEC MGIT 960 system compared to the BACTEC 460 TB system. The critical concentrations for the seven drugs used in the MGIT 960 system are as follows: amikacin, 1. 0 μg/ml; capreomycin, 2. 5 μg/ml; ethionamide, 5. 0 μg/ml; <b>protionamide,</b> 2. 5 μg/ml; ofloxacin, 2. 0 μg/ml; rifabutin, 0. 5 μg/ml; linezolid, 1. 0 μg/ml. Our results demonstrate that the BACTEC MGIT 960 system is an accurate method for rapid testing of the susceptibilities of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Resistance of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tb) strains is {{an increasing}} problem worldwide. Since no public health data are available for urban populations in Germany, we investigated resistance in our hospitalized patients (n= 1, 011) over the last 7 yrs. We therefore evaluated clinical data and results of susceptibility tests (breakpoint technique/proportion method) for isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, pyrazinamide, <b>protionamide</b> and ethambutol. Since 1987, {{there has been a}} relatively constant rate of 5. 9 % (3. 9 %– 7. 8 %) for single-drug resistance (SDR), but an increasing rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains (≥ 2 first-line drugs) from 1. 7 % in 1987 to 5. 8 % in 1993. Sixty nine percent of patients with MDR strains showed resistance to two drugs, and 31 % to three or more drugs. Risk factors for SDR and MDR tuberculosis revealed previous therapy (odds ratio (OR) (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)); SDR 2. 2 (1. 7 – 4. 0); MDR 4. 5 (2. 3 – 8. 8)); and foreign-born status (SDR 2. 2 (1. 3 – 3. 6); MDR 3. 5 (1. 8 – 6. 8)) {{to be the most important}} factors associated with resistance. Both primary and acquire...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) {{is a major}} global concern since, despite a complex treatment regime, it still remains a lethal threat. A 21 -yr-old male HIV-negative migrant from Burma presented with a disseminated tuberculosis affecting the lung, spleen, liver, mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes. This particular strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis proved to be resistant to all but one (pyrazinamide) of the first-line drugs, i. e. rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, plus streptomycin, rifabutin and ofloxacin. On the mere account of its susceptibility concerning kanamycin {{it could not be}} labelled as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. After 1 month of a standard first-line four-drug regimen and a subsequent 4 months of second-line treatment with amikacin, moxifloxacin, terizidone, <b>protionamide,</b> linezolid and pyrazinamide, sputum cultures eventually yielded constantly negative results. Likewise, the organ manifestations decreased significantly, so as to be virtually undetectable in computed tomography scans after 1 yr of continuous treatment. A moderate pancytopenia reversed completely after dose adjustment of linezolid. Disseminated tuberculosis manifestations without typical pulmonary cavernous lesions are likely to represent primary infection rather than reactivation. Even a multiorgan disseminated MDR-TB with an extensive resistance pattern (including fluoroquinolones) can be successfully treated with an individual second-line treatment and result in considerably few adverse events...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective. Since 1990, the {{tuberculosis}} {{incidence rate}} in Eastern Europe and post-Soviet republics {{has been increasing}} in many countries including Kazakhstan. This problem is particularly important in Kazakhstan regions with limited financial resources, among them – in South Kazakhstan province. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the main clinical and antibiotic-related economic aspects of tuberculosis treatment in South Kazakhstan province. Material and Methods. In total, 502 patients participated in the study. They were hospitalized to the tuberculosis dispensary of Sayram district (South Kazakhstan province) in 2007 – 2013. Statistical analysis included logistic regression for better treatment outcomes and analysis of antibiotic treatment costs. Results. Two-thirds of patients had infiltrative tuberculosis (67 %). Positive treatment outcomes were determined in 85 % of cases. The patients were mostly treated with cycloserine, <b>protionamide,</b> capreomycin, and ofloxacin. The majority of antibiotic costs were related to the treatment with capreomycin. In case of the positive results of the test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, antibiotic expenses were almost 3 times greater than in case of negative test results (P< 0. 001). Conclusions. The majority of patients had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. The negative results of the test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis at discharge were not related to pretreatment factors. Antibiotic-related costs were significantly higher in case of the positive results of the test of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but were not associated with gender, residence place, hospitalization recurrence, or main blood test results before treatment...|$|E
