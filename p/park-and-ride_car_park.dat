50|$|West of {{the station}} {{building}} is the city’s central bus station, in the forecourt there are a taxi rank, parking spaces and bicycle stands; further east is a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{the south}} side of the tracks there is a large <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with almost 1,000 parking spaces. There are nearly 1,600, mostly covered, spaces for {{bicycles}} in several places around the station.|$|E
50|$|Next to {{the railway}} station is a bus station, from which buses depart to {{all parts of}} the town and the local area.A <b>Park-and-Ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> and taxi stand are also {{available}} at the station.|$|E
50|$|The busway {{includes}} six dedicated stations, {{some with}} extensive <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> Feeder bus services serve the stations, allowing transfer. Many services travel on {{portions of the}} busway as parts of local routes.|$|R
5000|$|Park {{and ride}} {{facilities}} allowing parking {{at a distance}} and allowing continuation by public transport or ride sharing. <b>Park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are commonly found at metro stations, freeway entrances in suburban areas, and {{at the edge of}} smaller cities.|$|R
50|$|The {{line length}} is 14.5 km and it serves 31 tram halts. The Hauts-de-Chazal quarter {{is linked to}} Chaprais via the city centre. Alternate trams travel not to Chaprais, but instead follow a short branch line to Besançon-Viotte station. There are five <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> served, which {{together}} offer <b>parking</b> for 630 <b>cars.</b> There is talk of increasing <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> capacity to 1030. A southern extension to the existing line is envisioned, and a new line, planned for 2025, is to link Chalezeule with the Technology Park {{to the west of}} Besançon-Viotte.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{station is}} the main bus station, opened in 2006, and a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> At the bus station is the {{information}} centre of the Verkehrsgemeinschaft Aalen (Aalen Transport Corporation). In 2003 a bike parking area with 204 places was opened, which is under video surveillance for protection from theft.|$|E
50|$|The four-track {{railway station}} {{is about a}} {{kilometre}} from the Altmuehltal exit from the A 9 autobahn. It has a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with 100 spaces for cars and has several lay-bys for buses. From there, a ramp leads to platform 1, while an underpass connects to platform 4, which has a ramp at each end.|$|E
50|$|Attached to {{the station}} is a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with 500 places, which is {{directly}} accessible from the A 831 autobahn. The station is otherwise only accessible by foot. Above the station is the STEP business park with numerous offices, including the headquarters of Debitel. Near the station are also the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure building and the Michael Bauer School (a Waldorf school).|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Camber, Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on New Lydd road {{which also has}} a large {{overflow}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> opposite, Central <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> and the new <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on the old crazy golf site on Old Lydd road. Central also has a large overflow <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Only Central has {{direct access to the}} beach, as you have to negotiate long steep sandy paths over the dunes to reach the beach from Western <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> unsuitable for prams, or wheelchairs. The Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> closes at 8pm in the summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{shopping}} centre has 800 <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces, with a ground <b>car</b> <b>park</b> {{as well as}} a rooftop <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
50|$|FEC {{is among}} the top three <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> chain brands in Australia. The market share (2015) was {{approximately}} 20%. As at 30 September 2015, the Group’s <b>car</b> <b>park</b> portfolio comprised 351 <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> with approximately 70,700 <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> bays.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} served by line S 1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. Platform track 5 is used for S-Bahn {{services}} towards Bad Cannstatt and track 6 for services towards Esslingen. Tracks 2 and 4 are used for long-distance passenger and freight traffic. Tracks 1 and 3 have been removed. The platforms can be reached through a tunnel, which runs between the main station building and the <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Long Stanton {{railway station}} on the Cambridge and Huntingdon line {{operated}} between 1847 and 1970. [...] Despite surviving the Beeching Axe, passenger services to Long Stanton were ended in 1970. The route of the railway was developed as the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, the world's longest guided busway. The busway opened in August 2011 {{and there is a}} stop with a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> at Longstanton close {{to the site of the}} old railway station. [...] There are frequent daily services from Longstanton to Cambridge and St Ives along the busway. A bus service links Longstanton and surrounding villages with Cambridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} service gradually recovered, {{despite a}} further {{threat to the}} station's future following publication of the Serpell Report in 1982. However, in 1985 the grand but decaying station buildings were demolished and the remaining platform was shortened. A new station car park {{was built on the}} site of the old station buildings and platforms, while the goods yard site was sold for housing development. The 'new' station was unstaffed, and 'pay trains' were introduced between Edinburgh and North Berwick on 27 May 1985. Although the loss of the old station buildings was lamented by many local people, the reduction in operating costs and the provision of a <b>park-and-ride</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> contributed to the revitalisation of the line. By the end of the 1980s the service was once again operating on an hourly frequency.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in the {{immediate}} area for the railway station. They are operated by the railway <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and National <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> (NCP).|$|R
50|$|Parking at {{the centre}} is free, however some parking has a three-hour time limit. Out of the 6300 <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> {{approximately}} 2700 are undercover. Along the southern {{fringe of the}} shopping centre is a two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with centre entrances to both levels scattered throughout. A two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is also located {{at the rear of}} the centre with entrances to the Gallery North and Loft malls. The majority of disabled <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are located on the top deck of this <b>car</b> <b>park</b> near the Loft entrance. A four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R
25|$|Travellers by car {{can reach}} the airport via the M2 motorway. The airport {{operates}} four <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> three on-site <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and one off-site <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The on-site short stay and main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are situated within easy {{walking distance of the}} terminal building and an on demand courtesy bus operates to and from the on-site long stay <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The off-site short or long stay <b>car</b> <b>park</b> called 'Park and Fly' is located just before the main entrance to the airport and is also serviced by a courtesy bus.|$|R
50|$|With 778 {{parking spaces}} for private cars, the {{multi-storey}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was, as at December 2011, {{the second largest}} Transport Department multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>park</b> after Rumsey Street <b>Car</b> <b>Park.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Car</b> <b>parking</b> {{charges were}} {{introduced}} to the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> surrounding the shopping centre in 2004. The centre has 5 large <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> providing approximately 4,000 parking spaces. It is estimated that almost 90% of shoppers to the centre arrive by car despite the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> charges a maximum of £5.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two free}} <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> both reached from the {{entrance}} on Worden Lane. During the busy summer months an overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is opened next to the main <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> fits more <b>cars</b> per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> lots and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> structures.|$|R
25|$|The onsite parking {{facility}} is shared with Wembley Arena, essentially being {{the open air}} surface parking surrounding the eastern flank of Wembley Stadium and the multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> These are called Green <b>Car</b> <b>Park</b> and Red <b>Car</b> <b>Park,</b> respectively.
