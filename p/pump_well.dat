40|$|A Fortran {{program was}} {{developed}} to determine the optimal locations of an artificial recharge well. Three objective functions were considered: (1) maximizing the recovery rates, (2) maximizing the injection rates, and (3) minimizing the coefficient of variation of the increased pumping rates. We also suggested a new aggregate objective function which combined {{the first and the}} third objective functions. The model results showed that locating the injection well inside the cluster of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> was desirable if either the recovery or the injection rate was taken into account. However, the injection well located outside the cluster evenly increased the pumping rates in existing <b>pumping</b> <b>wells.</b> Therefore, for clustered <b>pumping</b> <b>wells,</b> installing an injection well at the center or the upstream of the <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> seems beneficial. For linear arrangement of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> parallel to the constant head boundary, locating the injection well in the upstream was recommended.

In {{order to}} improve the pump {{efficiency}} of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells,</b> {{by means of the}} basic formula of pump efficiency, the mathematical model and boundary conditions of dynamic control chart is obtained, and the pump efficiency of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> is drawn. Analysis shown that the pump efficiency is sensitive to the water content and pump leak rate. The higher the water content is, the higher pump efficiency is. The pump efficiency will be reduced with the increasing of pump leak rate. The dynamic control chart of class II block of A oilfield is given in the paper. After taking the measures, the pump efficiency of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> is obviously improved. The dynamic control chart drawn by this method can provide a scientific basis for improving the pump efficiency of <b>pumping</b> <b>wells</b> in oilfield...|$|R

40|$|Drawdowns {{generated}} by extracting {{water from a}} large diameter (e. g. water supply) well are affected by wellbore storage. We present an analytical solution in Laplace transformed space for drawdown in a uniform anisotropic aquifer caused by withdrawing water at a constant rate from a partially penetrating well with storage. The solution is back transformed into the time domain numerically. When the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> is fully penetrating our solution reduces to that of Papadopulos and Cooper [1967]; Hantush [1964] when the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> has no wellbore storage; Theis [1935] when both conditions are fulfilled and Yang et. al.

30|$|The <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> {{simulated}} {{water removal}} {{at a point}} (cell), imitating the owkura, by pumping at the rate similar to the median kariz flow rate, 1900  m 3  day− 1. The results of this simulation (Fig.  11 b) show nearly horizontal flow lines in regions that are upgradient and downgradient of the kariz and <b>pumping</b> <b>well,</b> and strong upward flow to the lower section of the kariz and the <b>pumping</b> <b>well.</b> The constant-head gradient across the model used in this simulation was only 0.5, much lower than expected for a typical kariz. For this reason, the conservative multiplier for estimating kariz discharge (doubling the discharge when doubling the kariz gradient; “Effect of water-table slope, water-table contact with kariz, and model dimensions”) was used to adjust the discharge as calculated by the zone budget. With this adjustment, when the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> removed 1900  m 3  day− 1 (prescribed), the kariz discharge was about 1860  m 3  day− 1, {{very close to the}} target amount.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pumping of {{groundwater}} near a stream induces the infiltration of stream {{water into the}} nearby aquifers, and this induced stream infiltration may result in concems about water quality at the well. This paper analyzes the migration process of the infiltrated stream water toward a <b>pumping</b> <b>well.</b> MODFLOW is used to simulate the surface water infiltration from a shallow stream to an alluvial aquifer, and MODPATH is used to record {{the locations of the}} infiltrated water particles during their movement to the well. Pathelines were plotted over a cross-section, which is perpendicular to the stream and contains the <b>pumping</b> <b>well,</b> to show the hydraulic connectivity between the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> and the stream. The area of influence zone, as well as the travel time, was used to characterize the migration processes of the stream water particles. Generally, the movement of the infiltrated stream water in the nearby aquifer is very slow, and it often takes more than six months for the infiltrated stream water to arrive at the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> located only several hundred meters from the stream. A number of variables reduce the hydraulic connectivity and thus the migration process between the stream and the well. They include a deep <b>pumping</b> <b>well,</b> a short <b>pumping</b> duration and small pumping rate, a larger distance between the stream and the <b>pumping</b> <b>well,</b> a smaller vertical hydraulic conductivity, a low-permeability streambed, an aquitard located below the stream but above the top of the well screen, and a regional hydraulic gradient toward the stream.

40|$|Tools for {{analyzing}} aquifer test data at the <b>pumping</b> or injection <b>well</b> are limited for aquifer {{conditions that are}} not axially symmetric about the <b>pumping</b> <b>well.</b> Accurate simulations of head change at a <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> can be generated with MODFLOW using a discretization scheme that (1) captures steep gradients adjacent to the cell(s) containing the <b>pumping</b> or injection <b>well</b> and (2) approximates radial flow despite rectangular prism well cell(s). This scheme {{is based on a}} very small incremental cell width adjacent to the <b>pumping</b> or injection <b>well</b> cell, and then a logarithmic increase in cell width outward with the expansion factor, α, in the range of 1. 2 to 1. 5. The validity of this scheme has been demonstrated by comparing model results with analytical solutions and RADMOD (axisymmetric adaptation of MODFLOW) for three radially symmetric confined aquifer scenarios, and with the analytical solution for a nonaxisymmetric confined aquifer scenario. Utility of this scheme is demonstrated with simulation of time-drawdown behavior at the Goddard 2 <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> in Boise, Idaho where four observation wells did not respond during a pumping test and where 28. 8 m of drawdown occurred in the <b>pumping</b> <b>well</b> during the first 2 min of the test.

50|$|The {{machine has}} a heated {{crucible}} for the hot type metal, with a mechanically actuated plunger which operates {{as part of}} the injection cycle. The pot on the machine was usually left on overnight during the week, with some flux added to the pot to reduce oxidation. At the end of each week, the plunger assembly had to be disassembled (while hot), removed, and the <b>pump</b> <b>well</b> cleaned using a scraper (as with linecasting machines). After reassembly, heat was removed for the weekend. In the present day, most machines are heated up only for that day's casting, with the heat turned off each night.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} using {{backward}} feeding. In this process, the dilute products are {{fed into the}} last effect which has the lowest temperature and are transferred from effect to effect, with the temperature increasing. The final concentrate is collected in the hottest effect, which provides an advantage in that the product is highly viscous in the last stages, and so the heat transfer is better. Since some years there are also in operation multiple-effect vacuum evaporators with heat <b>pump,</b> <b>well</b> known to be energetically and technically more effective than systems with mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) because due to the lower boiling temperature they can handle highly corrosive liquids or which may form incrustations.|$|E
50|$|Black Weir, {{formerly}} Black School Weir, is {{the most}} upstream weir of those on Ross River. Built in the early 1930s, Black Weir is a hollow buttress weir with an ogee shaped face on the downstream side, a sloped face on the upstream face and stone pitched abutments. The weir's name {{is derived from the}} name of Black School which abutted Ross River near the location of weir when it was constructed. Following damage to the weir due to flooding, the weir underwent major renovations in 1934. These renovations included the addition of a second <b>pump</b> <b>well,</b> the addition of further buttresses and the underpinning of the original structure. It took until 1936 to fill the reservoir behind the weir, but only provided a few years water supply. During World War II the large influxes of population as a result of Townsville's heavy military presence necessitated the provision of more water. In 1940 a galvanized iron wall was erected atop Black Weir to provide additional storage capacity to supplement the town's water supply. This continued for many years in order to provide additional water which could be pumped from the weir.|$|E
