40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} a salvage therapy (ST-HD- 86) {{for patients with}} progressive and relapsed Hodgkin's disease after primary treatment in the pediatric DAL/GPOH studies. The essential chemotherapeutic regimens were ifosfamide, etoposide, and prednisone (IEP) and doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with progression (n = 51) or first relapse (n = 125) were enrolled by 67 centers. The median time from initial diagnosis to progression/relapse was 1. 1 year (range, 0. 1 to 15. 3 years), and the patients' median age was 14. 7 years (range, 4. 3 to 24. 5 years). Salvage chemotherapy consisted of two to three cycles of IEP alternating with one to two cycles of ABVD supplemented in part by one to two cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone or lomustine (CCNU), etoposide, and <b>prednimustine.</b> Radiotherapy was given to involved areas using individualized doses. In the 1990 s, additional high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT) was introduced for patients with unfavorable prognosis. RESULTS: Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after 10 years are 62 % and 75 %, respectively (SE, 4 % each). Of 176 patients, 73 suffered second events. The risk-factor analysis revealed the time to progression/relapse as the strongest prognostic factor (P =. 0001). Patients with progression have an inferior outcome (DFS, 41 %; OS, 51 %), whereas patients with late relapse (> 12 months after end of therapy) do well (DFS, 86 %; OS, 90 %), although none of them received SCT in second remission. CONCLUSION: The result can be considered favorable. Whereas the salvage strategy for progressive disease has to be optimized further, {{it is possible to}} reduce intensity and avoid SCT in late relapses after Hodgkin's disease in childhood/adolescence...|$|E
40|$|One-hundred, twenty-eight {{patients}} with Hodgkin's disease in remission {{or who had}} failed a mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP), a doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) and/or lomustine, etoposide and <b>prednimustine</b> (CEP) regimens have been treated with a high-dose therapy (HDT) containing cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine (CVB) and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Forty patients were treated {{while they were in}} resistant or progressive disease states using alternating MOPP/ABVD protocol: 15 patients received ABMT in first relapse, 51 patients had a complete remission (CR) with first-line therapy but later relapsed and then received conventional salvage therapy; 16 achieved no response or progression (″resistant relapse″ patients) and 35 responded partially or completely (″sensitive-relapse″ patients). The other 22 patients received ABMT in remission. Following HDT, 56 patients (52. 8 %) achieved CR and 23 patients (21. 6 %) achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 74. 4 %. Sixteen patients failed to respond and died in progressive disease 1 to 10 months (median 6 months) after ABMT. High-dose therapy produced severe toxicity including vomiting (100 %), mucositis (75 %) and liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase elevations (51 %). There were 10 treatment-related deaths. A multivariate analysis identified poor performance status and resistant-relapse patients as very important adverse risk factors for survival immediately after ABMT. These results, while validating this procedure for inducing remissions in advanced highly-treated patients, at the same time confirm the need of employing this approach in first relapse or in second complete remission after standard therapy and before ABMT or, in first complete remission in very high risk Hodgkin's disease patients. Our experience in 15 very poor prognosis Hodgkin's disease patients transplanted in first CR demostrated to be much significant...|$|E
