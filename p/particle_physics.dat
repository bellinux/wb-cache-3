5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, <b>particle</b> <b>physics</b> has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy <b>particle</b> <b>physics</b> observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E
