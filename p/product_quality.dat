5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired <b>product</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{quality of}} {{software}} is achieved during its development. Development teams use various techniques to investigate, evaluate and control potential quality {{problems in their}} systems. These “Quality Attribute Techniques ” target specific <b>product</b> <b>qualities</b> such as safety or security. This paper proposes a framework to capture important characteristics of these techniques. The framework is intended to support process tailoring, by facilitating the selection of techniques for inclusion into process models that target specific <b>product</b> <b>qualities.</b> We use risk management as a theory to accommodate techniques for many <b>product</b> <b>qualities</b> and lifecycle phases. Safety techniques have motivated the framework, and safety and performance techniques {{have been used to}} evaluate the framework.

40|$|International audienceCompanies {{increasingly}} rely on {{product differentiation}} and personalization strategies {{to provide their}} customers with an expansive catalog, and tools {{to assist them in}} finding the product meeting their needs. These tools include product search facilities, recommender systems, and product configurators. They typically represent a product as a set of features, which refer to a large number of technical specifications (e. g. size, weight, battery life). However, customers usually communicate and reason about products in terms of their qualities (e. g. ease-of-use, portability, ergonomics). In this paper, we tackle the problem of formalizing <b>product</b> <b>qualities</b> in the requirements of product-centred applications. Our goal is to extract <b>product</b> <b>qualities</b> from their technical features, so that customers can better perceive and evaluate the proposed products. To this end, we design a procedure for identifying segments of textual product documentation related to specific <b>product</b> <b>qualities,</b> and propose an approach based on fuzzy modeling to represent <b>product</b> <b>qualities</b> on top of technical specifications. Preliminary experiments we carried out on a catalog of cameras tend to show that fuzzy modeling is an appropriate formalism for representing <b>product</b> <b>qualities.</b> We also illustrate how modeled qualities can support the design of product configurators that are centered on the customers' needs...|$|R
