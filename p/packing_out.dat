You see, for his size even a rat is worth {{considerable}} more, {{and is therefore}} not to be despised.

The marriage-ceremony, {{witnessed}} on the 17th, was one of the sublimest for Kur-Pfalz and kindred; and it too had secretly a touch of tragedy in it for the Poor Karl Albert. A double marriage: Two young Princesses, Grand-daughters, priceless Heiresses, to old Kur-Pfalz; married, one of them to Duke Clement of Baiern, Karl Albert's nephew, which is well enough: but married, the other and elder of them, to Theodor of Deux-Ponts, who will one day--could we pierce the merciful veil--be Kurfurst of Baiern, and succeed our own childless Son!

60|$|Venters {{exercised}} {{his usual}} {{care in the}} matter of hiding tracks from the outlet, yet it took him scarcely an hour to reach Oldring's cattle. Here sight of many calves changed his original intention, and instead of <b>packing</b> <b>out</b> meat he decided to take a calf out alive. He roped one, securely tied its feet, and swung it over his shoulder. Here was an exceedingly heavy burden, but Venters was powerful--he could take up a sack of grain and with ease pitch it over a pack-saddle--and he made long distance without resting. The hardest work came in the climb up to the outlet and on through to the valley. When he had accomplished it, he became fired with another idea that again changed his intention. He would not kill the calf, but keep it alive. He would go back to Oldring's herd and pack out more calves. Thereupon he secured the calf in the best available spot for the moment and turned to make a second trip.|$|E

[...] Citing the band's unwillingness to stray from their tried and true formula, Ian Gormely of Exclaim! wrote that [...] "A Head Full of Dreams might have been a poptimist masterpiece.

5000|$|Natural environments {{are often}} fragile, {{and may be}} accidentally damaged, {{especially}} when {{a large number of}} hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients, and can cause deforestation. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or <b>packing</b> <b>out</b> faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.|$|E
