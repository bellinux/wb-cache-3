An imaging plate (II?) was used as an X-ray detector, and continuous Debye-Scherrer diffraction rings were obtained from such coarse grained material by applying an X-Y <b>plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> method. Mechanical bending stress was applied to the specimen to measure X-ray elastic constants and a stress constant. An ideal orientation method was adopted to obtain these parameters. It uses the diffraction lines which belong to the same zone axis. The experimental elastic constant was compared with the theoretical values calculated from the elastic compliance of NisAl single crystal. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) The X-ray elastic constants measured from NisAl 220 diffraction peaks which appeared at ~= 0. 537 ” and 60. 537 ” were Ex/(l+vx) = 176 GPa, Ex= 220 GPa andvx= 0. 253. (2) The theoretical elastic constant Ea at w=O ” was calculated to be 207 GPa from the elastic compliances of Ni 3 Al single crystal. This value corresponds to the elastic constant {{in the direction of the}} tensile axis for the grains which contribute to diffraction. The elastic constant E 60 at v=bO”was similarly obtained as 228 GPa. The experimental value of the X-ray elastic constant Ex (220 GPa) was intermediate between these theoretical values...|$|E
40|$|Global {{extinction}} and geological {{events have}} previously been linked with galactic {{events such as}} spiral arm crossings and galactic <b>plane</b> <b>oscillation.</b> The expectation that these are repeating predictable events has led to studies of periodicity in a wide set of biological, geological and climatic phenomena. Using data on carbon isotope excursions, large igneous provinces and impact craters, we identify three time zones of high geological activity which relate to the timings of {{the passage of the}} Solar System through the spiral arms. These zones are shown to include a significantly large proportion of high extinction periods. The mass extinction events at the ends of the Ordovician, Permian and Cretaceous occur in the first zone, which contains the predicted midpoints of the spiral arms. The start of the Cambrian, end of the Devonian and end of the Triassic occur in the second zone. The pattern of extinction timing in relation to spiral arm structure is supported by the positions of the superchrons and the predicted speed of the spiral arms. The passage times through an arm are simple multiples of published results on impact and fossil record periodicity and galactic plane half-periods. The total estimated passage time through four arms is 703. 8 Myr. The repetition of extinction events at the same points in different spiral arm crossings suggests a common underlying galactic cause of mass extinctions, mediated through galactic effects on geological, solar and extra-solar processes. The two largest impact craters (Sudbury and Vredefort), predicted to have occurred during {{the early part of the}} first zone, extend the possible pattern to more than 2000 million years ago. © 2008 Cambridge University Press...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an approach to}} cutting dynamics during turning based upon the mechanism of deformation of work material around the tool nose known as "ploughing". Starting from the shearing process in the cutting zone and accounting for "ploughing", new mathematical models relating turning force components to cutting conditions, tool geometry and tool vibration are developed. These models are developed separately for steady state and for oscillatory turning with new and worn tools. Experimental results are used to determine mathematical functions expressing the parameters introduced by the steady state model {{in the case of}} a new tool. The form of these functions are of general validity though their coefficients are dependent on work and tool materials. Good agreement is achieved between experimental and predicted forces. The model is extended on one hand to include different work material by introducing a hardness factor. The model provides good predictions when predicted forces are compared to present and published experimental results. On the other hand, the extension of the ploughing model to taming with a worn edge showed the ability of the model in predicting machining forces during steady state turning with the worn flank of the tool. In the development of the dynamic models, the dynamic turning force equations define the cutting process as being a system for which vibration of the tool tip in the feed direction is the input and measured forces are the output The model takes into account the shear <b>plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> and the cutting configuration variation in response to tool motion. Theoretical expressions of the turning forces are obtained for new and worn cutting edges. The dynamic analysis revealed the interaction between the cutting mechanism and the machine tool structure. The effect of the machine tool and tool post is accounted for by using experimental data of the transfer function of the tool post system. Steady state coefficients are corrected to include the changes in the cutting configuration with tool vibration and are used in the dynamic model. A series of oscillatory cutting tests at various conditions and various tool flank wear levels are carried out and experimental results are compared with model—predicted forces. Good agreement between predictions and experiments were achieved over a wide range of cutting conditions. This research bridges the gap between the analysis of vibration and turning forces in turning. It offers an explicit expression of the dynamic turning force generated during machining and highlights the relationships between tool wear, tool vibration and turning force. Spectral analysis of tool acceleration and turning force components led to define an "Inertance Power Ratio" as a flank wear monitoring factor. A formulation of an on—line flank wear monitoring methodology is presented and shows how the results of the present model can be applied to practical in—process tool wear monitoring in • turning operations...|$|E

METHODS: Fifty-three patients with moderate to severe functional disabilities were randomized within 6 weeks poststroke and within 3 days after admission to a rehabilitation center to either whole-body vibration or exercise therapy on music in addition to a regular inpatient rehabilitation program. The whole-body vibration group received 4 x 45 -second stimulation on the Galileo 900 (30 -Hz frontal <b>plane</b> <b>oscillations</b> of 3 -mm amplitude) for 5 days per week during 6 weeks. The exercise therapy on music group received the same amount of exercise therapy on music. Outcome variables included the Berg Balance Scale, Trunk Control Test, Rivermead Mobility Index, Barthel Index, Functional Ambulation Categories, Motricity Index, and somatosensory threshold at 0, 6, and 12 weeks follow up. RESULTS: At baseline, both groups were comparable in terms of prognostic factors and outcome measures. Both at 6 and 12 weeks follow up, no clinically relevant or statistical differences in outcome were observed between the groups. No side effects were reported.
