40|$|Background Central venous {{catheters}} {{are important}} {{in the management of}} <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit patients, but can have serious complications which worsen the patients' health, prolong hospital stays and increase the cost of care. Evidence-based recommendations for preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections are available, but it is unknown how widely these are known or practiced in the <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> environment. Objectives To assess nursing knowledge of evidence based guidelines to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections; the extent to which Australia and New Zealand <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>cares</b> have adopted prevention practices; and to identify the factors that encouraged their adoption and improve nursing knowledge. Design Cross-sectional surveys using convenience sampling. Settings Tertiary level <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> units in Australia and New Zealand. Participants <b>Paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> nursing staff and nurse managers. Methods Between 2010 and 2011, the 'Paediatric Intensive Care Nurses' Knowledge of Evidence-Based Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection Prevention Questionnaire' was distributed to <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> nursing staff and the 'Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection Prevention Practices Survey' was distributed to nurse managers to measure knowledge, practices and culture. Results The questionnaires were completed by 253 <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> nurses (response rate: 34 %). The mean total knowledge score was 5. 5 (SD = 1. 4) out of a possible ten, with significant variation of total scores between <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> sites (p = 0. 01). Other demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with variation in total knowledge scores. All nursing managers from Australian and New Zealand <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> units participated in the survey (n = 8; response rate: 100 %). Wide practice variation was reported, with inconsistent adherence to recommendations. Safety culture was not significantly associated with mean knowledge scores per site. Conclusions This study has identified that there is variation in the infection prevention approach and nurses' knowledge about catheter-related bloodstream infection prevention. The presence of an improved safety culture, years of <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> experience and higher qualifications did not influence the nurses' uptake of recommendations, therefore further factors need to be explored in order to improve understanding and implementation of best practice.

40|$|Background: Parents of {{children}} with a life-limiting disease {{have to rely on}} themselves at home while adequate <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>care</b> is lacking. In several countries, <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>care</b> teams are introduced to ensure continuity and quality of care and to support the child and the family. Yet, little is known about how parents experience such multidisciplinary teams. Aim: To obtain insight into the support provided by a new <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>care</b> team from the parents' perspective. Design: An interpretative qualitative interview study using thematic analysis was performed. Setting/participants: A total of 47 single or repeated interviews were undertaken with 42 parents of 24 children supported by a multidisciplinary <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>care</b> team located at a university children's hospital. The children suffered from malignant or non-malignant diseases. Results: In advance, parents had limited expectations of the <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>care</b> team. Some had difficulty accepting the need for palliative care for their child. Once parents experienced what the team achieved for their child and family, they valued the team's involvement. Valuable elements were as follows: (1) process-related aspects such as continuity, coordination of care, and providing one reliable point of contact; (2) practical support; and (3) the team members' sensitive and reliable attitude. As a point of improvement, parents suggested more concrete clarification upfront of the content of the team's support.

In the ranking known as ‘the European Health Consumer Index’, Poland (taking the patient {{point of view on}} healthcare quality) is classified on the 27 th position out of the 33 possible. The unsolved problems concern inter alia the quality and availability of night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care.</b> Objective The aim was assessing the quality as well as the level of satisfaction with the night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care</b> in the Lublin Province of eastern Poland. Material and Methods The materials for this study consisted of 540 parents of children aged 6 – 16 years benefiting from night paediatric urgent medical assistance in Lublin Province. The survey was conducted using the Original Survey Questionnaire. Results Inhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality and accessibility of night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care</b> facilities as only satisfactory. Inhabitants living in rural areas have worse access to night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care</b> facilities because of having to travel greater distances, and receive less comprehensive medical assistance than inhabitants living in more urbanized areas, and they are more often referred to hospital emergency departments. During the past five years, both the availability and quality of night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care</b> did not change significantly. Conclusions Inhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality as well as accessibility of night <b>paediatric</b> urgent <b>care</b> facilities as only satisfactory. Rural residents have more reasons for dissatisfaction than urban dwellers. Both the quality and availability of such medical care needs to be improved...|$|R
30|$|All {{these issues}} have {{generated}} concerns regarding quality management (QM) in <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care.</b> Consequently, European countries attempt to legislate QM strategies in patient care aiming to optimize therapy regimes [8].

Additionally, <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> frequently requires a multidisciplinary approach with cooperations exceeding the treatment of adults [3, 9].|$|R

40|$|Background: Although child {{mortality}} is decreasing, {{more than half}} of all deaths in childhood occur in children with a life-limiting condition whose death may be expected. Aim: To assess trends in place of death and identify characteristics of children who died in the community after discharge from <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit. Design: National data linkage study. Setting/participants: All children resident in England and Wales when admitted to a <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit in the United Kingdom (1 January 2004 and 31 December 2014) were identified in the <b>Paediatric</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Audit Network dataset. Linkage to death certificate data was available up to the end of 2014. Place of death was categorised as hospital (hospital or <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit) or community (hospice, home or other) for multivariable logistic modelling. Results: The cohort consisted of 110, 328 individuals. In all, 7709 deaths occurred after first discharge from <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit. Among children dying, the percentage in-hospital at the time of death decreased from 83. 8 % in 2004 to 68. 1 % in 2014; 852 (0. 8 %) of children were discharged to palliative care. Children discharged to palliative care were eight times more likely to die in the community than children who died and had not been discharged to palliative care (odds ratio[*]=[*] 8. 06 (95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 6. 50 – 10. 01)). Conclusions: The proportion of children dying in hospital is decreasing, but a large proportion of children dying after discharge from <b>paediatric</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit continue to die in hospital.
