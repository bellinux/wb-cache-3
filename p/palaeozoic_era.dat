25|$|The {{first half}} of Huxley's career as a {{palaeontologist}} {{is marked by a}} rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic.

25|$|Late Precambrian {{rocks are}} {{widespread}} on Anglesey, Llŷn and Arfon with other, more restricted occurrences in north Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire and Carmarthenshire. The often intensive metamorphism which these originally volcanic and sedimentary rocks {{have been subjected}} to and their generally faulted relationship to neighbouring rocks has meant that geologists’ understanding of them has been limited. The majority lie on or close to the margins of terranes, blocks of the Earth’s crust which have had differing geological histories before assuming their present configuration.

25|$|During the <b>Palaeozoic</b> <b>era</b> {{at least}} a few {{thousand}} kilometres of ocean floor were subducted, taking of the order of a hundred million years. Sediments were deposited in the ocean floor in the form of fans formed by turbidity currents off the side of a continental slope. The flow was in the northerly direction, indicating that the continental slope was to the south. These deposits occurred during the Ordovician period. The ocean floor was distant from the continental source of the sediment. Towards the end of this period there were isolated parts where no turbidity currents reached and only fine clay and animal organic and silica debris were deposited into oxygen-depleted deep water. This ocean basin has been called the Monaro Basin. To the north west was a volcanic chain of islands, the Macquarie arc, with an associated submarine trench.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis is a genus placed {{within the}} placoderm order Antiarchi. The {{earliest}} antiarch placoderms {{first appeared in}} the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era and could be found distributed on every paleocontinent by the Devonian period. The earliest members of Bothriolepis appear by the Middle Devonian. Antiarchs, as well as other placoderms, are morphologically diverse and are characterized by bony plates that cover their head and the anterior part of the trunk. Early ontogenetic stages of placoderms had thinner bony plates within both the head and trunk-shield, which allowed for easy distinction between early placoderm ontogenetic stages within the fossil record and taxa that possessed fully developed bony plates but were small by characterization. Placoderm bony plates were generally made up of three layers, including a compact basal lamellar bony layer, a middle spongy bony layer and a superficial layer; Bothriolepis can be classified as a placoderm since it possesses these layers. Placoderms were extinct {{by the end of the}} Devonian. Placodermi is a paraphyletic group of the clade Gnathostomata, which includes all jawed vertebrates. It is unclear exactly when gnathostomes emerged, but the scant early fossil record indicates that it was sometime in the Early <b>Palaeozoic</b> <b>era.</b> The last species of Bothriolepis died out, together with the rest of Placodermi, at the end of the Devonian period.|$|E
50|$|The geology of Northumberland in {{northeast}} England includes {{a mix of}} sedimentary, intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks from the <b>Palaeozoic</b> and Cenozoic <b>eras.</b> Devonian age volcanic rocks and a granite pluton form the Cheviot massif. The geology {{of the rest of}} the county is characterised largely by a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous age. These are intruded by both Permian and Palaeogene dykes and sills and the whole is overlain by unconsolidated sediments from the last ice age and the post-glacial period. The Whin Sill makes a significant impact on Northumberland's character and the former working of the Northumberland Coalfield significantly influenced the development of the county's economy. The county's geology contributes to a series of significant landscape features around which the Northumberland National Park was designated.|$|R
500|$|Several early authors {{believed}} the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and their ancestors), {{based on its}} multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes (called [...] "amphistyly"), and its [...] "notochord-like" [...] spinal column with indistinct vertebrae.
