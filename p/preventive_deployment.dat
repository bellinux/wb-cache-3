In August 2011, the 4th Battalion deployed to Al-Asad and FOB Hammer in Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn. They returned in December of that year when the U.S and Iraqi government failed to come to an agreement concerning soldiers diplomatic immunity, making the Regulars one of the last units to withdraw from the Iraq.|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} focus on the <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> in Macedonia with special {{emphasis}} on the theory of preventive diplomacy.

The United Nation <b>Preventive</b> <b>Deployment</b> Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia is the first United Nations peacekeeping operations with a mandate on <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment.</b> The study aims to contribute the improvement of preventive diplomacy to become a tool for the conflict prevention of inter- and intra-state conflicts.

40|$|<b>Preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> as a {{conflict}} prevention tool has not recurred {{in the past}} decade-plus, despite the broadly acclaimed success of the United Nations <b>Preventive</b> <b>Deployment</b> in Macedonia (UNPREDEP 1995 - 1999; and its predecessor mission, UNPROFOR/Macedonia, UNPROFOR/M 1992 - 1995). The United Nations in particular has continued with mainly first- and second-generation peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding actions. What may best explain why has {{there has been no}} other engagement in <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> missions, when there has been much emphasis placed formally and informally on early warning, detection, mitigation, and prevention of conflict? There have also been an increasing numbers of violent conflicts worldwide, so again, why no more preventive deployments? Realism, organizational learning and constructivism in particular offer potential theoretical insights. Several research innovations were established: first, the main organizations involved (the UN Headquarters, UN HQ) and the field organization (UNPREDEP) were conceived of as two separate entities; second, the examination of the case was expanded temporally, and third, theoretical approaches infrequently utilized in international relations, particularly organization and organizational learning theory, were applied. Learning in the field organization pre-, during and post-deployment, and learning situated at key UN Departments and sections were to have been critical but largely unexamined factors in this outcome relevant to the absence, post-UNPROFOR/M and UNPREDEP of <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> as part of preventive diplomacy. Interviews with primary field and headquarters actors were crucial to addressing this question. Primary materials from the UN Archives were also made partially available for the first time, and were an important source for this case study. It is found that learning and knowledge interactions between organizations (especially between the field and UN HQ) resulted in flawed processes and outcomes at headquarters, and thereby blurred opportunities for understanding, learning and change, instead allowing decisions, principles, practices, policies and norms that at the very least marginalized <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> as an ongoing, viable tool of pre-conflict management...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt has been {{nearly two decades}} since {{the outbreak of the}} Yugoslav wars of secession and subsequent deployment of peace operations into the region, and over that time numerous {{attempts have been made to}} assess the success of these missions. This thesis evaluates elements of these peace operations, which, although generally considered critical to their success, have been largely overlooked in these assessments. These include efforts to promote social well-being and combat organized crime in Bosnia, and the United Nations' <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> to Macedonia. This study concludes that the peace mission in Bosnia promoted some aspects of social well-being, reduced the level of violent organized crime, and prevented a recurrence of violent conflict. However, its long-term success has been undermined by its inability to establish a truly unified, sovereign nation with an effective central government. In comparison, the <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> to Macedonia has had a more positive long-term effect, promoting security and stable governance without undermining the state's independence.

The thesis in its first part deals with the theory of conflicts in international relations and theory of their prevention, especially with preventive diplomacy and its tools. The second part presents the theory of conflict prevention from the UN perspective and indicates its actors, their roles and possibilities.

40|$|Japan’s {{commitments}} to the UN-authorized peace operations in East Timor were the largest contribution {{the country has}} made {{in the history of}} its international peace operations. Notably, Japan’s participation in the peacebuilding operations in East Timor was based on “human security” as one of the pillars of its diplomatic policy. Moreover, Japan’s participation in the peace operations in East Timor was a touchstone issue for its human security policy. Yet, one simple but important question arises. How consistent were Japan’s {{commitments to}} the peace operations? In an attempt to answer to this question, this paper systematically examines Japan’s contributions to the international peace operations for East Timor. In order to investigate long-term and complicated activities in the peace operations, this paper employs timeline “sequence analysis” as a research method which combines and simplifies analytical models suggested in earlier scholarship. Through the application of sequence analysis, this paper investigates four stages of Japan’s contributions to the peace operations in East Timor: 1) <b>preventive</b> <b>deployment</b> (UNAMET), 2) peace-enforcement (INTERFET), 3) peacekeeping (UNTAET), and 4) peacebuilding (e. g.

The four-part Dean Rusk Lectures commemorate the 25 th {{anniversary of the}} founding of the Dean Rusk Center - - International, Comparative and Graduate Legal Studies. Williams has served in three United Nations peacekeeping operations as special assistant to the deputy special representative of the secretary-general in Bosnia and Herzegovina, special assistant to the representative of the secretary-general in Haiti, and political and humanitarian affairs adviser to the U. N. <b>Preventive</b> <b>Deployment</b> Force in Macedonia. He was Georgetown University Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service Assistant Professor of International Relations and has taught courses in international organization, theory and practice of international relations, and power and justice in the international system. Executive Director of the Dean Rusk Center and Kirbo Chair in International Law Gabriel Wilner says this 25 th anniversary celebration is very much a celebration of Dean Rusk and the university 2 ̆ 7 s good fortune of being associated with him. 2 ̆ 2 During his time at the university, Dean Rusk encouraged students and faculty to gain international experiences and broaden their perspective. It brings us great joy to pay tribute to him by continuing his educational legacy with this lecture series. 2 ̆ 2 Wilner said the post Williams occupies is an important one particularly since Kofi Annan, the U. N. secretary general, has established himself as an activist in his role as the highest United Nations official. The Rusk Center was established in 1977 and merged with International and Graduate Legal Studies in 1999 to bring research, teaching and service at the University of Georgia School of Law into the evolving international dimensions of law. A former secretary of state, the late Dean Rusk was the inspiration behind the center 2 ̆ 7 s creation. It was his profound belief that through education, international cooperation could be a conduit of maintaining peace, building democratic institutions and raising standards of living throughout the world. Law school Dean David Shipley praised this initiative undertaken by the director and staff of the Dean Rusk Center and said this series is ample evidence of just how important Rusk 2 ̆ 7 s legacy is to the law school and how {{much a part of the}} law school the study of the many facets of international and comparative law has become. The remaining lecture in the series is 2 ̆ 2 The United States and Europe: Political Cleavages and the Use of Law 2 ̆ 2 by Manuel Medina Ortega, a member of the European Parliament, on Monday, Oct. 28, 2002, at 3 : 30 p. m. in the Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom at the School of Law. The previous two lectures in the series were: 2 ̆ 2 Democracy Beyond Nation State: World Trade Organizations and European Union 2 ̆ 2 given by Eric Stein, the Hessel E. Yntema Professor Emeritus of law at the University of Michigan, held Sept. 25, 2002. 2 ̆ 2 Constitutional Rights and Human Rights 2 ̆ 2 given by Louis Henkin, University Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, held Oct. 2, 2002.
