40|$|Background: Inequality {{in income}} {{distribution}} {{leads to the}} incidence of poverty and increase of the gap between social classes. Evidences suggest that policymakers in many developed and developing countries {{are concerned about the}} effects of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing on income distribution. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> on the distribution of income in rural and urban households in Iran. Methods: This descriptive- analytical, retrospective study was composed of a 3 -year time series. Data were collected from the household income and expenditure survey of the Statistical Centre of Iran. To measure the inequality in the distribution of resources, Lorenze Curve and Gini index estimations were used. Data were analyzed using Stata 11 software. Results: Gini coefficient for prepayment income, for the years 2008 to 2011, was respectively 0. 367, 0. 348 and 0. 369 for urban households and 0. 404, 0. 362, 0. 396, for rural households. The values of this index for post payment income in urban households were 0. 300, 0. 286 and 0. 302 and 0. 324, 0. 300, 0. 320 for rural households respectively. According to the results, <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services has led to a significant reduction in the Gini coefficient and increase of equity. Conclusion: The results showed that <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> had a significant relationship with income distribution; it means that <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and households’ contribution in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing reduced the Gini coefficient and improved income distribution.

25|$|In {{the article}} Why Tie Health Insurance to a Job?, Emanuel said that {{employer}} based health insurance {{should be replaced}} by state or regional insurance exchanges that pool individuals and small groups to pay the same lower prices charged to larger employers. Emanuel said that this would allow portable health insurance even to people that lose their jobs or change jobs, {{while at the same}} time preserving the security of employer based health benefits by giving consumers the bargaining power of a large group of patients. According to Emanuel, this would end discrimination by health insurance companies in the form of denial of health insurance based on age or preexisting conditions. In Solved!, Emanuel said that Universal Healthcare Vouchers would solve the problem of rapidly increasing health care costs, which, rising at three times the rate of inflation, would result in higher copayments, fewer benefits, stagnant wages and fewer employers willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> benefits.|$|E
25|$|Bieber's {{final round}} of {{collective}} bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approve the strike, but Yokich was the quarterback who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, but gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend {{the time it took}} for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or layoff income security provisions. However, Ford did agree to fully <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use layoff pay during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying layoff pay to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants. The wage payment scheme was the same as the previous contract.|$|E
