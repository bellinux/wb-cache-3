40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the predictors of motivation to change in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> alcohol dependence. The participants were 209 <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> alcohol dependence. Data were collected through self-report questionnaires, which were constructed to include socio-demographics, alcohol drinking-related factors, and psychosocial-spiritual factors. Data were analyzed with the SPSS 19. 0 programs. The significant predictors of motivation to change in <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> alcohol dependence were gratitude, professional support, and age at first admission. These alcohol drinking-related factors and psychosocial factors explained 22. 7 % of the variance in <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> alcohol dependence.

40|$|Background Obesity is an {{increasing}} health problem for many Australians, no less so among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. Behaviour change aimed at improving nutritional intake and increasing levels of physical activity is a requirement for the reduction of obesity. An essential {{part of this process}} is to first ascertain the level of knowledge and beliefs <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability have about these behaviours. Methods The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and psychometrically evaluate a scale to assess levels of nutritional and physical activity knowledge among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. Results Seventy-three <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability completed the interview-rated scale at time 1 and 66 of them completed it again at a 3 -week re-test. Conclusions The scale demonstrated strong factorial construct validity, high internal consistency and good temporal stability. The applications of this scale in future research and in intervention programmes are discussed. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2014. Objective: To {{investigate}} the ambulatory mental health service profile {{of persons with}} intellectual disability (ID) in {{a representative sample of}} New South Wales (NSW). Methods: A statistical linkage key was used to link the Disability Services Minimum Data Set (DS-MDS) and a community mental health services dataset (MH-COM) for a representative area of NSW for the period 2005 - 2010. Linkage was undertaken in four NSW local health districts (LHDs), covering 36. 7 % of the NSW population. The mental health profiles and service use characteristics of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID were compared to mental health service users without an ID. Results: Of the 89, 262 people in the MH-COM over this 6 -year period, 1, 459 people (1. 6 %) were identified as having an ID. Compared to those without <b>an</b> ID, <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID {{were more likely to have}} psychotic disorders, developmental disorders and personality disorders, and more than twice as likely to have an 'unknown' diagnosis. Compared to those without <b>an</b> ID, <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID were less likely to have depressive disorders, adjustment disorders and other disorders. Service use profiles revealed that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID had 1. 6 times more face-to-face contacts, and a total faceto- face contact time which was 2. 5 times longer than people without an ID. Conclusions: Ambulatory mental health data from NSW indicates that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID receive care for a distinct range of mental disorders, and experience uncertainty regarding their diagnosis. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID have higher service needs which require recognition and the allocation of specific resources. Such data provide a suitable baseline for future evaluation of the impact of ambulatory mental health reforms for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID...|$|R

40|$|Background Client-centred {{models of}} care emphasise the {{importance}} of collaborative working between staff and clients <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability (ID). How <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID perceive {{the nature of their}} engagement with staff is relatively unknown. This study investigated the perceptions of staff and <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID about the goals for their meetings and what aspects of the meetings they viewed as important. Method Interviews were carried out with 9 client–staff dyads. Prior to their meeting, staff and clients were asked about their expectations. Afterwards, both parties were asked about what they believed happened during the interaction. The participants’ answers were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID appreciated the opportunity to tell their story and valued reliable, practical support and advice. A trusting relationship was important to both clients and staff. Only staff viewed promoting clients’ autonomy as important. Conclusion Staff and <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID appear to differ in their expectations and perceptions regarding regular support meetings...|$|R

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} and perceptions of close and sexual relationships of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. BACKGROUND: Positive interpersonal relationships are beneficial for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability, acting as a protective barrier against, social stigma and negative outcomes such as {{physical and mental health}} problems. The social networks of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability are, however, often more restricted than those of the general population. There has been very little research exploring the views and experiences of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability about social and sexual relationships. DESIGN: Exploratory study using a qualitative research design. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 (6 male, 4 female) participants. Data were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: 'Touching other people in relationships' was identified as a superordinate theme. The theme was represented by five subthemes: 'Is wrong'; 'Unsafe to talk about'; 'Suggesting is safe'; 'No freedom or fun'; and 'Being touched'. The findings presented are drawn from a larger qualitative study. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of touch and sexual behaviours in the close relationships of participants. Negative perceptions were observed to surround sexual behaviours. Rules and restrictions regarding physical contact were also described. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Disseminating these findings may increase awareness of the importance of physical contact in the close relationships of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability and promote positive support arrangements...|$|R
