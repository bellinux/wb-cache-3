5000|$|Borrower {{lawsuits}} {{were often}} prompted by lendersâ€™ providing inadequate disclosure regarding {{the right to}} force-place CPI policies, force-placing policies with unnecessary coverages, and not disclosing they might be making a commission on the transaction. Additionally, some CPI providers had administrative problems with their programs, including the inability to receive and process insurance documents {{in a timely manner}} and ineffective tracking technology, and the inability of some providers to reamortize the loan payments resulting in the [...] "stacking" [...] of CPI premiums. These problems resulted in sending unnecessary letters to borrowers, issuing policies to borrowers who were in fact insured, and delays in <b>processing</b> <b>premium</b> refunds when proof of insurance was received, all of which served to exacerbate borrower complaints.|$|E
40|$|Niche {{markets have}} emerged for dairy {{products}} {{with a high}} concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in milkfat. Several studies have indicated that although milkfat UFA concentration could be increased on-farm by manipulation of the diet and genetic selection, farm profit could be negatively affected {{in the absence of a}} premium for milkfat UFA concentration. The objective of this study was to estimate, via simulation, a premium for milkfat UFA concentration, for dairy farmers in New Zealand that segregate cows, or feed oilseed supplements to dairy cows, to produce milk high in UFA. Data from New Zealand Holstein-Friesian cows were used to develop a stochastic farm model that simulated the physical and financial performance of dairy farms under New Zealand conditions. The farm model was then used to simulate a population of 1, 820, 000 cows and 5, 600 dairy farms. From the population simulated, the top 17, 150 cows for milkfat UFA concentration were segregated and randomly distributed onto 50 farms (UFA farms). The farm model was also used to simulate a group of 50 farms on which an oilseed supplement was fed to dairy cows during lactation (OILSEED farms). The characteristics of UFA farms and OILSEED farms were compared with those of 50 average farms (AVE farms). A deterministic milk processing model was used to simulate a dairy processor that processed and marketed the milk produced by AVE farms, UFA farms and OILSEED farms. A milk payment system which paid dairy farmers for milkfat ($/kg), protein ($/kg) and milkfat UFA concentration ($/kg milkfat), but penalised milk volume ($/L), was developed using data corresponding to the physical and financial performance of the dairy processor and the three groups of dairy farms simulated. In the absence of a premium for milkfat UFA concentration, the operating profit ($/ha) of UFA farms and OILSEED farms was significantly lower than that of AVE farms. For UFA farms, a premium of $ 0. 47 to $ 0. 51 /kg milkfat for each 0. 1 g UFA/ 100 g milkfat increase (above 34. 50 g UFA/ 100 g milkfat) equalled their operating profit ($/ha) to that of AVE farms. For OILSEED farms, a premium of $ 0. 10 to $ 0. 14 /kg milkfat for each 0. 1 g UFA/ 100 g milkfat increase (above 37. 50 g UFA/ 100 g milkfat) equalled their operating profit ($/ha) Abstract ii to that of AVE farms. These premiums for milfat UFA concentration could help New Zealand dairy companies to further evaluate whether it is economically viable producing and processing milk high in UFA.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to apply for <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> on an already-submitted application. In this case, the clock for <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> begins when the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> is requested.|$|R
50|$|Form I-907, Request for <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service, is {{required}} if the petitioner is requesting <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Data skewed by Premium Processing: The USCIS {{does not}} {{separate}} out data for petitions that have requested the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service, i.e., its estimate of processing time includes both petitions that have requested <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> {{and those that}} have not. While this does not affect form categories ineligible for <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing,</b> it does skew the reported processing times for the forms eligible for <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing.</b> For instance, a Form I-129 petition {{that did not have}} a <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service request will likely take more time to process than the processing time reported by the USCIS.|$|R
50|$|For Forms I-129 and I-140, the {{petitioner}} {{may use the}} <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service to get {{an initial}} review within 15 calendar days. The petitioner can obtain the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service for an already submitted application and can in fact obtain it electronically.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the annual suspension of the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service for cap-subject petitions as described above, USCIS has also temporarily suspended <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service for other types of applications {{in order to preserve}} resources for other kinds of increased caseloads. For instance, in anticipation of increased caseloads due to the Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Spouses final rule, USCIS suspended <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service for H-1B extension of stay petitions in cap-subject categories for the period from May 26 to July 27, 2015. Those who had already applied for the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service before May 26 would still receive it.|$|R
50|$|On May 23, 2006, the USCIS {{announced}} that it would roll out the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service for some Form I-140 visa categories. The rollout continued through 2006. <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> was reinstated for Form I-140 petitions in 2009.|$|R
50|$|USCIS' {{previous}} system of allowing discretionary expedite requests {{is no longer}} available for any task for which the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service is available, with one exception: non-profits (as designated by the Internal Revenue Service) may still make discretionary expedite requests instead of using the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service. Also, for categories for which <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> has been temporarily suspended, discretionary expedite requests may be made and {{would be subject to}} the usual Expedite Criteria.|$|R
50|$|The USCIS {{offers a}} <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service at an {{additional}} fee of $1225 for Form I-140 petitions. <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> is only available for this form and for Form I-129 (non-immigrant worker). The <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service promises an initial review from the USCIS {{within 15 calendar days}} of receipt of the form, after which time it may approve, deny, or issue a Request For Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny. USCIS will refund the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service fee if processing takes longer than 15 days. If the fee is refunded, the relating case will continue to receive expedited processing. The time begins from the receipt of Form I-907 and the associated fee.|$|R
50|$|The USCIS {{has been}} asked to extend the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service to Form I-526 (for EB-5 investors) and has also {{formulated}} proposals to do so, but as of January 2016, still uses the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service only for Forms I-129 and I-140.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{repeated}} requests to the USCIS to enable <b>premium</b> <b>processing</b> for Form I-526 applications that are a first step to obtaining an EB-5 visa (investor visa). The USCIS itself came up with proposals in August 2011 that would allow <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service requests for EB-5 investor applications (made on Form I-526) for projects that were fully developed and ready to go. However, as of April 2015, the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service is still restricted only to Form I-129 and Form I-140 petitions.|$|R

50|$|In other cases, USCIS has {{suspended}} <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> of petitions in categories {{where the}} rules have been in flux. Most recently, the USCIS suspended processing of all H-2B petitions starting March 5, 2015, following a ruling by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Perez v. Perez. On March 18, the district court granted a motion by the United States Department of Labor to resume issuance of temporary labor certifications for the H-2B program, so the USCIS resumed processing H-2B petitions, but kept <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> suspended.

50|$|For {{immigrant}} visa allocation, the Form I-140 petition must {{be approved}} and the priority date assigned to that petition must be before the cutoff date (which depends on the country of chargeability and the visa category). Since the cutoff date and the processing time for Form I-140 petitions are independent, the wait time for Form I-140 to be processed is the later of the visa number availability time (the cutoff date) and the Form I-140 <b>processing</b> time. Therefore, <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> can expedite the overall process of obtaining lawful permanent resident status when the Form I-140 processing time is longer than the visa number availability time. In other words, {{if there is no}} visa number availability wait time, either because the category is uncapped or the caps are nowhere near being met, then <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> is advantageous. On the other hand, for a visa category with a country of chargeability where the current cutoff date is far in the past (i.e. there is a long queue), <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> would not expedite the overall process because the cutoff date overwhelms even the standard processing time.|$|R
5000|$|Employers could {{optionally}} pay a $1000 fee for <b>premium</b> <b>processing,</b> so {{that they}} could get to know quickly if the application was approved.|$|R
50|$|Starting March 2013, USCIS has {{generally}} announced a delayed start date {{from which to}} start the 15-day counter for <b>premium</b> <b>processing</b> for cap-subject petitions for the H-1B visa.

In other words, applicants who requested the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service should expect a response within 15 days of the delayed start date rather than within 15 days of the USCIS receiving the application.|$|R

50|$|In June 2001, {{shortly after}} the {{introduction}} of the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the predecessor to USCIS), Gary Endelman wrote an article in Immigration Daily critical of the <b>Premium</b> <b>Processing</b> Service. He argued that the very fact that people were willing to pay the fee for 15-day processing times highlighted severe inefficiencies and unfunded mandates on the INS, which should not take much longer to process applications in any case. He suggested that rather than allowing the INS to treat these fees as cash cows, the United States legislature should identify clearer, more limited mandates for the agency along with a plan to fund them.|$|R
