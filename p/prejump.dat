40|$|Indotritia cf. heterotrichia, a box moss mite 800 mm in length, {{combines}} the abilities {{to curl up}} and to jump. Despite the lack of specialized legs and of extensor muscles in its knee joints, the backward leap is char-acterized by a short take-o ¡ time (ca. 0. 5 ms). This is apparently facilitated by a catch mechanism {{made up of a}} small hook on each forefemur that hitches {{on the rim of the}} anterior shield of the body and main-tains the forelegs in a £exed position during a <b>prejump</b> phase. While the animal is propelled backwards, its body simultaneously spins in a forward direction: it is supposed that, at take-o¡, the hindlegs initiate a forward rolling of the body, which is powered by internal hydraulic pressure, before the hook disen-gages from the shield rim and triggers a sudden backward impulse. The non-parabolic trajectory of the £ight can be described with a model where the air resistance due to the spin (Magnus e¡ect) and to the translatory motion is taken into account...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the plasma nerve growth factor (NGF) {{level and the}} distribution of NGF receptors in peripheral lymphocytes of young soldiers (mean age, 20 - 24 yr) experiencing the thrill of a novice about to make their first parachute jumps. Blood was collected from soldiers who knew they were selected to jump (n = 26), as well as from soldiers who knew they were not selected (n = 17, controls). The former group was sampled the evening before the jump and 20 min after landing. Compared with controls, NGF levels increased 84 % in <b>prejump</b> and 107 % in postjump sampling. Our studies also showed that the increase of NGF levels preceded the increase of plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. No changes in the baseline levels of circulating interleukin 1 beta or tumor necrosis factor were found, suggesting that the increased levels of NGF were not correlated with change in these cytokines. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that parachuting stress enhances the distribution of low-affinity p 75 LNGFR and high-affinity p 140 trkA NGF receptors in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These observations suggest that the release of NGF might be involved in the activation of cells of the immune system and is most probably associated with homeostatic adaptive mechanisms, as previously shown for stressed rodents...|$|E
