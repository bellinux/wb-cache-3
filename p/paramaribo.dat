5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in <b>Paramaribo,</b> Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a moped which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E

25|$|Matzeliger {{was born}} on a coffee {{plantation}} in Dutch Guiana, now Suriname. His father, Ernst Matzeliger, was a third generation Dutchman of German descent living in the Dutch Guiana capital city of <b>Paramaribo.</b> He owned and operated the Colonial Shipworks {{that had been in}} his family for three generations. His mother was a house slave of African descent; she lived on the plantation of which his father was the owner for a time. At the age of ten, Jan Matzeliger was apprenticed in the Colonial Ship Works in <b>Paramaribo,</b> where he demonstrated a natural aptitude for machinery and mechanics. He left Dutch Guiana at age 19, and worked as a mechanic on a Dutch East Indies merchant ship for several years before settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he first learned the shoe trade.

500|$|Because riots {{had broken}} out in the late 1930s over British {{proposals}} to partition Palestine, and U.S. diplomats including Sumner Welles proposed American alternatives, Silverman embarked on several tours of South America and the Caribbean in the early 1940s to determine if, {{as an alternative to}} Palestinian resettlement, European Jews could be established in the Dominican Republic, Peru, or Uruguay. She reported on her findings at the Inter-American Conference in Baltimore, describing the alternatives as unfavorable and the attempt in the Dominican Republic, as a [...] "failure". She also wrote articles under the byline Mrs. Archibald Silverman, urging the emigration of Jews to Palestine rather than to other places [...] such as a Jewish colony in Sosúa, Dominican Republic, promoted by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in the early 1940s; a plan to settle Jews in the Kimberley region of Australia; and another proposal for a Jewish colony in <b>Paramaribo,</b> Suriname. Her articles were filled with vitriol against what she perceived as the [...] "schemes" [...] of Jewish organizers opposed to Zionism; in a 1948 article titled [...] "The Surinam Nightmare", she [...] "described 'diabolical plans' to abandon Jewish 'guinea pigs' to 'terrifying tropical diseases'". Eventually the alternative emigration plans were scrapped {{in the wake of the}} 1948 declaration of independence by the State of Israel.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Amiens and the start of the Napoleonic Wars, Maxwell returned to sea-service in command of the sloop-of-war [...] [...] Within days of the start of the war, Cyane captured two French transports destined for the Caribbean, and later served in the West Indies, on one occasion exchanging fire with two large French frigates off Martinique. In 1803, Maxwell was involved in the capture of St Lucia, for which he was made captain of the ship of the line the flagship of his former commander Sir Samuel Hood. In this ship Maxwell participated in the capture of the French and Dutch colonies of Tobago, Demerera and Essequibo in 1803, following which his promotion to post captain was confirmed. He also blockaded Martinique, and was subsequently involved in the operation to seize Diamond Rock, overseeing the construction of a gun battery on its summit. This fortified position was able to severely restrict French shipping entering or leaving Fort-de-France. Present at the capture of Surinam and Berbice in 1804, Maxwell was the senior naval officer at the surrender of Surinam by its Dutch governor. His actions at Surinam: commanding the naval forces in the siege and capturing a succession of Dutch forts along the Suriname River, were highly commended. Maxwell's decisive leadership was essential in the rapid movement of troops by water to prevent the Dutch preparing fresh defensive positions; the colony surrendered after the British reached <b>Paramaribo,</b> giving up 2,000 prisoners, several ships, large quantities of supplies and the colony itself, with its valuable plantations. British losses numbered less than 30.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{appointed}} Governor of Barbados by Charles II. [...] He arrived at Barbados {{and took up}} the appointment in May 1650 and attempted to negotiate the strained politics of that island, which also experienced a division between Royalists and Parliamentarians. During this time he also sent a small colonizing party to Suriname, which established Fort Willoughby (now <b>Paramaribo)</b> {{in honor of the}} governor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, the U.S. Army bought Olympic {{from the}} Puget Sound Navigation Company and rebuilt her for {{service in the}} Panama Canal area as the Franklin R. Leisenburg. [...] After the war the vessel was sold to a firm in Dutch Guiana for service out of <b>Paramaribo</b> on the Surinam River.

2500|$|The American ship [...] first {{crossed the}} Atlantic Ocean, {{although}} most of the voyage was actually made under sail. The first ship to make the transatlantic trip substantially under steam power may have been the British-built Dutch-owned Curaçao, a wooden 438 ton vessel built in Dover and powered by two 50hp engines, which crossed from Hellevoetsluis, near Rotterdam on 26April 1827 to <b>Paramaribo,</b> Surinam on 24May, spending 11 days under steam on the way out and more on the return. Another claimant is the Canadian ship [...] in 1833.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Karl was invited {{on a trip}} to Surinam by the explorer August Kappler. In November 1845 the two departed from the port on the island of Texel aboard the ship [...] "Natalie." [...] After a dangerous voyage, they reached New Guinea in mid-March 1846. From <b>Paramaribo</b> they went into the interior of the country, where Mohr collected plants for European florists and herbariums. Severe fever attacks struck Mohr and tied him to a sick bed for several months, so he felt compelled to follow the advice of the doctors and returned home in November 1846.|$|E
2500|$|The U-boat sailed from Lorient {{once more}} on 16 January 1943 and headed across the Atlantic to the {{northern}} coast of South America. On 9 March at 03:00, U-510 attacked Convoy BT-6 about [...] north-east of <b>Paramaribo,</b> Dutch Guiana, sinking the 3,872 ton British merchant ship Kelvinbank, and damaging the 7,176 ton American Liberty ships George G. Meade, Tabitha Brown and Joseph Rodman Drake. She attacked the same convoy again three hours later and this time damaged the Liberty ships Mark Hanna, James Smith, Thomas Ruffin and James K. Polk, the latter two so badly that they were later declared total losses. The U-boat returned to Lorient on 16 April.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch Sephardim were {{interested}} in colonisation, and formed communities in both Curaçao and <b>Paramaribo,</b> Suriname. [...] Between 1630 and 1654, a Dutch colony existed in the north-east of Brazil, including Recife. [...] This attracted both conversos from Portuguese Brazil and Jewish emigrants from Holland, who formed a community in Recife called Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, the first synagogue in the Americas. [...] On the reconquest of the Recife area by Portugal, many of these Jews (it is not known what percentage) left Brazil for new or existing communities in the Caribbean such as Curaçao. Others formed a new community, Congregation Shearith Israel, in New Amsterdam (later renamed as New York) in 1654, the first Jewish synagogue in what became the United States. [...] Numerous conversos, however, stayed in Brazil. They survived by migrating to the countryside {{in the province of}} Paraíba and away from the reinstated Inquisition, which was mostly active in the major cities.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{steamship}} {{credited with}} crossing the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe was the American ship , {{though she was}} actually a hybrid between a steamship and a sailing ship, with {{the first half of}} the journey making use of the steam engine. Savannah left the port of Savannah, Georgia, on May22, 1819, arriving in Liverpool, England, on June20, 1819; her steam engine having been in use for part of the time on 18 days (estimates vary from 8 to 80 hours). A claimant to the title of the first ship to make the transatlantic trip substantially under steam power is the British-built Dutch-owned Curaçao, a wooden 438 ton vessel built in Dover and powered by two 50hp engines, which crossed from Hellevoetsluis, near Rotterdam on 26April 1827 to <b>Paramaribo,</b> Surinam on 24May, spending 11 days under steam on the way out and more on the return. Another claimant is the Canadian ship [...] in 1833.|$|E
2500|$|A {{founder of}} modern botany and zoology, the German Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717), spent her life {{investigating}} nature. When she was thirteen, Sibylla began growing caterpillars and studying their metamorphosis into butterflies. She kept a [...] "Study Book" [...] which recorded her investigations into natural philosophy. In her first publication, The New Book of Flowers, she used imagery to catalogue {{the lives of}} plants and insects. After her husband died, and her brief stint of living in Siewert, she and her daughter journeyed to <b>Paramaribo</b> for two years to observe insects, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. She returned to Amsterdam and published The Metamorphosis of the Insects of Suriname, which [...] "revealed to Europeans {{for the first time}} the astonishing diversity of the rain forest." [...] She was a botanist and entomologist who was known for her artistic illustrations of plants and insects. Uncommon for that era, she traveled to South America and Surinam, where, assisted by her daughters, she illustrated the plant and animal life of those regions.|$|E
60|$|He readily acquiesced in this, as {{he would}} have acquiesced in {{anything}} for the restitution of one he adored so deeply--even to the yielding of life itself. To put her in an immediate state of independence he gave her, in bonds and jewels, a considerable sum (for his worldly means had been in no way exaggerated); and by the next ship she sailed again for England, having travelled no farther than to <b>Paramaribo.</b> At parting he declared it to be his intention to turn all his landed possessions into personal property, and to be a wanderer {{on the face of the}} earth in remorse for his conduct towards her.|$|E
60|$|As they {{advanced}} on {{the voyage}} she observed that he grew {{more and more}} constrained; and, {{by the time they}} had crossed the Line, he was quite depressed, just as he had been before proposing to her. A day or two before landing at <b>Paramaribo,</b> he embraced her in a very tearful and passionate manner, and said he wished to make a confession. It had been his misfortune, he said, to marry at Quebec in early life a woman whose reputation proved to be in every way bad and scandalous. The discovery had nearly killed him; but he had ultimately separated from her, and had never seen her since. He had hoped and prayed she might be dead; but recently in London, when they were starting on this journey, he had discovered that she was still alive. At first he had decided to keep this dark intelligence from her beloved ears; but he had felt that he could not do it. All he hoped was that such a condition of things would make no difference in her feelings for him, as it need make no difference {{in the course of their}} lives.|$|E
