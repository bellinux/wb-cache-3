40|$|International audienceThis {{experiment}} {{is part of}} a study aiming to assess the disturbance experienced by workers in open-plan offices. Previous studies have shown that a sound environment rich with speech sounds can be detrimental to one's performance. The magnitude of this Irrelevant Speech Effect (ISE) depends on the intelligibility of the ambient speech. This has led {{to the use of the}} STI to model the induced decrement in performance. However, a decrease in performance is only one aspect of the more general concept of disturbance. When attempting to model the ISE in this <b>regard,</b> <b>other</b> <b>components</b> should be explored. In this first experiment, fifty-six subjects perform a classical seriation task during 10 -minutes blocks. They are confronted to sound evironments typical of open-plan offices. In each block, a voice emerges from the noise, with a STI value in the 0. 3  0. 7 range. Both their performance and response times are recorded. A silent condition is used as a reference. After each block, they are presented with the NASA-RTLX questionnaire for a subjective assesment of their workload. Comparisons between speech conditions will be made in order to understand the influence of ambient speech intelligibility on objective and subjective disturbance...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{estimate}} the employment effects {{of changes in}} national minimum wages using a pooled cross-section time-series data set comprising 17 OECD countries for the period 1975 – 2000. The average effects they find {{are consistent with the}} view that minimum wages cause employment losses among youths. However, the evidence also shows considerable variation across countries. In particular, disemployment effects of minimum wages appear to be smaller in countries that have subminimum wage <b>provisions</b> for youths. <b>Regarding</b> <b>other</b> labor market policies and institutions, the authors find that more restrictive labor standards and higher union coverage strengthen the disemployment effects of minimum wages, while employment protection laws and active labor market policies designed to bring unemployed individuals into the work force help to offset these effects. Overall, the disemployment effects of minimum wages are strongest in the countries with the least regulated labor markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{main purpose}} of this work was the {{determination}} of the genetic correlations among the density components of Pinus pinaster. The material was collected from 180 trees by the extraction of an increment core from pith to the cambium, at breast height, in a open pollinated test with 15 families at 18 years growth. The wood density components were measured using the X-ray densitometry technique. Although initially the density components of all rings were defined, in this study it was only analysed rings with a 6, 10 and 13 cambial age. The Average Ring Density is more dependent on the Earlywood components, mainly on Earlywood Density, than Latewood ones. Among all the components analysed, Earlywood ones revealed the highest and most stable genetic control, without revealing any adverse genetic correlation with <b>regard</b> to <b>other</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore these are the most suitable ones to be included in future selection and improvement programmes. Even though the correlation coefficients are low, Ring With is positively correlated at genetic and phenotypic level with Average Ring Density, Minimum Density, Earlywood Density and Latewood Percentage...|$|R

However, {{this article provides}} a great knowledge about {{the different types of}} sensitizers, but lacks the information <b>regarding</b> <b>other</b> important <b>components</b> of the DSSCs. Again, apart from discussing all different components of DSSCs, the review article by Jihuai Wu et al. [14] was concentrated over the counter electrode part. They have discussed the study of different types of counter electrodes based on transparency and flexibility, metals and alloys, carbon materials, conductive polymers, transition metal compounds, and hybrids. A highest efficiency of 14.3 % was discussed for the DSSC fabricated with Au/GNP as a counter electrode, Co 3 +/ 2 + as a redox couple, and LEG 4 [*]+[*]ADEKA- 1 as a sensitizer [15] and was shown in the review article. Similarly, Yeoh et al. and Fan et al. [16, 17] have given a brief review over the photoanode of DSSC. They have classified modification of photoanode into three categories, namely interfacial modification through the introduction of blocking and scattering layer, compositing, doping with non-metallic anions and metallic cations, interfacial engineering, and replacing the conventional mesoporous semiconducting metal oxide films like with 1 -D or 2 -D nanostructures.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The average area-wide {{underground}} terrestrial {{water storage}} in the Kherlen River basin, a relatively pristine area in eastern Mongolia where human impacts have been minimal so far, {{has undergone a}} marked decline in the past decade; nevertheless, {{there is no evidence}} that any unusual or systematic long-term storage change has taken place over the past half century. This result follows from an analysis of daily streamflow records measured at three gauging stations on the river, namely at Baganuur, Undurkhaan and Choibalsaan. This absence of a clear trend in long-term groundwater storage is generally consistent with findings in previous studies <b>regarding</b> trends of <b>other</b> <b>components</b> of the hydrological cycle in Mongolia and neighbouring regions at similar latitudes, namely in northern Inner Mongolia to the east and Xinjiang to the west, and even further in the same direction in the adjacent areas of southern Central Asia of the Russian Federation and of Kazakhstan...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Territory Living With Alcohol Programme (LWAP), {{implemented}} in Australia from 1991 to 2000, has been {{hailed as a}} successful example of a comprehensive public health alcohol policy, especially in its first 4 years— 1991 / 92 to 1995 / 96. This paper draws upon a policy analysis of the LWAP currently in progress to identify and describe the factors that made implementation possible at this time. I argue that programme implementation was shaped by a remarkable alignment of agencies and actors in the political, fiscal, administrative and industrial domains. This alignment of forces, however, owed as much to contingency as to planning and did not endure. Although the policy itself remained unchanged and continued to generate significant achievements, the alignment of forces sustaining it began to fragment from late 1995 onwards. The paper concludes by exploring {{the implications of the}} analysis for alcohol policy in other domains, and for the relationship between evidence <b>regarding</b> effectiveness and <b>other</b> <b>components</b> of the policy process. ...|$|R

The {{national}} road-network covers approximately 7429 {{kilometers of}} which are administered by Consejo Nacional de Vialidad (CONAVI). According to LANAMME studies approximately 58 % of the national roads are in areas with geotechnical issues that could affect the state of them.

The proposed model has its focus of study geotechnical infrastructures of the road-network without <b>regarding</b> <b>other</b> infrastructure <b>components.</b> This model aims to help in managing the priorities of the national road-network for optimizing the operation and maintenance of geotechnical issues.
