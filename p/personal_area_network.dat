2500|$|In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix {{rules have}} changed, {{thanks to the}} setting's {{constant}} evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a <b>Personal</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head-mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> {{such as home}} {{or small}} office LANs are usually more {{vulnerable}} to cyber-attacks than those with dedicated support staff {{and the ability to}} invest consistently in security defenses. In this paper we propose leveraging physical characteristics of these <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> in order to enable non-technical individuals to secure their networks or at least be aware that their devices have been compromised. Our proposal leverages records of location for mobile devices, proximity authentication, and individual homophily. In this work, we summarize previous studies on securing personal networks, proximity authentication, and software attestation. We then present a preliminary design for the detection of and recovery from infection for <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> Limitations and future work are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, two {{innovative}} computing {{and communication}} technologies have emerged: wearable computers and wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> Wearable computers advance an innovative form of personal computing based on continuously worn, intelligent assistants that augment memory, intellect, communication, and physical senses. Wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (WPAN) {{are a new}} class of wireless networks that provide seamless ad hoc communication over short-range radio links. The convergence of these technologies creates new opportunities for technological support of social interactions and face-to-face communities. While past research has provided a partial understanding of the social potentials of wearable computers and wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks,</b> we know little about the iii software engineering aspects of such systems. This dissertation aims to remedy this situation by exploring software infrastructure and architectural support for co-present communities.

40|$|Wireless <b>Personal</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> are {{increasingly}} widespread In their application. These range from simple remote controls to highly complex networks {{that allow the}} communication of heterogeneous data-collecting devices and actor devices via routing nodes and gateways, to networks such as wired JP networks. Key performance aspects for wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> are {{the large number of}} nodes capable of working within the same reception area and the energy consumption of such nodes. This work shows how equalisation for wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> can be realised with a small increase in hardware, in order to achieve performance improvements in highly dispersive environments. The proposed ideas are extended to a multiple-antenna solution which can be made downwards-compatible to the appropriate IEEE standard. In this manner, the performance in terms of either bit rate or robustness can be improved. For both equalisation and multiple-antenna procedures it is shown how the existing pre-amble can be used to find an estimate of the channel impulse response. This processing is performed in the time domain. Equalisation as well as multi-antenna channel separation is achieved by one set of cyclic filters operating at the chip rate. This allows a simple hardware design for integration. Selected methods are tested in real-time in a testbed for wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> and. are shown to offer real performance improvements.

The protocol is undemanding in terms of resources, so even simple devices can participate in the network. The network is simulated and a prototype is realized...|$|R
