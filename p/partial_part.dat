Traditionally RBF based shape approximation method {{is used for}} entire object, but in many applications only <b>partial</b> <b>part</b> of the points needs to be reconstructed. Our method first transforms the partial point cloud with PCA, then generates off-surface points by plane fitting for the local neighborhood of each point. The implicit surface is generated with constructed RBF while the surface edge is constrained by checking whether the marching cube is within the points' range, and octree-based subdivision {{is also used to}} speed the procedure. The proposed approach can reconstruct partial surface with constrained edge in much less computational time, and its efficiency is tested with experiments on different point clouds...|$|E

Methods: Combination of throat and nasal swab specimens {{was subjected to}} viral RNA extraction. For screening, the extracted RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR targeting upstream of E gene, open reading frame 1 b and open reading frame 1 a. For confirmation, the RNA was subjected to RT-PCR targeting <b>partial</b> <b>part</b> of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results: Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_ 1 _ 2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV.

This kind of transport has become a very popular type of spatial mobility after its deregulation and liberalization particularly thanks to its speed, cheaper fares and relative safety. Thanks to this spatial mobility of inhabitants, {{it is possible to}} delineate borders of regions according to real movements. Supposing usage of aviation data to delineate nodal regions, the airports represent their nodes. The purpose of this master´s thesis was delineating nodal regions via civil transport data in an interesting territory of Central Europe. Its western and eastern part has undergone different historical and political development which has had consequences on the aviation development level. Research input data included number of flights between central European airports for the period of 1 day. The master´s thesis is structured into 5 chapters. The first parts are: introduction and goals, theoretical part and methodology.
