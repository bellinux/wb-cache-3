50|$|In gemology/gemmology, the {{gemstone}} refractometer is one {{the fundamental}} {{pieces of equipment}} used in a gemological laboratory. Gemstones are transparent minerals and can therefore be examined using optical methods. Refractive index is a material constant, dependent on the chemical composition of a substance. The refractometer is used to help identify gem materials by measuring their refractive index, {{one of the principal}} properties used in determining the type of a gemstone. Due to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light used (i.e. dispersion), the measurement is normally taken at the wavelength of the sodium line D-line (NaD) of ~589 nm. This is either filtered out from daylight or generated with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED). Certain stones such as rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and topaz are optically anisotropic. They demonstrate birefringence based on the <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> of the light. The two different refractive indexes are classified using a polarisation filter.

To extract a pure rotational phase shift, we suggest to measure a difference in the angle of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> rotation by two consecutive light beams with opposite OAM. The differential angle Δα_ℓ is proportional to the rotation frequency of the medium ω_rot and the winding number ℓ of light, and is inversely proportional to the group velocity of light.

We demonstrate in particular that all bands along the cubic [100] direction can be identified with the irreducible representations E+/-,A and B of the C 4 point group. E+ and E- modes represent the only transmission channels for plane waves with wave vector along the ? line, and can be identified as non-interacting transmission channels for right- (E-) and left-circularly polarised light (E+), respectively. Scattering matrix calculations provide explicit relationships for the transmission and reflectance amplitudes through a finite slab which guarantee equal transmission rates for both polarisations and vanishing ellipticity below a critical frequency, yet allowing for finite rotation of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane.</b> All results are verified numerically for the so-called 8 -srs geometry, consisting of eight interwoven equal-handed dielectric Gyroid networks embedded in air.

In order to solve such problems research has been dedicated to developing driver assistance systems that are able to monitor the traffic situation around the vehicle. This paper presents methods for recognizing several circumstances on a road. The methods use both the in-vehicle warning systems and the roadside infrastructure. Preliminary evaluation results for fog and ice-on-road detection are presented. The ice detection results are based on data recorded in a test track dedicated to tyre friction testing. The achieved results anticipate that ice detection could work at a performance of 70 % detection with the right setup, which is a good foundation for implementation. However, the full benefit of the presented cooperative system is achieved by fusing the outputs of multiple data sources, which is the key point of discussion behind this publication. II.

40|$|With the {{adoption}} of IEEE. 802. 11 / 16 wireless networks are fast becoming a preferred solution to the Access “Last Mile” problem. The ease of installation and minimum disruption to infrastructure makes wireless systems an attractive and economical alternative to conventional “hard connected” layouts. With connecting optical systems commonly operating at 10 Gb/s and the latest generation VDSL modems requiring 10 MHz of bandwidth, conventional wireless systems are challenged. The aim of this project is to demonstrate a wireless system that could operate at data rates commensurate to that of these “wired “ and optical systems. To accomplish this, a wide bandwidth suspended patch antenna was developed and modelled using Agilent ADS software. Difficulties with the antenna feed were overcome using an integrated stub tuning method. Three antennas were designed to operate at centre frequencies of 2. 4 GHz, 4 GHz, and 6 GHz, these being combined into an array. Performance of the individual elements was analysed both experimentally and {{with the use of}} modelling, both sets of results were then compared and used to optimise the final design. A standard 4 QAM technique was employed to double the system throughput. A phase locked loop based carrier and clock recovery circuit was implemented to enable autonomous demodulation and data analysis over the target distance of 60 metres. The complete system was then evaluated in terms of data throughput. By combining the bandwidth capability of each antenna, and utilising the linear polarisation properties of the patches, three channels were created on each of two <b>polarisation</b> <b>planes.</b> In this way a total throughput of 10. 4 Gbs of PRBS data was transmitted...|$|R

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} efficient creation of highly entangled bipartite continuous variable polarisation states. Exploiting an optimised scheme {{for the production}} of squeezing using the Kerr non-linearity of a glass fibre we generated polarisation squeezed pulses with a mean classical excitation in S 3. Polarisation entanglement was generated by interfering two independent polarisation squeezed fields on a symmetric beam splitter. The resultant beams exhibit strong quantum noise correlations in the dark S 1 - S 2 <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane.</b> To verify entanglement generation, we characterised the quantum correlations of the system for two different sets of conjugate Stokes parameters. The quantum correlations along the squeezed and the anti-squeezed Stokes parameters were observed to be - 4. 1 +/- 0. 3 dB and - 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 dB below the shot noise level respectively. The degree of correlations was found to depend critically on the beam splitting ratio of the entangling beam splitter. Carrying out measurements on a different set of conjugate Stokes parameters, correlations of - 3. 6 +/- 0. 3 dB and - 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 dB have been observed. This result is more robust against asymmetries in the entangling beam splitter, even in the presence of excess noise. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The RoboPol {{instrument}} and the relevant program {{was developed in}} order to conduct a systematic study of the optical polarisation variability of blazars. Driven by the discovery that long smooth rotations of the optical <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> {{can be associated with}} the activity in other bands and especially in gamma rays, the program was meant to investigate the physical mechanisms causing them and quantify the optical polarisation behaviour in blazars. Over the first three nominal observing seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) RoboPol detected 40 rotations in 24 blazars by observing a gamma-ray-loud and gamma-ray-quite unbiassed sample of blazars, providing a reliable set of events for exploring the phenomenon. The obtain datasets provided the ground for a systematic quantification of the variability of the optical polarisation in such systems. In the following after a brief review of the discoveries that relate to the gamma-ray loudness of the sources we move on to discuss a simple jet model that explains the observed dichotomy in terms of polarisation between gamma-ray-loud and quite sources and the dependence of polarisation and the stability of the polarisation angle on the synchrotron peak frequency.

40|$|AbstractWhite noise {{techniques}} {{are used to}} compare the two photoreceptor sub-types in blowfly retina, the short visual fibres (R 1 - 6) that code achromatic contrast, and the long visual fibres (R 7 and R 8) that together code wavelength distribution and <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane.</b> Measurements of signal and noise spectra and contrast gain, taken across a broad intensity range, permit a detailed comparison of coding efficiency under natural conditions of illumination. As a function of excitation (effective photons per photoreceptor per second; hυ/rec per s), adaptive changes in the long and short visual fibres are similar, suggesting that post-rhodopsin their phototransduction cascades are identical. Under identical natural daylight conditions (photons per cm 2 per second; hυ/cm 2 per s) short visual fibres catch more photons, thus operating with a higher signal to noise ratio and faster response, to consistently outperform the long visual fibres. Long visual fibres compensate for their poor quantum catch by having a higher absolute gain (mV/hυ) which at low light intensities enables them to achieve a level of contrast gain (mV/unit contrast) similar to the short visual fibres. Differences in signal to noise ratios are related to known differences in photoreceptor structure and synaptic frequency among visual interneurons. The principles of matching sensitivity and synapse number to quantum catch described here could explain analogous differences between chromatic and achromatic pathways in mammalian and amphibian retinas...|$|E

40|$|We study Maxwell's {{equations}} on a 4 -manifold N with {{a medium}} that is non-dissipative {{and has a}} linear and pointwise response. In this setting, the medium can be represented by a suitable (2, 2) -tensor on the 4 -manifold N. Moreover, in each cotangent space on N, the medium defines a Fresnel surface. Essentially, the Fresnel surface is a tensorial analogue of the dispersion equation that describes {{the response of the}} medium for signals in the geometric optics limit. For example, in isotropic medium the Fresnel surface is at each point a Lorentz light cone. In a recent paper, I. Lindell, A. Favaro and L. Bergamin introduced a condition that constrains the <b>polarisation</b> for <b>plane</b> waves. In this paper we show (under suitable assumptions) that a slight strengthening of this condition gives a pointwise characterisation of all medium tensors for which the Fresnel surface is the union of two distinct Lorentz null cones. This is for example the behaviour of uniaxial medium like calcite. Moreover, using the representation formulas from Lindell et al. we obtain a closed form representation formula that pointwise parameterises all medium tensors for which the Fresnel surface is the union of two distinct Lorentz null cones. Both the characterisation and the representation formula are tensorial and do not depend on local coordinates...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{anisotropy}} is investigated {{across the}} previously unstudied region of central East Antarctica including new coastal locations and remote, temporary stations far inland. Shear-wave splitting parameters are determined using core refracted phases from earthquakes occurring at teleseismic distances. New results are obtained from {{stations of the}} SSCUA temporary deployment in central East Antarctica (the greater Lambert Glacier basin) and also from permanent stations at Mawson and Casey. The pattern, for the coastal stations, shows that {{the orientation of the}} <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> of the fast S-wave is parallel to the general trend of the continental margin of central East Antarctica. The remote stations, further inland, show fast directions that are not parallel to the continental margin and change more from station to station. These results are discussed, together with previous results of shear-wave splitting studies from other regions of East Antarctica in the light of a revised absolute plate motion (APM). In Dronning Maud Land and Victoria Land, the APM vectors are larger than in the Lambert Glacier region and strain associated with mantle flow could be contributing to observed anisotropy in these regions. The margin-parallel anisotropy observed at the coastal stations in central East Antarctica is likely to be caused by a combination of pre-existing lineations, and an additional component associated with trans-tensional rifting at the breakup of Gondwana. The more variable fast directions of the inland stations are likely to be caused by upper lithospheric remnant anisotropy of ancient lithospheric blocks, possibly with a component from the failed rifting associated with the trans-tensional basin of the present-day Lambert Glacier...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} S-band microwave frequency phase-contrast imaging. Resolution is a critical issue so system enhancements such as optical remote connection and polarisation-dependant sensing have been implemented within an end-to-end sensing system. Initially, the feasibility of phase-contrast measurements was considered {{and the limits of}} phase and amplitude measurements established. A switching matrix was then designed and incorporated into a tri-antenna array to demonstrate triangulation-based location. Commercial, linearly-polarised antennas were then used to demonstrate basic object location. A comprehensive experimental investigation into optical transmission of phase sensitive data using Radio over Fibre (RoF) techniques is then described. Reflective technology and directly modulated Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are assessed for suitability as are Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexed (CWDM) architectures. These are believed to be a novel contribution in the imaging context as are the techniques employed to enhance and extend the matching and performance of the optical devices. A directly modulated VCSEL based CWDM method was then used over the extended range of 1 km of standard single mode optical fibre. Subsequently, dual <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> techniques were used to generate sequential, orthogonally-separated measurements, which required the development of a suitable antenna. The design, modelling, construction and deployment of a high cross-polar isolation, patch antenna is then described.

40|$|Polarisation, {{which was}} first studied in optics, is a {{fundamental}} property of all electromagnetic fields. A convenient way to describe the polarisation of two dimensional electromagnetic fields is given by the Stokes parameters. This thesis deals with different aspects of wave polarisation and electromagnetic field measurements. A generalisation of the Stokes parameters to three dimensions is presented. The theory {{has been used to}} develop methods and systems for obtaining the polarisation parameters of electromagnetic waves. The methods can be applied {{for a wide range of}} electromagnetic fields, measured both on ground and onboard satellites. The applications include, e. g., direction-finding, polarisation analysis, radar, and several examples in the field of wireless communication. Further applications are given in the analysis of satellite data, where a whistler wave is considered. Whistlers are circularly polarised electromagnetic waves propagating in the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic field. Dispersion in the magnetospheric plasma make the whistler frequencies travel at different speeds and the signal takes the form of a chirp. From instantaneous polarisation analysis of the whistler´s magnetic wave field, the normal to the <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane</b> is obtained and found to precess around the geomagnetic field. A statistic analysis of ionospheric stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) is also presented. SEE is generated by injecting a powerful high frequency radio wave into the ionosphere. It is shown that the SEE features have a statistical behaviour indistinguishable from the amplitude and phase distributions of narrow-band Gaussian noise. The results suggests that SEE cannot be explained by simple coherent processes alone. Finally, an expression for the complex Poynting theorem is derived for the general case of anharmonic fields. It is found that the complex Poynting theorem, for real fields and sources, is not a conservation law of the imaginary part of electromagnetic energy...|$|E

The measurements made by STEAMR will be used to monitor trace-gases and link the occurence of these to the Earth's climate by accurate modeling of the atmosphere. To interpret the measured data require a firm understanding of the coupling between the radiation emitted from the atmosphere to the signal being received by the instrument's optical system. Thus, precise knowledge of the instrument's optical performance while in orbit is crucial. This thesis is dedicated to the study of optical analysis and measurements of the highly advanced optical system of the STEAMR instrument. A mechanical tolerance analysis of the complete optical system consisting of two <b>polarisation</b> separated focal <b>plane</b> arrays, a four reflector anastigmatic relay optics chain and an off-axis Ritchey-Chretien telescope was performed. Using Monte-Carlo simulations in combination with ray-tracing and physical optics/physical theory of diffraction, it could be concluded that the overall reflector alignment accuracy from manufacturing should be better than 100 µm. Surface distortion analyses of the 1. 6 m × 0. 8 m primary reflector highlighted the need for an optical system with high stability in orbit (< 30 µm). Furthermore, it was shown that the manufacturing techniques were compliant with the requirements dictated by the tolerance analysis. The design, manufacturing and characterisation of a 340 GHz smooth-walled spline feed horn antenna for STEAMR is presented also presented.

The spatial alignment of gas phase molecules overcomes {{the loss of}} information that results from averaging angle-dependent quantities over all the possible orientations of an isotropic sample. Therefore, laser-induced molecular alignment techniques are an essential component in new experiments aimed at measuring the structure of molecules with attosecond time resolution. In {{the first part of}} this thesis an experiment to measure molecular axis alignment is described. This experiment is based on the velocity map imaging technique in conjunction with time-resolved femtosecond laser Coulomb explosion of the molecular sample by an intense circularly polarised laser beam. A circularly polarised beam is needed to ensure a uniform detection efficiency for each possible orientation of the molecular axis in the <b>polarisation</b> <b>plane.</b> However, such a polarisation produces ion distributions that are not cylindrically symmetric, preventing the use of the standard Abel inversion technique to retrieve the three-dimensional ion distributions from the detected two-dimensional images. A new inversion algorithm is presented that allows the retrieval of molecular axis distributions from angular distributions of ions without cylindrical symmetry. The second part of the thesis focuses on the application of laser-induced molecular alignment to retrieve molecular structure and dynamics from high-order harmonic generation (HHG) experiments. HHG with a mid-infrared laser source (1300 nm) from aligned molecular samples of CO 2, N 2, C 2 H 2, and N 2 O are presented. The use of a laser source with a wavelength longer than that used in previous experiments (800 nm) has increased the amount of information obtainable from such experiments.

The dispersion equation for MHD waves within each of half space is obtained in the reference frame connected with the discontinuity surface.

The surface wave can be a fast one or, in rare cases, a slow, magnetoacoustic one. The entropy and Alfvén waves always remain in a usual homogeneous mode. (II) For certain values of cp and parameters of the discontinuity behind the front of the fast shock wave, there can be four slow magnetoacoustic waves, satisfying the dispersion equation, and none of the fast magnetoacoustic waves.

Also, the technique for the reduction of the data, from its initial electronograph to the final extraction of the Stokes parameters for over 8550 points in the Orion Nebula is described. The next chapter contains an account of gaseous nebulae, particularly the Orion Nebula, where a review of the present properties of this object and some general remarks on M 43 are made. In Chapter 5 of this thesis, the technique employed to measure the optical linear polarisation of these nebulae, together with a final map of the polarisation for each of them, and a comparison of the results obtained by the present method for the Orion Nebula with those measurements of Hall (1974) and Pallister et al (1977) are described which confirm the success of the present technique.
