5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. <b>Pulse</b> CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a <b>pulse</b> oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular <b>pulse</b> oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a <b>pulse</b> oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
