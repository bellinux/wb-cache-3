He was walking leisurely along the little green path at the bottom, beside the stream, a satchel slung upon his left hip, a stout walking-stick in his hand, and a brown-holland sun-hat upon his head.

5000|$|The site of Munhatta, {{excavated}} by J. Perrot, {{has contributed}} a large series of ceramic assemblages dated to the Neolithic period. In one phase {{there are some}} extraordinarily sophisticated ceramic vessels of especially finely levigated, highly polished or burnished (<b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> almost dry, <b>leather</b> hard, surfaces <b>of</b> unfired clay to produce a smooth surface that becomes shiny when fired), black fabric. Other pottery suggests that some potters in this period, dated later than an earlier, [...] "Yarmukian" [...] phase at the site (identified by Sha'ar HaGolan type pottery), were highly skilled craftspeople. One researcher, Y. Garfinkel, refers to this phase as [...] "Jericho IX" [...] after a stratum and associated pottery excavated by J. Garstang at Jericho (he excavated at Jericho prior to Kenyon). The decorated pottery of this period often has red paint {{in the form of}} stripes, sometimes in large, wide herringbone-like decorations.|$|R

60|$|Since Alaric's {{conviction}} Charley led a busy life; and as men {{who have}} really something to do have seldom time to get into much mischief, he had been peculiarly moral and respectable. It {{is not surprising that}} at such a moment Gertrude found that Alaric's newer friends fell off from him. Of course they did; nor is it a sign of ingratitude or heartlessness in the world that at such a period of great distress new friends should fall off. New friends, like one's best coat and polished patent-leather dress boots, are only intended for holiday wear. At other times they are neither serviceable nor comfortable; they do not answer the required purposes, and are ill adapted to give us the ease we seek. A new coat, however, has this advantage, that it will in time become old and comfortable; so much can by no means be predicted with certainty of a new friend. Woe to those men who go through the world with none but new coats on their backs, with no boots but those <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> <b>leather,</b> with none but new friends to comfort them in adversity.|$|R

40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways of approaching the whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> are examined: (i) influence {{of the type of}} tannage, (ii) influence of the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> (iii) influence <b>of</b> the type of retannage, (iv) influence of the type of fatliquor, and (v) influence of the use of flame retardants. The results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance. However, the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> type <b>of</b> tannage, retannage and fatliquor effect the flammability behavior <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> In addition, the use of flame retardants slightly improves the smouldering properties <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R
