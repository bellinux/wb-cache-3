25|$|Because Black Eagle Dam is an {{overflow}} dam, it {{is common}} for debris to jam against the dam or obstruct the <b>penstock</b> intakes. Driftwood and logs are the most common forms of debris, but unusual objects such as boat docks, bowling balls, canoes, hot tubs, and small wooden and steel sheds and buildings also sometimes become lodged against the dam. Removing hollow items can be dangerous, because the water pressure against them can cause them to implode. In addition to large amounts of driftwood, about 100 animal carcasses (cattle, deer, dogs, and various small animals) become lodged against the dam or the <b>penstock</b> intake screens each year. Floating screens {{at the entrance to the}} forebay catch many items, as do the <b>penstock</b> intake screens. Workers use a crane to remove items from these screens, and bury the items retrieved at a landfill. Dam operators also use a yellow civilian version of the Alvis Stalwart amphibious vehicle to remove objects, and to maintain the dam. (This vehicle caused a stir in Great Falls in June 2006, when local residents driving on a nearby road mistook the vehicle for a sport utility vehicle which had fallen into the water.) Ice is another form of dangerous debris for the dam. In December 2010, blocks of floating ice overwhelmed the top of the dam, tearing the handrails off the maintenance walkway.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Montana Power {{upgraded}} Black Eagle Dam {{to generate}} more electrical (rather than mechanical) power.

500|$|After the {{clearing}} of over [...] {{of the future}} reservoir site and the relocation of several roads that ran through it, the diversion tunnel was closed and water began to rise behind New Don Pedro. The rising lake submerged Old Don Pedro Dam on April 12, 1970 and inundated the Gold Rush town of Jacksonville by June. The powerhouse and penstocks were completed by August 1970, after lengthy delays and setbacks due to the sheer scale of the generators, pipes and gates used in their construction.

2500|$|Most {{hydroelectric}} power {{comes from the}} potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator; to boost the power generation capabilities of a dam, the water may be run through a large pipe called a <b>penstock</b> before the turbine. A variant on this simple model uses pumped-storage hydroelectricity to produce electricity to match periods {{of high and low}} demand, by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. (For example, see Dinorwig Power Station.) ...|$|E
