One tradeoff allows an attacker to reconstruct the key in one second from two minutes of known plaintext or in several minutes from two seconds of known plain text, but he must first complete an expensive <b>preprocessing</b> stage which requires 248 steps to compute around 300 GB of data.

25|$|Some attacks {{require an}} {{expensive}} <b>preprocessing</b> stage {{after which the}} cipher can be broken in minutes or seconds. Until recently, the weaknesses have been passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in <b>preprocessing</b> is {{conventionally}} slice timing correction. The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times, and hence the slices represent brain activity at different timepoints. Since this complicates later analysis, a timing correction is applied to bring all slices to the same timepoint reference. This is done by assuming the timecourse of a voxel is smooth when plotted as a dotted line. Hence the voxel's intensity value at other times not in the sampled frames can be calculated by filling in the dots to create a continuous curve.|$|E

25|$|Most metals {{occur in}} nature in their {{oxidized}} form (ores) and thus must {{be reduced to}} their metallic forms. The ore is dissolved following some <b>preprocessing</b> in an aqueous electrolyte or in a molten salt and the resulting solution is electrolyzed.

Several metals are naturally present as metal sulfides; these include copper, lead, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base metal ores. Most metal sulfides or their salts, are electrically conductive and this allows electrochemical redox reactions to efficiently occur in the molten state or in aqueous solutions.|$|E

Preprocessor directives are extensively used in C/C++ programs and have various purposes. However, program code with lots of directives often causes problems in program understanding and maintenance. The main source of the problem is the difference between the code that the programmer sees and the <b>preprocessed</b> code that the compiler is given. We designed a Preprocessor Schema and implemented a preprocessor which produces both <b>preprocessed</b> (. i) files and schema instances.

40|$|Abstract — Image {{segmentation}} {{is crucial}} to object-oriented remote sensing imagery analysis. In this paper, a newly modified texture segmentation algorithm is proposed using spectral, shape and intensity features. This algorithm is a robust technique {{that can be applied}} directly to the color images. The image is <b>preprocessed</b> using Adaptive Switching Median Filter, which removes the impulse noises and keeping the fine details of the image intact in the most efficient manner. Also, the <b>preprocessed</b> image is smoothened using morphological operators, which reduces the false detection of abnormal cells. Then, the <b>preprocessed</b> image is transformed into HSV (Hue, Saturation and value) color space representation in order to analyze and establish a color contrast gradient. The multiscale morphological gradient in the intensity channel of the <b>preprocessed</b> image is obtained and multiplied with the color contrast gradient. The shape feature is extracted from the <b>preprocessed</b> image based on the descriptors such as compactness, convexness, rectangularity and eccentricity, moment invariants. Based on these spectral, shape and intensity features, markers are extracted for this image and given as input to the watershed algorithm which uses a Hill-Climbing approach to identify and label the neighborhood pixels. This algorithm may reduce the computational complexity by avoiding the process of computing lower-complete image.
