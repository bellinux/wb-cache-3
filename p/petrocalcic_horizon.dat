The aim {{of this study was to}} show that calcified filaments were also numerous in these <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons,</b> thus ensuring their high cohesion. Samples were collected in <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons</b> of Eutrochrepts in Beauce, France. They were studied by scanning electron microscopy, and chemical analyses were performed using an energy dispersion spectrometer microprobe. Observations of fragments in the secondary electron mode showed a close packing of needle-fiber calcite with micro-rod calcite without any visible calcified filament. In the backscattered electron mode, observations showed numerous rounded voids, 0. 5 to 1. 0 µm in diameter within the packing of microrods. These voids and their walls exhibited similar morphological characteristics to those of the calcified filaments described earlier and interpreted as the remains of fungal hyphae. Chemical analysis of the rounded voids' walls, needle-fiber calcite, and micro-rod calcite revealed the presence of C and Ca as main elements and secondarily of Al and Si, but their respective compositions were not significantly different (P = 0. 05).

40|$|Ooids, pisoids, nodules, concretions, {{and a host}} {{of other}} terms are used to {{describe}} concentrically-zoned pedogenic carbonate, phyllosilicates, silica, and other minerals in calcic and <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons</b> worldwide. The pedogenic and paleoenvironmental significance of such features is not always easy to interpret because variations in size, structure, composition, and soil-geomorphic context have been used to infer distinct modes of genesis for features that appear similar. Using both optical and scanning electron microscopy, petrocalcic soil samples from the Jornada La Mesa geomorphic surface in New Mexico and the Mormon Mesa geomorphic surface in Nevada were studied to reconsider the formation of pedogenic ooids. In this paper, “ooids” are 3 ̆c 2 mm in diameter and are comprised of concentrically alternating carbonate and fibrous clay laminae. “Pisoids” are 3 ̆e 2 mm in diameter and have a range of internal morphologies. Ooids were especially common within features including clast pendant laminae, pisoids, and laminar horizons or laminar horizon caps. We propose a possible new mode of ooid genesis, suggesting that crystal growth can move ooids tiny, incremental distances over time, and that phyllosilicates are an important genetic component. Ooids are interpreted to form via: (1) mineralization during the evaporation of solutions held by surface tension around mineral grains, clasts, or petrocalcic fragments, with or without the presence of organic matter, (2) hydration and plastic behavior of pervasive, pedogenic, fibrous phyllosilicates that co-precipitate with pedogenic calcite, and (3) tiny, successive movements caused by the crystallization pressure of pedogenic carbonate and other minerals during soil solution evaporation. Spheroidal morphology is initially promoted by chemical precipitation from evaporating solutions around grains. Next, crystallization pressures from the surrounding matrix displace grains non-uniformly, promoting stochastic contacts or ‘knocking’ of ooids against one another and against the soil matrix. Over long time spans, this micrometer-scale, episodic translocation and rotation, in tandem with the plastic behavior of fibrous phyllosilicates, enhances the spherical shape of ooids. The model described here does not preclude possible biological contributions to ooid genesis, nor refute the role of other processes in producing similar features in the same soil. Finally, ooid size is limited by physical and hydrological thresholds. Pisoids, as larger features, are more complex and are more likely to involve erosion; they do not form in the same manner as ooids. This study has implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations of calcic and <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons,</b> and for the selection of pedogenic features for isotopic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO 3 − 1) accumulates in Haplocambids and Torrifluvents in inset fan and fan skirt {{positions}} in central Nevada. The soils store {{as much as}} 17, 600 kg of NO 3 − 1 N ha− 1 within the upper 208 cm. This paper provides an explanation. These Holocene soils receive NO 3 − 1 N from mineralization of organic matter and other NO 3 − 1 N sources including snowmelt. The NO 3 − 1 is delivered to soils {{in the first part}} of snowmelt in run-off from the higher surfaces. The last part of the melt and the run-off, when sufficient, serve to move the NO 3 − 1 out of the root zone. Winter fat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), the most valuable winter grazing plant in the Great Basin, is the common plant on NO 3 − 1 N rich soils. The soils are loamy or sandy and lack horizons restricting water penetration or biological denitrification zones. Hence, some NO 3 − 1 is free to leach deeply past plant roots. Playas, wet floodplains, deeply gullied inset fans and well-developed soils accumulate little NO 3 − 1 except where the latter soils are capped by desert pavements and rarely, if ever become saturated with water. Soils with argillic or <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons</b> or duripans on summits of alluvial fan remnants loose NO 3 − 1 through denitrification, or incorporate it in plants, commonly accumulating less than 50 kg of NO 3 − 1 N ha− 1.

40|$|Since the 1970 s and 1980 s, the {{vineyard}} {{areas in the}} Mediterranean region of north east Spain have undergone profound transformation to allow greater mechanization.

Recently the EU Common Agricultural Policy encourages this through {{the vineyard}} restructuring and conversion plans (Commission Regulation EC No 1227 ⁄ 2000 of 31 May 2000) by subsidizing up to 50 % of the cost of soil preparation such as soil movement and land levelling. A clear example of the problems that this causes is in the Penede`s vineyard region (Catalonia, north east Spain), and the present research analyses the changes in soil properties caused by erosion, deep ploughing and land levelling. The study was carried out in an area of 30 000 ha for which a Soil Information System at a scale of 1 : 50 000 was developed based on 394 field observations (89 soil profiles and 251 auger hole samples down to 120 cm). The results show that 74 % of the described soil profiles are disturbed with evidence of soil mixing and ⁄ or profile truncation due to erosion, deep ploughing and ⁄ or land levelling.

The objectives of the present research were to study 1) genesis and development of soils related to different geomorphic surfaces in Kouh Birk Area (Mehrestan City), 2) Soil classification according to Soil Taxonomy (2014) and WRB (2014) systems, and 3) physicochemical properties, clay mineralogy and micromorphology of soils. Materials and Methods: Mean annual rainfall and soil temperature in the selected location are 153. 46 mm and 19. 6 oC, respectively. From geological point of view, the studied area {{is a part of}} west and south west zones and Flysch zone of east Iran. Soil temperature and moisture regimes of this part are thermic and aridic, respectively. Eight representative pedons on different surfaces including rock pediment, mantled pediment, Alluvial fan and Upper terraces were selected, sampled, and described. Routine physicochemical analyses, clay mineralogy, and micromorphological observations performed on soil samples. Soil reaction, texture, electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate, and gypsum were identified. Four samples including Bt horizon of pedon 1, Bk 1 horizon of pedon 4, By 2 horizon of pedon 5 and Bk 1 horizon of pedon 7 were selected for clay mineralogy investigations. Four slides including Mg saturated, Mg saturated treated with ethylene glycol, K saturated, and K saturated heated up to 550 oC were analyzed. A Brucker X-Ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 30 mA was used for XRD analyses. Undisturbed soil samples from Bt horizon of pedon 1, Bk 2 horizon of pedon 2, Btn horizon of pedon 3, By 2 horizon of pedon 5, Bk 1 horizon of pedon 7, and By 1 horizon of pedon 8 were selected for micromorphological observations.

40|$|The Early to Middle Pleistocene {{continental}} {{transition in}} East Africa is widely documented from lacustrine and deep-sea records, although significant insights are also provided by fluvio-lacustrine successions {{of the central}} and southern African Rift Valley, such as the at Olduvai Gorge succession (Tanzania), the Bouri Formation (Ethiopia) and the Olorgesailie Formation (Kenya). The Early to Middle Pleistocene Dandiero Basin fill (Eritrean Danakil) represents the only continental succession in the northernmost sector of the African Rift Valley that provided abundant fossil vertebrates, including human remains. The present study integrates already available data with new sedimentological, pedological, magnetostratigraphic, paleontological and paleoanthropological investigations of the 300 m thick Aalat section (North Dandiero Basin). This sedimentary succession records repeated shifts from fluvial to lacustrine depositional settings, which occurred under the tight interaction between local tectonics and Pleistocene climate changes. Accumulation was associated with axial sedimentation in a NS-trending extensional basin, with an overall tectono-sedimentary setting comparable {{with that of the}} coeval Bouri Formation (Ethiopia). Because of the high rates of sedimentation, a poor to moderate degree of soil development characterizes the whole succession. Sporadic soil horizons testify to carbonate dissolution, leaching and accumulation in calcic and <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons</b> (indicating an overall dry climate). The alternate with local to extensive iron-oxide/hydroxide segregation, promoted by water infiltration under varying drainage conditions and/or seasonal contrast, that record more humid conditions.

50|$|A duripan is a {{diagnostic}} soil horizon of the USDA soil taxonomy that is cemented by illuvial silica into a subsurface hardpan. Similar to a fragipan, <b>Petrocalcic</b> <b>Horizon</b> and petrogypsic horizon, it is firmly cemented and restricts soil management. In soil descriptions, {{they are most}} often denoted by the symbol Bqm. The closest equivalent in the Canadian system of soil classification is called a duric horizon, although {{it does not mean}} exactly the same thing as a duripan in the United States. They form almost exclusively in arid or Mediterranean climates, and can be as hard as concrete, which makes plowing very difficult or impossible. Soils that include duripans are generally used for grazing or wildlife habitat, and are seldom cultivated.|$|E
50|$|Duripans occur {{mostly in}} arid or {{semiarid}} climates, where {{the soil is}} usually dry or seasonally dry. Soils with duripans are often geographically associated with areas of volcanic activity, and show evidence of ash or volcanic glass deposition. Volcanic glass weathers rapidly, providing an ample supply of soluble silica to cement the underlying soil. Other common sources of the silica cementing agent are iron-magnesium minerals and feldspars. The parent material of duripan soils usually does not contain {{a large amount of}} calcium carbonate, and if there is an abundance of calcium, a <b>Petrocalcic</b> <b>Horizon</b> can form in conjunction with the duripan. The weathered silica is mostly transported by water into the subsoil, where it precipitates and forms microaggregates that gradually grow into a full-fledged duripan. It cannot be considered a duripan until the cracks and gaps that allow roots to penetrate are 10 cm or more apart. A duripan can sometimes be broken up by earthquakes or periods of alternate wetting and drying that cause small volume changes.|$|E

40|$|Obtaining isotope ages for arid {{soils and}} paleosols, {{including}} carbonate-cemented (calcic and <b>petrocalcic)</b> <b>horizons,</b> constitutes a significant challenge for soil scientists, geomorphologists, and stratigraphers. Carbonate-cemented soils foster diverse suites of authigenic minerals with exciting potential for geochronology, however, this potential {{has not been}} realized. This dissertation describes the timing of pedogenic palygorskite and sepiolite crystallization in extremely old, extant petrocalcic soils of the southwest U. S. A., and assumes that these fibrous, high-magnesium phyllosilicates contain sufficient lattice-bound K to warrant vacuum-encapsulated 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. This three-part study evaluated the (1) selective extraction, (2) 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analysis, and (3) pedogenesis of palygorskite and sepiolite. Effects of selective extraction of the phyllosilicates from carbonate and silica cements using successive buffered sodium acetate and tiron solution treatments, and particle size fractionation via centrifuge, were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry, and x-ray diffraction analysis. No adverse effects were identified, however, intergrowths and/or inclusions of detrital mineral species persisted in the samples. Moreover, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar total gas ages exceeded known relative dates by two orders of magnitude. Gas chromatograph data indicate that hydrocarbon contaminants - derived chiefly from selective dissolution compounds, but also possibly from the natural soil environment - caused these impossible ages. Future work is needed both to constrain argon diffusion parameters for the clays, and also to evaluate methods to remove organic contaminants. Extensive mineralogical, chemical, and micromorphological analysis of petrocalcic soil samples from Mormon Mesa, NV, permitted conceptual modeling of mineral genesis during pluvial-interpluvial climate oscillations. These models address not only the timing and genetic relationships of palygorskite, sepiolite, calcite, and silica, but also the presence of authigenic barite (BaSO 4), in the petrocalcic soil. Isotopic dates for petrocalcic soils are sorely needed to assess rates at which arid landforms and soils have formed, stabilized, and/or degraded both in the late Holocene, and in the geologic past. Thus, the potential benefit of successful 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of pedogenic palygorskite and sepiolite, and other arid soil minerals, strongly merits further experimentation and discussion. Extensive, detailed, and targeted micromorphological analysis is an inescapable prerequisite of any study linking the genesis and geochronology of calcic and petrocalcic soil landscapes.

40|$|The Kirkwood Formation in the Bushman's River {{area of the}} Algoa Basin is characterised by {{a number}} of fining-upward cycles. These have been {{interpreted}} as indicating deposition in a dynamic aggrading meandering river system with the channel deposits (conglomerates grading upwards into sandstones) fining upward into the overbank deposits (mudrocks). Channel, channel-margin and overbank deposits were recognised. The three mudrock sequences logged comprise compound pedofacies sequences of multistorey, simple and cumulative palaeosols. Distinctive palaeopedological features, such as root traces and pedotubules, soil horizons and structures, mottles, and iron-rich and calcareous glaebules and calcareous hardpan lenses and layers were used to identify a number of palaeosols within the mudrock sequences. Each mudrock sequence comprises multistorey entisol, inceptisol, alfisol, ultisol, aridisol and vertisol profiles at different stags of pedogenic maturity. The entisols and inceptisols are relatively immature profiles formed close to the meandering river channel and are classified as channel-margin palaeosols. The ultisols, alfisols, aridisols and vertisols are more mature and formed at some distance from the channel. They are classified as proximal floodbasin or distal floodbasin palaeosols depending on their maturity, distance from the channel and grain-size. Slickensides, desiccation cracks, and iron-rich concretions occur, indicating multiple cycles of wetting and drying. A low water-table beneath the floodplain is indicated by both the prominent maroon-brown colouration of the mudstones, caused by oxidation during deposition, and the general lack of evaporites in the sequence. Calcretes comprising calcic and <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizons</b> are very common in the lower mudrock sequence, rare in the middle mudrock sequence and relatively common in the upper mudrock sequence. The calcretes generally consist a nodular zone which may, in some cases, be capped by a thin hardpan layer. The calcic palaeosols commonly show stages of carbonate accumulation which indicate at least 10 000 years of formation. The lack of calcrete formation in some of the profiles may indicate frequent flooding and high sediment accretion rates or a decrease in the influx of Ca²⁺-rich aeolian dust into the depositional basin. Clay alluviation is common in many of the profiles and soil structures are commonly well developed. The palaeosols are interpreted as having formed on an aggrading floodplain in a warm to hot (25 - 30 °C), semi-arid climate with a low but seasonal rainfall (100 - 500 mm per annum) ...|$|R
40|$|Geochronological {{data for}} timing of Gulf of Corinth rift-margin fault {{migration}} is presented from the Megara basin, {{precursor to the}} active eastern Corinth rift. Fifteen sanidine separates from a thin tuff {{near the top of}} the sedimentary basin fill analysed by laser-fusion give apparent 40 Ar– 39 Ar ages from 2. 78 to 4. 53 Ma. A weighted mean age of 2. 82 ± 0. 06 Ma (at 2 s error) for the three youngest aliquots (range of mean ages 2. 78 – 2. 86 Ma) is regarded as a maximum probable age for ash eruption. Together with magnetostratigraphy results, this age constrains timing of Megara basin abandonment and likely propagation of the active South Alkyonides coastal faults that presently bound the southern rift-margin to the late-Pliocene, 2. 2 Ma. Initiation of the coastal faults caused uplift, fluvial incision and calcrete formation on geomorphic surfaces over the abandoned Megara basin fill. A <b>petrocalcic</b> laminar <b>horizon</b> from a supermature calcrete unconformably capping the fill gives a U–Pb age of 0. 77 ± 0. 08 Ma, dating a late stage in the history of calcrete development. The new age for initiation of active faulting in the eastern rift yields a low estimate of long-term mean extension along the active South Alkyonides coastal faults of 0. 9 – 1. 4 mm a- 1, consistent with previous geological data. This rate is less than the 100 -year GPS-determined geodetic extension rate of 6 ± 2. 7 mm a- 1 measured along a 23 °E meridional array just west of the Alkyonides gulf. It implies either that the geodetic rate declines rapidly over the 15 km distance into the eastern gulf or that the geodetic rate is unchanged but extra strain is taken up aseismically and/or along antithetic and unrecognised major intrabasinal faults. In the full graben of the central rift displacements are 3. 5 km along the Xylocastro and Antikyra faults; the mean long term extension rate here since 2. 2 Ma is 3. 5 mm a- 1, much less than current geodetic rates of 10 mm a- 1. In the western rift, despite a lack of precise chronological data, geodetic and extension rates seem comparable. Overall, a late-Pliocene to early Pleistocene age is likely for initiation of the deep-marine Corinth rift, with no evidence for rift propagation, either eastwards or westwards. More generally, our results constrain timing of strain localisation and vertical axis rigid block rotation over the Aegean–Anatolian plate and demonstrate that intraplate deformation can be accomplished rapidly in response to regional-scale tectonic drivers...|$|R

The study area covers two climatic regions including Shahrekord and Chellgerd with mean annual precipitations of 314 and 1224 mm, respectively. In Shahrekord area, {{the amount of}} Feo (amorphous and organic-bound iron) was higher in surface horizons, whereas, the Fed (crystalline, amorphous and organic-bound iron) was higher in the surface soil of well-drained pedons and concentrated in subsoils with high ground water. Smectite increases as chlorite and palygorskite decrease. This might be an indication of Fe-chlorite transformation {{as a result of}} the local effects of organic acids, alternate oxidation reduction and hydrolysis intensity of a wetter past climate. Presence of an argillic as well as <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon</b> with sparitic calcite and spherulitic fabric show intermittent and periodic leaching and deposition in Shahrekord area. Furthermore, reduction in sand and gravel content of the soils from mountain toward plains was attributed to the dissolution of carbonates and deposition of alluvium. Lower pH, lower carbonate content and higher pedogenic Fe in surface horizons were prominent in Chellgerd area. Consequently, interstratified chlorite-smectite, decrease of Fe-chlorite in fine clay, increase of smectite, high CEC and absence of <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon</b> show that weathering intensity was higher in Chellgerd as compared to Shahrekord area. Also, papules with concentric fabric, higher Fed-Feo, and redder hues in buried horizon suggest polygenetic soils.

To do this, a Random Forest (RF) analysis was applied. RF was able to select those variables according to their predictive potential for ESD. In that order, ECa_ 90, catchment slope, elevation and ECa_ 30 had main prediction importance. For validating purposes, 3035 ESD measurements were carried out, in five fields. ECa and ESD values showed complex spatial pattern at short distances. RF parameters with lowest error (OOBerror) were calibrated. RF model simplified which uses main predictors had a similar predictive development to it uses all predictors. Furthermore, RF model simplified had the ability to delineate similar pattern to those obtained from in situ measure of ESD in all fields. In general, RF was an effective method and easy to work. However, further studies are needed which add other types of variables importance calculation, greater number of fields and test other predictors in order to improve these results...|$|E
40|$|A {{long term}} {{experiment}} {{was established in}} olive orchards of Andalusia, southern Spain, to compare the fertilization practice based on foliar diagnosis versus the current fertilization practice in the area. Only nutrients whose concentration in leaves taken in July were below the critical levels were applied in the former treatment, whereas in the latter 500 kg ha- 1 of a 15 - 15 - 15 complex fertilizer, and three foliar sprays of micronutrients and aminoacids were applied annually. Four olive orchards were selected. One orchard has a small effective depth (33 cm) limited by a <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon.</b> The second has an effective soil depth of 60 cm, and is representative of broad level uplands on hard calcareous rocks. The third orchard has a deep soil (~ 90 cm), typical of rolling areas with soft marls; and the fourth is a soil whose effective depth is also large (~ 90 cm), representative of flat areas on soft clayey sediments, partially decalcified. One homogeneous zone of 2 -ha was split into two plots within each orchard, and the treatments {{were randomly assigned to}} each plot. After five years, no sig-nificant differences were found in yield, fruit weight, oil content or vegetative growth, but polyphenols in the oil decreased in trees subjected to the traditional fertilization. Fertilization cost increased in more than 10 times in the traditional fertil-ization plots. Results indicate that the current fertilization practice apply more nutrients that needed for a good crop, neg-atively affect olive oil quality, and increase cost compared with foliar diagnosis. Additional key words: leaf-nutrient analysis; Olea europaea; rational fertilization practices...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Information {{is scarce}} on the genesis and {{classification}} of soils derived from calcareous {{rocks in the}} Northeastern region of Brazil. This study describes the morphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical, and micromorphological properties of four soil profiles (P 1 -P 4) located in the Apodi Plateau. A pedogenesis hypothesis and soil classification, according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS), are proposed for these profiles. The interactions between parent material, surface topography and climate affected the pedogenesis processes and soil properties, although the calcareous nature of the parent material most affected the soil morphology and chemical properties. The sand fraction contained mainly quartz and calcite, and a smaller amount of mica. Smectite and interstratified illite-smectite occurred in the clay fraction of profile P 1 and in some horizons of P 2 (Ccm&# 1116; and Ccr&# 1116;) and P 3 (2 Ccr&# 1116;). Kaolinite predominated in profiles P 2, P 3, and P 4; where as illite and vermiculite {{were present in the}} Bic&# 1116;, Bc&# 1116;, Bcm&# 1116; horizons of P 2, in Bt 2 c of P 3, and in C of P 4. The mineralogy showed illite, hematite, and goethite, and anatase in a number of horizons. Micromorphological analysis of P 2 indicated a strong cementation of Bcm&# 1116; and Ccm&# 1116; by calcium carbonate, and other properties indicate the formation of a <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon,</b> but this horizon lacked lateral continuity in the profile. Therefore, the parapetrocalcic term is proposed for classifying P 2 in the fourth level of the SiBCS. The 3 Bi&# 1116;-P 1 horizon exhibited calcite coating and iron coating or quasi-coating, indicating distinct pedogenesis processes occurring under different environmental conditions. Likewise, the occurrence of petroplinthite in P 2 indicates that climatic conditions during its formation differed from present conditions, and both situations are interpreted as evidence that the soils were formed by polygenetic processes. In the SiBCS classification, the soils are classified as Cambissolo Háplico Carbonático vertissólico (P 1), Cambissolo Háplico Carbonático concrecionário (P 2), Luvissolo Crômico Pálico petroplíntico (P 3), and Neossolo Litólico Carbonatico típico (P 4); and a new class (parapetrocálcico concrecionário) is proposed for P 2 in the fourth level...|$|E
40|$|Deposits of {{the ancestral}} Rio Grande (aRG) {{belonging}} to the Camp Rice Formation are preserved and exposed in the uplifted southern portion of the Robledo Mountains horst of the southern Rio Grande rift. The sediments are dated palaeomagnetically to the Gauss chron (upper Pliocene). The {{lower part of the}} succession lies in a newly discovered palaeocanyon cut into underlying Eocene rocks whose margins are progressively onlapped by the upper part. Detailed sedimentological studies reveal the presence of numerous river channel and floodplain lithofacies, indicative of varied deposition in channel bar complexes of low-sinuosity, pebbly sandbed channels that traversed generally dryland floodplains and shifted {{in and out of the}} study area five times over the 1 Myr or so recorded by the succession. Notable discoveries in the deposits are: (1) complexes of initial avulsion breakout channels at the base of major sandstone storeys; (2) common low-angle bedsets ascribed to deposition over low-angle dunes in active channels; (3) palaeocanyon floodplain environments with evidence of fluctuating near-surface water tables. Sandbody architecture is generally multistorey, with palaeocurrents indicative of funnelling of initial avulsive and main fluvial discharge from the neighbouring Mesilla basin through a narrow topographic gap into the palaeocanyon and out over the study area. An avulsion node was evidently located at the stationary southern tip to the East Robledo fault during Gauss times, with aRG channels to the north flowing close to the fault and preventing fan progradation. Subsequent Matuyama growth of the fault caused (1) deposition to cease as the whole succession was uplifted in its footwall, (2) development of a thick <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon,</b> and (3) fan progradation into the Mesilla basin. Parameters for the whole aRG fluvial system are estimated as: active single channels 2 m deep and 25 m wide; valley slope 0. 24 - 0. 065 °; maximum mean aggradation rate 0. 05 mm year- 1; major channel belt avulsion interval 200 ky; individual channel recurrence interval 100 ky; minimum bankfull mean flow velocity 1. 54 m s- 1, minimum single-channel discharge 77 m 3 s- 1, bed shear stress 22. 3 N m- 2; and stream power 34. 3 W m- 2...|$|E
40|$|In Spain, large {{quantities}} of wine are produced every year (3, 339, 700 tonnes in 2011) (FAO, 2011) with the consequent waste generation. During the winemaking process, solid residues like grape stalks are generated, as well as grape marc and wine lees as by-products. According to the Council Regulation (EC) 1493 / 1999 on the common organization of the wine market, by-products coming from the winery industry must be sent to alcohol-distilleries to generate exhausted grape marc and vinasses. With an adequate composting treatment, these wastes {{can be applied to}} soils as a source of nutrients and organic matter. A three-year field experiment (2011, 2012 and 2013) was carried out in Ciudad Real (central Spain) to study the effects of wine-distillery waste compost application in a melon crop (Cucumis melo L.). Melon crop has been traditionally cultivated in this area with high inputs of water and fertilizers, but no antecedents of application of winery wastes are known. In a randomized complete block design, four treatments were compared: three compost doses consisted of 6. 7 (D 1), 13. 3 (D 2) and 20 t compost ha- 1 (D 3), and a control treatment without compost addition (D 0). The soil was a shallow sandy-loam (Petrocalcic Palexeralfs) with a depth of 0. 60 m and a discontinuous <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon</b> between 0. 60 and 0. 70 m, slightly basic (pH 8. 4), poor in organic matter (0. 24 %), rich in potassium (410 ppm) and with a medium level of phosphorus (22. 1 ppm). During each growing period four harvests were carried out and total and marketable yield (fruits weighting < 1 kg or visually rotten were not considered), fruit average weight and fruit number per plant were determined. At the end of the crop cycle, four plants per treatment were sampled and the nutrient content (N, P and K) was determined. Soil samplings (0 - 30 cm depth) were carried before the application of compost {{and at the end of}} each growing season and available N and P, as well as exchangeable K content were analyzed. With this information, an integrated analysis was carried out with the aim to evaluate the suitability of this compost as organic amendment...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{monitoring}} {{was carried}} out in order to investigate the role of topsoil, rock matrix and fractures in controlling the water flow in unsaturated zone of calcareous rocks and in determining the timing and the magnitude of groundwater recharge. A comprehensive dataset of climate data, soil moisture and rock pressure heads was used to evaluate a physically based 1 D dual permeability model, in order to simulate the water flow in the vertical profile to the groundwater table. The parameters of water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves in soil and rock matrix were estimated using two evaporation experiments in the laboratory and the tension infiltrometer in the field. The other sensitive parameters of the model were calibrated using an optimization procedure based on combinations of randomly sampled parameters. Once the model had been calibrated, it was used to obtain insights into the hydrological processes through the unsaturated profile, down to the water table. The soil acts as a attenuation layer, determining the timing and the magnitude of drainage fluxes towards the unsaturated rock zone. The low permeability <b>petrocalcic</b> <b>horizon</b> below the soil, which frequently occurs in semi-arid regions, {{plays a key role in}} controlling the water exchanges between the soil and the rock. Most water flow in the top of the rock profile occurs through the fractures. This fracture flow becomes less along the profile, as a part of it gradually infiltrates into the unsaturated rock matrix. Fracture water infiltrates entirely into the matrix only when the unsaturated rock zone is very thick, so that in sites with a shallow water table fracture flow may be the dominant groundwater recharge mechanism. The flow through the matrix is continuous over time and at the water table it becomes constant and independent of large seasonal and annual variations in rainfall. The flow through the unsaturated matrix is the dominant groundwater recharge mechanism. In dry summers and in drought years the continuous matrix water flow sustains the recharge, thus maintaining high groundwater levels when more water is extracted. This is important in regions where groundwater from unconfined calcareous aquifers are important water resources. The recharge through the fractures is sensitive to the annual rainfall pattern and also contributes to the groundwater in years when the rainfall is greater...|$|E
