5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used by the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the caves during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells Natural History and Archaeology Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in {{multistory}} apartment buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), toilets that were flushed with running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, {{and some of the}} best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Creoles are a {{community}} with varied non-Anglo ancestry, mostly descendant of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana before its purchase by the U.S. The Cajuns are {{a group of}} Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana, being a major port, has acted as a melting pot for {{people from all over}} the Caribbean basin. The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun music and Creole music.|$|E
50|$|Table For Two Korea (TFT) is {{a project}} that aims {{to solve the problem}} about {{unbalanced}} food distribution between developed countries and developing countries with one meal. In the world, about one billion <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> developed countries have problem with hyper nutrition and about one billion other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> developing countries are suffering from starvation and malnutrition. TFT suggests one solution to solve these two problems with only one meal. If <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> advanced countries eat a TFT meal reduced calorie, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> less developed countries can have one meal in the school with a donation form the calorie.|$|R

5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim {{were brought in}} to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to help him}} fight the pagan Baltic Prussian <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> a {{territory}} adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As {{virtually all of the}} Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
