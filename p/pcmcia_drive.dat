5000|$|In most DOS systems, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to have more than 26 mounted drives. Atari GEMDOS supports drive letters A: to P: only. The PalmDOS PCMCIA driver stack supports drive letters 0:, 1:, 2:, ... to address <b>PCMCIA</b> <b>drive</b> slots.Some Novell network drivers for DOS support up to 32 drive letters under compatible DOS versions. In addition to this, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 genuinely support a CONFIG.SYS LASTDRIVE=32 directive in order to allocate up to 32 drive letters, named A: to Z:, \:, :, ^:, _: and `:. (DR-DOS 7.02-7.07 also supports HILASTDRIVE and LASTDRIVEHIGH directives in order to relocate drive structures into upper memory.) Some DOS application programs do not expect drive letters beyond Z: and will not work with them, therefore it is recommended to use them for special purposes or search drives.JP Software's 4DOS command line processor supports drive letters beyond Z: in general, but since some of the letters clash with syntactical extensions of this command line processor, they need to be escaped in order to use them as drive letters.Windows 9x (MS-DOS 7.0/MS-DOS 7.1) added support for LASTDRIVE=32 and LASTDRIVEHIGH=32 as well.If access to more filesystems than Z: is required under Windows NT, Volume Mount Points must be used. However, it is possible to mount non-letter drives, such as 1:, 2:, or !: using the command line SUBST utility in Windows XP or Vista (i.e. [...] ), but this is not officially supported and may break programs that assume that all drive letters are A: to Z:.|$|E

50|$|The PCMCIA {{specification}} {{can be seen}} as a superset of ATA. The {{standard for}} PCMCIA hard disk interfaces, which included <b>PCMCIA</b> flash <b>drives,</b> allows for the mutual configuration of the port and the drive in an ATA mode. As a de facto extension, most <b>PCMCIA</b> flash <b>drives</b> additionally allow for a simple ATA mode that is enabled by pulling a single pin low, so that PCMCIA hardware and firmware are unnecessary to use them as an ATA drive connected to an ATA port. <b>PCMCIA</b> flash <b>drive</b> to ATA adapters are thus simple and inexpensive, but are not guaranteed to work with any and every standard <b>PCMCIA</b> flash <b>drive.</b> Further, such adapters cannot be used as generic PCMCIA ports, as the PCMCIA interface is much more complex than ATA.|$|R

50|$|The Gigabeat {{was first}} called the MobilPhile and later renamed to Gigabeat. It {{contained}} a monochrome LCD with blue backlighting, and a 5 GB removable <b>PCMCIA</b> hard <b>drive.</b> Its case {{was made of}} aluminum, and battery life is specified at 18 hours. It required music to be converted using the Toshiba Audio Application to an encrypted format. It has a circular dpad surrounding a smaller circular play/pause button, 2 menu buttons, side-mounted volume up/down buttons and a lock switch.|$|R
50|$|The PocketZip {{drive was}} {{available}} originally as a laptop PC card (<b>PCMCIA)</b> slot <b>drive</b> {{where it could}} compete with contemporary PC card, MicroDrive, CompactFlash and SmartMedia readers. A dock was available to connect this drive to a desktop computer's parallel port. Later, a USB version of the drive was also offered. It was marketed as a backup and portable storage solution, similar to the original Zip drive, but which could be installed completely inside a laptop computer, as PC cards typically slide completely inside the laptop computer and thus do not increase its dimensions, which also precludes {{the need for a}} power supply or cables.|$|R
