40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that global processing precedes local processing of a visual scene even when the local and the global aspects are similar in nature (e. g., both alphabetic). The two types of processing were compared here in four different ways, for stimuli with many and with few local elements (i. e., differing sparsities). These methods consisted of assessing naming latency, intrastimulus Stroop-like interference, intermodality Stroop-like interference, and phenomenal judgment.

40|$|Recent {{studies by}} Berent and Perfetti (1995) and Lee, Rayner, and Pollatsek (2001) {{have shown a}} <b>processing</b> <b>priority</b> of consonants over vowels in tasks like {{backward}} masking and reading, respectively. One possible explanation for this advantage of consonants {{is in terms of}} the specific characteristics of the English spelling (i. e., a great inconsistency in the spelling-sound relations for vowels), and therefore is not predicted for a language, like Italian, with a transparent orthography. The aim of the present experiments was to investigate the consonant advantage in Italian with the backward masking paradigm. The first two experiments, with a perceptual identification and a naming task, showed a masking reduction effect for masks sharing vowels with the target at the shortest SOAs, in addition to a pseudo-homophone advantage as compared to the control condition. In the third experiment, where a lexical decision task was used, the advantage of the mask sharing vowels disappeared. The fourth experiment was a replication of Experiment 1 with different materials. Overall, the results suggest that the advantage of consonants can only be found in English, whereas in Italian, for which the computation of phonology of vowels and consonants is similar, no effect is apparent. Thus, the <b>processing</b> <b>priority</b> for consonants seems to depend on the inconsistencies of vowel phonology in English...|$|E
40|$|When {{people see}} a snake, {{they are likely}} to {{activate}} both affective information (e. g., dangerous) and non-affective information about its ontological category (e. g., animal). According to the Affective Primacy Hypothesis, the affective information has priority, and its activation can precede identification of the ontological category of a stimulus. Alternatively, according to the Cognitive Primacy Hypothesis, perceivers must know what they are looking at before they can make an affective judgment about it. We propose that neither hypothesis holds at all times. Here we show that the relative speed with which affective and non-affective information gets activated by pictures and words depends upon the contexts in which stimuli are processed. Results illustrate that the question of whether affective information has <b>processing</b> <b>priority</b> over ontological information (or vice versa) is ill posed. Rather than seeking to resolve the debate over Cognitive vs. Affective Primacy in favor of one hypothesis or the other, a more productive goal may be to determine the factors that cause affective information to have <b>processing</b> <b>priority</b> in some circumstances and ontological information in others.

40|$|The perceptual {{load and}} {{dilution}} models differ fundamentally {{in terms of}} the proposed mechanism underlying variation in distractibility during different perceptual conditions. However, both models predict that distracting information can be processed beyond perceptual processing under certain conditions, a prediction that is well-supported by the literature. Load theory proposes that in such cases, where perceptual task aspects do not allow for sufficient attentional selectivity, the maintenance of task-relevant processing depends on cognitive control mechanisms, including working memory. The key prediction is that working memory plays a role in keeping clear <b>processing</b> <b>priorities</b> in the face of potential distraction, and the evidence reviewed and evaluated in a meta-analysis here supports this claim, by showing that the processing of distracting information tends to be enhanced when load on a concurrent task of working memory is high. Low working memory capacity is similarly associated with greater distractor processing in selective attention, again suggesting that the unavailability of working memory during selective attention leads to an increase in distractibility. Together, these findings suggest that selective attention against distractors that are processed beyond perception depends on the availability of working memory. Possible mechanisms for the effects of working memory on selective attention are discussed...|$|R

For instance, an object that looms toward an observer {{has also been shown}} to capture attention. In two experiments, we investigated whether onset receives <b>processing</b> <b>priority</b> over looming.

40|$|When {{subjects}} have {{to report}} verbal material presented tachistoscopically simultaneously {{on both sides of}} a fixation point, right visual field superiority has been obtained in several experiments using a central task technique, i. e. where a stimulus presented at the fixation point had to be identified before reporting the rest of the material. Without a central task, left visual field superiority has generally been obtained. It has been suggested to attribute the difference to control of eye fixation by the central task. An alternative interpretation, that the central task modifies the order of attentional scanning was put to the test in Experiment I. With two normally printed words, right visual field superiority was obtained with a central task and left visual field superiority without it. It was predicted that with mirrored words, the opposite pattern would be obtained, yet here right visual field superiority was obtained both without and with a central task. Experiment II shows that the latter result is nevertheless dependent on scanning order, for it can be completely inverted through recall order instructions. It is concluded that lateral differences observed with bilateral presentation cannot be explained without taking account of optional <b>processing</b> <b>priorities,</b> but that the factors on which the latter depend are not yet fully understood. © 1975.

40|$|AbstractScheduling {{algorithms}} play {{an important}} role in the design of real-time systems. Processing jobs having little processing time and less priorities leads to user frustration because of considerable long waiting times. The target of this research is to implement fuzzy logic algorithm for scheduling non-periodic jobs on soft real-time single processor system. The algorithm assumes a heavy loaded machine with single processor shared by multi users. Jobs are assumed having different processing time, different waiting time, and different exterior priority. Jobs are also assumed non-periodic and having deadlines for their execution. The main idea is to use fuzzy logic algorithm to investigate the priority of a job to be executed first. Second fuzzy algorithm is used to adapt priorities of other jobs being waiting in case of new job arrives and considering deadlines for these jobs. This fuzzy logic load scheduling algorithm is used within multi-objective algorithm to minimize average delay, number of overdue jobs, and throughput times of jobs. Objectives are to reduce job total throughput time and to improve user satisfaction. Test cases with different job factors were generated to evaluate the algorithms and to demonstrate its strength. Jobs having little processing time are assigned new higher <b>processing</b> <b>priorities</b> and hence improving user satisfaction...|$|R

Participants in the experimental group viewed negative pictures (Trauma) as an analogue trauma induction. Participants in the control group viewed visually similar neutral pictures (Neutral Match). In a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task participants identified two target pictures. The first target (T 1) was a neutral picture, whereas the second target (T 2) was a familiar negative or neutral picture or a new neutral or negative picture. In line with hypotheses, only participants in the experimental group showed preferential processing of Trauma pictures.

Hands or visual anchors (boards) were placed next to potential target locations, and responses were made with the contralateral hand.

In the multiperiod problem, both the server capacity and the processing policy in each period are determined optimally. Here, it may be optimal for the retailer to sacrifice profit and increase QoS in initial periods in order to increase demand (and revenue) in later periods.
