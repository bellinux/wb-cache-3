Drag forces acting on filaments are shown to vary with the filament cross-section, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> across the nozzle, and the local air velocity. Since finer filaments have a smaller inertial resistance to fluid forces and have lower stiffness, yarns with finer filaments are shown to be more suitable for air-jet texturing.

40|$|From Hα {{narrow band}} observations, we {{identified}} three Hα emitting {{regions in the}} direction of Magellanic Stream IV (MS IV). They consist of three parallel filaments with 2 arcmin width and 6 – 30 arcmin length at 12 arcmin intervals. The mean surface brightness of them is ∼ 2 × 10 − 18 erg s− 1 cm− 2 arcsec− 2. Because of their low surface brightness, the regions were not detected in previous Hα surveys. In H I map, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> overlap MS, suggesting that they are parts of MS, but there also exists a local H I structure. If the filaments associate with MS, the sizes are 30 pc × 100 – 500 pc. The filaments lie at the leading edge of a downstream cloud, which supports a shock heating and its propagation (shock cascade) model for the ionizing source. If they are local objects, on the other hand, Fossil Strömgren Trails of more than two stars is a possible interpretation, and the sizes would be 0. 1 pc × 0. 3 – 1. 5 pc at 180 pc distance.

40|$|The {{reactions}} {{listed in}} Table 1 were simulated {{according to the}} Gillespie algorithm with rejection (see above) in a flat parallelepiped domain (10 3 10 3 0. 1 mm). The extension in the third dimension (0. 1 mm) is {{of the order of}} the evanescent-wave penetration depth. The proteins (actin monomers, profilin, and ADF/cofilin) diffused in space; we also considered translational and rotational random movements for actin-filament fragments and determined diffusion coefficients by applying the theory of polymer diffusion [S 1]. We also neglected any filament shape change (thermal fluctuations or drag by viscous forces) that might affect the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> in space. This assumption, which is valid during the early phase when filament lengths are less than the persistence length (w 15 mm), does not weaken the model or our conclusions and numerical simu-lation over long periods is facilitated. Because the concentration of actin monomers is high and all actin-filament barbed ends are rooted on the circular line, where formins are located, the filament growth does not depend on filament shape changes away from the bead. Rather, numerical simulations showed that the elongation rate depends on the supply of fresh actin monomers to the reaction site and on the density of formins on the circular line (data not shown). Gillespie Algorithm with Rejection We developed amulti-agent program for reaction-diffusion systems {{on the basis of a}} modified version of the Gillespie algorithm to sim-ulate the kinetics of polymerization and chemical transformation of actin filaments [S 2].

40|$|The ctenophore swimming-plate {{has been}} {{examined}} with the electron microscope. It {{has been recognized}} as an association of long cilia in tight hexagonal packing. One of the directions of the hexagonal packing {{is parallel to the}} long edge of the swimming-plate and is perpendicular to the direction of the ciliary beat. All the cilia in the swimming-plate are identically oriented. The effective beat in the movement of the swimming-plate is directed towards the aboral pole of the animal, and this is also the side of the unpaired peripheral filament in all the cilia. The direction of the ciliary beat is fixed in relation to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> of the cilia. The swimming-plate cilium differs from other types of cilia and flagella in having a filament arrangement that can be described as 9 + 3 as opposed to the conventional 9 + 2 pattern. The central filaments appear in a group of two "tubular" filaments and an associated compact filament. The compact filament might have a supporting function. It has been called "midfilament. " Two of the peripheral nine filaments (Fig. 1, Nos. 3 and 8) are joined to the ciliary membrane by means of slender lamellae, which divide the cilium into two unequal compartments. These lamellae have been called "compartmenting lamellae. " Some observations of the arrangement of the compartmenting lamelae indicate that they function by cementing the cilia together in lateral rows. The cilia of the rows meet at a short distance from each other, leaving a gap of 30 A only. The meeting points are close to the termini of the compartmenting ridges. An electron-dense substance is sometimes seen bridging the gap. Some irregularities are noted with regard to the arrangement of the compartmenting lamellae particularly at the peripheral rows of cilia.

40|$|We report radio {{observations}} of the supernova remnant W 49 B using the Very Large Array (VLA) of the NRAO at 90, 20, and 6 cm. This work continues {{the study of the}} properties of young, bright supernova remnants (SNRs) begun with 3 C 391 (Moffett & Reynolds 1994). Here we present high-resolution images of total intensity, polarization, and spectral index of W 49 B. In large-scale morphology it is basically a box-shaped remnant expanding into an apparently inhomogeneous medium, but we also find small-scale structures, arcs and filaments, which lie interior to the outer shell in projection. The actual spatial <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> is unknown, though we suspect that they are in the remnant interior rather than on the front or back face of the blast wave. In addition, their distribution in two dimensions suggests the projection of a helical structure. The shell edge, sharply rising in brightness for at least 3 / 4 of its circumference, still remains unresolved at our highest resolution (4 sec). This for our assumed distance of 8 kpc, the width of the region in which the emission appears is less than 0. 16 pc, indicating short mean free paths for shock-accelerated electrons and high levels of MHD turbulence presumably causing the scattering. We find no polarized flux at 90 or 20 cm, with 3 sigma upper limits in polarized intensity of 36 mJy at 90 cm (45 sec resolution) and 7. 2 mJy at 20 cm (5 sec resolution), or 22 micro-Jy/sq arcsec and 370 micro-jy/sq arcsec, respectively, for any emission extended on those scales. Polarized flux is present at 6 cm, but at a very low mean polarized fraction (total polarized flux divided by total flux) of 0. 44 % +/- 0. 06 %, which, as for 3 C 391, is much lower than typical for bright SNRs at this frequency. The morphology in polarized intensity is poorly correlated with that in total intensity. We see excursions in the polarized fraction up to at least 10 % in a few locations, but even where polarization is seen, typical levels are a few percent. Tangled or disordered magnetic fields in the emitting region of the radio shell may be responsible for depolarizing the radio synchrotron radiation, but some form of internal Faraday depolarization may also occur. We estimate the foreground Faraday rotation measure to be about - 450 rad/sq m, similar to that found for 3 C 391, which is also the Galactic plane and just about as distant. Spectral index images created from the total intensity images show that the spectral index across W 49 B is constant to within about Delta alpha approximately 0. 1 in bright regions. This result weakly supports a common origin of the radio-emitting electrons, as in the blast wave, rather than in inhomogeneous turbulent regions of differing properties due to the stochastic (second-order Fermi) acceleration process. Variations at the level of Delta alpha approximately 0. 1 are seen, but their significance is doubtful. New observations at 90 cm, using experimental three-dimensional imaging technology, may improve on this limit...|$|E

However, the fluorescence anisotropy is considerably reduced, suggesting a higher degree of freedom <b>of</b> DNA in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> ATP hydrolysis. Upon addition of a complementary strand, poly(dT), to a preformed <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> RecA:BPDE-poly(dA) in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> ATP, <b>the</b> fluorescence intensity slowly decreases and a change of emission profile consistent with Watson-Crick base pairing is observed.

A-bands generally move from their central position and continue moving toward one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Z-discs after tension has reached a plateau at its maximum level. <b>The</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thick and thin filaments remain constant during this movement. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> A-band movement during contraction depends on <b>the</b> final length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual sarcomere. After prolonged activation, all sarcomeres between 1. 9 and 2. 5 micron long exhibit A-bands that are adjacent to a Z-disc, with no intervening I- band. Sarcomeres 2. 6 or 2. 7 micron long exhibit a partial movement of A- bands. At longer sarcomere lengths, where the resting stiffness exceeds <b>the</b> slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active tension-length relation, the A-bands remain perfectly centered during contraction. Sarcomere symmetry and length uniformity are restored upon relaxation. These results indicate that <b>the</b> central <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thick <b>filaments</b> in <b>the</b> resting sarcomere becomes unstable upon activation. In addition, they provide evidence that <b>the</b> elastic titin <b>filaments,</b> which join thick filaments to Z- discs, produce almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resting tension in skinned rabbit psoas fibers and act to resist <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> thick <b>filaments</b> away from <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sarcomere during contraction...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation discusses <b>the</b> capillary-driven breakup <b>of</b> various low viscous non-Newtonian liquid filaments. A liquid filament is destabilised by surface tension {{that drives the}} free surface to minimise its surface energy by forming spherical droplets. These surface tension-driven flows are encountered in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> liquid jets, dripping faucets and stretched filaments between two solid surfaces. The thinning dynamics during this free-surface flow are determined bynbsp;dominant resisting stress, which depends on <b>the</b> relative magnitude <b>of</b> fluid properties such as density, viscosity and elasticity. Since a homogeneous uniaxial extensional flow field isnbsp;during the pinching process, free-surface flows are used as a characterisation method for the extensional rheological properties of low viscous liquids. We have enhanced <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commercial Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) that creates an unstable liquid bridge by rapidly stretching a droplet of fluid between two plates and monitors <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> radius. <b>The</b> spatial and temporal resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> setup is improved by using a high-speed camera equipped with a custom-made microscopic tube lens to follow <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> thinning. Moreover, <b>the</b> image processing routines are substantially improved by employing advanced edge detection techniques to locate <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> edges with sub-pixel accuracy. We {{are now able to}} quantify relaxation times in complex fluids of O(100 µs), which are the smallest relaxation times that have been reliably obtained. The CaBER setup is further used to study two model complex fluids that display an opposite stabilisation effect on a filament. First, we examine <b>the</b> breakup dynamics <b>of</b> long stable jets of weak viscoelastic fluids. Capillary instabilities arise in a stable zone after the nozzle at wave numbers that are in line with predictions from linear stability analysis. This zone is followed by a short inertia-capillary regime where the flexible polymer chains are efficiently unraveled, resulting in strong non-linear elastic stresses that stabilise <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> during <b>the</b> important elasto-capillary regime. In this regime, <b>the</b> minimal <b>filament</b> radius decreases exponentially in time with a time scale that is proportional to <b>the</b> relaxation time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid. By comparing the thinning dynamics during jetting and static CaBER experiments we observe a new time scale <b>of</b> twice <b>the</b> relaxation time, which implies that jets breakup faster than static liquid bridges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same elastic fluid. nbsp;new scaling is theoretically explained with a stress balance over <b>the</b> <b>filament,</b> where <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> surface below <b>the</b> nozzle generates a constant tensile force in the jet. Numerical simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet breakupnbsp;a non-linear dumbbell model (FENE) are in agreement with the experimental observation by selecting a proper value for <b>the</b> initial deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer molecules. <b>The</b> drop formation <b>of</b> non-colloidal suspensions in a Newtonian matrix is examined as a second model system, in which thenbsp;is locally destabilised during the pinching process. The breakup dynamics are explained by dividing the process into four stages. Initially, the suspension behaves as a homogeneous fluid and the suspensionnbsp;dominates thenbsp;resulting in a linear decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> radius in time. As <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> thins, local particle density fluctuations are amplified and <b>the</b> <b>filament</b> becomes heterogeneous with diluted zones that exhibit faster thinning rates due to the local decrease in viscosity. <b>The</b> onset <b>of</b> this concentration fluctuation regime is defined with a transition radius and a scaling for this radius is proposed based on <b>the</b> standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean inter-particle distance and <b>the</b> relative dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viscosity to small changes the volume fraction. Third regime starts when a particle-free section is formed between two particle clusters. <b>The</b> breakupnbsp;a small-scale <b>filament</b> stretchingnbsp;and <b>the</b> thinning rate reaches a maximum. Finally, a deceleration is detected before breakup, where <b>the</b> depleted <b>filament</b> becomes slender again and the thinning rate approaches that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure medium fluid. nrpages: 210 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{movement}} <b>of</b> tropomyosin from actin 2 ̆ 7 s outer to its inner domain plays a {{key role}} in sterically regulating muscle contraction. This movement, from a low Ca 2 + to a Ca 2 +-induced position has been directly demonstrated by electron microscopy and helical reconstruction. Solution studies, however, suggest that tropomyosin oscillates dynamically between these positions at all Ca 2 + levels, and that it is <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> this equilibrium that is controlled by Ca 2 +.

40|$|Liagora tsengii sp. nov. (Liagoraceae, Rhodophyta) is {{described}} from St Kitts and Guadeloupe, Lesser Antilles, West Indies. Mature thalli are to 7 – 10 cm in height, pinkish grey, moderately to heavily calcified, mucilaginous, and dichotomously branched (often with numerous short proliferous lateral branches in older portions). Carpogonial branches are 4 – 5 celled and borne on the mid- or distal region of a mid-cortical supporting cell. Following presumed fertilization the zygote divides transversely and gonimoblast initials arise laterally from the distal daughter cell. A moderately diffuse gonimoblast is produced, {{although it does}} not intermingle with vegetative <b>filaments.</b> <b>The</b> lower gonimoblast cells and distal cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carpogonial branch coalesce and form a fusion cell. Post-fertilization sterile <b>filaments</b> arise from <b>the</b> basal cell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carpogonial branch and occasionally from the supporting cell, and adjacent vegetative cells.

40|$|Measurement {{methods for}} steel and textile {{reinforced}} concrete elements {{have to provide}} precise values (in <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> microns) in a "rough" and strongly dispersive environment. Contactless, non-destructive (NDT), optical measurement methods allow <b>the</b> monitoring <b>of</b> test data and enable <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex composition and the structural behaviour. In <b>the</b> First part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present thesis load induced deformations and cracks are first analysed and detected, then illustrated and interpreted using photogrammetry and methods of image processing. Photogrammetric images consist of a target grid on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> a structural element. The evaluation leads to <b>the</b> three-dimensional movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. Then, the deformations are investigated and cracks {{as well as the}} crack openings are extracted by analysing discrete steps. This way, the threedimensional shrinking and deformations, <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> cracks and <b>the</b> crack openings due to tension or shear in tests, real structural elements and junctions are calculated. <b>The</b> main focus <b>of</b> this thesis is a complete analysis of series of tension tests on textile-reinforced elements including <b>the</b> inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rovings. Using image processing, cracks are detected by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line detection methods with mathematical morphology. Displacements on a concrete surface are correlatively investigated with a random speckle signal. Due to the line detection method, crack positions can be determined with pixel-size accuracy, which are then used for the correlative displacement detection on both crack sides for the sub-pixel-size accurate crack opening calculation. Deformations and cracks are investigated in tests by interpreting surface images <b>of</b> construction elements. <b>The</b> measurement technique can be extended using similar methods for <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> reinforcement in cross sections. The aim is to correlate <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reinforcement and the deformation and crack images. In <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> this thesis different cross sections of structural elements are investigated to analyse incorporated the fibres and their properties. Glass fibres (filaments) are used as textile reinforcement and visualized in bond with the concrete matrix. Using image processing methods, the number, <b>position</b> and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filaments</b> and <b>the</b> bond area to the surrounding concrete or pores are identified. For successive sections a three-dimensional illustration and analysis is feasible. At last the image processing methods are extended to <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> non-directional steel fibres in concrete to determine their numbers, positions and orientations for <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> construction elements. Furthermore, image processing methods are used to identify <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rovings in textile reinforced concrete elements. Measurements of an intended detection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reinforcement in construction elements show the considerable influence on the cracks and deformations in a loading test...|$|R
