The analysis shows that Singapore has comparative advantage in 5 commodities (ground-nuts, hazelnuts, plums, apricots and walnuts), Philippines has comparative advantage in 3 commodities (tomatoes nes prepared or <b>preserved,</b> <b>tomatoes</b> whole or in peaces and cherries), Thailand and Malaysia has comparative advantage in 2 commodities (citrus fruits, fruit and vegetable juice, and tomatoes and apple juice, respectively) while Indonesia has comparative advantage in 1 commodity (cashew nuts). Malaysia has comparative advantage only in tomatoes and apple juice but comparative disadvantage in other commodities such as cashew nuts, walnuts and fruit and vegetable juice. The RCA index for apple juice in Malaysia is increasing over the years 2000 to 2006 indicating improvement in comparative advantage. However, the comparative advantage of tomatoes is constant. ...|$|E

40|$|Previously {{optimised}} postharvest treatments {{were compared}} to conventional chlorinated water treatment {{in terms of their}} effects on the overall quality of tomato (‘Zinac’) during storage at 10 °C. The treatments in question were water heat treatment (WHT = 40 °C, 30 min), ultrasounds (US = 45 kHz, 80 %, 30 min), thermosonication (TS = 40 °C, 30 min, 45 kHz, 80 %) and ultraviolet irradiation (UV-C: 0. 97 kJ m− 2). The quality factors evaluated were colour, texture, sensorial analysis, mass loss, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, peroxidase and pectin methylesterase enzymatic activities, and microbial load reduction. The results demonstrate that all treatments tested <b>preserve</b> <b>tomato</b> quality to some extent during storage at 10 °C. WHT, TS and UV-C proved to be more efficient on minimising colour and texture changes with the additional advantage of microbial load reduction, leading to a shelf life extension when compared to control trials.

Since all fresh tomatoes can not be consumed at the time of harvest, preservation provides a larger market, allowing consumers to buy the <b>preserved</b> <b>tomato</b> through the year. A natural convection solar dryer consisting of a solar air heater and a drying chamber was manufactured in this research.

With increasing the temperature, the time required to arrive certain moisture content is decreased. Also results showed that drying time in the solar dryer is shorter than open sun drying. In other words, drying time was reduced 17 to 45 % by the solar drying in comparison to open – sun drying. The experimental shrinkage data showed a linear behavior with moisture content. Also, the experimental data didn't show a strong effect of temperature on the rehydration ability of the product. Thus, the effect of temperature and method of sun drying on the shrinkage phenomenon and the rehydration ability can be neglected.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to standardise the duration and temperatures of the conventional oven drying methods for best physical and sensory characteristics of dried tomato. The experiment consisted of two factor factorial design (3 * 2) with three levels of drying temperature (70 °C, 80 °C and 90 °C) and two levels of drying duration (7 and 8 hours) with three replications. An improved and high yielding variety (Cochoro) of tomato released in 2007 for processing and widely grown in Ziwai (Maki), Ethiopia was used. Prior to drying, individual tomato fruits were washed and sliced into uniform thickness (8 mm); then, the slices were placed on to the drying trays in a single layer to facilitate uniform drying in hot air oven set at predetermined temperatures per the respective treatments. Data were collected on different physical and sensory attributes and analysed using SAS software (version 9. 2). The results showed that titratable acidity, total soluble solids and water absorption capacity were significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased due to the interaction of degree of temperature and duration of oven drying. In contrast, pH and water activity decreased as the drying temperature and duration increased. Drying at 70 °C for 7 hours produced dried tomatoes with the highest sensorial acceptability and physical attributes while higher temperatures (80, 90 °C) and longer duration (9 hours) significantly detract the quality of dried tomato.

40|$|Increased {{interest}} toward traditional tomato varieties {{is fueled}} {{by the need to}} rescue desirable organoleptic traits and {{to improve the quality of}} fresh and processed tomatoes in the market. In addition, the phenotypic and genetic variation <b>preserved</b> in <b>tomato</b> landraces represents a means to understand the genetic basis of traits related to health and organoleptic aspects and improve them in modern varieties. To establish a framework for this approach, we studied the content of several metabolites in a panel of Italian tomato landraces categorized into three broad fruit type classes (flattened/ribbed, pear/oxheart, round/elongate). Three modern hybrids, corresponding to the three fruit shape typologies, were included as reference. Red ripe fruits were morphologically characterized and biochemically analyzed for their content in glycoalkaloids, phenols, amino acids, and Amadori products. The round/elongate types showed a higher content in glycoalkaloids, whereas flattened types had higher levels of phenolic compounds. Flattened tomatoes were also rich in total amino acids and in particular in glutamic acid. Multivariate analysis of amino acid content clearly separated the three classes of fruit types. Making allowance of the very low number of genotypes, phenotype-marker relationships were analyzed after retrieving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the landraces available in the literature. Sixty-six markers were significantly associated with the studied traits. The positions of several of these SNPs showed correspondence with already described genomic regions and QTLs supporting the reliability of the association. Overall the data indicated that significant changes in quality-related metabolites occur depending on the genetic background in traditional tomato germplasm, frequently according to specific fruit shape categories. Such a variability is suitable to harness association mapping for metabolic quality traits using this germplasm as an experimental population, paving the way for investigating their genetic/molecular basis, and facilitating breeding for quality-related compounds in tomato fruits. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{researched}} {{the best possible}} operating conditions of a test dryer and the mild drying technique for <b>preserving</b> fresh <b>tomato</b> flavour. Fresh flavour is the one with more green notes and less heat-induced notes. Three different type of test dryers, namely a convective dryer (Heat Pump Dehumidifier, HPD), a conduction and infra-red radiation dryer (Refractance Window Dryer, RWD), and a microwave radiation dryer (Microwave Vacuum Dryer, MWVD) were chosen {{as a representative of}} differing principles of heat transfer. Control dryers based on commercial tomato products were also chosen, the freeze dryer (FD), spray dryer (SPD) as a basis for comparison of the flavour quality. A thin layer model was developed to predict the drying behaviour of tomato pulp and energy modelling was used with the RWD. For the RWD, conduction and evaporation were proved to be the dominant mechanisms of heat gain and heat loss from the product, respectively. The radiation effect was found to be negligible, so disproving the concept of RWD. With the HPD, a preliminary lipoxygenase inactivation model was employed to understand the low temperature drying effect on the flavour producing enzyme. Volatile and non-volatile flavour measurements were carried out for all the test dried samples. FD and HPD- dried tomatoes of the same cultivar were not significantly different from each other. Generally, acid concentration increased while sugar concentration decreased with increased thermal processing. Microwave vacuum drying operated under high vacuum of 0. 1 mbar (also called as microwave freeze drying) produced the best flavour quality, followed by HPD. An integrated approach of instrumental and sensory analysis was adopted to investigate the drying impact on the stability of flavour compounds and their associated sensory attributes. The volatile and sensory profiles of HPD- and FD-dried tomatoes were comparable, whereas loss of compounds contributing to fresh green aroma and presence of heat-induced compounds contributing to a cooked aroma were detected in the SPD-dried tomatoes and paste. Volatiles were found to be a good marker than non-volatiles. They were highly significant for discriminating the sensory attributes of processed tomatoes, allowing a better insight into the development of mild drying techniques...|$|R
40|$|ENG] The food {{packaging}} industry is demanding new packages able {{to improve the}} quality of the packed products. In this regard some of the problems to be solved are the recyclable and compostable character of the materials, the antimicrobial properties of some substances to be involved in the packaging system and the optimum control of the internal atmosphere in the package. As a solution for these problems a new flow-pack active packaging design was proposed to be developed in this investigation, based on Polylactic acid (PLA) -coated cardboard trays, with some active substances embedded into this coating (plant essential oils and gases scavengers) and the suitable wrapping film. The antimicrobial effect of this new package was studied using plant essential oils embedded in the inner coating of the cardboard tray. Essential oils are aromatic and volatile liquids extracted from plants. The chemicals in essential oils are secondary metabolites, which play an important role in plant defense, as they often possess antimicrobial properties. The interest in essential oils and their application in food preservation have been amplified in recent years by an increasingly negative consumer perception of synthetic preservatives. Furthermore, food-borne diseases are a growing public health problem worldwide, calling for more effective preservation strategies. The antibacterial properties of essential oils and their constituents have been documented extensively. The main obstacle for using essential oil constituents as food preservatives is that they are most often not powerful enough as single components, and they cause negative sensorial effects when added in sufficient amounts to provide an antimicrobial effect. Exploiting synergies between different essential oils has been suggested as a solution to this problem. The effect of them in antimicrobial packaging systems has been little studied. Because of the latter the proposal for this research was the use of a combination of vanillin, and essential oils of clove, cinnamon and thyme as antimicrobials in the new model of package. Cardboard trays coated with a film of PLA were studied in order to obtain a new active packaging friendly with the environment. During this investigation the PLA showed active properties in relation with the control of the internal atmosphere of the package used to storage “Cherry” tomatoes. This polymer belongs to the family of aliphatic polyesters commonly made from α-hydroxy acids, which include polyglycolic acid or polymandelic acid, and are considered biodegradable and compostable. PLA is a thermoplastic, high-strength, high-modulus polymer that can be made from annually renewable resources to yield articles for use in either the industrial packaging field or the biocompatible/bioabsorbable medical device market. It is easily processed on standard plastics equipment to yield molded parts, film, or fibers. In addition, it can be used for food contact and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). PLA is degraded by simple hydrolysis of the ester bond and does not require the presence of enzymes to catalyze this hydrolysis. The rate of degradation is dependent on the size and shape of the article, the isomer ratio, and the temperature of hydrolysis. Ethylene has diverse and significant effects on plant physiology. These are usually negative for the quality and shelf life of most horticultural products since this gas accelerates maturation and senescence. Modifications of the atmosphere inside the package can decrease O 2 and increase CO 2 in its interior, which allows the respiration and the production of ethylene by the fruit in the packaging to be reduced. O 2 and CO 2 modified atmosphere packages have been positively used to <b>preserve</b> fresh-cut <b>tomatoes</b> from damages. Also absorbent substances held on various inert support materials are commonly used to remove ethylene in various postharvest situations. Potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) is usually used for this purpose, being added to different absorbent materials such as activated carbon, silica gel, aluminum oxide, and clay minerals like sepiolite, to complement the properties of the active packaging. For all the above the experimental design of this investigation consisted in the following research lines: - The study of antimicrobial activity of the plant essential oils, individually and combinations of them, “in vitro” and in a food model system. - Characterization of physical and water barrier properties, for the PLA-coated cardboard, with or without some gasses scavengers. - Assesment of the practical application of the latter results in a new active packaging design with ethylene adsorption and antimicrobial characteristics. This evaluation was performed using as model food “Cherry” tomatoes. The present work has yielded some interesting results for the packaging industry. The use of vanillin and the essential oils of clove, thyme and cinnamon showed effective antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes and E. coli O 157 :H 7 “in vitro” and in the tested food model system at the concentrations used as food flavouring agent. The application of these substances in the PLA coating films has shown antimicrobial activity against the target strains studied in this work. Mixtures of plant essential oils of clove, thyme and cinnamon leaves with vanillin also inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes showing a marked synergistic effect. It could be reasonable to use these mixtures to lower the individual sensorial impact on the packed food and to enlarge the spectrum of sensitive microorganisms to this antimicrobial activity. The physical properties (thickness, weight, smoothness) and water barrier properties of PLA-coated cardboard (Water vapor permeability (WVP), Water absorptivity (WA), wetting energy (WE), and contact angle (CA)) showed an improvement of impermeability. The use of clays additives (Clinoptinolite, Sepiolite, or Sepiolite- Permanganate) reported as gasses scavengers increased the water affinity of PLAcoated paperboard but not as much as the uncoated samples. The embedding of those clays additives in the PLA coating film helps to control the humidity in the internal atmosphere of the package. These results represent an advantage for the manufacture of cardboard trays with improved humidity behavior. The compostable and environmentally friendly nature of PLA amplifies these advantages. The best results were obtained for PLA 2 % alone or with Clinoptinolite 1. 5 % or with 1 % of Sepiolite Permanganate, these conditions were the most effective in increasing the water barrier properties of cardboard. These coatings are suitable for use in cardboard trays for the packaging, storage, and transport of foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables. The PLA coating on the inside of the cardboard trays has demonstrated a very significant effect on the adsorption of ethylene and water vapour, and can be used in active packaging systems intended to “Cherry” tomatoes to regulate both factors. When this new active packaging design is applied to the preservation of “Cherry” tomatoes it is shown that in early stages of storage, there is a little production of water vapour and a high production of ethylene, which is adsorbed in the PLA layer. In later stages, ethylene production in tomatoes falls and water vapour production increases, so that ethylene may be exchanged for water vapour in the PLA layer, allowing the progressive exit of small amounts of ethylene through the wall of the thin LDPE wrapping film. Passive modified atmosphere packaging in combination with active packaging using PLA-coated cardboard trays wrapped with thin LDPE film has significantly extended the shelf life of fresh tomatoes. This is a good solution for fresh tomato packaging compared with packaging systems using trays wrapped with macroperforated films because microbial safety is better, while ethylene concentration inside the package is controlled at the same time. In addition, with the studied active packaging system, there is a considerable saving of energy during the storage and distribution of fresh tomatoes, as the storage temperature is 20 ° C, much higher than the storage temperatures usually used with modified atmosphere packaging. As a result of this thesis work, a new active packaging system has been patented. This system is based on PLA-coated cardboard trays, wrapped and thermo-sealed with LDPE film (20 μm thickness), which allows to prolong the shelf life of fresh vegetables. Some claims of this patent consider the addition of clays additives and plant essential oils to the PLA coating film in order to enhance the preservation of the packed food, acting as gasses scavengers and antimicrobials respectively. [ESP]Se estudió el efecto antimicrobiano de este nuevo envase con aceites esenciales de plantas inmersos en el recubrimiento interior de PLA de la superficie de la bandeja de cartón. Los aceites esenciales son sustancias aromáticas y volátiles extraídas de las plantas, son metabolitos secundarios, que desempeñan un papel importante en la defensa de la planta, debido en gran parte a sus propiedades antimicrobianas. El interés por los aceites esenciales y su aplicación en la conservación de alimentos se ha incrementado en los últimos años debido a la percepción cada vez más negativa de los consumidores por los conservantes sintéticos. Por otra parte, las enfermedades transmitidas por alimentos son un problema creciente en la salud pública, lo que exige estrategias de conservación más eficaces. Las propiedades antibacterianas de los aceites esenciales y sus componentes se han documentado ampliamente. Los principales obstáculos para el uso aceites esenciales como conservantes de alimentos es que no son suficientemente potentes de manera individual y el efecto sensorial suele ser negativo cuando se añaden en cantidades suficientes para proporcionar un efecto antimicrobiano.
