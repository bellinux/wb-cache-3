5|$|The {{theory of}} low {{temperature}} superconductivity {{has been well}} understood since the BCS theory of 1957. It {{is based on a}} peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> for superconductivity to occur.|$|E

25|$|Klystrons are {{specialized}} linear-beam vacuum-devices, {{designed to}} provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. Klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they {{have the advantage of}} coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> in amplitude, frequency and phase.|$|E
25|$|In polymer demixing, polymer blends {{experience}} spontaneous phase separation; {{it often}} occurs during {{conditions such as}} spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively. There is not much control in the horizontal direction, though the vertical direction of the features can be <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled.</b> Because the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height nanotopographies.|$|E
25|$|Miter gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These miter slots (or miter grooves) are used to position and guide either a miter gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The miter gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The miter gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> angle (a so-called miter cut).|$|E

25|$|The Mediterranean region {{contains}} the earliest archeological evidence of human use; the oldest known seeds {{date back to}} more than 5000 BCE in the Neolithic age with purposes such as food, anaesthetics, and ritual. Evidence from ancient Greece indicate that opium was consumed in several ways, including inhalation of vapors, suppositories, medical poultices, and as a combination with hemlock for suicide. The Sumerian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Indian, Minoan, Greek, Roman, Persian and Arab Empires all made widespread use of opium, which was the most potent form of pain relief then available, allowing ancient surgeons to perform prolonged surgical procedures. Opium is mentioned in the most important medical texts of the ancient world, including the Ebers Papyrus and the writings of Dioscorides, Galen, and Avicenna. Widespread medical use of unprocessed opium continued through the American Civil War before giving way to morphine and its successors, which could be injected at a <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> dosage.|$|E

500|$|Three Model C {{instruments}} were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The [...] Model B's rotary cell compartment {{was replaced with}} a linear [...] sample [...] chamber. The tangent bar mechanism {{was replaced by a}} scroll drive mechanism, which could be more <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength. With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly skilled operator. This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments. [...] Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to Caltech and the other two to [...] companies in the food industry.|$|E

500|$|The {{conceptual}} {{foundation for}} DNA nanotechnology was first {{laid out by}} Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s, and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid-2000s. This use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules, which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong, rigid double helix structures. This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> [...] nanoscale features. Several assembly methods are used to make these structures, including tile-based structures that assemble from smaller structures, folding structures using the DNA origami method, and dynamically reconfigurable structures using strand displacement methods. The field's name specifically references DNA, but the same principles have been used {{with other types of}} nucleic acids as well, leading to the occasional use of the alternative name nucleic acid nanotechnology.|$|E
500|$|On 28October 1983, it was {{announced}} that the Hastings line was to be electrified. Reasons that decided the issue included a commitment by British Rail to eliminate asbestos from all stock in service by 1988 and the increasing cost of maintaining the then ageing Hastings Diesels. The scheme was to cost £23,925,000. Electrification was finally completed in 1986, the line was electrified using 750V DC third rail using standard rolling stock, and the expedient of singling the track through the narrow tunnels. The tunnels either side of Tunbridge Wells Central station were not singled because the fact that the south portal of Wells Tunnel and north portal of Grove Hill Tunnel were at the ends of the platforms meant it was impossible to install pointwork without reducing the length of platform available. A speed restriction [...] was imposed through Wells Tunnel. Parliamentary powers were sought in 1979 to bore a second Grove Hill Tunnel, but there was much opposition from local residents. This, and the high cost, caused the proposal to be abandoned. The track in Grove Hill Tunnel was relaid on a concrete base, allowing alignment to be <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For ABI the {{stability}} {{requirements of the}} crystals is less strict than for crystal interferometry but the setup still requires a perfect analyzer crystal {{that needs to be}} very <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> in angle {{and the size of the}} analyzer crystal and the constraint that the beam needs to be parallel also limits the field of view. [...] Additionally as in crystal interferometry a general limitation for the spatial resolution of this method is given by the blurring in the analyzer crystal due to dynamic diffraction effects, but can be improved by using grazing incidence diffraction for the crystal.|$|E

2500|$|Three main factors {{contributed to}} Kocher's {{success as a}} surgeon, {{according}} to Bonjour (1981). The first factor was his consequent implementation of antiseptic wound treatment which prevented infection and later death of the patients. The second factor, according to Erich Hintzsche, was his monitoring of the anesthesia where he used special masks and later used local anesthesia for goitre surgery which decreased or removed the dangers of anesthesia. As a third factor, Hintzsche mentions the minimal blood loss which Kocher achieved. Even the smallest source of blood during surgery was <b>precisely</b> <b>controlled</b> and inhibited by Kocher, initially because he thought that decomposing blood would constitute an infection risk for the patient.|$|E

Likewise better controlled studies have found lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates". The study found that [...] "after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, drivers who tested positive for marijuana [...] were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving". The study however cautions that [...] "these results do not indicate that drug use by drivers is risk-free." ...|$|E
