In their 1979 review of the author, Kartini et al. {{were able to find}} only six extant titles. It is difficult to determine the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the <b>printing</b> <b>number</b> was not recorded. As such, sources list works as having been published in different years; for instance, Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923, 1926, and 1928.|$|E
25|$|Houghton Mifflin {{enlarged}} {{the book}} to 14.0 x 21.0cm commencing with the 15th printing, probably in 1964. At that point they abandoned importing sheets from George Allen and Unwin LTD. Parallel to the single British 15th printing, Houghton Mifflin reprinted The Hobbit nine times from their own plates until {{the advent of the}} third edition. They dropped the red color from the maps and removed the color frontispiece so that no color remained in the book's interior. The 15th and remaining printings of the second edition are bound in light green with lettering in dark blue. Beginning with the 18th impression the volumes state the <b>printing</b> <b>number</b> on the reverse of the title page, but the 15th, 16th, and 17th printings do not seem to have any unique marks to distinguish one from the other. The 23rd impression is the final impression of the second edition.|$|E

The years of {{publication}} are generally unclear, as reprints included neither the year of first publication nor the <b>printing</b> <b>number.</b> Stylistically, Joehana has been classified as a realist owing to his use of the names of actual locations and products in his works, as well as the predominantly vernacular Sundanese in his novels. However, influences from traditional theatrical forms such as [...] and literature such as [...] are evident. Joehana's works cover a wide range of themes, although in general they are oriented towards social criticism and promote modernization.|$|E

50|$|Modern bound {{books are}} {{organized}} {{according to a}} particular format called the book's layout. Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what {{the parts of the}} layout are and what their content usually includes. A basic layout will include a front cover, a back cover, and the book's content which is called its body copy or content pages. The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s). The inside front cover page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books. The next section, if present, is the book's front matter, which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or <b>printing</b> <b>number</b> and place of publication. Between the body copy and the back cover goes the end matter which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works {{at the end of each}} authored chapter). The inside back cover page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank. The back cover itself is the usual place for the book's ISBN, and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them. Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.|$|E

25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic <b>printing,</b> intaglio <b>printing,</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>printing,</b> and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|R
