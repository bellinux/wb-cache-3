40|$|This work aims to {{characterize}} <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> as a fuel {{for a better}} understanding of the burning dynamics of forest floor fuels in wildland fires. Three Mediterranean species of pine have been studied: Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster and Pinus laricio. These species have been chosen because they present close but slightly different physical and chemical properties. The study focuses on the influence of the bulk and particle properties on the burning dynamics of <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> <b>litters.</b> The permeability of the porous fuel beds as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of each fuel have been determined experimentally. The combustion experiments were performed using the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. The heat release rate estimation was done by using oxygen consumption calorimetry with a correction of the energy constant since the composition of the fuels was known. Two kinds of sample holders were used, one with holes to allow different air flow rates to pass through the fuel sample and one blocked to stop the flow at the bottom and the sides of the fuel sample. The different air flow rates were natural convection and different rates of forced flows. A mean value of the energy released during the flaming stage per unit mass loss can be determined for all species under the different flow conditions. This energy is related to the fire-line intensity, which is an important quantity for foresters, and firefighters that allows them to evaluate the fire impact and the means which are necessary to fight a fire. Permeability appears to be an important parameter when analyzing the combustion dynamics of highly porous forest fuel beds. The energy released during flaming depends greatly on permeability but for the same permeability, the fuel species have an influence on the burning dynamics...|$|R

Initial nutrient composition differed between the species, with lodgepole <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> having significantly higher concentrations of P, Mg and Mn. However, no difference was found for concentrations of N, Ca or K. Increases in concentrations of N, P and K during decomposition were significant in both litter types. For Ca the pattern of concentration changes followed a quadratic function as decomposition proceeded. Concentrations of Mg and Mn decreased in lodgepole <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter.</b> In Scots pine litter {{there was also an}} initial decrease, but it was followed by an increase in most incubations. For both Mg and Mn, changes in concentrations during decomposition differed significantly between species.

Nutrient concentrations generated by the models were compared with those of the humus (F and H) layer in the stands. The model was quite accurate in predicting concentrations of N and P for both species and the concentration of Mg for {{lodgepole pine}}. By contrast, it was not accurate in predicting concentrations of Ca and Mn. Nutrient release was estimated for the two species using both measured litterfall data and long-term estimates, and regression models were used to predict concentration changes.

30|$|Preferences for burning seasons {{could be}} {{attributed}} to ecological constraints on ignition success. For example, ignitions in hardwood forests in the early spring benefit from a leafless canopy, which allows the warm, spring sun to quickly dry last year’s leaf fall and cured grasses. Success in other times of the year, such as the summer season, appears to be associated with drought conditions, which are by definition anomalous. This may be especially true for RL 1, a hardwood dominated region, which displayed relatively strong relationships between fire frequency and PDSI values for the months of May through August, the period in which the fewest fires were set. RL 3, however, showed even stronger skew toward the spring fire season, but had the weakest relationship with drought overall. The dominance of evergreen forests with flammable <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> (duff) may moderate the importance of abnormally dry conditions for setting fires in the summer season.|$|E

The study was carried out at the experimental site of Mata de Cuellar (Segovia-Central Spain), where an integrated analysis of Maritime Pine regeneration has been underway since 2004. Seed predation was monitored every month from 2010 to 2013. A generalized linear model was fitted using ‘next spring seed density’ as the response variable and seed rain, micro-site conditions and annual climate variability as explanatory variables. Seed rain, distance to the nearest stump, basal area and Walter’s drought index, along with percentage cover of herbaceous species, <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> and shrub species had significant positive effects.

However, it may adversely affect surface fuel load, moisture content and within-stand wind, which infl uence sur-face fi re behaviour and crowning potential. Comparison of a mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) stand in southeastern British Columbia to an adjacent stand {{with half the}} basal area removed by thinning to 4 m inter-tree spacing found a decrease in canopy interception of rainfall and increases in solar radiation, windspeed, and near-surface air temperature during peak fi re danger hours over 13 fi re seasons. Moisture content of needle litter and fuel moisture sticks was measured in both stands in 2005.

We investigated the dynamic and nutrient characteristics of litter in a 30 -year-old mixed stand of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) and deciduous orient oak (Quercus variabilis Bl.) and two comparable pure stands. Oak litterfall peaked in November and pine litterfall in December. The oak stand had the largest annual litterfall (347 g m– 2) and the forest fl oor mass (950 g m– 2), the mixed stand the second (236 g m– 2 and 634 g m– 2), and the pine stand the least (217 g m– 2 and 615 g m– 2). The nutrient return through litterfall and the storage in forest fl oor followed corresponding order between three stands.

40|$|The {{reflectance}} {{signatures of}} plantation pine canopy and understorey components were measured using a spectro-radiometer. The {{aim was to}} establish whether differences observed in the reflectance signature of stressed and unstressed pine needles were consistent with observed differences in the reflectance of multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of healthy and stressed forest. Because overall scene reflectance includes the contribution of each scene component, needle reflectance may not be representative of canopy reflectance. In this investigation, a limited dataset of reflectance signatures from stressed and unstressed needles confirmed the negative relationship between pine needle health and reflectance which was observed in visible red wavelengths. However, the reflectance contribution from bushes, <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> and bare soil tended to reinforce this relationship suggesting that in this instance, overall scene reflectance is comprised of the proportional reflectance of each scene component. In near infrared wavelengths, differences between healthy and stressed needle reflectance suggested a strong positive relationship between reflectance and tree health. For Landsat TM images, previous research had only observed a weak positive relationship between stand health and near infrared reflectance in these pine canopies. This suggests that for multispectral Landsat TM images, reflectance of near infrared light from pine canopies may be affected by other factors which may include the scattering of light within canopies. These results are seen as promising {{for the use of}} hyperspectral images to detect stand health, provided that pixel reflectance is not influenced by other scene components...|$|E

However, the grasslands and their ecological services have become vulnerable to land use change and degradation. This study used a series of field data to investigate the effects of grassland conversions to forest on recharge rates in a century-old experimental forest in the Sand Hills. The {{results show that the}} impact of grassland conversion on recharge was dependent on the species and plantation density. Estimated recharge rates beneath the dense plantations represent reductions of 86 – 94 % relative to the native grassland. Results of 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectral analysis suggested that the surface soil organic carbon beneath pine plantations also contain up to 3 times the ratio of hydrophobic components than the native grasslands and may alter the soil hydraulic properties. This investigation further uncovered a previously overlooked feedback between the effect of soil organic carbon chemical shift generated by the ponderosa <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> decomposition; namely that the alteration may have a link to reduced groundwater recharge rates. Thus, a global optimizer algorithm was used to estimate the effective soil hydraulic parameters from monthly soil moisture contents and recharge rates were then estimated through HYDRUS 1 -D numerical modeling for grassland and pine forest soils. The impact of grassland conversion to pine was an overall reduction of groundwater recharge by nearly 100 %.

A total of 1884 Collembola specimens belonging to 66 species were collected. Three species, namely Protaphorura pannonica (Onychiuridae), Tomocerus mixtus (Tomoceridae) and Isotoma caerulea (Isotomidae) proved to be new to the Hungarian fauna. There are typical Collembola communities which are specific to different habitat types where species of a given composition can only or predominantly be found in that habitat, {{as well as some}} basic common species which occur in every habitat. The highest species richness (41) was found in steppe meadows, considerably lower (34) in downy oak forests, reaching the lowest value (25) in pine plantations. Although several forest species present in the oak woodland were completely missing from the pine forests, {{there was no significant difference}} between the Collembola diversities of the two forest habitats. The difference became more prominent in collembolan abundance which resulted in less than half of individuals/m 2 in pine plantations compared to the soils of downy oak forests, most likely due to the changed soil conditions, especially of humus characteristics, caused by the <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter.</b> Jaccard similarity measure indicated approximately equal similarity (0. 24 – 0. 28) for paired comparison, suggesting that a relatively constant 'basic Collembola community' determined by the soil type typical for the area is present; while dissimilarity in communities between sites are partly provided by spatial heterogeneity of open and forest habitats and by the difference of the vegetation type...|$|E

Our data base included 56 separate studies on decomposition of <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter,</b> spanning Scots pine, lodgepole pine, Aleppo pine, stone pine and white pine, mainly incubated {{at the site of}} collection. Studies had 5 to 19 samplings, on average 10, and the decomposition was followed to a mass loss ranging from 47 to 83 %, on average 67 %. The periods from 3. 0 to 5. 4 years, on average 3. 9 years, were of sufficient duration to allow estimates of limit values of decomposition. We used a linear mixed model with regression effects to relate limit values to potential explanatory variables, namely the sites' long-term mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and to substrate-chemistry factors. Regarding the latter, we explored two models; one that included initial concentrations of water solubles, lignin, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Mn and one that included only lignin, N, Ca, and Mn to focus on those nutrients known to influence lignin degradation. Using backward elimination significant explanatory variables were determined. For litter decomposed in its site of origin we found the limit value to depend mainly on the initial concentration of Mn, with higher Mn concentrations resulting in higher accumulated mass loss. Thus, litter with higher Mn reached a higher limit value and left a smaller stable fraction. This is likely {{due to the fact that}} Mn is an essential component of ligninolytic enzymes important for degrading litter in the later stages of decomposition. Manganese has received little attention in decomposition studies to date.

Foliar moisture content was measured in four mountain pine beetle crown condition classes: green-uninfested, green-infested (current year’s attack), yellow (last year’s attack), and red. Total terpene content was analyzed in whitebark <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> <b>litter</b> and volatile terpenes were collected and analyzed from green, green-infested, yellow, and red trees. Significant differences were found in litter depths under green, red, and graytrees. Duff depths were significantly less beneath green trees than red and gray trees. One hour and ten hour fuels were more influenced by diameter and crown size than beetle crown condition classes. Foliar fuel moisture content dramatically decreased from green-infested to the red beetle crown condition class. No differences were detected in shrub and forb biomass between green, red, and gray trees. Green-infested trees had significantly lower foliar fuel moisture than green trees and by late in the season showed fuel moisture levels similar to red trees which had the lowest fuel moisture content. Litter beneath red trees contained large amounts of terpenes, including compounds known to increase foliage flammability that remain in the litter throughout the fire season. Total terpene content emitted from red foliage is greater than green-infested or yellow foliage...|$|E

Using batch experiments, <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> pretreated with alkali-isopropanol (AI) failed to effectively remove phosphorus, while <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> modified with lanthanum hydroxide (LH) showed relatively high removal efficiency. LH <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> were effective at a wide pH ranges, with the highest removal efficiency reaching approximately 85 % at a pH of 3. The removal efficiency was kept above 65 % using 10 mg/L phosphorus solutions at desired pH values.
