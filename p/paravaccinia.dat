50|$|A {{person who}} has not {{previously}} been infected with <b>paravaccinia</b> virus should avoid contact with infected livestock to prevent contraction of disease. There is no commercially available vaccination for cattle or humans against <b>paravaccinia.</b> However, following infection, immunization has been noted in humans, making re-infection difficult. Unlike other pox viruses, {{there is no record}} of contracting <b>paravaccinia</b> virus from another human. Further, cattle only show a short immunization after initial infection, providing opportunity to continue to infect more livestock and new human hosts.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>paravaccinia</b> virus {{will often}} come from Polymerase chain {{reaction}} screening ordered by their physician. However, due to how common <b>paravaccinia</b> virus is in rural areas, individuals typically {{do not seek}} professional help in diagnosis. Instead individuals may refer to people with local knowledge of the cattle in their area such as ranchers, or veterinarians who have some familiarity with the infections in the region.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paravaccinia</b> virus {{originates}} from livestock {{infected with}} bovine papular stomatitis. When a human makes physical {{contact with the}} livestock's muzzle, udders, or an infected area, the area of contact will become infected. Livestock may not show symptoms of bovine papular stomatitis and still be infected and contagious. <b>Paravaccinia</b> can enter the body though all pathways including: skin contact by mechanical means, through the respiratory tract, or orally. Oral or respiratory contraction {{may be more likely}} to cause systemic symptoms such as lesions across the whole body ...|$|E
5000|$|Milker's nodules (or [...] "milkmaid blisters") are a {{cutaneous}} {{condition that}} is most commonly transmitted from the udders of infected cows. Milker's nodule is caused by <b>Paravaccinia</b> virus. Disease in humans is nearly identical to Orf.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paravaccinia</b> {{virus is}} a viral {{infection}} of the Parapoxvirus genus of viruses. Human can contract the virus from contact with livestock infected with Bovine papular stomatitis and is common with ranchers, milkers, and veterinarians. Infection will present with fever, fatigue, and lesion on the skin.|$|E
50|$|Lesions of <b>paravaccinia</b> virus will {{clear up}} {{with little to}} no scaring after 4 to 8 weeks. An {{antibiotic}} may be prescribed by a physician to help prevent bacterial infection of the lesion area. In rare cases, surgical removal of the lesions {{can be done to}} help increase rate of healing, and help minimize risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Upon healing, no long term side effects have been reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paravaccinia</b> virus {{presents}} itself with blisters, nodules, or lesions about 4 mm in diameter, typically {{in the area}} that has made contact with livestock that is infected with bovine papular stomatitis. Lesions may begin forming as late as three weeks after contact has been made with an infected animal. In rare cases, lesions may be seen systemic. General signs of infection are also common, such as fever and fatigue.|$|E
50|$|Very little {{research}} has been done on <b>Paravaccinia</b> virus in humans over the last 40 years. However the cattle variant has been studied due to an unusual case in Great Britain in 2009 as well as isolation in new hosts. The cattle discussed showed particularly severe lesions on their body found to be linked to the virus. Several case studies have been done including one by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paravaccinia</b> {{virus was}} first {{characterized}} in by Edward Jenner in 1799 {{with the presence}} of lesions on humans, later described as Milker's nodule. Jenner associated the lesions found on human who had contact with infected cattle. Since first being characterized in cows, bovine papular stomatitis has been isolated in sheep, goats, and red deer creating new potential sources for human infection. Bolvine papular stomatitis has been reported in the United States of America, Great Britain, Brazil, Switzerland, and Japan ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Paravaccinia</b> is {{a member}} of the Parapoxvirus family. It has a {{cylindrical}} body about 140 X 310 nm in size, with convex ends covered in a criss-cross pattern of rope like structures. The virus is resistant to cold, dehydration, and temperatures up to 56 °C. Upon injecting a cell with its genome, the virus begins transcription in the cytoplasm using viral RNA polymerase. As the virus progresses through the cell, the host begins to replicate the viral genome between 140 minutes and 48 hours.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Milker's nodule is an {{occupational}} viral skin disease of universal distribution, {{caused by the}} <b>Paravaccinia</b> virus and that occurs in individuals who deal with dairy cattle herds. We describe a case acquired {{due to lack of}} use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and perform a literature review...|$|E
40|$|Bovine <b>paravaccinia</b> virus {{produces}} cytoplasmic {{inclusion bodies}} on infection of bovine embryonic kidney cells; these were easily recognized when stained with acridine orange or May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. The inclusions could {{be shown to}} contain newly synthesized deoxyribonucleic acid by autoradiography. Counts of inclusion-containing cells decreased when virus suspensions were treated with immune serum before being used to inoculate cell cultures. At 24 hr after infection, the number of cells containing inclusions was directly proportional to the concentration of infectious virus inoculated. These observations {{provide the basis for}} a virus assay which is simpler, faster, and more sensitive than the plaque assay...|$|E
