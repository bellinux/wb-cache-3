The project {{was funded by}} proceeds from Proposition 12 bonds approved by voters in 2007, a package which was voted on by commissioners. Clay Smith, TxDOT's San Antonio District <b>planning</b> <b>engineer,</b> said the Wurzbach Parkway project would get $126 million under the bond-financing plan, enough for TxDOT to finish the three final segments left on the parkway. The expansion construction was completed in two phases: the first from Blanco Road to West Avenue and from Jones Maltsberger Road to Wetmore; the second between West Avenue and Jones Maltsberger.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrical}} {{company is}} responsible for the maintenance of a transmission network of high voltage electricity. The maintenance schedule must be planned so as to minimize outage costs, taking into consideration various factors such as system security/reliability, system availability, and manpower utilization. With the rapid growth of organization, <b>planning</b> <b>engineers</b> are required to fulfill additional roles in order to increase productivity. To this end, a fast response and accurate mechanism is required to assist the <b>planning</b> <b>engineers</b> in dealing with the daily operation. This paper describes how a proposed maintenance schedule can be obtained automatically by the adoption of genetic algorithm. The main aim is to determine the maintenance schedule of circuit outage with minimizing the maintenance cost and maximizing the circuit availability under certain unavoidable system constraints. Further, an additional search mechanism called "final tuning search" is developed to enhance the system performance. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Grazier {{was hired}} at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{while still in}} {{graduate}} school to write mission planning and analysis software, used primarily by the Cassini/Huygens Mission. Upon completion of his Ph.D., he was hired full-time onto Cassini as a Science System Engineer (later Science <b>Planning</b> <b>Engineer)</b> and, a short time later, as Investigation Scientist for the Imaging Science Subsystem—the visible light camera aboard the spacecraft. As a Science <b>Planning</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Grazier co-wrote an award-winning program called EVENTS which determined event times when spacecraft can make {{many different types of}} observations. Later, Grazier created the Cassini Tour Atlas, a large database with geometrical values and event times, used for mission and observation planning, flight rule constraint checking, and data analysis. Grazier led a small team that designed software to automatically regenerate the Tour Atlas for hypothetical spacecraft trajectories, or when the actual trajectory was subject to change. This software saved Cassini an estimated quarter of a million dollars, and earned a NASA Space Act Award, a NASA Board Act Award, and a NASA Tech Brief Award.|$|E

30|$|This paper proposes an MADS-based {{blackbox}} optimization {{approach for}} the optimal control parameters of SVCs, which efficiently interfaces a power system DAE solver with the MADS algorithm. The proposed approach can assist power system <b>planning</b> <b>engineers</b> {{to optimize the}} control parameters of several installed SVCs, which not only mitigates FIDVR issues but also improves angular stability. This is an important and time-consuming task at many electric utilities, especially those concerning angular stability along with potential FIDVR issues. The proposed approach has been successfully validated on a detailed NPCC system model with realistic load models.|$|R
