Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E

25|$|Advances {{in public}} health caused an {{explosion}} of population growth, {{making it difficult to}} provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, disparity of wealth increased.

It aims to “improve the health, happiness, and harmony of dogs and people — while helping both species learn from and support each other”.

25|$|As the Cold War escalated, AFSC was {{involved}} in relief and service efforts, often supporting civilians {{on both sides of}} conflicts around the world including the Korean War, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Algerian War, and the Nigerian-Biafran War. Beginning in 1966, AFSC developed <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> children and provided medical supplies and artificial limbs to civilians in both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. Unable to secure U.S. State Department approval to send medical supplies to North Vietnam, the committee dispatched goods through Canada.

25|$|ECLAC {{states that}} in order to create better {{economic}} relations globally, international lending agencies must work with developing countries to change how and where credit is concentrated as well as work towards accelerating financial development in developing countries. ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested that <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.|$|E

25|$|Both Canada and the United States {{have limited}} {{programs}} to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., {{the introduction of}} Medicare Part D has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to Medicare beneficiaries. In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the poor and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists. About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers. In both countries, {{there is a significant}} population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada's and 40% of America's sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor {{are more likely to}} be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E
