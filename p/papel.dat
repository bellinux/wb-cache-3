5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new {{currency}} crisis, and the peso <b>papel</b> was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso <b>papel</b> lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso <b>papel</b> began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso <b>papel</b> was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E

25|$|Crafts {{based on}} paper {{products}} {{can be found}} in Acolman, Metepec, Toluca, Huixquilcan, Nezahualcoyotl and Otumba. The making of paper in this region dates back well into the pre Hispanic period, when it was mostly used in the making of codices. Today the most common product is <b>papel</b> picado (lit. pricked paper), where holes are cut into crepe paper to make designs and hung as decorations for special occasions.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} piñatas, {{decorative}} cut outs {{and other objects}} from paper and/or cardboard is known in Acolman, Metepec, Toluca, Huixquilucan, Nezahualcoyotl and Otumba. This tradition dates back to pre-Hispanic times with bark paper, but newer materials have been incorporated since then. For example, paper cut out banner or <b>papel</b> picado was originally done with crepe paper (called “papel chino” in Spanish) but today {{it can be seen}} done on thin plastic sheets.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} Oaxaca {{is one of}} the main and best-known {{producers}} of handcrafts (which includes certain kinds of processed foods) in Mexico. Its long tradition of production since the pre Hispanic period along with an abundance of raw materials has allowed this tradition to stand out both in quality and the variety. The most successful products are ceramics and textiles, followed by those made from wood and leather. Other production includes wood carving, metal work, embroidery, leatherwork, fireworks, <b>papel</b> picado, stone work, furniture and more.|$|E
25|$|Preparation {{generally}} {{begins in}} August with <b>papel</b> picado-making, altar-making, and printmaking workshops {{for children and}} adults. On November 1, participants, many of whom paint their faces as calaveras, proceed down Cesar Chavez to Evergreen Cemetery, where personal and family altars are set up and food is (pan de muerto) offered to the deceased family members there interred. Sometimes a mass is celebrated there. Then attendees return to Self Help, where altars, ofrendas, prints, and other works are exhibited. Often there are musical and theatrical performances. In 1978, Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino performed El Fin del Mundo {{as part of the}} program.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{rural population}} speaks {{a variety of}} native African languages unique to each ethnicity: Fula (16%), Balanta (14%), Mandinga (7%), Manjaco (5%), <b>Papel</b> (3%), Felupe (1%), Beafada (0.7%), Bijagó (0.3%) and Nalu (0.1%) which form the ethnic African languages spoken by the population. Most Portuguese and Mestiços speakers also {{have one of the}} African languages and Kriol as additional languages. Ethnic African languages are not discouraged, in any situation, despite their lower prestige. These languages are the link between individuals of the same ethnic background and daily used in villages, between neighbors or friends, traditional and religious ceremonies, and also used in contact between the urban and rural populations. However, none of these languages are dominant in Guinea-Bissau. French is taught as a foreign language in schools because Guinea-Bissau is surrounded by French-speaking nations. Guinea-Bissau is a full member of the Francophonie.|$|E
25|$|All {{organs and}} trade unions within the CNT may {{have their own}} media. Solidaridad Obrera ("Workers' Solidarity") is {{the journal of the}} Regional Confederation of Labour of Catalonia.

Other media are La tira de <b>papel,</b> the Graphic Arts, Media and Shows National Coordinator bulletin; the Cenit, newspaper of the Regional Committee of the Exterior; and BICEL, edited by the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation, which was created in 1987. The Foundation works autonomously, and its directorship is elected in a national plenary congress. Some of its duties are to maintain, catalogue and publicly display historic properties of the CNT, to publish books and other media, including BICEL, the Internal Bulletin of Centers of Anarchist Studies, to prepare cultural events during CNT or AIT congresses: lectures, debates, conferences, videoforums, book presentations, etc., and to coordinate with other similar projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{event is}} {{alternatively}} known as La Noche de los Alebrijes (Night of the Alebrijes), and the Desfile y Concurso de Alebrijes Monumentales del MAP (Monumental Alebrije Parade and Contest of MAP). The parade and contest is {{organized by the}} Museo de Arte Popular, {{in collaboration with the}} federal and city secretariats of culture, the authorities of the historic center of Mexico City, the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, the Associación de Amigos del MAP and the BBDO company. Its purpose is a homage to Mexican handcrafts and folk art, especially cartonería (a kind of very hard paper mache) in order to restore value to it in modern society. In the spring or early summer, the Museo de Art Popular puts out an open call for participants, inviting individual artists and artisans along with museums, galleries, hotels, restaurants, businesses and public and private institutions. Notable artisans who have participated include Arturo Caballero Arroyo, Ricardo Hernández, Esteban G. Vargas, Laila Yamille Sabag, Enriqueta Landgrave Zamora and Fabián Hernández. Alebrijes have been sponsored by organizations such as CONACULTA, el Taller Los Olvidados, El FARO de Oriente, Arte en <b>Papel,</b> the Centro Cultural Xavier Villarrutia, Librarte, Arte Mexicano para el Mundo and the Mexico City Secretariat of Culture.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{while the}} Nahua {{are still the}} {{principle}} buyers of Otomi amate paper, the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed {{some of their own}} products to sell. Today, amate paper {{is one of the most}} widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally. It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in <b>Papel</b> Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, Dance of the Voladors, Huapango music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as Francisco Toledo, Sergio Hernández, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio Sánchez, Nicolás de Jesús, David Correa, Héctor Montiel, José Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester González, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nicéforo Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso García Tellez. The Museo de Arte Popular and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and papyrus with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions. One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito García Téllez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the San Pedro Museo de Arte in Puebla.|$|E
25|$|The end of wet season farming {{ends with}} Xantolo. It {{is similar to}} Day of the Dead and celebrated at the same time, but it has {{important}} differences. Xantolo brings people to cemeteries as well but it is to celebrate {{the living and the}} dead, as it marks the harvest of this growing season. Preparations for Xantolo last a week with altars remaining through November. Gifts of food are prepared to exchange with god parents, friends, family and neighbors. Altars consist of arches over a rectangular table. Each corner of the table has a pole to represent the four stages of human life (childhood, adolescence, adult and old age). The poles are bent towards the center above the table to form arches, and covered with branches of local flora. It shares certain elements with Day of the Dead such as cempasúchil flowers, <b>papel</b> picado and the creation of altars to the dead adorned with local fruit, candles and copal incense. It lasts from 29 October with the slaughter of pigs and turkeys. October 30 and 31 are for the remembrance of children and adults respectively and November 1 is not only for saints but also to honor godparents. A traditional dance for the event has groups of dancers who ridicule the powerful of the local society then are chained by a devil. These dancers perform with cloth masks, with the aim that Death does not recognize them and take them away.|$|E

2500|$|The shared {{ownership}} by the Clarín Group, La Nación, and the Argentine Government in <b>Papel</b> Prensa (the largest producer of newsprint in Argentina), {{has also been}} marked by controversy. [...] The administration alleged that the sale of <b>Papel</b> Prensa by {{the family of the}} late David Graiver in 1976 was done so by illicit means and in collusion with the dictatorship. The government presented a report in 2010 claiming that during the Dirty War, while being coerced, the Graivers were forced to sell the newsprint maker at a bargain price. Another source of contention between the government and its private partners in <b>Papel</b> Prensa was a preferential pricing scale that allowed La Nación and the Clarín Group's numerous dailies to buy newsprint at a 25% discount while other dailies were charged prices based on expensive Chilean imports; the practice was made illegal in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Cartonería work {{received}} {{a boost from}} the work of 20th century artisans such as Pedro Linares and Carmen Caballero Sevilla, who created more artistic works, reinventing traditional forms and creating new ones. These caught the attention of artists such as Diego Rivera and academics, creating a new market related to collectors. The Linares family remains internationally known for its creations, and has trained other artists such as Ruben Guzman in Oakland, CA [...] Despite its historic importance, fewer of the younger generations are dedicating themselves to the crafts as many of the areas known for it, such as Mexico City and Celaya, continue to urbanize. To counter this, cultural centers and institutions such as CONACULTA give workshops and sponsor events such as contests to keep the craft viable. The parish of San Pedro Apostol in Tepotzotlan has an annual event dedicated to promoting cartonería among youth in preparation for Day of the Dead. Creaturas de <b>Papel,</b> headed by Nancy Chávez and Gabriel Granados, is a workshop for cartonería in Tepotzotlan.

2500|$|There are two widely {{practice}} paper crafts in Puebla. The {{making of}} bark paper or amate {{was known in}} pre-Hispanic times when such was reserved for special ceremonies and the recording of important information. It had an almost magical quality to it and was used for spells, clothing of idols and other ceremonial purposes. Today, the paper is still made {{as an art form}} and often painted with elaborate designs. In Puebla, the paper is still made by hand and often it is hand-painted with pre-Hispanic designs. One area noted for this craft is San Salvador Huixcolotla [...] Another is San Pablito Pahuatlán in the Sierra Norte. One notable amate paper artist is curandero Alfonso García Téllez, who narrates stories and ceremonies in his works. Another paper craft is <b>papel</b> picado, or “chopped paper.” This craft began with the introduction of crepe paper from Asia. This paper is elaborately cut to form figures and scenes which are then hung for decorative purposes for holidays such as Day of the Dead. This most traditional of these are laborious cut by hand, but most are done today by machine.

2500|$|While {{amate paper}} {{is one of}} a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with <b>papel</b> picado, papier-mâché [...] (such as Judas figures, alebrijes or {{decorative}} items such as strands of chili peppers called ristras). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes. The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional Mexican handcraft designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both Otomi artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers. [...] The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers. [...] Although the Nahua people of Guerrero remain the principle buyers of Otomi paper, other wholesale buyers [...] have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks, [...] furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and [...] more. [...] The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.|$|E
