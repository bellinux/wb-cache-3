40|$|South America's {{predominant}} democratic {{regimes and}} its increasing interdependence on regional trade have not precluded {{the emergence of}} militarized crises between Colombia and Venezuela or the revival of boundary claims between Chile and Peru. This way, how can we characterize a zone that, {{in spite of its}} flourishing democracy and dense economic ties, remain involved in territorial disputes for whose resolution the use of force has not yet been discarded? This article contends that existing classifications of <b>zones</b> of <b>peace</b> are not adequate to explain this unusual coexistence. Thus, its main purpose is to develop a new analytical category of regional peace for assessing this phenomenon: the hybrid peace. It aims to research the evolution of security systems in South America during the previous century and build a new, threefold classification of peace zones: negative <b>peace</b> <b>zones,</b> hybrid <b>peace</b> <b>zones,</b> and positive <b>peace</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

50|$|A second {{intermittent}} narrative {{beginning in}} the 1990s meanwhile follows the career of Alex, Ella’s son by Claude, as a journalist in the former Yugoslavia. A third narrative interlaced with the first two explores the life of Max, Ella’s eldest son by George. With Ella as the pivot and ultimate focus of these three interwoven narratives, moving between war and <b>peace</b> <b>zones</b> at different times in different places, the novel that begins as a family saga becomes increasingly a meditation on environmental collapse. Above all, Ella Morris is {{the portrait of a}} woman’s survival of the troubled times she lives in without surrendering the commitment to humanity she regards as her personal responsibility.|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{focussing}} on {{the operational}} gaps hindering {{the implementation of}} the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), this article argues that gaps are mostly product of the concepts of gender, violence, security that inform the Resolution. Two particular criticisms that have emerged in the analysis of 1325 will be addressed: i) the equation of violence as war, and particularly the equation of war gendered violence as violence suffered by women and girls only; and consequently ii) the idea of war and post-war at the domestic level as the main source of insecurity for women, the international community (of non-warring States) being the main guarantor of peace and security. By emphasising the articulations between war and <b>peace</b> <b>zones</b> both domestically and internationally, this paper will elaborate on one of the facets of violence production and reproduction omitted by the Resolution: armed violence in non war zones...|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{in general}} terms how the environment of 21 st century transnational organised crime, terrorism and unconventional conflict is being shaped by information-related capabilities (IRCs) that foster global networked connectivity and asymmetric responses to conventional military supremacy. This article explores how the conceptual apparatus regarding the distinction between wartime and peacetime, as well as war <b>zones</b> and <b>peace</b> <b>zones,</b> which has been developed {{within the framework of}} international criminal law and humanitarian law, can contribute to military-strategic operational and capability concepts. Integration of these conceptual frameworks within strategic analysis can serve to promote the effective use of force within a full spectrum operational environment in which information, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance thresholds are being raised and where deeper understandings of the social dynamic that sustains ongoing fighting within a global information environment become increasingly feasible. In this context, this article suggests that law enforcement frameworks and approaches have a high threshold of applicability if the strategic failures associated with conventional military operations are to be avoided...|$|R

50|$|It {{was built}} on the Government Spring, which {{originally}} supplied water to the military men of Fort Brooke. This spring was valued by many cultures to be sacred. Florida's Paleo Indians believed the water in the spring to be of a sacred nature. They brought their sick and wounded to bathe in the water with the belief that it would cure their injuries and diseases. Nearly every Indian tribe respected the spring's holiness and thus would use the land around the spring as a <b>peace</b> <b>zone,</b> where no one would attack. Influenced by these tales and others in Europe, Spanish Conquistadors fell under the belief that there were crystalline fountains of youth hidden in the springs. Juan Ponce de León helped spread these rumors when he and a Spanish Armada set out to find a mythical fountain of youth. Many still believe the spring to have supernatural powers.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} of Benny Giay {{is focused on}} the role of religion and the Christian faith in Papuan society. He did research on new religious movements, in particular on cargo cults in the Papuan context. This term can be considered derogatory, as it assumes that Papuans are primitive people who have an unrealistic and irrational way to acquire material goods; it also assumes that their religious feelings and expressions can be reduced to this attitude. Giay describes these new movements with sympathy and often from an insider's perspective. His doctoral thesis was a study of the Wege Bage Movement in his home regency (Paniai), a movement that had been initiated by Zakheus Pakage. Several of Giay's relatives had joined the movement. Giay sees the movement as a legitimate way to reconcile traditional culture and Christianity, though {{as a member of the}} evangelical KINGMI Papua Church, he is also critical of it. Giay calls on followers of the Wege Bage Movement not to close themselves off from a discussion on the Christian truth with other churches, and he also appeals to his own church not to condemn the movement, but to initiate a dialogue.In later publications Giay advocates a church that is active in the human rights movement, and which is a spokesperson for Papuans, who are victims of repression by the Indonesian security forces. He advocates a theology that is inspired by liberation theologians and by Frantz Fanon. He pleads for the recognition of the right of Papuans to their own cultural and ethnic identity. Papuans, in his view, are Melanesians, with a black skin and frizzy hair, and they can never become Indonesians with amber-coloured skin and straight hair. He wrote an article on the origins of the Papuan political movement called Papua Zone Damai and Papua Tanah Damai — the Papua <b>Peace</b> <b>Zone</b> and the Papua Land of Peace project. This a non-violent spiritual movement of Papuans fighting for their rights. It is supported by churches and by several NGOs. At the Second Papua Congress of May-June 2000, the Papua Council (Dewan Papua) gave Giay the task of initiating a debate on rectifying Papuan history (meluruskan sejarah). The purpose of the project is to give Papuans their own history back, to demand recognition for Papuan heroes and to honour the many Papuan victims of Indonesian repression since 1962. In the context of this project he has written several studies, like the biographies of Theys Eluay and of Rev Saud. He also wrote a local church history of the Nduga Regency of Papua (see also list of publications below).|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} five years the {{countries}} bordering the Indian Ocean have been pressing {{for the establishment of a}} Zone of Peace in the Indian Ocean which would block the escalation of great power military presence in the area. Australia and New Zealand voted for a UN General Assembly resolution in December 1972 which supported the general concept of such a <b>Peace</b> <b>Zone.</b> Over the same period modest escalation of both US and Soviet military activities has occurred in the area. The Soviet expansion has of course been continually emphasised and exaggerated in the West, while American expansion has gone largely unnoticed...|$|E
40|$|Starting in 1964 {{there has}} been a {{movement}} to declare the Indian Ocean a 2 ̆ 2 <b>Zone</b> of <b>Peace.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In an age when many in the world feel threatened by the potential of nuclear holocaust this is not striking in and of itself. What the <b>Zone</b> of <b>Peace</b> proposal provides is more valuable than the actual resolution. Empirically, it is obvious that nuclear free <b>zones</b> and <b>peace</b> <b>zones</b> have little validity. Historically, the weak have been vanquished by the powerful; their proclaimed neutrality notwithstanding. Consequently, a study of the peace movement in the Indian ocean may be utilized to investigate why proclamations which attempt to restrict military involvement in a given region are unworkable. A study of the peace movement in the region rapidly moves toward discussion of the military posture of the United States and the Soviet Union. Many littoral states argue that a removal of superpower forces would inevitably result in regional concord. This, as we shall see, is unlikely. this remote ocean is actually an area of high intrigue and endemic political maneuver. This paper will focus on the presence of the superpowers in the region, {{as well as that of}} China. Other western states with an interest will also be considered. The prospects for peace amongst the littoral states (should the superpowers abandon the Indian ocean), will also be examined. lastly, some analysis will be provided which will identify major problems with attempts to proclaim any area of the world as a <b>zone</b> of <b>peace...</b>|$|R
