The present study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, and cost of AWARE ™ Blood Serum Plasma (BSP) and Oral Mucosal Transudate (OMT) Rapid HIV- 1 / 2 <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> using real-time and archived samples of HIV-infected persons from Cameroon. Matched whole blood and OMT specimens were collected prospectively from HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons from different regions of Cameroon and tested using the AWARE ™ BSP and OMT <b>test</b> <b>kits,</b> respectively. These results were compared to the gold standard that included a combination of Determine HIV- 1 / 2 and Enzygnost HIV- 1 / 2. The BSP Rapid <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> was further evaluated using well characterized panels of HIV- 2 and HIV- 1 group O samples. Cost and end-user analysis of the OMT <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> was done by comparing its actual cost, consumables, safety, bench time and manipulation with other <b>test</b> <b>kits.</b> Of the 732 matched samples, 412 (56. 3 %) and 320 (43. 7 %) were from females and males, respectively. Of these samples, 23 (3. 1 %) gave discordant results between Determine HIV- 1 / 2 and Enzygnost HIV 1 / 2 and were excluded from the analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AWARE™ BSP were 100 %. The AWARE™ OMT had 98. 8 % sensitivity, 98. 9 % specificity, 98. 0 % PPV and 99. 4 % NPV. The results of a well-characterized archived panel of HIV- 2 (n= 7) and HIV- 1 group O (n= 3) samples using the AWARE™ BSP Rapid <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> gave 100 % concordance. Total per patient cost of the AWARE OMT rapid <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> was US$ 4. 72 compared to a mean cost of US $ 7. 33 ± 0. 11 for the other <b>test</b> <b>kits.</b> Both the AWARE™ BSP and OMT Rapid <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> demonstrated high sensitivities and specificities on all samples tested and were well adapted for use in resource-constrained settings with high HIV heterogeneity such as Cameroon.

40|$|Detecting and {{quantifying}} peanut residues in {{food products}} {{is necessary to}} ascertain product safety for allergic individuals and to comply with international labelling regulations. Several technical possibilities exist to analyse peanut contents in food products. Methods based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most commonly used.

The calibration materials are typically crude peanut protein extracts or purified specific peanut allergens in a buffer solution. In this inter-laboratory the study of five commercially available peanut ELISA <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> to detect and quantify peanut residues in two food matrices (biscuit and dark chocolate) at four different concentrations (0 - 10 mg peanut¿kg- 1 matrix corresponding to about 0 - 2. 5 mg peanut protein¿kg- 1 matrix) are presented.

40|$|The {{resistance}} <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> is an assay {{to receive}} very quickly {{detailed information about}} the behaviour of adult insects in a phosphine atmosphere. The used concentration of 3, 000 ppm has a narcotic effect on non-resistant insects within a few minutes. Insects with a low phosphine susceptibility are still active after this time period. Using the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> we succeed {{to distinguish between the}} tolerance of different insect species, the tolerance of one species at different concentrations and of different temperature regimes. The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages.
