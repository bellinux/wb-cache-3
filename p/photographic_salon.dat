5000|$|Le Guay’s schoolboy hobby of {{photography}} {{was encouraged by}} Harold Cazneaux and from 1935, at age eighteen, he worked as an assistant at Dayne portrait studio, before opening his own studio in Martin Place in 1937, to concentrate on illustrative and fashion photography. [...] He joined the Pictorialist Sydney Camera Circle in 1940 and exhibited with them at various national and international <b>photographic</b> <b>salons.</b> He began producing photomontage work of a more Surrealist style around the contemporary theme of the Machine Age and incorporating the heroic nude, most significant being The Progenitors (1938). Many of these became illustrations in the newly founded Man: The Australian magazine for men. Consequently, in November 1938 he was invited by Max Dupain and Olive Cotton to join them in forming The Contemporary Camera Groupe with others including Douglas Annand, Harold Cazneaux, Damien Parer, Cecil Bostock and Russell Roberts. The Groupe proclaimed themselves as Modernist, seceding from Pictorialism, and the youngest members were, like Le Guay, commercial photographers. They were inspired by a new image of the body, Australian in that it referred to sun-worshipping beach culture, health and vitality.|$|R

40|$|Thelma Kent was a {{well-known}} pictorialist photographer of her day, highly regarded for her {{photographs of the}} landscape of the South Island. Born in 1899, she was active in the decades of the 1920 s and 1930 s and throughout the war years before her early death in 1946. Her short life encapsulates a fascinating period in the history of New Zealand photography and focuses this thesis on to a previously little studied window. Kent reflected a lot of the dominant ideals and passions of photographic practice and thus becomes an exemplar of her times. Only a small amount of research has previously been attempted on Kent‘s life and work because fragmentary photographic archives yielded few clues. I solved this by concentrating on her published photographs and writings in the nation‘s newspapers and magazines, which proved to be extensive, and provided new insights in to photographic practices of the era. I also used the tools of the biographer; electoral rolls, directories, and interviews with individuals with links to Kent to enable a broader view of my subject. Chapter one looks at Kent‘s early years and examines the biographical methods involved in researching an individual‘s life. Chapter two explores Kent‘s love of travel to remote corners of the South Island to capture photographs. These images fed the nation‘s craze for travel and recreation in an era where new forms of transport such as cars and rail opened up the countryside to droves of ordinary New Zealanders. Chapter three delves into Kent‘s more adventurous trips, particularly to regions in the Southern Alps, and looks at her written accounts and photographs from these journeys. Chapter four shows Kent‘s involvement with camera clubs, <b>photographic</b> <b>salons</b> and the paths that a pictorialist photographer could take to gain national and international exposure. The final chapter looks at Kent mature career during the war years, a time when photographers faced challenges to their practices in terms of limitations of materials and subject matter...|$|R
