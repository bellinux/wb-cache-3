5000|$|A {{very fine}} powder of ferric oxide {{is known as}} [...] "jeweler's rouge", [...] "red rouge", or simply rouge. It is used to put the final polish on {{metallic}} jewelry and lenses, and historically as a cosmetic. Rouge cuts more slowly than some modern polishes, such as cerium(IV) oxide, but is still used in optics fabrication and by jewelers for the superior finish it can produce. When polishing gold, the rouge slightly stains the gold, which contributes to {{the appearance of the}} finished piece. Rouge is sold as a powder, paste, laced on <b>polishing</b> <b>cloths,</b> or solid bar (with a wax or grease binder). Other polishing compounds are also often called [...] "rouge", even when they do not contain iron oxide. Jewelers remove the residual rouge on jewelry by use of ultrasonic cleaning.

40|$|Bullet and {{cartridge}} case evidence may potentially link weapons and crimes through {{the comparison of}} toolmark patterns. This analysis relies on {{the clarity of the}} toolmarks and the ability of the examiner to identify patterns on the evidence. These patterns may be distorted by debris such as soil, blood, cyanoacrylate, and construction materials. Despite the potential importance of bullet and {{cartridge case}} evidence, few investigations of proper cleaning methods have been conducted. The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} various cleaning solutions and application methods on copper and brass bullets and cartridge cases. Additionally, this research investigated the efficacy of these cleaning protocols on the common evidence contaminants blood and cyanoacrylate. No cleaning method was found to be universally effective on both contaminant types and nondestructive to the metal surface. Ultrasonication was the most efficient application method employed when used in conjunction with an appropriate cleaning solution. Acetone proved to be safe and successful at removing heavy cyanoacrylate deposits from brass cartridge cases without damaging the metal. Although sulfuric acid removed most of the cyanoacrylate from the brass cartridge case, ultrasonication of the fumed cartridge cases in sulfuric acid caused the nickel-plated primer caps to turn black. Additionally, etching occurred when sulfuric acid was allowed to dry on the cartridge case surface. Citric acid, salt-flour-vinegar paste, Tergazyme®, and water did not effectively remove the cyanoacrylate from the cartridge cases, but the solutions were safe to use on the brass and sometimes resulted in a shinier surface. Regardless of the cleaning method employed, the bloodstained bullets retained most or all of the underlying brown tarnish. Ultrasonication with sulfuric acid was successful at removing some blood-initiated tarnishing; however, the removal of residues was not complete, making it difficult to visualize the full striation pattern. Citric Acid, Tergazyme®, and water proved to be safe to use on the copper bullets and capable of removing loose debris, but the cleaning solutions did not effectively remove the brown tarnish. Flitz® Instant Brass and Copper Tarnish Remover caused damage to both sample types by causing etching to occur on the metal surface.

As amostras foram acabadas e polidas com lixa d?água de granulação 320, 400, 600 e 1000, e utilizada pasta de diamante de 1 µm. A rugosidade superficial (µm) da resina acrílica foi avaliada em equipamento Surfcorder SE 1700 calibrado com comprimento de onda limite de 0, 8 mm, percurso de medição de 3, 2 mm e velocidade de 0, 5 mm/s. A dureza Knoop (Kg/mm 2) foi avaliada em equipamento Shimadzu HMV- 2000 aplicando-se carga de 25 gramas por 10 segundos, nas distâncias de 50, 100, 200, 400 e 800 µm da barra metálica. Ambas as análises foram realizadas na mesma superfície polida da amostra, mas em lados opostos em relação ao metal. Os resultados de rugosidade foram submetidos a análise de variânica, teste de Tukey e teste t, e para dureza Knoop foram realizados a análise de variância, teste de Tukey e teste de Kruskal-Wallis. Foi observada diferença significativa (p 0, 05) para a dureza em 1 nenhum dos grupos estudados (grupo 1 : KHN 50 = 16, 78; KHN 100 = 17, 16; KHN 200 = 17, 29; KHN 400 = 17, 87; KHN 800 = 17, 98; e grupo 3 : KHN 50 = 17, 07; KHN 100 = 17, 06; KHN 200 = 17, 21; KHN 400 = 17, 78; KHN 800 = 17, 96). Com estes resultados pode-se concluir que a resina acrílica fotopolimerizável apresenta maior rugosidade e dureza Knoop superficiais, em relação aos outros grupos, e o metal não interferiu na dureza do material. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate and compare roughness and Knoop microhardness values of a visible light-cured resin to heat-cured resins, when in contact with metal. Therefore, twelve samples of 30 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness were made, containing a cobalt-chromium metal bar exposed {{in one of the}} surfaces, to each group of the according to the resin and polymerizing method: group 1) microwave oven-cured acrylic resin (Onda Cryl®); group 2) visible light-cured acrylic resin (Triad®); group 3) heat-cured in water acrylic resin (Clássico®). After processing, all samples were ground with 360, 400, 600 and 1000 -grit abrasive papers in a polishing machine under refrigeration, followed by <b>polishing</b> <b>cloths</b> and 1 -micron diamond suspension. Roughness of the acrylic resins were evaluated in micrometers (µm) with a surface texture measurer Surfcorder SE 1700 calibrated with a cut-off value of 0. 8 mm and a tracing length of 3. 2 mm in 0. 5 mm/s. Knoop Microhardness (Kg/mm 2) was assayed using a microhardness tester Shimadzu HMV- 2000 set on 25 gram for 10 seconds, at 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 µm from the metal bar. Roughness values were submitted to analysis of variance, Tukey?s test and t-test and Knoop hardness values were submitted to analysis of variance, Tukey?s test and Kruskal-Wallis? test. Statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) were found for microhardness and roughness values, where group 2 presented the highest values (Ra = 0. 11 and KHN 50 = 20. 20; KHN 100 = 20. 96; KHN 200 = 20. 88; KHN 400 = 21. 01 and KHN 800 = 21. 44). Microhardness values in different distances from the metal bar were not significantly different (p < 0. 05) (group 1 : KHN 50 = 16. 78; KHN 100 = 17. 16; KHN 200 = 17. 29; KHN 400 = 17. 87; KHN 800 = 17. 98; and group 3 : KHN 50 = 17. 07; KHN 3 100 = 17. 06; KHN 200 = 17. 21; KHN 400 = 17. 78; KHN 800 = 17. 96).

5000|$|Abrasive {{machining}} processes {{can be divided}} into two categories based on how the grains are applied to the workpiece. In bonded abrasive processes, the particles are held together within a matrix, and their combined shape determines the geometry of the finished workpiece.

In loose abrasive processes, there is no structure connecting the grains. They may be applied without lubrication as dry powder, or they may be mixed with a lubricant to form a slurry.

The C 18 reversed phase LC system operated in the isocratic mode at 0. 7 mLmin- 1 and used an acidic mobile phase composed of formic acid, EDTA, sodium nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and methanol 1 % (v/v) at pH 4. 5. The working electrode operated at 0. 08 V vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl and its manual cleaning was realized once a month by smoothing on a <b>polishing</b> <b>cloth.</b> The analyzed aminothiols were resolved and eluted within 4 min, and all standard curves were linear in the range 2 × 10 - 7 - 2 × 10 - 5 M. The analyzed wine samples needed no preparation other than dilution with the mobile phase. The concentration of cysteine (CYS), homocysteine (HCYS), glutathione (GSH) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in bottled white wines, determined by the method of standard addition, {{was found to be}} in the low μM range (0. 2 - 2 mgL- 1) depending on the wine type and its age. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{demonstration}} that Nanocrystalline Diamond (NCD) can retain the superior Young’s modulus (1100 GPa) of single crystal diamond twinned with {{its ability to}} be grown at low temperatures (< 450 °C) has driven a revival into the growth and applications of NCD thin films. However, owing to the competitive growth of crystals the resulting film has a roughness that evolves with film thickness, preventing NCD films from reaching their full potential in devices where a smooth film is required. To reduce this roughness, films have been polished using Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP). A Logitech Tribo CMP tool equipped with a polyurethane/polyester <b>polishing</b> <b>cloth</b> and an alkaline colloidal silica polishing fluid {{has been used to}} polish NCD films. The resulting films have been characterised with Atomic Force Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Root mean square roughness values have been reduced from 18. 3 nm to 1. 7 nm over 25 μm 2, with roughness values as low as 0. 42 nm over ∼ 0. 25 μm 2. A polishing mechanism of wet oxidation of the surface, attachment of silica particles and subsequent shearing away of carbon has also been proposed...|$|R
