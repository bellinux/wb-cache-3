Also, we propose to use subjective risk perception as the source of information for quantifying vulnerability since it overcomes some of the shortcomings connected to the reliance on information about the past. Finally, we apply the measure of perceived vulnerability to downside risk to risk perception data from Thailand and Vietnam and find that households in the latter country tend to be more vulnerable than households in the former. Moreover, determinants of perceived vulnerability to downside risk differ significantly between the two countries. Vulnerability; Risk; Risk Perception; Subjective Wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|The {{microelectronics}} industry requires alumina substrates with exceptionally smooth {{surfaces and}} few surface defects to allow successful deposition of metallic films for reliable electronic performance. Irradiation by a 248 -nm wavelength excimer laser beam (KrF) at a fluence of 125 mJ/mm{sup 2 } and at various angles of incidence {{is shown to}} significantly reduce the surface roughness of alumina substrates. However, irradiation also creates a fine particulate deposit of alumina that only <b>partially</b> <b>adheres</b> to the substrate and impedes deposition of metal films. Annealing in air between 1350 C and 1450 C was found to remove the particles by sintering. As-received material showed surface roughness average (R{sub a}) mean values of 457 nm, which was reduced to 60 nm (mean) following irradiation and 71 nm (mean) following irradiation and annealing at 1350 C.

Failure of any of these processes leads to the formation of cleft palate. The mechanisms underlying palatal shelf adhesion are poorly understood, although the presence of filopodia on the apical surfaces of the superficial medial edge epithelial (MEE) cells seems to play an important role in the adhesion of the opposing MEE. We demonstrate here the appearance of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) on the apical surface of MEE cells only immediately prior to contact between the palatal shelves. This apical CSPG has a functional role in palatal shelf adhesion, as either the alteration of CSPG synthesis by β-d-Xyloside or its specific digestion by chondroitinase AC strikingly alters the in vitro adhesion of palatal shelves. We also demonstrate the absence of this apical CSPG in the clefted palates of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β 3) null mutant mice, and its induction, together with palatal shelf adhesion, when TGF-β 3 is added to TGF-β 3 null mutant palatal shelves in culture.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Tetanus is an {{infectious}} disease caused by tetanus toxin produced by Clostridium tetani and induces severe neurological manifestations. We treated {{a patient who}} developed tetanus during hospitalization for replantation of an amputated finger. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first published case report of such an entity. Case presentation A 49 -year-old Japanese man had an amputation of his right middle finger at the distal interphalangeal joint region in an accident at work. His middle finger was successfully replanted, but his fingertip was partially necrotized because of crushing and so additional reconstruction with a reverse digital arterial flap was performed 15 days after the injury. Tetanus developed 21 days after replantation of the middle finger, but symptoms remitted via rapid diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions In replantation after finger trauma with exposure of nerve and blood vessel bundles, concern over injuring nerves and blood vessels may prevent irrigation and debridement from being performed sufficiently; these treatments may have been insufficiently performed in this patient. It is likely that the replanted middle finger <b>partially</b> <b>adhered,</b> and Clostridium tetani colonized the partially necrotized region. Even when there is only limited soil contamination, administration of tetanus toxoid and anti-tetanus immunoglobulin is necessary when the fingers are injured outdoors and the finger nerves and blood vessels are exposed. The drugs should be administered just after replantation if the finger has been amputated. However, if clinicians pay attention to the possibility of tetanus development, treatment can be rapidly initiated. </p...|$|R

The administration of this drug in humans presents several criticisms due to its short half-life, poor stability, and high doses needed to achieve the effect. This paper investigates the potential of polylactic-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) as sustained release systems for iv administration of cerebrolysin in normal and brain injured rats. NPs were prepared by water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion technique and characterized by light scattering for mean size and zeta potential and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology. The NPs produced by double sonication under cooling at 60 W for 45 s, 12 mL of 1 % w:v of PVA, and 1 : 0. 6 w:w drug/PLGA ratio (C-NPs 4) displayed an adequate loading of drug (24 ± 1 mg/ 100 mg of NPs), zeta potential value (− 13 mV), and average diameters (ranged from 250 to 330 nm) suitable to iv administration.

Here, we review and combine some of these published techniques to more realistically assess how key aspects of the public health response might impact on the outcomes of a bioterrorist attack. We combine a within-host mathematical model with our spatial back-calculation method to investigate the effects of a number of important response variables. These include how previously reported levels of adherence with taking antibiotics might affect the total outbreak size compared to assuming full adherence. Post-exposure vaccination is also considered, both with and without the use of antibiotics. Further, we investigate a range of delays (2, 4 and 8 days) before interventions are implemented, following the last day of symptomatic onset of some number of observed initial cases (5, 10 and 15). Our analysis confirms that outbreak size is minimised by implementing prophylactic treatment after having estimated the exposed area based on 5 observed cases; however, imperfect (rather than full) adherence with antibiotics results in approximately 15 % additional cases. Moreover, of those infected individuals who only <b>partially</b> <b>adhere</b> with a prophylactic course of antibiotics, 86 % remain disease free; a result that holds for scenarios in which infected individuals inhale much higher doses than considered here. Increasing logistical delays have a particularly detrimental effect on lives saved with an optimal strategy of early identification and analysis.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the deformation and adhesion of thin elastic sheets that come into contact with an underlying substrate. The focus of this work is on the interplay between material and geometric properties of a system and how this interplay determines the equilibrium states of sheet and substrate, particularly in the regime of geometrically nonlinear deformations. We first consider the form of an elastic sheet that is <b>partially</b> <b>adhered</b> to a rigid substrate, accounting for deflections with large slope: the Sticky Elastica. Starting from the classical Euler Elastica we provide numerical results for the profiles of such blisters and present asymptotic expressions that go beyond the previously known, linear, approximations. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by desktop experiments and suggest a new method for the measurement of material properties for systems undergoing large deformations. With the aim to gain better understanding of the initial appearance of blisters we next investigate the deformation of a thin elastic sheet floating on a liquid surface. We show that, after the appearance of initial wrinkles, the sheet delaminates from the liquid over a finite region at a critical compression, forming a delamination blister. We determine the initial blister size and the evolution of blister size with continuing compression before verifying our theoretical results with experiments at a macroscopic scale. We next study theoretically the deposition of thin sheets onto a grooved substrate, in the context of graphene adhesion. We develop a model to understand the equilibrium of the sheet allowing for partial conformation of sheet to substrate. This model gives phys- ical insight into recent observations of ‘snap-through’ from flat to conforming states and emphasises the crucial role of substrate shape in determining the nature of this transition. We finally present a theoretical investigation of stiction in nanoscale electromechanical contact switches. Our model captures the elastic bending of the switch in response to both electrostatic and van der Waals forces and accounts for geometrically nonlinear deflections. We solve the resulting equations numerically to study how a cantilever beam adheres to a fixed bottom electrode: transitions between free, pinned and clamped states are shown to be discontinuous and to exhibit significant hysteresis. The implications for nanoscale switch design are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|As Junta Central {{turned into}} a body {{coordinating}} the first Carlist electoral campaign of the Restoration Solferino became one of key so-called aperturistas; together with Cerralbo he pursued the path of acknowledging the system by at least <b>partially</b> <b>adhering</b> to its political rules. In 1890 he launched his own electoral campaign, standing in the Catalan Vich close to where he lived and in the Aragon Huesca where his major estate was. Though in Huesca he clearly lost, the Vich result remained heavily contested; the voting took place in February 1891, but he was finally declared victorious {{in the summer of}} 1892, just a month before the Cortes was dissolved. Though his influence in Vich was described by the press as [...] "grandisima", in the following campaign he did not stand; instead, having completed 35 years of age Solferino decided to exercise his grandeza de España right and in 1893 he was admitted to the Senate, sitting as the only Carlist except de Cerralbo himself. Though the Catalan Carlist leader was Luis de Llauder y Dalmases, Solferino was gradually emerging as one of key regional jefes, presiding over some party meetings as early as in 1896. He remained involved in pilgrimage activities. A close collaborator of Llauder, both worked together developing regional Traditionalist media, especially a daily Correo Catalan and a weekly La Hormiga de Oro.In 1896 together with other Carlist deputies and senators Solferino withdrew from the Cortes; denying allegations that like in 1872, the act was introduction to Carlist insurgency, he nevertheless signed a letter lambasting the turnista system as corrupted and unsustainable. The same year he took part in ambiguous gatherings hailing general Moore and in 1898 he presented Carlos VII with an enigmatic gift.

40|$|Purpose: A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{was conducted to}} test key predictions of the widely-studied ‘paranoia as defence’ model (more formally known as the ‘attribution–self-representation cycle’) proposed by Bentall, Corcoran, Howard, Blackwood, and Kinderman (2001), as applied to people with psychosis with persecutory delusions. A novel case series was also conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of collaborative psychological assessment and formulation of impaired treatment decision-making capacity (TDMC) among patients with psychosis, and produce preliminary data on safety and efficacy. Methods: With regard to the {{systematic review}} and meta-analysis, people with psychosis with persecutory delusions were compared to healthy controls, people with depression and people with psychosis without persecutory delusions (and, if specified, grandiose delusions) {{on a number of}} outcomes: externalising attributional bias, explicit self-esteem, implicit self-esteem and discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem. Correlations between paranoia severity and each of these outcomes and self-esteem instability were also examined. In regards to the case series, a formulation of impaired TDMC for 5 patient participants was developed and shared with 13 clinician participants. Acceptability, utility, working alliance and safety were assessed through pre and post self-report and interview measures. Results: Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis and systematic review, of which 33, 36, 10, 10 and 4 were used to test hypotheses on externalising attributional bias, explicit self-esteem, implicit self-esteem, implicit-explicit self-esteem discrepancy and selfesteem instability, respectively. Key model-consistent findings included the following: people with psychosis with persecutory delusions had a greater externalising attributional bias compared to all the other groups and a greater implicit-explicit self-esteem discrepancy than people with depression, and paranoia severity was positively correlated with externalising attributional bias and self-esteem instability. Key model-inconsistent findings included the following: people with psychosis with persecutory delusions had lower explicit self-esteem than healthy controls, and paranoia severity was negatively correlated with explicit self-esteem. There were also some model-inconclusive findings. Regarding the case series, 3 of the patient participants collaborated in the development of their formulation.

40|$|In this research, {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET), as a high-density thermoplastic sheet, and Aluminum A 5052, as a metal with seven distinct surface roughnesses, {{were joined by}} friction spot welding (FSW). The effect of A 5052 ’s various surface states on the welding joining mechanism and mechanical properties were investigated. Friction spot welding was successfully applied for the dissimilar joining of PET thermoplastics and aluminum alloy A 5052. During FSW, the PET near the joining interface softened, <b>partially</b> melted and <b>adhered</b> to the A 5052 joining surface. The melted PET evaporated to form bubbles near the joining interface and cooled, forming hollows. The bubbles have two opposite effects: its presence at the joining interface prevent PET from contacting with A 5052, while bubbles or hollows are crack origins that induce crack paths which degrade the joining strength. On the other hand, the bubbles’ flow pushed the softened PET into irregularities on the roughened surface to form mechanical interlocking, which significantly improved the strength. The tensile-shear failure load for an as-received surface (0. 31 μ m Ra) specimen was about 0. 4 – 0. 8 kN while that for the treated surface (> 0. 31 μ m Ra) specimen was about 4. 8 – 5. 2 kN...|$|R
40|$|Background: Published {{evaluations}} of successful interventions to prevent falls {{in people with}} sight impairment (SI) are limited. The aim of this feasibility study is to optimise the design and investigation of home safety (HS) and home exercise (HE) programmes to prevent falls in older people with SI. Methods: A community-based feasibility study in north-west England comprising a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) allocated participants to (1) a control group receiving usual care and social visits, (2) an experimental group receiving the HS programme and (3) an experimental group receiving the HS + HE programme. Participants were community-dwelling, aged 65 years and older and sight impaired. Primary outcome data on falls were collected continuously over 6 months. Secondary outcomes on physical activity (self-report and instrumented) and adherence were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months for HE and at 6 months for the HS programme. Costs for the HS and HS + HE groups were calculated from logs of time spent on home visits, telephone calls and travel. The research assistant and statistician were blinded to group allocation. Results: Altogether, 49 people were recruited over a 9 -month period (randomised: 16 to control, 16 to HS, 17 to HS + HE). The interventions were implemented over 6 months by an occupational therapist at a cost per person (pounds sterling, 2011) of £ 249 (HS) and £ 674 (HS + HE). Eighty-eight percent (43 / 49) completed the trial and 6 -month follow-up. At 6 -month follow-up, 100 % reported <b>partially</b> or completely <b>adhering</b> to HS recommendations but evidence for adherence to HE was equivocal. Although self-reported physical activity increased, instrumented monitoring showed a decrease in walking activity. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in falls between the groups; however, the study was not powered to detect a difference. Conclusion: It is feasible and acceptable for an occupational therapist to deliver HS and HE falls prevention programmes to people with SI living independently in the community. Future studies could access Local Authority Registers of people with SI to improve recruitment rates. Further research is required to identify how to improve adherence to HE and to measure changes in physical activity before conducting a definitive RCT.
