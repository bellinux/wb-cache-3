25|$|In {{the tenth}} month, Yuan Shao's general Chunyu Qiong {{returned}} with {{an army of}} 10,000 from Hebei escorting large reserves of food supplies. Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu to escort the supplies to Wuchao (烏巢; in present-day Yanjin County, Henan), a place 40 li away from Guandu near Gushi, and placed him in charge of guarding the supplies there. Yuan Shao's advisor Ju Shou argued that Wuchao, being their important supply depot, was too lightly guarded and insisted that Yuan Shao should send the general Jiang Qi (蔣奇) {{to serve as a}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>guard</b> to Chunyu Qiong and cut off any potential raids.

25|$|While this {{research}} takes place, tragedies occur on Lusitania. Father Estevão Ribeira, the priest attempting to sway a distant warmongering sect of the Pequeninos from their goal of attacking humanity, is {{killed by the}} Fathertree Warmaker, who took Quim hostage and denied him the food with the anti-descolada chemicals, so the descolada infected and killed him on the 7th day of being hostage. Grego Ribeira spurs a riot of humans to burn down the warmaker's forest, but the violent mob gets out of his control, and rampages through the neighboring Pequenino forest instead, massacring many of its inhabitants – the original friends and allies of humanity. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty with Pequeninos, the Hive Queen is brought in to hold the peace, setting a <b>perimeter</b> <b>guard</b> of hive drones around the human colony and preventing further escalation of violence between the two groups. Grego is locked in jail, despite eventually stepping between the surviving Pequeninos and his own riot. The town realizes their horrific rage, and constructs a chapel surrounding the fallen priest's grave, trying to find penance for their actions.|$|E
500|$|The first {{casualty}} of the labor battle was a picketer, shot and temporarily paralyzed by a <b>perimeter</b> <b>guard</b> on November 14, 1931, for throwing stones at workers. Several months later, on February 27, 1932, a car carrying six workers to the construction site was surrounded by union men, who began to beat them with iron bars. One of the workers, William T. Harrison, was dead by the next morning; Hague broke all ties with Brandle and ordered the police to [...] "wage relentless war against the Brandle gang-rioters". In April 1932, 21ironworkers were indicted as suspects in the Harrison murder. The trial was held on December 6, 1932, {{two weeks after the}} completion of the skyway. Every defendant was found not guilty, since county prosecutor John Drewen was unable to place any of them {{at the scene of the}} crime, and witnesses and defendants testified that they had been forced under torture or the threat of prosecution to sign affidavits and confessions. In addition to William T. Harrison's death, 14lives were claimed by work-related accidents during construction.|$|E

50|$|When all {{the troops}} and non-essential {{personnel}} were safely shuttled off, he ordered all remaining boats to start loading the full fuel canisters on board to be dropped off at a friendly port. The fuel was mainly used for sea duty's Q-boats to remain functional since they didn't know where another fuel depot would be located. He coordinated the incoming and outgoing boats for the fuel removal, when the <b>perimeter</b> <b>guards</b> warned the Japanese were approaching their security perimeter. He ordered {{all of them to}} withdraw along with the entire harbor personnel to evacuate in any available boats. Since most of the docked boats were loaded with extra fuel tanks, the remaining harbor personnel had to sit on top of them as they departed. Liwanag along with several Q-boats remained and waited for all the volunteer <b>perimeter</b> <b>guards</b> to arrive. They all came running in and immediately jumped onto the boats, saying the Japanese were behind them only by several minutes. He finally gave the order for the destruction of the fuel tanks, facilities and harbor. As his boat departed, some the <b>perimeter</b> <b>guards</b> on board started firing at the direction of the Japanese to keep them at bay, but told them to cease fire to prevent the Japanese from locking onto their position from their weapon's muzzle fire which would endangering themselves further since they were all sitting on top of portable fuel tanks. They used the night's darkness to conceal their departure with only the sounds of their boats motors indicating their presence. The harbor's total destruction took place late during the night with their withdrawal punctuated by a tremendous explosions of the fuel depot tanks which was seen across the Manila Bay.|$|R
50|$|For a week {{following}} the initial strike the camp administration apparently did nothing; they increased <b>perimeter</b> <b>guards</b> but took no forceful action against inmates. The mines were visited by State Attorney of the USSR, Roman Rudenko, Internal Troops Commander, Ivan Maslennikov, {{and other top}} brass from Moscow. The generals spoke to the inmates who sat idle in camp courtyards, so far peacefully. However, on July 26 the mob stormed the maximum security punitive compound, releasing 77 of its inmates. The commissars from Moscow remained in Vorkuta, planning their response.|$|R
50|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of hostage rescue and other dynamic CQC operations, it is desirable to use multiple simultaneous attacks from different entry points to overload the target's ability to react effectively. The more entry points the attackers can choose from, the better their chances. The teams entering the objective usually have to synchronize with snipers, negotiators, power technicians, <b>perimeter</b> <b>guards,</b> and others who assist from the outside. Medical personnel, investigators, and bomb experts may be prepped to enter the scene as soon as the initial attackers get control.|$|R
2500|$|According to a witness, Wilhelm Adelt, who {{commanded}} the <b>perimeter</b> <b>guard</b> at a three-day shooting, men, women and children, {{with the men}} predominating, were brought out to the shooting range, where on each day {{they were forced to}} dig a pit about 20 to 50 meters long and 2 meters deep. [...] They were compelled to remove their outer clothing and surrender any valuables they were carrying. [...] The victims were led to the pits by Latvian auxiliary policemen carrying rifles and wearing armbands. [...] 8 to 10 Jews were killed at a time. [...] The shooters were SD men, who used bolt-action rifles. [...] Some shooters stood, and others knelt. [...] The precise number of killers is not known. [...] After being shot, some victims fell in the pit, others collapsed along the edge. [...] Becu, who also gave the command to shoot, walked among the victims and shot again the still-living ones with his pistol. [...] More victims were then brought up, shot, and pushed into the grave. [...] When the pit was full, Latvians covered it up with sand. [...] On each day of the killing, the victims would first be forced to dig a new pit and the process would continue. [...] According to Adelt, Becu said [...] "'the Jews had to be killed because they did not fit into the Nazi regime, and that Jews in general would be rooted out.'" [...] The method described by Adelt was similar to the many killings committed by Einsatzkommando 2 in the Biķernieki forest. [...] Adelt testified that about 500 to 600 people were killed in the three-day massacre. [...] Professor Ezergailis states that if this was the single major massacre, the total must have been three times as high.|$|E

The British force consisted of B and C Companies from 40 Commando, Royal Marines. As of mid-December 2001 more than 300 US troops, mainly with the 10th Mountain Division, were providing force protection at Bagram.

At this time Faulkner's group arrives, but the plane's pilot under strict instructions from Mad Malloy refuses to wait for the mercenaries and promptly takes off. Leaving the mercenaries stranded, Faulkner organises a fighting withdrawal, taking with them all the fuel, spare arms and ammunition they can pile on the trucks and jeeps.|$|R
