5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird's size.|$|E

Specifically, Caucasian students reported higher cultural congruity than Other students (Russian, Armenian, and Asian and other-non-White), and Latino students reported more positive <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic environment than Other students (Russian, Armenian, and Asian and other non-White). However, no differences emerged between Caucasian and Latino students, and Caucasian and African American students.; While students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic support services (i. e., cultural congruity and the academic environment) and their tendency to protect their selfworth did not predict help-seeking, students' knowledge of support services added variance above and beyond students' GPA in explaining students' help-seeking behaviors.

It was hypothesized that individuals who hold more positive views of their family of origin health will also view themselves and, consequently, the divorced single mother more positively. Participants were 170 college students, 113 of whom lived only with their biological parents, and 57 of whom lived at sometime in their lives with a divorced single mother.

Generally, results indicated that family type made no major impact on participants' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divorced single mother. Among participants in the biological parent group and the divorced single mother group, family of origin health significantly predicted more positive <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divorced single mother.
