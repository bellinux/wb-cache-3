It gives higher <b>priority</b> to hand-off <b>calls</b> to provide higher connectivity to users who are already accepted in the network.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that quality of service {{requirements}} are not very strict for all traffic types, more calls of higher priority can be accommodated by reducing some bandwidth allocation for the bandwidth adaptive calls. The bandwidth adaptation to accept a higher <b>priority</b> <b>call</b> is more than that of a lower <b>priority</b> <b>call.</b> Therefore, the multi-level bandwidth adaptation technique improves the overall forced call termination probability as well as provides priority of the traffic classes in terms of call blocking probability without reducing the bandwidth utilization. We propose a novel bandwidth adaptation model that releases multi-level of bandwidth from the existing multimedia traffic calls. The amount of released bandwidth is decided based on the priority of the requesting traffic calls and the number of existing bandwidth adaptive calls. This prioritization of traffic classes does not reduce the bandwidth utilization. Moreover, our scheme reduces the overall forced call termination probability significantly. The proposed scheme is modeled using the Markov Chain. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to provide negligible handover call dropping probability as well as significantly reduced new call blocking probability of higher priority calls without increasing the overall forced call termination probability.

40|$|Provisioning {{of quality}} of service (QoS) is a key issue in visible light {{communication}} (VLC) system {{as well as in}} other wireless communication systems. Due to the fact that QoS requirements are not as strict for all traffic types, more <b>calls</b> of higher <b>priority</b> traffic classes can be accommodated by blocking some more <b>calls</b> of lower <b>priority</b> traffic classes. Diverse types of high data rate traffic are supported by existing wireless communication systems while the resource is limited. Hence, priority based resource allocation can ensure the service quality for the calls of important traffic class. The fixed guard channels to prioritize any class of calls always reduce the channel utilization. In this paper we propose a priority based dynamic channel reservation scheme for higher <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> that does not reduce the channel utilization significantly. The number of reserved channels for each of the individual traffic classes is calculated using real-time observation of the call arrival rates of all the traffic classes. The features of the scheme allow reduction of the call blocking probability of higher <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> along with the increase of the channel utilization.

Such systems are a component of a ubiquitous computing. Context aware computing makes systems aware of situations of interest, enhances services to users, automates systems and reduces obtrusiveness and customizes and personalizes applications. Mobile phones and PDAs are converging into mobile lifestyle devices that offer {{a wide range of}} applications to end users. Many of these applications will have the ability to adapt themselves to the user’s situation, commonly referred to as context awareness. Context-aware services have been introduced into mobile devices, such as cellular phones. Context aware service recommendation engine for mobile is designed to automatically adopt its behavior to changing environment. To achieve this, an important issue to be addressed is how to effectively select services for adaptation according to the user’s current context. In this paper, we propose an intelligent service recommendation model. We formulate the service adaptation process by using artificial intelligence techniques like Bayesian Network, fuzzy logic and rule based reasoning. Bayesian Network to classify the incoming call (high <b>priority</b> <b>call,</b> low <b>priority</b> <b>call</b> and unknown calls), fuzzy linguistic variables and membership degrees to define the context situations, the rules for adopting the policies of implementing a service, fitness degree computation and service recommendation.

The purpose of this report is to inquire {{whether there is a}} way to {{implement}} an option for personnel at Swedish hospitals to claim priority on an elevator call, and to do this in an efficient way. An ordinary elevator system has been simulated with an implementation of Nearest Car algorithm, an algorithm which calculates the most suitable elevator car to serve a specific call considering the distance between the call floor and the car and the direction. Along with this algorithm, different ways to handle <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> has been implemented to see how they affect the mean transport time for both passengers with priority and regular passengers in the elevator. This has been made to decide if any of these algorithms are suitable for using in practice. It is established that the mean time for <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> are substantially lower in all tested algorithms and that the ordinary calls mean time are not affected very much. However, it is stated that more thorough tests are required before a conclusion can be made about the implementations effectivity. ...|$|R
