40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{economic development and}} public infrastructure capital has puzzled economists, economic geographers, planners, and other social scientists, for many years. This thesis presents an attempt to theorise and conduct empirical research on this field {{in the context of}} a developing economy within the European Union - Greece. Key to understanding the work undertaken in this thesis is the wider theoretical and applied research, which has flourished in the US and other countries during the last decade. The thesis examines the effects of public capital investment on Greek economic development viewed at different spatial scales. More specifically, it explores the role of infrastructure spending at national, regional, and urban (metropolitan area of Athens) levels. The empirical presentation begins with a description of the <b>Public</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Programme</b> from 1976 onwards. This is the main channel for public investment in infrastructure capital in Greece. Its various public capital sub-categories have been aggregated into two basic types, 'productive' and 'social' infrastructure. The next step was to utilise a production function analytical framework and panel data analysis to explore the direct and network effects of infrastructure investment on manufacturing industry. Positive effects of infrastructure spending are apparent. An alternative approach, cost function analysis, is deployed in the second major empirical section. Using various spatial levels, the role of public capital on the private costs of production can be examined by the calibration of a cost function for industrial sectors. The results show that infrastructure investment reduces private costs in manufacturing at most spatial levels. Finally, the thesis investigates other direct and indirect channels by which public capital can affect the non-manufacturing and manufacturing sectors of the private economy. The empirical findings show that there is no significant infrastructure impact on the former sector, whereas there are mixed results for the indirect channels on manufacturing. It can be safely argued that the public capital and regional development relationship is a complex one, especially as infrastructure effects can be different at different spatial levels...|$|E

He considers the National Development Finance Agency whose mission is to optimise the financing of public sector investment projects. While Professor Lane believes that this agency could make a contribution by improving the financial engineering of the <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programme,</b> he also identifies a number of limitations to its operation. He examines the National Pensions Reserve Fund which was set in 2001 in order to partially pre-fund social welfare and public sector pensions. Some issues are raised with regard to the Fund's current investment strategy and its political sustainability. Professor Lane is strongly opposed to investing the Fund in domestic projects such as Public Private Partnership (PPPs) or domestic securities since such exposure would reduce the diversification of the Fund and leave it open to political pressure. The other innovation he considers is the Special Savings Investment Account Scheme. Introduced in 2001, it was designed to raise national savings levels and has proved extremely popular with over 1. 14 million individual accounts opened. The principal defect of the scheme appears to be its high cost to the taxpayer which arises from the fact that the level of matching contribution is set too high. However, this level may have been necessary to kick-start the programme. Finally, Professor Lane addresses the Stability and Growth Pact and suggests that net additions to public investment be excluded from the deficit limit. This recalls the discussion at last year's Budget Perspectives Conference which dealt with the UK's twin investment rules: the golden rule which enjoins Government to borrow only to finance investment and not consumption and the sustainable investment rule which aims to keep net public sector debt at a stable and prudent level. Carbon Tax and Climate Change Strategy This paper is presented by Stephen Smith of University College London and deals with the very topical issue of carbon taxation. Professor Smith outlines the key scientific and economic issues underlying international climate change policy and focuses in particular on a question of great salience for Ireland - the implications of carbon taxation for industrial competitiveness. He shows that applying the concept of "competitiveness" to a whole economy is more complex than applying it to an individual enterprise. The impact of a carbon tax is seen as primarily relative: carbon-intensive sectors will suffer while sectors with low carbon intensity will benefit. Even if the revenue raised by a carbon tax is used to reduce other taxes (taxes on labour are frequently suggested), the author points out that tax burden effects can still arise, as will the costs of environmental compliance. Tax Cuts, Tax Reform and Labour Supply Responses In this session, Tim Callan, Arthur van Soest and John Walsh present the results of some recently completed work on labour supply responses to changes in taxation. This is the first time it has been possible to extend the SWITCH model to go beyond static or first round effects and model in some depth the behavioural responses of individuals. Being based on a nationally representative sample of households, the estimates outlined in this paper will provide reliable guidance to the authorities in reforming the direct taxation system. For example, the results indicate that structural reforms of the tax treatment of husbands and wives seem to have a greater impact on labour supply than simple tax cuts, and can achieve this at lower Exchequer cost. Educational Expenditure: Implications for Equality As well as examining taxation policy and the macro-economic aspects of the Budget, we try in the Budget Perspectives Conferences to focus also on an in-depth assessment of a particular area of expenditure. This year Selina McCoy and Emer Smyth of the ESRI examine expenditure on education. The ESRI has conducted a large body of work on equality issues in education and the authors use this to assess the extent to which expenditure has been successful in reducing inequalities. They show that programmes designed to tackle educational disadvantage are fragmented and may not be sufficient to compensate for pre-existing inequalities. They provide evidence that the benefits of education accrue not only to individuals in terms of improved employment and income levels, but also to the wider society in terms of reduced welfare costs and crime levels. For this reason, they believe that increased educational expenditure, particularly on younger age groups, should remain a priority. ...|$|E

This {{essay will}} attempt to forecast what {{the economic and social}} role of government in Canada will be during the next fifty years. The forecasting method which will be used is quite simple. We will try first to detect the trends which seem to account for the past. Secondly, past trends will: be submitted to scientific analysis in order to see if they ought to be modified before being projected into the future. Thirdly, the forecast itself will be formulated. Regarding this latter adventure, however, we must never forget that the only one thing certain with regard to the future is its uncertainty. This is particularly true with regard to our topic. PAST EVOLUTION SINCE 1850 The first phase in the application of our forecasting method consists in reviewing the past role of government in Canada. It seems that, from 1850 to the present day, a distinction can be made between two periods which largely coincide with two important industrial revolutions. In Canada, the First World War marked the transition between those two phases. The First Period of EvolutionWhile it is always unsatisfactory to ascribe specific dates to different phases of general economic evolution, it can be suggested that this first period started with the end of mercantilism, when the first industrial revolution received its real impetus in Canada, and, in the political field, with the first years of Confederation. The industrial revolution meant the rise of manufacturing, new methods of production and substantial changes in the system of sea and land transport. As has been frequently said, it was based on coal, steam and steel. In such circumstances, industrial development could be entrusted to private initiative, which would produce rapid economic progress provided private enterprise was not discouraged by any system of intervention and regulation. In the British North American colonies, however, economic conditions were quite different because the industrial revolution had an unfavourable impact, aggravated by the long depression which characterized {{the last part of the}} nineteenth century. Potential investment opportunities existed, mainly in the filed of railroad building and equipment, but prospective profits did not seem sufficient to attract private capital. It was necessary then to find a solution to serious economic stagnation and, at the same time, to achieve the technological progress enjoyed in other countries by providing railroad transport facilities and by encouraging the application of the new methods of production as well as the manufacture of the new products. Thus, Confederation, which was brought about 1867, can be interpreted as a political adaptation to the unfavourable impact of the first industrial revolution on Canada. Although the Canadian people had a strong preference for private enterprise, the doctrine of economic liberalism requiring government non-intervention did not fit in with the particular conditions of that period. The first task of the federal government was to enlarge the territory. Thus as early as 1873 Canada extended over the entire area she occupied until the addition of Newfoundland in 1949. The role of government in this field took different forms: direct public investment, monetary subsidies, free distribution of land, guarantees for private borrowing. It finally ended up with the creation of a large public enterprise to integrate the network which the government had been obliged to take over. To develop the territory it was necessary to build up important markets which at the same time would be complementary to each other. The first step toward this goal was to ensure that the domestic market would be preserved for Canadian industry. This was the objective of the National Policy inaugurated in 1878. The end of the century coincided with world economic recovery. For the first time, Western countries felt the full impact of the industrial revolution. In particular, there was a huge world demand for wheat. On the other hand, Western Canada was particularly suited for wheat production and was, thus, in a strong position to compete on world markets. The rapid colonization of the West, coupled with the huge <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programme</b> necessary to organize the territory, favoured an intense prosperity and a swift industrial development in the whole of Canada. Long-term projects of economic development were inspired, supported and often initiated by the public authority. On the whole, private initiative merely responded to the impulse coming from the government. In contrast, the role of government in social affairs was restricted to a minimum during that first period. The economy, based mainly on agriculture and on small enterprise, did not experience wide short-term variations in production. Massive and prolonged unemployment was relatively unknown. Technological immobility was low. Of course, social risks and extreme poverty existed, but, according to the then prevailing standards, they were expected to be solved on the private level. The Second Industrial EvolutionAt the beginning of the present century, what was the basis of this new industrial revolution, and what would be its impact on the countries of the Western world, and, in particular, on Canada?The first technological revolution had been based on coal, steam and steel; the second was found upon oil and water and on metals which became substitutes for steel, such as copper and aluminum. It brought substantial changes in almost every sector of economic activity. The new industrial revolution witnessed the generalization of mass and standardized production, which favoured large scale operations, huge plants, a further division of labour and increased efficiency. In contrast with the first industrial revolution, Canada was probably the country most favoured by the new technology in the Western world. For the first time, the rate of Canadian economic development exceeded that of the United States during the second quarter of the present century. Over the long run, prospective profits were high, investment opportunities were great and private initiative was very active. Thus, for the first time since the industrial era, the Canadian government was in a position to adopt a "laissez-faire" attitude toward economic affairs. The only new important responsibility undertaken by government in the economic field W 3 S road building which, of course, could not be left to private initiative. It was soon discovered, however, that the movement of private investment was irregular and that, if left alone, it tended to create short-run economic instability characterized by inflation and unemployment. The great depression of the thirties was the dramatic manifestation of the new industrial era. Broadly speaking, governments adopted the same "laissez-faire" attitude toward short-run problems which they had applied to the long-term situation. In the social field, the situation during this second period was different from that of the first. The main source of change has been rapid industrialization. This period witnessed the rapid development of the co-operative movement, the farmers' associations and the labour unions. Secondly, industrialization, through its various impacts, has given rise to specified risks and needs which cannot be met by the average family. Thus, the very conditions which permitted the government to adopt a "laissez-faire" attitude in the economic field obliged the public authorities to assume an increasing role regarding social welfare. In other words private initiative had failed to solve the complex social problem resulting from rapid industrialization and urbanization in an unstable world, and public intervention had become necessary. Conclusion We are now in a position to set out the main conclusions concerning the evolution of the role of government in Canada since Confederation. Up to the twenties, government played an active role in the field of a long term economic development through its programme of direct public investments and of encouragement to private initiative. It was the real dynamic factor in industrial progress during that period. On the other hand, short-term economic instability was not so much a problem; to a certain extent, this explains why the responsibilities of the public authority in that respect as well as in the field of social security were almost negligible. Since the twenties, however, the role of government has followed a different pattern. Long-term economic development has been taken over by private initiative, while public authorities have assumed new and increasing responsibilities first in the field of welfare and social security and later, especially since the forties, in respect to short-term economic instability. It is highly important to note the Canadian past experience, because it shows, that there is no basic general trend pointing toward an increasing role of government in the same direction. It also reveals that political ideologies have not played a decisive influence in determining state responsibilities. On the contrary, the role of government has been primarily functional in character; it has been adapted, with certains lags, to changing economic and social circumstances, which, in the last resort, were determined by the recurrence and the impact of industrial revolutions. A THEORICAL APPRAISAL OF PAST TRENDSFrom the above interpretation of Canadian past political evolution, it is possible to build a general model describing the behaviour of government in three important economic and social sectors, that is, long-term industrial development, short-term economic stability and social welfare. The main determinants of that model are the consequences of industrial revolutions and the different objectives sought by government and private initiative. We are now in a position to summarize our brief incursion into the field of political science. The above tentative theory can be reduced to the following basic propositions. 1. —The process of political evolution leads sooner or later to a situation of stable equilibrium, which is moving according to changing economic and social conditions, and which rests on a combination of forces that can best realize general welfare. 2. —That situation of moving equilibrium, which is usually attained after a certain period of adjustment, does not correspond to pure capitalism, which means the systematic reliance on private initiative, or to pure socialism which relies exclusively on government action. It is rather characterized by the recognition of a complementary relationship between the private and the public sectors of our society. 3. —This complementary relationship is mainly determined in the long run by the impact of industrial revolutions or by the response of the natural resources of a country to the technology prevailing during a certain period. Thus, the role of government can be deduced from that main determinant and from the basic features of the behaviour of the private sector. 4. —In an equilibrium situation, if the impact of technological factors is favourable to a given country, the main responsibilities in the field of long-term industrial development are left to private initiative, but the role of government in respect to short-term economic stability and social welfare is decisive. On the other hand, if the impact of technology is unfavourable, then the role of government in the field of long-term industrial progress will be determinant but its functions in respect to short-term stability will be greatly reduced while its responsibilities in the field of social welfare will depend to a large extent on the degree of industrialization. 5. —Finally, two main sources of desequilibrium have been detected. The first coincides with the passage from mercantilism to industrialism. During that transition period, most countries go through a temporary phase of pure capitalism or of pure socialism, but those two avenues can be viewed as convergent paths toward the same equilibrium position. Once that position has been attained, another source of desequilibrium is still possible. Generally it is due to a static interpretation of the equilibrium position, which is essentially moving; this, in turn, is usually explained by the fact that an extremist ideology is dominating the political scene. For instance, a government may refuse, because of its unlimited faith in private initiative, to take on more responsibilities in a certain field although such a step is required by changing conditions. Thus the static interpretation of the dynamic relationship existing between private initiative and government action causes a temporary departure from the equilibrium position and may leave crucial problems without solutions. If the ideology and the sectional interests which are at the origin of the evil are not too solidly rooted, the result may be limited to short-run political instability. On the other hand, if they are strongly entrenched, so that delays in solving the important problems of a period are prolonged, then this situation may produce a profound disequilibrium and lead to the temporary victory of an opposite ideology. We may also mention a third source of disequilibrium; the direct intervention of a foreign power to impose by force its own ideology on another country. However, our theory does not take that possibility into account so that the forecast which is based on the above interpretation does not envisage conquest by force or political disequilibrium by conquest. Our brief scientific inquiry contributes at least to raise serious doubts about the foundation of those political theories which assert that the evolution process leads more or less inevitably toward pure socialism, conceived as a stable system. It also shows that our interpretation of Canadian past experience not only accounts for a single set of conditions which may not repeat themselves but has a much more general theoritical validity. Finally, we are led to the conclusion that past trends are not likely to be modified in the future in Canada and that the model which we have just outlined can serve as the basis of our forecast. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN CANADA: A FORECASTThe recognition of the complementary relationship between private initiative and government action has been the dominant feature of our political history at least since 1867, and there is no evidence at present to show that this long-established tradition may be broken. On the contrary, all the facts indicate that it will be strenghtened. First, the present attitude of the Canadian Government in that regard is clear and has been re-stated on several occasions since the publication of the White Paper on employment and income. Secondly, the major political parties recognize the fundamental complementarity existing between private initiative and government action. Finally, it is evident that there are differences of opinion among the various sections of the Canadian population as to what government should or should not do. Slogans denouncing the Welfare State or creeping socialism or government controlled by wicked capitalists had to be imported from other countries and were soon found to be unfit for Canadian consumption. The normal implication to be drawn from this outlook is that private initiative will continue to play the dynamic and dominant role in the field of long-term industrial development in Canada during the next decades. The role of government will be auxiliary and conditioning. It will consist mainly in maintaining a favourable climate for private initiative and in adopting policies designed to ensure that the natural resources will be rationally utilized to the advantage of the Canadian population. This outlook has direct implications in the future short-run situation. Thus, if the theory developed in this essay holds, the main responsibility of our government in the future will consist in maintaining short-term economic stability. On the success of this vital role will depend the stable level of general welfare and the survival of private initiative in the field of long-term development This objective of government action will require the contribution of each sector of general economic policy. From this point of view, economic preparedness to fight a depression is just as important as military preparedness to resist an aggression. The future role of government in the field of economic stability will be crucial and highly complex. It will require centralized responsibility, growing reliance on expert knowledge and judgment, constant collaboration between the different levels of government and co-operation from private groups as well as from the people generally. In the years to come more than ever before, the essential complementarity existing between private initiative and government action will have to be recognized both in theory and in practice. GENERAL CONCLUSIONOur forecast concerning the future role of government has several important implications. The first is related to the orientation of federation in Canada and the second to the problem of bureaucracy. Confederation was the recognition of the fact that only a central authority could effectively assume those heavy responsibilities. After the First World War the importance of the federal government was gready reduced. On the other hand, the rise of the automobile as a new mean of transport, the growing importance of natural resources as the foundation of economic development, rapid industrialization and urbanization contributed to establish provincial legislature in a dominant position. The Great Depression seems to have brought this phase of provincial autonomy to an end. For various reasons, provincial governments did not provide the most basic measures of social security and the federal government took the initiative in this field. This trend will be maintained in the future until the minimum requirements of the main social needs and risks are met. Thus, the federal authorities will continue to assume the most important responsibilities of government in the field of social welfare. In respect to short-term economic stability, the role that can be played by provincial governments is limited because they have no jurisdiction in the field of international trade and of monetary policy; they increase their borrowing capacity and their fiscal powers are restricted. In addition, it must also be recognized that a stabilization programme requires a central authority and a unified economic policy. All these factors indicate that the federal government will be obliged to play the dominant role in the collective effort to avoid economic instability. Account should also be taken of its vital responsibilities in respect to national defence. In recent years, the rising power of bureaucracy has been criticized. Indeed, bureaucracy is not an institution confined to government. It is also growing in business organization and in labour unions. This trend is brought about by many factors. The first and probably the most important is the large-scale proportions obtained by our economic, social and political institutions, which has made direct and immediate control almost impossible. A second factor has been the growing complexity of the problem faced by those various organizations. Finally, the progress accomplished by social sciences has given rise to expert and specialized knowledge in this field. The expansion of bureaucracy certainly creates crucial problems with regard to the democratic control of our private and public institutions. Some people are proposing to solve those difficulties by getting rid of experts. II is certainly as desirable to be able to rely on specialized advisers in the field of social sciences as it is in the sector of natural sciences. It will be necessary to create new methods of democratic control and perhaps also to revise our concept of democracy. It might well be that a more enlightened public opinion can provide the only satisfactory and permanent answer to that question...|$|E

Experience of FY 2007 was unique in the history of Bangladesh {{in the sense that it}} saw three consecutive governments and declaration of a state of emergency. The new caretaker governments (CTGs) first six months coincided with the second half of FY 2007. Despite the challenging scenario, political turmoil and disruption in the economy in the early months of FY 2007 (particularly in November- December, 2006) and the uncertainties afflicting the economy during the period following the takeover by the current CTG in January 2007, FY 2007 saw a number of positive developments. These included moderately high growth of manufacturing industries (10. 01 per cent), robust performance of the export sector (15. 69 per cent growth), revitalized capital market (121 per cent growth in DSE market-capitalisation) and high growth of remittance flow (24. 5 per cent). However, some disturbing signs were already discernible as FY 2007 was drawing to a close : a deteriorating trade balance, weak implementation of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programmes,</b> stagnating food grains production and a fall in agricultural credit disbursement. Creeping inflation throughout the year, particularly, rising prices of cereals and fuel originating from increasing world prices of cereals and oil, was already emerging as causes for concern. The wide ranging anticorruption drive added to uncertainties affecting investment environment with consequent negative implications for domestic and foreign investment.

40|$|The paper uses an aid {{disaggregation}} {{approach to}} {{examine the impact of}} different aid modalities on the fiscal sector of the aid-recipient country. It uses time-series data on different types of development aid (project aid, programme aid, technical assistance and food aid) for Uganda, an important aid recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of aid which combines aid heterogeneity and endogenous aid. The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues since different aid categories have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. Project and food aids appear to cause a reduction in <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> whereas <b>programme</b> aid and technical assistance are positively related to <b>public</b> <b>investment.</b> The same applies for government consumption.

40|$|The {{present study}} was a cross {{sectional}} survey carried out to establish the views of ZOU lecturers on the quality expectations of the Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education (ZIMCHE). Open and closed questions were asked to accord the respondents variety. Documents on the accreditation of {{institutions of higher education}} were analysed and items for the questionnaires were derived from these documents. Out of a potential lecturer complement of 200 at the 10 Regional Centres and National Centre, a stratified sample of 100 lecturers was selected. Lecturers were grouped into strata according to the four faculties. Out of the four strata, 100 lecturers were selected through the simple random technique based on proportional representation. The study established that ODL institutions face a number challenges in an attempt to meet the quality standards set by ZIMCHE, the higher and tertiary regulatory body. The challenges include the lack of support in terms of financial, material and physical infrastructure from central government, extra functional and operational activities undertaken by ODL lecturers which affect the quality of service offered, inadequate ICT gadgets for information dissemination as a handicap and staff and student competence in the use of ICTs, among other findings. It was therefore, recommended that there is need for heavy capital investment from government through <b>Public</b> Sector <b>Investment</b> <b>Programme</b> for infrastructure development to cater for building construction. There was also need for change in perceptions towards ODL by all stakeholders among which are the politicians who need to conscientise their constituencies on the important role of ODL in sustainable development. Staff and students needed to be trained thoroughly in ICT usage for communication and research purposes to boost research work and the workload of the lecturers should be reduced so that the lecturers focus more on research and teaching which are their core businesses. There was also need to draft and implement an exclusively ODL policy which takes into consideration the peculiar characteristics of ODL institutions...|$|R
40|$|The Bali Action Plan (UNFCCC, 2007 a) {{acknowledges}} the central roles {{of finance and}} technology in the successful implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘the Convention’). They form {{two of the four}} building blocks for a post- 2012 international climate change agreement. For developing countries, the conclusion of negotiations for an acceptable and successful agreement hinges upon the provision of financial and technology sup-port from developed countries, commensurate with the identified needs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and reflecting the full agreed incremental costs of meeting the objectives of the Convention. This dissertation presents research undertaken in support of these negotiations and the design of new financing and technology development and transfer policies to underpin the mitigation and adaptation efforts of the post- 2012 agreement, as mandated by decision 3 /CP. 13 of the Conference of the Parties. The research contained within this dissertation draws and builds upon the re-ports of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (UNFCCC, 2008 a; 2009 a;b) which were pre-pared in response to the mandate of the Conference of the Parties. Financing for technology will need to be scaled up by an order of magnitude, across all technologies and in all nations (UNFCCC, 2009 b). In the order of USD 1 trillion in <b>investment,</b> both <b>public</b> and private, needs to be mobilized each year (IEA, 2008 a). Using estimates of the incremental costs for developing countries, the cost for Annex II Parties is estimated at an additional USD 262 – 670 billion per year for mitigation technologies and USD 33 – 163 billion per year to adapt to climate change (see UNFCCC, 2009 a, pp 31 – 33). A wide range of financing options and technology development and transfer policies are avail-able, some with greater potential than others to mobilise the necessary financial resources. Effectiveness varies across policy instruments. Combining policy options so as to exploit synergies, and matching of policy responses to local and national circumstances can be significant determinants of a successful regime. This dissertation attempts to assess and compare the possible public and private financing needs, based on the policy concept of ‘leveraging the private sector’, which is commonly touted within the negotiations by many national governments as an essential policy objective for finance and technology. Available options are described and proposals are analysed according to their effectiveness. Scenarios of public and private financing for technology development and transfer are developed based on the average leveraging ratios achieved by a wide range of policies and programmes at the national, regional and international level. Policies under consideration both at the international and national levels are included where estimates of their leveraging potential can be made. The assessment is made for each stage of the technology innovation cycle (research and development, demonstration, deployment, diffusion) and estimates are made of the amounts of public financing required. The results of this dissertation point to the significant role that public finance will play in achieving the objectives of the Convention. Scenarios that involve {{a significant increase in the}} leveraging effect of <b>public</b> policies and <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> on the private sector will still require substantial <b>public</b> <b>investment,</b> in the order of USD 30 – 160 billion per annum. It is estimated that, under this scenario, the private sector share of total investment would be increased from the current levels of approximately 60 per cent to 75 – 80 per cent. The results also suggest that the financial mechanism of the Convention needs to take a more prominent role in coordinating the overall delivery of financing and to help optimize the potential for private sector financing. Integrated design of <b>public</b> policies and <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> will be important and a wide range of innovative financing instruments and types of finance will need to be deployed in a targeted way to address qualitative and quantitative gaps in the existing financial arrangements...|$|R

In the analysis, the paper also estimated the important indirect contribution of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> to economic growth through its crowding effect on private investment. The study employs the newly proposed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) -bounds testing approach in estimating the economic growth and private investment models.

Second, as for regional allocation, up to 1993 when the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) stepped down from government, the LDP had had a great influence on <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> allocation; however, following such a government alternation the influence of local special interest groups may have become stronger. Focusing on the local side, empirical analysis of the <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> function considering political-economic factors clarifies that local <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> policy has been deeply affected by the construction industry as a local interest group (which is heavily dependent on <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> in general), and that levels of <b>public</b> <b>investment</b> have not been determined in the way the median voter theorem implies. <b>investment</b> policy, <b>public</b> <b>investment,</b> Japan, voter theorem, Liberal Democratic Party of Japan...|$|R
