50|$|<b>Precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> {{are intimately}} {{associated}} with investments, if earnings {{are not used}} for purchasing commodities and services; there is a probability that the <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> can be invested to generate fixed capital and achieve economic growth.|$|E
50|$|Ventura and Eisenhauer (2005) {{argue that}} the reason behind lack of {{consensus}} of empirical work on the magnitude of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> {{is due to the}} lack of suitable data, and of a good proxy for future income variability.|$|E
50|$|A more {{developed}} analytical framework would consider {{the impact of}} income risk and capital risk on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings.</b> Increased savings {{in the current period}} raises the expected value of future consumption.

50|$|Weil (1993) {{proposed}} a simple multi-period model {{to analyze the}} determinants of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> Analytical findings confirmed {{the presence of a}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive, with <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> positively correlated with income risk.

40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> {{is shown in}} this paper to be {{isomorphic}} to the Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion, making possible {{the application of a}} large body of knowledge about risk aversion to <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving,</b> and more generally, to the theory of optimal choice under risk. In particular, a measure of the strength of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive analogous to the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion is used to establish a number of new propositions about <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving,</b> and to give a new interpretation of the Oreze-Modigliani substitution effect. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how aversion to risk and aversion to intertemporal substitution determine {{the strength of}} the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive in a twoperiod model with KrepsPorteus preferences. For small risks, we derive a measure of {{the strength of the}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive which generalizes the concept of “prudence ” introduced by Kimball (1990 b). For large risks, we show that decreasing absolute risk aversion guarantees that the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive is stronger than risk aversion, regardless of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Holding risk preferences fixed, {{the extent to which the}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive is stronger than risk aversion increases with the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We derive sufficient conditions for a change in risk preferences alone to increase the strength of the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive and for the strength of the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive to decline with wealth. Within the class of constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution, constantrelative risk aversion utility functions, these conditions are also necessary...|$|R
50|$|Precautionary saving is {{different}} from <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings.</b> Saving is a flow variable quantity, measured in units of currency per unit of time (such as dollars per year).

50|$|Subsequent {{analysis}} from Kazarosian (1997), {{using data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey, has shown that a doubling of uncertainty increases the ratio of wealth to permanent income by 29%. In addition, surveys have shown that most Americans desire <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> at 8% of total net worth and 20% of total financial wealth.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{explanation}} is accidental bequest, developed by economists Yaari (1965) and Davies (1980). Here {{it is not}} assumed that the disponer (testator) gains any specific benefit from leaving a bequest, but rather that lifetime is uncertain, and so she/he holds <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> to insure him/herself against the risk of living too long. Unspent wealth at time of death is transferred according to intestacy law.|$|E
40|$|Using panel data, the {{relationship}} between income uncertainty and the stock of wealth through <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> is examined.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> under {{liquidity}} constraints in Pakistan using {{household panel}} data. In particular, while it estimates Kimball's [Kimball, M.

How prudent are consumers? Journal of Political Economy 1993; 101; 1104 - 1113. ], this study deviates from the framework by explicitly considering liquidity constraints, as in Zeldes [Zeldes, S. P. Consumption and liquidity constraints: an empirical investigation. Journal of Political Economy 1989; 97; 305 - 346. ]. By doing so, this paper attempts to differentiate the standard <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> caused by uncertainty from that caused by liquidity constraints. Furthermore, endogenous liquidity constraints are used in order to resolve issues of selection biases. We find substantial evidence of the presence of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> in Pakistan. More specifically, the estimated prudence is significantly higher for liquidity-constrained households as compared with unconstrained ones. The finding suggests that the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motives appear stronger when households see that their access to credit markets is limited. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> Prudence Liquidity constraints Switching regression...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{insuring}} industrial workers’ future incomes against workplace {{accident was}} used to test the effect of insurance on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings.</b> This was conducted for 7000 households who did not or could not obtain complete insurance coverage against workplace accident risk, covering 1917-1919. Industrial workers at the time significantly reduced their saving and insurance consumption by approximately 25 percent when their expected post accident benefits increased.|$|E
50|$|Precautionary saving {{is saving}} (non-expenditure of {{a portion of}} income) that occurs in {{response}} to uncertainty regarding future income. The precautionary motive to delay consumption and save {{in the current period}} rises {{due to the lack of}} completeness of insurance markets. Accordingly, individuals will not be able to insure against some bad state of the economy in the future. They anticipate that if this bad state is realized, they will earn lower income. To avoid adverse effects of future income fluctuations and retain a smooth path of consumption, they set aside a precautionary reserve, called <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings,</b> by consuming less in the current period, and resort to it in case the bad state is realized in the future.|$|E
50|$|So far, we have {{explained}} why some countries have accumulated many savings, but not {{why they are}} held abroad (besides the <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> explanation). One reason, is that the financial development has not been followed at the same pace as the financial openness. This {{can be seen in}} a very small markets to generate safe assets where to store value from one period to the next. For this reason, many countries have decided to invest those assets abroad, in the more financially developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, in the form of Sovereign Wealth Funds, portfolio investments and foreign reserves, indicating the existence of shortages in safe assets as well. Another explanation is that ageing population do not find profitable investment vehicles to invest at home, and end up investing them abroad.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{importance}} of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> in Italy. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on two contemporaneous sources of uncertainty, income and health expenditures, to explain the presence of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> The major changes occurred in public health care policies from 1985 to 1996 have caused households to pay {{a larger share of}} their outof-the-pocket medical expenditures. We therefore expect consumers to react to this uncertainty by generating <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> Our results show strong support for the precautionary savinghypothesis as a response to health uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} literature on <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> is based {{almost entirely on}} the assumption that the household acts as if it con-sisted of a single individual decision-taker.

This paper examines the implications of this observation for the existence of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving,</b> and shows that the assumption that the in-dividual utility functions satisfy the conditions for <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> to exist can imply that the household exhibits precaution-ary saving, but only under strong assumptions on the type of risk change being considered.

50|$|The Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a {{longitudinal}} cohort study {{designed to determine}} the impact of tax-time saving and {{examine the effects of}} supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings)</b> factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved {{in the absence of the}} intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{existence}} of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> using subjective or self-reported measures of income uncertainty drawn from Japanese household data (primarily from those in their 30 s). Two subjective measures are tested: one concerning labor earnings and the other concerning public pension benefits. The results show that, among either nuclear family households or households that do not receive income transfers from parents, there exist <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> due to uncertainty concerning public pension benefits. As the respondents are primarily in their 30 s, we find that those households start to save based on precautionary motives early in their lives. The finding {{that the effect of}} public pension uncertainty concerning savings is manifested in nuclear family households suggests that intergenerational risk-sharing reduces risk and therefore wealth accumulation. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are found to take the form of relatively low-risk assets; no <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are found in securities.

40|$|A common {{assumption}} {{in standard}} economic models is that agents are risk-averse and prudent, {{and it is}} often argued that prudence is necessary to generate <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings.</b> This paper shows that prudence {{is not necessary to}} generate <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> in small open economy models with more than two periods. A new class of preferences, which enables the isolation of the effect of risk aversion on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings,</b> is introduced. The effects of changes in risk aversion, interest rates, and persistence and volatility of shocks on average asset holdings are qualitatively identical to the ones observed for standard constant-elasticity-of-substitution preferences. These results show that the almost universal assertion in the literature - that only prudent consumers can generate positive levels of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> - is simply incorrect.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. {{thesis is}} to {{contribute}} to the understanding of household consumption and saving behaviour under risk and uncertainty. The <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> hypothesis proposes that households will postpone their consumption and increase their saving level to be protected against future labour income uncertainty. It is reasonable to interpret the additional rise in household saving due to future labour income uncertainty as <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> Moreover, it is expected that households will prefer to keep their <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> in the form of financial assets because of their liquidity. I utilize several waves of household budget surveys, which are designed as repeated cross-sectional surveys that provide information about social, economic and demographic characteristics of households to reveal the empirical importance of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> in the Turkish economy. The empirical analysis confirms the predictions of the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> hypothesis. It is observed that households raise their saving level under risk and uncertainty and the amount of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> constitutes a significant fraction of total household saving. Labour income risk is the most important source of concern for households among the analysed risk types, since a job-opportunity in the registered economy creates a reliable source of income and social security coverage. Moreover, households implement alternative strategies in addition to <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> such as holding a second job and to increase the number income earners in the family. The influence of risk and uncertainty on household consumption and saving behaviour is further intensified by the lack of a sufficient social security system, which meets the needs and the demands of society. However, a comprehensive social security reform starting with the introduction of universal health care is being implemented in Turkey. Thus, it is thought that the improvement of the social security system will diminish the significance of the <b>precautionary</b> motive for <b>saving</b> for households.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of {{financial}} intermediation on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> and incentives to invest in a setting where the credit market is subject to informational asymmetry due to moral hazard. We show that <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are the outcome of financial contracts that offer incomplete insurance. However, such a provision of incomplete insurance generates incentives to invest. The magnitude of investment and <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> depend on risk bearing and insurance effects accompanied by financial contracts. The first effect enhances the incentive to invest and the second one has a dampening effect on investment. We also find that in a richer economy the former effect dominates so that incentive to invest is greater and the <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> is smaller. We also make comparison in between three different financial regimes. (a) Financial autarky (b) Full information and (c) informationally constrained financial markets.
