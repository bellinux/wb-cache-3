25|$|The {{procedures}} of {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) {{are part of the}} ISO 14000 environmental management standards: in ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006. (ISO 14044 replaced earlier versions of ISO 14041 to ISO 14043.)

25|$|Determining {{the balance}} of how the several effects of reuse {{interact}} is often best accomplished by a formal life cycle assessment. For example, {{research has shown that}} reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete <b>product</b> <b>life</b> cycle. A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.|$|E
25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial <b>product</b> <b>life</b> cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E

25|$|When {{the patient}} is {{unsatisfied}} with {{the outcome of the}} augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited <b>product</b> <b>life,</b> it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. Common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, capsular contracture, shell rupture, and device deflation. Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the anatomical borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external radiation therapy. Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, breast cancer patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient’s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0 per cent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
500|$|E.T. {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} most {{important}} titles in the industry's history. As early as January 1983, after Atari admitted that the game had sold poorly, an industry executive said that [...] "the lesson of E.T. has not been lost on the industry". Infamously, the game is also cited to be one of the main causes of the video game industry crisis of 1983. Billboard magazine Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T. games along with an increase in competition prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers. By the end of 1982, Atari had begun to lose dominance as more competitors entered the market. Poor critical reception and lack of a profitable marketing strategy made this game one of many cited decisions that led Atari to report a $536 million loss in 1983 and led to the company being divided and sold in 1984. GameSpy's Classic Gaming called E.T. Atari's biggest mistake, as well as the largest financial failure in the industry. Reiley commented that the game's poor quality was responsible for ending the <b>product</b> <b>life</b> of the Atari 2600. Occurring soon after Pac-Mans negative critical response on the Atari 2600, E.T.s poor reception was attributed by Kent to a negative impact on Atari's reputation and profitability. Authors Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost echoed similar comments about Pac-Man and E.T.s combined effect on the company's reputation and the industry's reaction. Buchanan also cited the game as a factor to Atari and the industry's crash. He stated that the large amount of unsold merchandise was a financial burden to Atari, which pushed the company into debt.|$|E

The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets/slots.

2500|$|In the European context, safety {{effectiveness}} and quality is ensured through the [...] "Conformity Assessment" [...] that {{is defined as}} [...] "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies {{with the requirements of}} the European Medical Device Directive". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the technical file and the quality system deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients {{for the use of the}} device. The technical file contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure.
