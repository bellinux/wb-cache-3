40|$|In Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) the {{correspondence}} problem, specifically detecting cycles, {{is one of}} the most difficult challenges for an autonomous mobile robot. In this paper we show how significant cycles in a topological map can be identified with a companion absolute global metric map. A tight coupling of the basic unit of representation in the two maps is the key to the method. Each local space visited is represented, with its own frame of reference, as a node in the topological map. In the global absolute metric map these local space representations from the topological map are described within a single global frame of reference. The method exploits the overlap which occurs when duplicate representations are computed from different vantage points for the same local space. The representations need not be exactly aligned and can thus tolerate a limited amount of accumulated error. We show how false <b>positive</b> <b>overlaps</b> which are the result of a misaligned map, can be discounted. ...|$|R

If at the same time community noise levels would increase due to the use of Krueger leading edge devices the effort to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft would be partly contradicted. In view of the above initial noise measurements on a 3 -dimensional semi-span wind tunnel model were conducted in order to (i) characterize the noise generated by a Krueger device and (ii) to compare the airframe noise contribution of a Krueger device with a conventional slat under similar aerodynamic conditions. Two different Krueger designs were noise tested in the anechoic open test section of DNW’s low speed wind tunnel Braunschweig. The so called reference Krueger flap has a short chord, a steep deployment angle and a negative overlap while the configuration named optimized Krueger features a long chord, a shallower deployment angle and a <b>positive</b> <b>overlap</b> of the Krueger trailing edge over the wing leading edge. The aerodynamic and acoustic study reveale, that Krueger noise compares well to slat noise in terms of maximum noise levels and spectral shape. Furthermore Krueger generated noise dominates the high lift system related airframe noise component. This first outcome of this DLR-internal study demands first of all strong efforts to minimize Krueger noise right from the beginning. Second, it was demonstrated that a long chord Krueger with <b>positive</b> <b>overlap</b> and moderate deflection angle serves provides a significant up to 5 dB noise reductions compared to the reference Krueger and the conventional slat...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAssuming two <b>positive</b> <b>overlapping</b> signals, {{with known}} shapes, the {{proposed}} method estimates the distances between their mean positions, width and area ratios. The data are two profiles representing the component shapes: no parametric model is assumed. The algorithm seeks shape equality between a linear combination of observation and first component, {{and the second}} component, in function of the area ratio. At the minimum shape difference the three parameters (distance between components, scaling factor and area ratio) are estimated. After theory, simulations are presented on Gaussian signals. Then, the method was applied on ECG signals from BSPM device during exercise on healthy people. The aim is mainly to get time distance between each T-wave and the P-wave of the following beat, on a given lead, in case of overlapping. Shape and width of the T-wave were shown to be constant before P-wave interference, which allowed taking such a real T-wave as first component model. Assumption of the same shape for the second component gave good results, as can be viewed on the reconstructed signals...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in quantum information {{is to explore}} the roles of different quantum correlations in a quantum information procedure. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett., 107 (2011) 080401] shows that the protocol for assisted optimal state discrimination (AOSD) may be implemented successfully without entanglement, but with another correlation, quantum dissonance. However, both the original work and the extension to discrimination of d states [Phys. Rev. A, 85 (2012) 022328] have only proved that entanglement can be absent in the case with equal a priori probabilities. By improving the protocol in [Sci.

40|$|The {{presence}} of chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBPs) {{in drinking water}} is a public health issue, due to their possible adverse health effects on humans. To gauge the risk of chlorinated DBPs on human health, a risk assessment of chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), bromoform (TBM), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) in drinking water was carried out using probabilistic techniques. Literature data on exposure concentrations from more than 15 different countries and adverse health effects on test animals as well as human epidemiological studies were used. The risk assessment showed no overlap between the highest human exposure dose (EXPD) and the lowest human equivalent dose (HED) from animal test data, for TCM, BDCM, DBCM, TBM, DCAA and TCAA. All the HED values were approximately 104 to 105 {{times higher than the}} 95 th percentiles of EXPD. However, from the human epidemiology data, there was a <b>positive</b> <b>overlap</b> between the highest EXPD and the lifetime average daily doses (LADDH) for TCM, BDCM, DCAA and TCAA. This suggests that there are possible adverse health risks such as a small increased incidence of cancers in males and developmental effects on infants.

40|$|Conjugates of {{fatty acids}} and amines, {{including}} endocannabinoids, {{are known to}} play important roles as endogenous signaling molecules. Among these, the ethanolamine conjugate of the n- 3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong anti-inflammatory properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA- 5 -HT), in intestinal tissues and showed that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n- 3 PUFAs. However, its biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA- 5 -HT possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL- 23 -IL- 17 signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA- 5 -HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD 4 + Th 17 response. Hence, levels of PGE 2, IL- 6, IL- 1 β, and IL- 23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th 17 cells in a concerted way, {{were found to be}} significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100 – 500 nM DHA- 5 -HT. Furthermore, DHA- 5 -HT inhibited the ability of RAW 264. 7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP- 1, CCL- 20, and gene-expression of CCL- 22 and of several metalloproteinases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested negative overlap with gene sets linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and <b>positive</b> <b>overlap</b> with gene sets related to the Nrf 2 pathway. The specific formation of DHA- 5 -HT in the gut, combined with increasing data underlining the importance of the IL- 23 -IL- 17 signaling pathway in the etiology of many chronic inflammatory diseases merits further investigation into its potential as therapeutic compound in e. g.

Using the FPC (FingerPrinted Contig) software, the contigs are assembled with markers and complete digest fingerprints, and the contigs are ordered and localised by a global framework. Publicly available resources have been used, such as, the 1998 International Gene Map for the framework and the GSC Human BAC fingerprint database {{for the majority}} of the fingerprints. Additional markers and fingerprints are generated in-house to supplement this data.

Patients with Sjogren's/lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and mothers of infants with the neonatal lupus syndrome characteristically have autoantibodies to Ro(SS-A), and in many cases, La(SS-B) antigens.

Two <b>positive</b> <b>overlapping</b> lambda clones were sequenced. The S-complex operon, 5 kilobases in size, was shown to contain four open reading frames and three putative promoters, which are located upstream of the first, the third, and the last gene.

All of these proteins were recognized by antisera separately raised against each protein of the S. aureus membrane-bound ribosome protein and B. subtilis S complexes, thus verifying the S-complex identity of the lambda clones. Sequence analysis revealed that all four proteins of the B. subtilis S complex are homologous to the four subunits of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).

The challenges of this supervised learning application are significant: 1) noisy and corrupt imagery resulting in high levels of feature uncertainty, 2) features with heavy-tailed, peaked distributions, 3) extremely imbalanced and <b>overlapping</b> <b>positive</b> and negative data sets, and 4) the need to reach high positive classification rates, i. e. to find all potential supernovae, while reducing the burdensome workload of manually examining false positives. High accuracy is achieved via a sign-preserving, shifted log transform applied to features with peaked, heavy-tailed distributions. The imbalanced data problem is handled by oversampling positive examples, selectively sampling misclassified negative examples, and iteratively training multiple SVMs for improved supernova recognition on unseen test data. We present crossvalidation results and demonstrate the impact on a largescale supernova survey that currently uses the SVM decision value to rank-order 600, 000 potential supernovae each night. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a <b>positive</b> theory of <b>overlapping</b> income taxation in a federation of states. Its main motivation {{comes from the}} observation that in the U. S. states income tax rates are {{significantly lower than the}} federal income tax rate. The analysis shows that in a federal system total productivity dispersion between the states determines the federal tax rate. In fact, there exists a positive relation between the level of productivity dispersion and the federal tax rate, even if the income of the decisive voter is above the mean income. When the individuals' income is endogenous, the higher the implemented federal tax rate is, the lower the resulting state tax rate will be, even if the decisive voter at the state level has zero pre-tax income. Empirical evidence obtained from a panel data set on tax schedules at the state level supports the main hypothesis of the paper. Fiscal Federalism, Political Economy, Income Taxation. ...|$|R
40|$|Common dielectrophoresis (c-DEP, i. e. {{neutral matter}} motion induced by {{non-uniform}} electric fields) {{has become a}} basic pheno-menon of biochips intended for medical, biological and chemical assays, especially when they imply bioparticle handling. This paper deals with modelling and experimental verification of a castellated, c-DEP-based, microelectrode array intended to handle biological objects. The proposed microsystem was developed employing platinum electrodes patterned by lift-off, silicon micro-machining and photoresin patterning techniques. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used as test bioparticles for experimental verifi-cation. Yeast cells were repelled toward electrode bays and toward interelectrodic gaps tor frequencies around 20 MHz where there is minimum electric field strength, corresponding to a negative dielectrophoretic phenomenon. Yeast cell agglomerations were observed around electrode edges for frequencies of around 2 MHz where there is maximum electric field strength, thereby verifying the positive dielectrophoretic phenomenon. Bioparticles were separated from the electrode edges when the working fre-quency was reduced and they were dragged towards the electrode centre, remaining there while the frequency was low enough. Such atypical pattern may be explained due to the occurrence of <b>positive</b> dielectrophoresis <b>overlap</b> with electrohydrodynamic effects (i. e. the viscous drag force acting on the particles was greater than the dielectrophoretic force at frequencies where positi-ve dielectrophoresis should occur). The experiments illustrated microsystem convenience in microhandling biological objects, the-reby providing these microarrays’ possible use with other cells. Liquid motion resulting from electrohydrodynamic effects {{must also be taken}} into account when designing bioparticle micromanipulators, and {{could be used as a}} mechanism for cleaning electrode surfaces...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A new dual fuel Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) combustion concept was proposed and researched for lower exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The concept takes {{the advantage of the}} complementary physical and chemical properties of high octane number gasoline and high cetane number Di-Methyl Ether (DME) to organize the combustion process. Homogeneous gasoline/air mixture is utilized as the main combustible charge, which is realised by a low-cost Port Fuel Injection (PFI) system. Pressurised DME is directly injected into cylinder via a commercial Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) injector. Flexible DME injection strategies are employed to realise the controlled auto ignition of the premixed charge. The engine is operated at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) in the entire operating region in order to minimize the intake pumping loss. Engine load is controlled by varing the amount of internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (iEGR) which is achieved and adjusted by <b>Positive</b> Valve <b>Overlap</b> (PVO) and/or exhaust back pressure, and exhaust rebreathing method. The premixed mixture can be of either stoichiometric air/fuel ratio or fuel lean mixture and is heated and diluted by recycled exhaust gases. The use of internal EGR is considered as a very effective method to initiate CAI combustion due to its heating effect and moderation of the heat release rate by its dilution effect. In addition, the new combustion concept is compared to conventional SI combustion. The results indicate that the new combustion concept has potential for high efficiency, low emissions, enlargement of the engine operational region and flexible control of CAI combustion...|$|R
