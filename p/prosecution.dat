5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown <b>Prosecution</b> Service (CPS) to proceed with a <b>prosecution</b> or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced {{that there would be}} no <b>prosecution</b> because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for <b>prosecution</b> because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective <b>prosecution</b> claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective <b>prosecution</b> based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prosecution</b> {{argued that}} {{pressure}} to fill fund raising quotas {{had led to}} 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented {{the case that the}} <b>prosecution</b> was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the <b>prosecution</b> was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Burton himself {{alleged that}} Roosevelt had orchestrated his <b>prosecution</b> in March 23, 1907 speech in Abilene, Kansas {{after his release}} from prison.

40|$|Human rights <b>prosecutions</b> {{have been}} the major policy {{innovation}} of {{the late twentieth century}} designed to address human rights violations. The main justification for such <b>prosecutions</b> is that sanctions are necessary to deter future violations. In this article, we use our new data set on domestic and international human rights <b>prosecutions</b> in 100 transitional countries to explore whether prosecuting human rights violations can decrease repression. We find that human rights <b>prosecutions</b> after transition lead to improvements in human rights protection, and that human rights <b>prosecutions</b> have a deterrence impact beyond the confines of the single country. We also explore the mechanisms through which <b>prosecutions</b> lead to improvements in human rights. We argue that impact of <b>prosecutions</b> is the result of both normative pressures and material punishment and provide support for this argument with a comparison of the impact of <b>prosecutions</b> and truth commissions, which do not involve material punishment.

5|$|Prosecutor John McGohey did not {{assert that}} the {{defendants}} had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. The <b>prosecution</b> called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz. The <b>prosecution</b> witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin. Belknap (1994), p 209. The <b>prosecution</b> argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted.

5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a <b>prosecution</b> to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a <b>prosecution</b> is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A <b>prosecution</b> {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E

Coercive contract enforcement was applied in industrial Britain; restricted mobility allowed workers to commit to risk-sharing contracts with lower, but less volatile, wages. ...|$|R
