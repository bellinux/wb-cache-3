40|$|We {{define a}} new model of {{communication}} complexity, called the garden-hose model. Informally, the garden-hose complexity of a function f: { 0, 1 } n × { 0, 1 } n → { 0, 1 } is given by the minimal number of water pipes that need to be shared between two parties, Alice and Bob, {{in order for them to}} compute the function f as follows: Alice connects her ends of the <b>pipes</b> in a <b>way</b> that is determined solely by her input x ∈ { 0, 1 } n and, similarly, Bob connects his ends of the <b>pipes</b> in a <b>way</b> that is determined solely by his input y ∈ { 0, 1 } n. Alice turns on the water tap that she also connected to one of the pipes. Then, the water comes out on Alice’s or Bob’s side depending on the function value f(x, y). We prove almost-linear lower bounds on the garden-hose complexity for concrete functions like inner product, majority, and equality, and we show the existence of functions with exponential gardenhose complexity. Furthermore, we show a connection to classical complexity theory by proving that all functions computable in log-space have polynomial garden-hose complexity. We consider a randomized variant of the garden-hose complexity, where Alice and Bob hold preshared randomness, and a quantum variant, where Alice and Bob hold pre-shared quantum entanglement, and we show that the randomized garden-hose complexity is within a polynomial factor of the deterministic garden-hose complexity. Examples of (partial) functions are given where the quantum garden-hose complexity is logarithmic in n while the classical garden-hose complexity can be lower bounded by n c for constant c> 0. Finally, we show an interesting connection between the garden-hose model and the (in) security of a certain class of quantum position-verification schemes...|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is done with the methods learned in our education, Technical Design at the Luleå University of technology. The project {{took place in the}} town of Katrineholm and with the {{plumbing}} company PCT Systems AB. The method that is being used while cleaning pipes consists of a tool that is rotating by a wire connected to a power drill. When the tool is rotating in the pipe it cleans the inner wall, also known as milling. If the tool is stuck the power drill is twisted and the user loses their grip. With that {{there is a possibility that}} the user gets hurt. If the tool starts to lose momentum there is a risk that the wire is damaged. The result in this thesis is to remove these problems and to improve the usability of a power drill in work. The work was done with a part of the creative process that applies segregation of duties, with main function, part function and support functions. The main function in this thesis is a slip clutch and apart from that there are support functions that will ease the usability of the slip clutch.

40|$|Summary: This work {{is focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of the performance of a small-scale inflatable, or plug, placed in a confined space provided by a circular rigid <b>pipe</b> as a <b>way</b> to contain the propagation of floods. The rigid pipe is a simplified and scaled approximation of an actual tunnel section. The evaluations were conducted using an inflatable plug made of a single layer of coated Vectran ® fabric. Friction coefficients of the system were calculated for three different materials lining the pipe so a comparison could be made. These friction coefficients were also compared to laboratory friction machine testing of the same lining materials. This comparison showed that the friction coefficients of the pipe-plug system were lower than the laboratory friction machine tests. Rates of water leakage around the plug were also studied. The leakage rates were recorded for several different plug pressures while varying the tunnel pressure accordingly. It was observed that as pressure differential decreased between the plug and pipe, the leakage rate increased. Results showed also that the plug was able to withstand a pressure differential with manageable water leakage rates...|$|R

A pipeline network is generally established either to transmit gas at high pressure from coastal supplies to regional demand points (transmission network) or to distribute gas to consumers at low pressure from the regional demand points (distribution network).

In particular, the decision variables include the length of the pipes’ diameter, pressure drops at each node of the network, and mass flow rate at each pipeline leg.
