25|$|A {{number of}} fictional and semi-biographical {{accounts}} of Every {{were published in}} the decades following his disappearance. In 1709, the first such account appeared as a sixteen-page pamphlet entitled The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery; the Famous English Pirate, Now in Possession of Madagascar (London: J. Baker, 1709). It was written by an anonymous author using the pseudonym Adrian van Broeck, who claimed to be a Dutchman who endured captivity by Every's crew. In the account, Every is depicted as both a treacherous pirate and a romantic lover; after he raids the Mughal's ship, he runs off with—and later marries—the Emperor's daughter. The couple then flee the Mughal's army to Saint Mary's Island, where Every sets up a pirate utopia similar to the fictional <b>pirate</b> <b>state</b> of Libertalia. Every even has several children with the princess and establishes a new monarchy. The King of Madagascar soon commands an army of 15,000 pirates and a fleet of forty warships, and is said to be living in fantastic luxury in an impregnable fortress beyond the reach of his English and Mughal adversaries. Furthermore, Every mints his own currency: gold coins engraved in his royal likeness.|$|E

With Kenway's help, they seize control of Nassau and {{establish}} a pirate republic. However, poor governance, a lack of an economy and an outbreak of disease bring the <b>pirate</b> <b>state</b> perilously close to collapse, with the founders divided on the best way forward. Kenway attempts to resolve the dispute, but is too late to stop the Templars from exploiting the situation for their own ends.|$|E
50|$|Anthony Janszoon van Salee (1607-1676) {{was the son}} of Jan Janszoon, a Dutch pirate who led the Republic of Salé, a <b>pirate</b> <b>state</b> {{in modern}} Morocco. He was an {{original}} settler of and prominent landholder, merchant, and creditor in New Netherlands. Van Salee may have been the first Muslim in the New World. A Qur'an said to have belonged to him was eventually auctioned in the following centuries, having passed through a descendant, Robert Bayles, a one-time President of The Market and Fulton National Bank of New York.|$|E

50|$|Armada {{is made up}} of {{hundreds}} of ships, airships and other sea vessels all interconnected, existing as a movable <b>pirate</b> <b>state</b> on the oceans of Bas-Lag. The ships, the oldest having been part of Armada for more than a thousand years, are mostly built-upon, factories and residences built up on their decks (and in some cases, within their gutted hulls). The city's population is at least a hundred thousand, and {{is made up of}} humans, cactacae, khepri, ab-dead, Remade, scabmettlers and many other races. People considered criminals (or otherwise being of lower classes) in their former home states of Bas-Lag are recast as equals upon joining Armada, and often go on to hold positions of power.|$|E
50|$|Retribution {{for this}} latest {{action by the}} Tripoli pirates came swiftly and dramatically. Lt. Stephen Decatur, Jr., boarded and {{destroyed}} Philadelphia where she lay in Tripoli harbor on 16 February 1804, and Commodore Preble later followed this up with five heavy bombardments of the <b>pirate</b> <b>state</b> on the 3, 7, 24, and 29 August, and on 3 September. Vixen participated in all these actions, and performed tactical service by helping to coordinate {{the movements of the}} various American vessels. She was rerigged as a brig in September 1804, ostensibly to improve her sailing qualities, and was with the squadron, now under Commodore John Rodgers, in actions before Tunis in August 1805. The warship returned to the United States one year later in August 1806.|$|E
50|$|After the First Barbary War (1801 - 1805), the U.S. {{found its}} {{attention}} diverted to its worsening relationship with Great Britain over trade with France, which {{culminated in the}} War of 1812.

50|$|In 1820 the <b>pirate</b> <b>states</b> {{signed a}} treaty that {{effectively}} eliminated {{them as a}} threat to British shipping. In 1822 Collier returned to Britain, and between 1826 and 1830 he was the commodore in command of the West African Station. He raised his pennant in Sybille; during the time she was engaged in anti-slavery duties off West Africa, Sybille captured numerous slavers and freed some 3,500 slaves.|$|R
5000|$|Graeme {{wishes to}} start a pirate bank, a pirate bus service, and a pirate Church of England, all outside Britain's 5 mile (9.3 km) limit, as well as having also planned a fiendish scheme to tow the whole of Britain outside the 5 mile limit and become leader of a <b>pirate</b> <b>state,</b> but his plan is ruined when Tim and Bill [...] - [...] having finally had enough [...] - [...] leave him to it. Unfortunately, Graeme's efforts to tow the whole of Great Britain away single-handedly only cause [...] "The Saucy Gibbon" [...] to sink. Graeme, who is {{standing}} up, begins to 'go down with the boat', and Tim suggests that they leave Graeme to his fate, feeling that Graeme would have wanted it that way. Bill, however, disagrees, saying: [...] "No he bloody wouldn't!", and he and Tim decide to rescue Graeme from the sea.|$|E

50|$|Piracy, {{which is}} a robbery {{committed}} at sea or sometimes on the shore, dates back to Classical Antiquity and, in all likelihood, much further. The Tyrrhenians, Illyrians and Thracians were known as pirates in ancient times. The island of Lemnos long resisted Greek influence and remained a haven for Thracian pirates. By the 1st century BC, there were <b>pirate</b> <b>states</b> along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the United States and European nations stopped their {{practice}} of paying tribute to the <b>pirate</b> <b>states</b> to forestall attacks on their shipping. It helped mark {{the beginning of the end}} of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination (16th-18th centuries). Within decades, European powers built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology.|$|R

Italy became part of the Triple Alliance, upsetting Bismarck's carefully laid plans with the state and forcing Germany to become involved in Africa. In 1882, realizing the geopolitical extent of Portuguese control on the coasts, but seeing penetration by France eastward across Central Africa toward Ethiopia, the Nile, and the Suez Canal, Britain saw its vital trade route through Egypt and its Indian Empire threatened.|$|R

5000|$|WGUN - Mentioned in {{an article}} by Shannon Huniwell in Popular Communications magazine, this was a {{short-lived}} pirate station in the Lynchburg, Virginia area that broadcast on channel 45 during the late 1970s. The sole broadcast consisted of a water pistol with [...] "WGUN 45 TV" [...] in cut out letters mounted on a phonograph turntable with audio from [...] "an unmercifully scratchy Baja Marimba Band album". The station was located by radio station technicians after being informed by {{the mother of a}} young viewer who found the station while tuning the UHF TV band. When asked, the young unnamed <b>pirate</b> <b>stated</b> he purchased the transmitter, an EMC Model TXRU-100 UHF transmitter, at a rummage sale from a church that had intended to start a UHF-TV station. Upon being informed that his broadcasts were illegal, the station was shut down. The transmitter was reportedly re-sold at a yard sale.|$|R
50|$|The Mediterranean pass (or Mediterranean passport, {{the name}} {{used in the}} United States) was a {{document}} which identified a ship as being protected under a treaty with states of the Barbary Coast.

25|$|In the 3rd century BC, pirate {{attacks on}} Olympos (city in Anatolia) brought impoverishment. Among {{some of the}} most famous ancient pirateering peoples were the Illyrians, a people populating the western Balkan peninsula. Constantly raiding the Adriatic Sea, the Illyrians caused many {{conflicts}} with the Roman Republic. It was not until 229 BC when the Romans finally decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended. During the 1st century BC, there were <b>pirate</b> <b>states</b> along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. On one voyage across the Aegean Sea in 75BC, Julius Caesar was kidnapped and briefly held by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. The Senate finally invested the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with powers to deal with piracy in 67BC (the Lex Gabinia), and Pompey, after three months of naval warfare, managed to suppress the threat.|$|R
