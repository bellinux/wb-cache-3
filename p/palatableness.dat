We can mix sugar with anything we like, whether it had sugar in it to begin with or otherwise; and by sweetening and flavouring we can give a false <b>palatableness</b> to even the worst and most indigestible rubbish, such as plaster-of-Paris, largely sold {{under the name of}} sugared almonds to the ingenuous youth of two hemispheres. But in untouched nature the test rarely or never fails. As long as fruits are unripe and unfit for human food, they are green and sour; as soon as they ripen they become soft and sweet, and usually acquire some bright colour as a sort of advertisement of their edibility. In the main, bar the accidents of civilisation, whatever is sweet is good to eat--nay more, is meant to be eaten; it is only our own perverse folly that makes us sometimes think all nice things bad for us, and all wholesome things nasty. In a state of nature, the exact opposite is really the case. One may observe, too, that children, who are literally young savages in more senses than one, stand nearer to the primitive feeling in this respect than grown-up people. They unaffectedly like sweets; adults, who have grown more accustomed to the artificial meat diet, don't, as a rule, care much for puddings, cakes, and made dishes. (May I venture parenthetically to add, any appearance to the contrary notwithstanding, that I am not a vegetarian, and that I am far from desiring to bring down upon my devoted head the imprecation pronounced against the rash person who would rob a poor man of his beer. It is quite possible to believe that vegetarianism was the starting point of the race, without wishing to consider it also as the goal; just as it is quite possible to regard clothes as purely artificial products of civilisation, without desiring personally to return to the charming simplicity of the Garden of Eden.) ...|$|E

Many of these foods have been prepared in an excellent manner, placed in clean boxes and are attractive to the consumer. The breakfast foods are regarded by many as a very expensive form of food material, while others, considering the <b>palatableness</b> of these preparations and the amount of milk and sugar consumed as part of the meal say that they are economical when everything is considered...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{medications}} for hyperlipidemia management have been continuously searched for above all because currently employed drugs appear {{not to be}} effective or are poorly tolerated. Fibers, such as guar-gum, {{seem to be able}} to reduce cholesterol levels, but their extensive and long-term use is beset by the high incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects. In this study the administration of guar-enriched pasta has proved to reduce fasting and post-prandial cholesterol levels significantly in 15 obese normocholesterolemic women (5 diabetics and 10 non-diabetics). The women reported good <b>palatableness</b> of guar-pasta without any side-effects...|$|E

We study application of discovery of the knowledge that is new from many history data to the base in this recommendation technology and the development of the new product and the marketing support. We repeat recommendation {{to be able to get}} closer to user’s needs for behavior of user each from the ubiquitous systems by the analysis of the acquisition data of the ubiquitous systems. Thereby the potential taste and the user's "notice" are provided...|$|E
40|$|In {{the third}} annual report of this Station (1892) {{the result of}} feeding wide and narrow nutritive rations to horses was given. This trial was {{favorable}} to the narrow nutritive ration. This ration {{was made up of}} clover, oats and wheat 2 ̆ 2, while the wide ration was made up of timothy and corn. The trial ran through the summer, when the influence of what has been termed heating food, like corn, might be less effective than in the winter season. Many believe that the more varieties of food given the better the result, as the <b>palatableness</b> of food, it is claimed, has a reflex influence on the appetite and digestive system. The weight to be attached to such reasoning is uncertain. The influence of season on the ration to be fed is less doubtful...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the circumstances in and around the principal appraisal process in five New Zealand primary schools. An outcome of this investigation was to generate a theoretical explanation of what was happening in this appraisal process. Data were gathered from five principals and their appraisers through a questionnaire and an interview. Through a constant comparative analysis of the data, a basic social process was discovered that consisted of four conceptual categories labelled as metamorphosis, metamorphic reaction, adaptation and <b>palatableness.</b> These categories were linked into a core category labelled fluxion and abatement. Fluxion and abatement is a conceptual statement of a continually changing appraisal process that has been grappled with and abated in a meaningful way by the appraisal participants. That no school site, of principal appraisal development and implementation, closely resembles another, is testimony of the fluxion and abatement theory. That schools are still talking of adaptation to the latest metamorphosis of professional standards and that a <b>palatableness</b> state is some time, even years, away, strengthens the theory produced in this study. These findings have important implications for a number of areas of school operation. The first is leadership. Will the school site strengthen or move away from a collaborative model of leadership? The study argues for a supportive board of trustees to the principal, who should engender a transformational leadership style. These collaborative approaches will see schools as educative communities rather than managed organisations. The second implication is in teaching and learning. Principals, working with their staff, need to have refined the meaningful data on what is happening in teaching and learning within their schools. The third implication is the principal appraisal process. This process should be used as a purposeful tool to achieve and produce evidence of the other stated implications. The last implication, school effectiveness, is the prospective outcome of such a principal appraisal process...|$|E
40|$|The Czech fishery {{analysis}}, SWOT {{analysis of}} processing fish {{department and the}} fish commodities sale marketing survey {{of the most important}} firms were done. Next the consumer marketing survey was done by means of printed questionnaire. 110 informants were spoken and men and women at working age with family were destined as a target group in the Vysočina region. Calculation, co called ratio coefficient of differentiation (P= 4 s 2 /R 2), was done, which showed, that informants used by determining of meat kind popularity by fish meat of whole answers scale (P= 0, 33) and by determining of importance of product characteristic the freshness had minimum answers differentiation (P= 0, 009), which 98 % of informants marked as very important. By next questions informants evaluated importance of individual quality attributes by means of 4 point scale (1 -very important, 2 -rather important, 3 -rather uninportant, 4 - unimportant). The questions of this type were interpreted by means of weighted arithmetic average (x), and so their importance rate was detected. The freshness (x= 1, 02) and the <b>palatableness</b> (x= 1, 34) were marked as 2 the most important product characteristic and as at least important characteristic the ease of food preperation (x= 2, 23) and the size of package. The consumer awareness about positive influence over human health was marked as the most acceptable promotion of fish commodities (x= 1, 44) and the TV advertising (x= 1, 45) and the programmes about cooking (x= 1, 57) were marked as the best promotion. Next questions evaluation was done by means of percentage share and absolute, cumulate and relative frequencies...|$|E
