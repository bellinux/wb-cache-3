5|$|The {{extent of}} the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy <b>prevalence</b> <b>rates</b> are {{significantly}} lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia, due to {{a high proportion of}} the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of honeybee stings. One in three million annually die of general anaphalaxis in Australia alone. Over 90% of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by the jack jumper.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed <b>prevalence</b> <b>rates</b> are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics.

Among men, the age-adjusted <b>prevalence</b> <b>rate</b> ratio of less-than-good perceived general health by social class decreased from 1. 32 to 1. 23 between 1987 and 1995 / 97; however, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>rate</b> ratio by educational level increased from 1. 47 to 1. 57.

RESULTS: We identified 75 studies that estimated the HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>rate</b> among female sex workers. Most of the studies employed convenience samples. The sample size was not adequate to estimate HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>rate</b> in 35 studies. DISCUSSION: The use of convenience sample limits statistical inference for the whole group.
