5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

Promoter methylation of PGC-1α and PDK4 were immediately reduced after high intensity exercise, whereas PPAR-γ methylation was not reduced until three hours after exercise. By contrast, six months of exercise in previously sedentary middle-age men resulted in increased methylation in adipose tissue.

25|$|The Mayo Clinic has {{suggested}} seven steps: stay mentally active, socialize regularly, get organized, eat a healthy diet, include <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> your daily routine, and manage chronic conditions.

These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions on eating and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E

500|$|A {{sedentary}} lifestyle plays {{a significant role}} in obesity. Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work, and currently at least 30% of the world's population gets insufficient exercise. This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of labor-saving technology in the home. [...] In children, there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity due to less walking and physical education. World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear. The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits, while a study from Finland found an increase and a study from the United States found leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly.

40|$|Regular {{implementation}} of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> {{has a positive}} effect on our health, on both social and emotional area of operation as well as learning since it supports the learning and thinking processes. In the master’s thesis we focused on the {{implementation of}} <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> teaching in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, attended by children with mild mental disabilities. These children face difficulties in the field of motoric development therefore it is of great importance to promote and implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>In</b> doing so the teacher can help developing the student’s cognitive, emotional and social fields along with the motoric skills. In some cases the implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> the teaching process depends on the teacher’s beliefs on the importance of being physically active. Therefore we examined the teachers’ beliefs on the importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> both <b>in</b> everyday life and teaching children in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, to what measure and in what way do they implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> when teaching children with mild mental disabilities; and what effects they have noticed with their pupils. 97 teachers who teach in the adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard took part in our research. The research data was acquired through a questionnaire. The results have shown that most teachers have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their implementation in the teaching process. The majority of teachers often and in diverse ways include <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> while teaching. They also implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at different school subjects, {{in all parts of the}} lessons and at almost all stages of the learning process. There are however some differences in the frequency of implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> between teachers who teach in the first, second or the third educational cycle. Furthermore the frequency of implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> is different with teachers who teach in homogenous or multi-grade classes. The teachers have indicated positive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on the students’ motoric, emotional, cognitive and social areas of operation. Most teachers do not have any problems with the implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> their teaching process although some report problems with the children’s behaviour (some students become more difficult to calm down or too lively and thus unpredictable situations arise more quickly), some face time or space constraints or problems connected to teaching in multi-grade classes. The results have shown that teachers who teach in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their use in teaching. They often implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> their teaching process and they have indicated positive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on their students...|$|R
