5|$|Onneca {{was thus}} the <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother</b> of Abd-ar-Rahman III, who {{inherited}} from her {{as well as from}} his mother Muzna hailing from the Pyrenees (probably a Basque) European facial features such as blue eyes and light reddish hair that he attempted to alter (notably through hair coloring) in order to look more typically Arab.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother</b> in the latter's residence in Finchley. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a staphylococcal septicaemia. The two then spent a short time {{under the care of}} an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.|$|E

50|$|Other {{studies have}} focused on the genetic {{relationship}} between grandmothers and grandchildren. Such studies have found that the effects of maternal / <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmothers</b> on grandsons / granddaughters may vary based on degree of genetic relatedness, with <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmothers</b> having positive effects on granddaughters but detrimental effects on grandsons, and paternity uncertainty may be less important than chromosome inheritance.|$|R
25|$|Indeed, {{analysis}} of historical data {{found that the}} length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren. Interestingly, another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother—paternal grandmothers had a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty). Differing assistance strategies for maternal and <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmothers</b> have also been demonstrated. Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmothers</b> increase birth rates.|$|R
5|$|During the 2006 election, it {{was brought}} to {{attention}} that Reinfeldt's paternal great-great-grandfather was an African American circus director from New York, John Hood, who had a son with Emma Dorotea Reinfeld, a maid from Eckau in present-day Latvia. Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson, but her illegitimate son John kept his mother's surname. The spelling was later changed to Reinfeldt. He also has Italian ancestry, via his <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later Clann Cholmáin kings were {{descended from}} Flann, as was Congalach Cnogba, whose {{official}} pedigree pronounced {{him to be}} a member of the Síl nÁedo Sláine, the first of that branch of the Uí Néill to become King of Tara in two centuries, and whose last agnatic ancestor to have ruled from Tara was the eponymous Áed Sláine, ten generations before. Congalach was closely tied to Clann Cholmáin. His mother was Flann's daughter Lígach, and his <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother</b> Eithne had been Flann's wife.|$|E

After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi.

Through his father, Edward, the Black Prince, {{he was a member}} of the House of Plantagenet and the second, but eldest surviving grandson of the reigning English monarch, Edward III. Edward was related to the reigning French royal House of Valois through his <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother,</b> Philippa of Hainault.

5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother,</b> Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower {{was raised}} amidst great wealth. Her <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother,</b> the great heiress Elizabeth Gordon, was suo jure Countess of Sutherland, {{overseeing}} estates that spanned 800,000 to one {{million acres of}} Scottish Highlands.

On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette {{was struck}} by a cannonball while fighting a British-led coalition at the Battle of Minden in Westphalia.

She {{was said to have}} been born prematurely and was the only {{legitimate}} child of James to survive him. She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother,</b> Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scots when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss, or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her <b>paternal</b> <b>grandmother.</b> She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
