25|$|The {{privatization}} program, {{which had}} been started already in 1990, was initially criticized by the newly elected parliamentary majority, but soon continued. In a chaotic process, the laws governing privatization were reviewed and changed constantly, but still had loopholes in them that allowed well-connected individuals and financial groups to assume control of government property at fire-sale prices. The second stage of privatization started in July 1995 with Seimas adopting the new Law on Privatization of Government and Municipal Property. The new law attempted to eliminate many of the weaknesses in the <b>privatization</b> <b>process</b> – assets could now be sold only for cash, discounts for employees were eliminated and equal participation rights were granted to local and foreign investors. However, the new law {{did not meet the}} expectations and the <b>privatization</b> <b>process</b> remained inefficient and prone to corruption.|$|E

Two arguments are advanced. First, it is shown how the complex class analytic contradictions that municipal <b>privatization</b> <b>processes</b> give rise to may work to: undermine private sector rates of accumulation, and stimulate non-capitalist class processes. While the former finding necessarily casts a long shadow over the mainstream privatization discourse 2 ̆ 7 s central efficiency/cost propositions, the latter finding highlights the limitations of the discourse 2 ̆ 7 s hegemonic association that weds <b>privatization</b> <b>processes</b> to 2 ̆ 2 capitalism. 2 ̆ 2 Building upon the latter finding, the final chapter advances an argument that centers on the class transformative opportunities <b>privatization</b> <b>processes</b> [...] -both in the municipal and global contexts [...] -might afford. Such opportunities open up immense theoretical and policy space for radically reconsidering and rethinking <b>privatization</b> <b>processes.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>privatization</b> <b>process</b> {{that started}} in 2000 with a public {{offering}} of the four generation companies was complicated due both to legal problems and to lack of interest by investors. As a result, ENEL maintained a more relevant role than initially expected.

25|$|The <b>Privatization</b> <b>process</b> in Pakistan (sometimes {{referred}} to as Denationalization programme or simply the Privatization in Pakistan) was a policy measure programme in the economic period of Pakistan. It was first conceived and implemented by the then-people-elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Muslim League, {{in an attempt to}} enable the nationalized industries towards market economy, immediately after the economic collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989–90. The program was envisaged and visioned to improve the GDP growth of the national economy of Pakistan, and reversal of the nationalization programme in 1970s— an inverse of the privatization programme.|$|E
25|$|When the Conservatives {{replaced}} the Liberals {{in power in}} 1984, they began to reverse the nationalization process. In 1991, they passed legislation allowing privatization and began selling shares to the public. The Liberals returned to power in 1993, but had lost interest in having a national oil company, and continued the <b>privatization</b> <b>process.</b> In 1995 the federal government reduced its interest to 20 percent, and in 2004 sold the remaining shares. Petro-Canada has done better since privatization because oil price increases since 2003 make its high-cost production profitable, and consolidation of its refining operations to fewer but larger refineries reduced its downstream costs even as prices increased.|$|E

According to ProInversión, the <b>privatization</b> <b>process</b> in the minerals sector and FDI in every sector of the Peruvian economy, particularly in the banking and energy industries are expected to continue to generate additional investments. Higher demand for copper, gold, iron ore, and silver and high metal prices are likely to encourage mining companies to invest in expanding and modernizing their operations.

40|$|Regarding the {{effectiveness}} of privatization, two schools of thought are distinguished: a school in favor of privatization in general and a school that judges the success of privatization {{to be dependent on}} the institutional context. This article discusses the arguments of both schools and presents a case study on the <b>privatization</b> <b>processes</b> that did take place in Kosovo. The Kosovo case is a critical case as Kosovo was a post-conflict country with a deplorable institutional setting at the time it initiated the <b>privatization</b> <b>processes.</b> If <b>privatization</b> was successful anyway, this would make for a strong argument in favor of privatization in general. The outcomes of the case study show, however, many unintended and negative effects of privatization in the Kosovo context. The conclusion, therefore, disputes the claim that privatization is beneficial in general, irrespective of the institutional setting. Instead, the article makes a plea for creating a favorable institutional setting before starting far-reaching transformations through large-scale privatization. The issues arising from this article are important for policy-makers and international missions considering implementing similar programs to other post-conflict countries...|$|R
