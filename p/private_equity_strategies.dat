I study the pre- and post-buyout operational improvement of the companies via growth and profitability improvement. I find that sales growth is the main determinant of operational improvement. Somewhat contrasted with the literature, EBIT-% development during the first two years is negative, likely due to non-recurring integration costs of add-on acquisitions or frontloading of capital and operational expenditure required for growth. There is a small and possibly significant post-buyout rebound effect of EBIT margin deterioration for companies that had high pre-buyout EBIT margin improvement, possibly due to unsustainable EBIT enhancement before selling the company. I also find indicative support for the merger waves theory, in that EBIT margin improvements is especially high for companies acquired during high M&A activity years.

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} This thesis {{examines}} how <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> investors employ management control systems in strategy implementation during their ownership of buyout targets. <b>Private</b> <b>equity</b> investments differ from industrial acquisitions in {{that they have a}} predefined lifespan, an intention and even a schedule to be sold further. <b>Private</b> <b>equity</b> funds also tend to have more complex governance structures. However, management control systems in <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> investing have gained scarce attention among academic research. Notably, {{there is a lack of}} longitudinal single case studies sensitive to actual context of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> and its contingent factors. The research illustrates the lifespan of a cleantech fund and uses Simons' (1995) Levers of Control framework to analyze, how <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> investor implemented <b>strategy</b> into the target companies by using management control systems. Distinctive motivation behind this research is the expansion of scope from governance of a single buyout company to a wider <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> context. This scope is sensitive to factors that potentially influenced management control systems beyond the boundaries of a single target company. Method and framework The research adopts a longitudinal, retrospective single case approach together with an exceptional method of systematic combining. Systematic combining differs from traditional linear approach by its non-linear, continuous back and forth integration of theory and empirical observations in order to match theory and reality. It is appropriate for research on subjects that have slight body of existing research. Expansion of research scope in aforementioned way raised the need to integrate additional and relevant theoretical insights into the framework. Consequently, literature reviews on <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> and management control systems were complemented with theoretical concepts that shed light on entrepreneurship, ownership and capabilities. Findings This research generated multiple findings and insights. Generally, management control systems supported alignment of the whole fund with the perceptions and wishes of the original investors. The examined fund management implemented management control systems and especially interactive controls in remarkably various ways for a growth business. The case demonstrates how management control systems were not designed and used in isolation from factors such as ownership, parent organization and capabilities. Parent company and its customers as potential investors were taken into account in early formulation of beliefs and boundary systems. Furthermore, the fund had a distinct investment "philosophy" with indirect implications for diagnostic and interactive control systems. <b>Private</b> <b>equity</b> buyout research also has a tendency of limiting scope to single organizations. Such scope limits realization of investor's potential. Notably, this exceptional case illustrates how <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> investor had a comprehensive entrepreneurial plan that defined exploration and orchestration of resources acquired through buyouts...|$|R

40|$|In May 1976, with merely 120, 000 {{and a few}} metal chairs {{left behind}} from a prior tenant, Kolberg Kravis Roberts 2 ̆ 6 Co. (KKR) opened its doors. Though few people outside Wall Street circles knew of this {{start-up}} company, by the 1980 s its reputation as a takeover machine brought it notoriety. One {{can only imagine what}} went on behind closed doors, but whatever happened, it worked. By 1989, KKR had become the largest client of accounting giant Deloitte 2 ̆ 6 Touche, with General Motors following as a close second. The “Age of Leverage” peaked in 1990 when KKR took over RJR Nabisco. Until 2006, this takeover was the largest in history and is still considered one of the largest ever. The deal almost ruined KKR, yet KKR managed to acquire many other companies in the ensuing years. In late February 2007, KKR and other <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> firms announced another record-breaking deal. An investor group led by KKR and Texas Pacific Group (TPG) purchased TXU Corporation, a Texas-based energy company, for an unprecedented 45 billion. GS Capital Partners, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley became equity partners at closing. An official statement explained that the new owners planned to have stronger environmental and climate stewardship policies, to invest in alternative energy, and to focus on the electric consumer market by delivering both price cuts and protection. Although a deal of this volume may seem extraordinary, it {{is only one of the}} many mega-deals in the realm of <b>private</b> <b>equity,</b> which has become a vital engine for investment in our economy. Generally, <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> is any equity investment that is not freely tradable on public stock markets. A trend contributing to the success of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> is a <b>strategy</b> known as “clubbing. ” Clubbing occurs when at least two buyout firms join forces to purchase a company. Buyout firms cite many reasons for clubbing, such as spreading the risk of a single deal or amassing sufficient capital to acquire a huge corporate target. But clubbing can carry negative consequences as well, especially if companies use the practice to inhibit competition. This concern apparently worried the Department of Justice (DOJ), which in October 2006 launched an inquiry into the potentially anticompetitive behavior of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> firms—an inquiry that could unearth antitrust violations. The DOJ is examining the possibility of collusion among <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> firms and is trying to discover attempts by clubs to reduce purchase prices. The inquiry started with a two-page letter sent to several of the largest <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> firms seeking voluntary, general information about club deals since January 2003. Although seemingly straightforward, the inquiry presents many complex issues that cannot be easily resolved. Irrespective of the outcome, the <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> industry is paying attention. <b>Private</b> <b>equity</b> will likely need to change if it wishes to continue assembling mega-deals like the TXU deal. This Note addresses the antitrust issues that clubbing raises and argues that the antitrust laws should not restrict clubbing—absent some egregious conduct—and that courts should apply rule of reason analysis rather than per se rules to these sorts of antitrust claims. Part II provides a general background of antitrust law and the various standards that courts apply to <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> clubs. Part III explains <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> and fleshes out what a club deal is and how it works. Part IV discusses antitrust law within the context of joint ventures and sets out the varying standards that could apply to <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> clubs.

40|$|Global mining {{productivity}} has hit new {{low levels}} {{and has been}} on an estimated 24 % steady decline over the past decade. Productivity decline was rated the number one challenge in the mining sector. In this study we will examine the management operating system's impact on performance and its relevance to <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> turnaround <b>strategies.</b> Through a literature review the following recommendations were identified : addressing the integration gap, embedding effective management operating systems, prioritising operational excellence, and integrating {{the number of participants}} in the mining value chain to improve performance. Following the literature review, three research questions were identified : Does the design and implementation of MOS impact operational performance improvement positively? What is the impact of MOS non-financial performance measures on business performance improvement? Is there a significant difference in EBITDA performance pre and post-MOS implementation? To answer these, the study was divided into two quantitative research phases : An online survey questionnaire to 59 MOS experts with a response of 32, to gain their opinions and comments on nine items; and the analysis of secondary data from four mining operations to examine the pre and post-MOS tonnage, EBITDA performance, and the correlation between tonnage output and direct operating hours. The study found that when comparing tonnage output of the mine pre and post-MOS implementation, tonnage output post-MOS implementation was higher. Furthermore, EBIDTA earnings pre and post-MOS implementation were sustained over the period under coal prices were reported to have dropped by almost forty percent. Moreover, the study found that MOS's strength lies in its ability to improve accountability and behaviours, influencing issues within management control and integrating all levels of the management teams. Ultimately, this improves productivity and performance. The study furthermore suggested that MOS is more relevant to turnaround <b>strategies</b> and <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> firms as a management tool for executing operational strategy, improving productivity and performance improvement, especially as far as underperforming companies were concerned.
