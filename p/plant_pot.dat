500|$|The video later {{shifts to}} a night scene on a {{building}} rooftop, where half of Gaga's body is inside a car, while her legs protrude {{from the window}} and onto the roof of the car. She has blonde hair and wears a black plastic leather outfit. She gets her full body into the car, kissing a [...] "Marry the Night" [...] tape and inserting it into the audio player. The song begins playing as Gaga smokes on the driver's seat. As the chorus begins, vehicles in the background explode aflame and Gaga exits the car and dances. In a new dance studio setting as the second verse begins, Gaga enters with her dancers, and warms up to do an intricate choreography during the chorus with her team. During the bridge, she and her dance team take a break and warm up to perform another choreography. The rooftop car parking scene and a bath scene intersperse. Gaga and her dancers repeat the choreography [...] during the final chorus, as one dancers falls and is helped up by Gaga. During the breakdown, Gaga and her team dance on a street while interspersing scenes show her causing chaos, including falling down the stairs, attempting to get into a car with a ridiculously oversized hat and pouring water over herself with a marble <b>plant</b> <b>pot</b> in the bath. She enters a car and reveals [...] "Interscope Records; Hollywood, CA; 4p.m." [...] written on her palm. The last scene shows Gaga in couture and surrounded by flames. The video ends with Gaga suddenly vanishing.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst {{was born}} Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol {{and grew up}} in Leeds. He never met his father, with his mother marrying his {{stepfather}} when he was 2 and divorcing 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic. Hirst's mother who was from an Irish Catholic background worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker {{to turn it into a}} fruit bowl (or a <b>plant</b> <b>pot).</b> He says, [...] "If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop." [...] She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.|$|E
2500|$|After being a stalwart of chat shows, in {{the mid-1980s}} Monkhouse {{presented}} his own for the BBC, The Bob Monkhouse Show. The show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but {{said that they were}} all heroes of his and that was how he really felt about them. Monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and he used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between [...] "true" [...] chat and analysis of comedy, to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest's stooge as he did with Bob Hope. On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson who, after prior arrangement with the show's producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a <b>plant</b> <b>pot</b> on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof. She then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly [...] "fired" [...] destroying a camera. The gun, launcher and camera were props. None of this was known to Monkhouse who appeared genuinely frightened (although the production crew were aware).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} plant growth on copper {{solubility}} and speciation was studied in a 10 -week pot experiment. A copper-tolerant grass variety (Agrostis capillaris L. var. Parys Mountain) was grown in pots that contained either clean (copper-total approx. 30 mg kg(- 1)) or copper contaminated soil (copper-total approx. 170 mg kg(- 1)) at two pH levels (4. 7 and 5. 5). Also, similar pots without vegeta tion {{were included in}} the study. Due to the addition of NH 4 NO 3 fertilizer and subsequent nitrification of ammonia to nitrate, soil pH decreased from 4. 7 to 3. 5 and from 5. 5 to 4, respectively. In the <b>planted</b> <b>pots,</b> soil pH recovered faster after depletion of NH 4 +. This resulted in a decrease in the calcium solution concentrations and an increase in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the <b>planted</b> <b>pots.</b> However, this was only observed in the clean soil; in the contaminated soil no difference in DOC levels between bare and <b>planted</b> <b>pots</b> was observed. Copper solubility in the contaminated soil was lower in the presence of plants; in the clean soil no differences were observed between the bare and <b>planted</b> <b>pots.</b> In the <b>planted</b> <b>pots,</b> copper activities in solution in both clean and contaminated soils were two orders of magnitude lower than in the bare pots. Copper activities in the non-planted contaminated soil reached potentially toxic levels ([Cu]+/- 10 (- 5) to 10 (- 6) M) in contrast to the lower levels in the <b>planted</b> <b>pots</b> ([Cu]+/- 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 10) M). Data and model results show that plant growth improves pH, DOC and calcium in solution {{to such an extent that}} both the total dissolved copper concentration and the free metal activity in soils can be reduced. This stresses the potential beneficial role of plants for the immobilization and detoxification of metals in contaminated soils. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
