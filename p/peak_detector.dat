It is also called a Cockcroft-Walton multiplier after the particle accelerator machine built by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, who independently discovered the circuit in 1932. The concept in this topology can be extended to a voltage quadrupler circuit by using two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities driven from the same AC source. The output is taken across the two individual outputs. As with a bridge circuit, it is impossible to simultaneously ground the input and output of this circuit.|$|E

We can build a simple and fast <b>peak</b> <b>detector</b> from a serial diode and a shunt capacitor, but it suffers from serious inaccuracy due to the diode's forward-voltage drop. The <b>peak</b> <b>detector</b> monitors a voltage of interest and retains its peak value as its output. The circuit gives a DC output voltage that is the peak input voltage over a wide frequency range, with a very low ripple voltage and low harmonic distortion. In this paper <b>peak</b> <b>detector</b> is used to detect the maximum magnitude of a signal {{over a period of}} time. For high frequency circuits we require to know the peak value of an input voltage waveform to compare it with reference value to improve the accuracy of the circuit. Simple <b>peak</b> <b>detector</b> circuits can miss the peak of sharp-peaked signals, which gives inaccurate value of the peak. These limitations are removed in the high speed peak detection circuit. The proposed solution improves both linearity and accuracy without compromising speed.
