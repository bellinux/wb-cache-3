40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the in-line transmission of fine transparent alumina in visible light the grain growth during sintering of alumina ceramics was supressed using a combined densification process. This process combines <b>presintering</b> of a green body by spark plasma sintering with final hot isostatic pressing. The <b>presintering</b> by spark plasma sintering provided bodies with a substantially smaller grain size than pressureless <b>presintering.</b> It is shown that the fine-grained presintered microstructure could be retained during final hot isostatic pressing and alumina ceramics doped with spinel and zirconia nanoparticles in particular could be sintered to full density with only minor grain growth during final hot isostatic pressing. The novel combined densification process enhanced by the unique nanoparticle doping approach provided fully dense alumina ceramics with an average grain size of 237 nm and an in-line transmission of 76. 2 % at a wavelength of 632. 8 nm and a sample thickness of 0. 8 mm...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{fabricate}} alumina glass composites by melt infiltration with better dimensional control through reducing both the <b>presintering</b> and infiltration temperature. Main efforts were put to develop glasses that are chemically compatible with alumina. After extensive investigations, a glass of 21 SiO 2 – 24 B 2 O 3 – 35 Al 2 O 3 – 15 Li 2 O– 5 CaO wt. % was successfully developed. The glass shows good chemical compatibility with alumina at elevated temperatures and low viscosity above 900 °C. Dense alumina glass composites can be fabricated by the melt infiltration process at 950 °C, which is 150 °C lower than the current state-of-art. Investigations showed improved net-shape capability for the newly developed composites, where the total linear shrinkage for the sintering and infiltration at 950 °C is less than 0. 1 %, as compared with the shrinkage of 0. 5 % induced by the <b>presintering</b> and infiltration at 1100 °C.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to develop thermal spray coating {{solutions}} for flexible, targeted modification of the functionality of ceramic substrate surfaces. In principle, all ceramic substrates of sufficient strength can be coated. Substrate preparation can be omitted for porous ceramics (including <b>presintered</b> ceramics), with the porosity limits differing for the different spray processes (approximately 60 % porosity for APS and approximately 30 % for HVOF and S-HVOF coatings). Dense technical ceramics require substrate preparation. However, because sandblasting results in damage to the substrate and bonding defects, laser ablation is the best method for substrate preparation. Thick coatings with good substrate bonding can be achieved if the R z roughness values are about 40 µm.

40|$|The in situ {{formation}} of nanostructured aluminum hydroxides {{on the surface}} of alumina particles, which can work as inorganic binder, was reported in this paper. The effect of the suspension pH during milling of alumina powder and subsequent hydrothermal treatment for the hydroxide formation and microstructure was depicted.

When the pH of suspension changed from acidic to basic during milling, bayerite [Al(OH) 3] nanoparticles were formed, but only a fraction of this hydroxide was converted to boehmite (AlOOH) during subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The aluminum hydroxide and oxyhydroxide formed in this condition improved the smoothness of extruded rods and the strength of <b>presintered</b> segments. For the powder milled under basic pH condition, the mechanochemically formed bayerite was completely converted into boehmite nanoparticles during the hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{determined}} the flexural strength of one hipped and eight <b>presintered</b> zirconia and evaluated the results using different estimation methods of Weibull statistics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Presintered</b> zirconia specimens were prepared in white state and sintered according to each manufacturer's instructions. One hipped zirconia acted as the control group. The specimens were loaded in a Universal Testing Machine (ISO 6872, 2008). Data were analysed using "normal" (Levene test, one-way ANOVA, Scheffé test) and "Weibull distribution" estimated by either Least Squares (LS) (mean (Excel) and median rank (MINITAB)), Maximum Likelihood (ML) (MINITAB) or ML (MINITAB) with a correction of BS EN 843 - 5 (2006) (MLC) (alpha= 0. 05). RESULTS: According to normal (σ) and Weibull distribution (s), three-point flexural strength (MPa) of the hipped zirconia (σ= 1643 (1507; 1782), s(LS mean rank) : 1772, s(LS median rank) : 1751 (1619; 1894), s(ML) : 1733 (1645; 1826) and s(MLC) : (1625; 1848) showed significantly higher results compared {{to all other}} <b>presintered</b> zirconia groups (p< 0. 001). The lowest mean and characteristic strength was observed with GC (σ= 817 (803; 953), s(LS mean rank) : 935, s(LS median rank) : 935 (868; 1007), s(ML) : 932 (875; 994) and s(MLC) : (862; 1009)). The highest Weibull modulus estimated by LS for mean and median rank was observed with LZ (8. 9 and 9. 8 (7. 5; 12. 9), respectively) and the lowest with ZE (5. 1 and 5 (3; 8. 2), respectively). According to ML and MLC estimation, the control group showed the highest (10. 1 (6. 6; 15. 6), 9. 2 (5. 8; 14. 2), respectively), and CZ the lowest (5. 6 (3. 8; 8. 2), 5. 0 (3. 2; 7. 8), respectively) Weibull modulus.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{transmittance}} and hardness of Al-rich spinel ceramics (MgO•nAl 2 O 3, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2. 5) prepd. By reaction air sintering (up to closed porosity) of different ratios of fine and coarse-grained com. Al 2 O 3 and MgO raw powders completed by subsequent {{hot isostatic pressing}} (HiP). Different compns {{give rise to a}} wide range of <b>presintering</b> temps. With starting compns 1 ≤ n ≤ 1. 5, <b>presintering</b> results in a formation of single-phase spinel, in which the excess of Al is solved. With higher Al contents (n > 1. 5), however, a biphasic ceramic of stoichiometric MgAl 2 O 4 and residual alumina is formed first. This excess alumina is incorporated into the spinel lattice during the final HiP at a temp. of 1750 °C. Single-phase, highly transparent spinel is obtained by increasing the Al-content up to n = 2. 5, which gives about 85 % in-line transmittance in the visible range of light and about 63 % at aUV wavelength of 200 nm. Whereas the optical properties can be improved, the hardness (HV 1) slightly decreases with increasing Al content. Depending on the raw powders, the hardness of samples prepd. by finer powders tend to higher values enabled by the development of a bimodal microstructure with a finer grain fraction (≤ 2 μm) between coarser grains (≤ 156 μm).

Afterwards threepoint- bending toughness was determined, elastic modulus was calculated and finally Vicker's hardness indents were made and measured with a light microscpe. The resulting parameters were used to calculate the fracture toughness. Additionally the specimen bars were thermal- etched in order to analyse the microstructure. The average toughness was 914 MPa with an ideal sintering temperature of 1480 °C. The average elastic modulus was calculated with 187. 738 MPa without any significant differences in sintering temperatures, but with an influence of the specimenhights. Fracture toughness was determined with 3, 43 MPa*√m in average and was significantly lower then expected from literature reseach (7 - 10 MPa*√m).

Colored 3 Y-TZP zirconia dental zirconia ceramics were made by mixing colorants and their combinations into a 3 Y-TZP powder, the green body were compacted at 200 MPa, <b>presinter</b> at 1050 °C and densely sintered at 1500 °C for 2 h. Specimens were subjected to an accelerated aging test carried out in an autoclave in steam at 134 °C, 2 bar, for 4 hs. XRD was used to identify the crystal phases, three-point bending strength were tested before and after aging according to the ISO 6872 standard, polished and aging specimens were observed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to evaluate surface microstructure. Tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation was detected for both uncolored and colored specimens, the relative content of monoclinic phase was increased with the prolonged aging time. Aging had no significant negative effects on flexural strength on colored 3 Y-TZP. The nucleation and growth of monoclinic phase were detected by AFM in surface of both colored and uncolored zirconia...|$|R
40|$|Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) of Si 3 N 4 powders {{with and}} without {{additives}} was performed using a glass container, and various kinds of pressureless-sintered Si 3 N 4 were HIP'ed without a container. The effects of HIP treatment on density, microstructure, flexural strength, microhardness, and fracture toughness on Si 3 N 4 ceramics were studied. Using a glass container {{it was difficult to}} reach theoretical density. The microhardness of HIP'ed Si 3 N 4 without additives was low, and the fracture toughness of HIP'ed Si 3 N 4 {{with and without}} additives was 22 to 25 W/m-K, and it decreased with increasing the amount of additives. The density and flexural strength, and hardness of pressureless-sintered Si 3 N 4 which contained Al 2 O and Y 2 O 3 as oxide additives were remarkably improved by HIP treatment using nitrogen as a pressure transmitting gas. It is very important to select the sintering conditions for fabricating the <b>presintered</b> body of Si 3 N 4 in order to improve the mechanical properties of Si 3 N 4 by HIP treatment...|$|R
