5|$|In animals, <b>poly(A)</b> {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the <b>poly(A)</b> tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and <b>poly(A)</b> tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the <b>poly(A)</b> tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the <b>poly(A)</b> tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This <b>poly(A)</b> tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} <b>poly(A)</b> tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The <b>poly(A)</b> tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial <b>poly(A)</b> tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|The <b>poly(A)</b> tail acts as {{the binding}} site for poly(A)-binding protein. Poly(A)-binding protein {{promotes}} export from the nucleus and translation, and inhibits degradation. This protein binds to the <b>poly(A)</b> tail prior to mRNA export from the nucleus and in yeast also recruits <b>poly(A)</b> nuclease, an enzyme that shortens the <b>poly(A)</b> tail and allows the export of the mRNA. Poly(A)-binding protein is exported to the cytoplasm with the RNA. mRNAs that are not exported are degraded by the exosome. Poly(A)-binding protein also can bind to, and thus recruit, several proteins that affect translation, {{one of these is}} initiation factor-4G, which in turn recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit. However, a <b>poly(A)</b> tail is not required for the translation of all mRNAs. Further, <b>poly(A)</b> tailing (oligo-adenylation) can determine the fate of RNA molecules that are usually not poly(A)-tailed (such as (small) non-coding (sn)RNAs etc.) and thereby induce their RNA decay.|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods and}} their {{extended}} versions for enumerating stereoisomers, {{which have been}} developed by modifying or simplifying Fujita’s USCI (unit-subduced-cycle-index) approach based {{on the concept of}} sphericities of orbits in order not to take account of symmetry itemization, are applied to the enumeration problem of ethane and propane derivatives. The proligand method and its extended version based on the concept of sphericities of cycles are also applied to the same enumeration problems. These results are compared with the results based on <b>Pólya’s</b> theorem (and <b>Pólya’s</b> corona). Thereby, it is shown that <b>Pólya’s</b> theorem enumerates chemical compounds as graphs, not as stereoisomers (3 D chemical structures) if all of the permutations corresponding to proper and improper rotations are adopted. Moreover, if the permutations corresponding to proper rotations are adopted, <b>Pólya’s</b> theorem enumerates chemical compounds as chiral ones, where enantiomeric relationship and achiral nature (i. e., self-enantiomeric relationship) are not characterized properly. The two types of applications of <b>Pólya’s</b> theorem do not take account of improper rotations properly. Thereby, what <b>Pólya’s</b> theorem is deficient in is concluded to be the concept of sphericity...|$|R

5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the <b>poly(A)</b> tail of an mRNA with a shortened <b>poly(A)</b> tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated. These shortened <b>poly(A)</b> tails are often less than 20 nucleotides, and are lengthened to around 80–150 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the <b>poly(A)</b> tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter <b>poly(A)</b> tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened <b>poly(A)</b> tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a <b>poly(A)</b> tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription. On mRNAs, the <b>poly(A)</b> tail protects the mRNA {{molecule}} from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a <b>poly(A)</b> tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E

5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a <b>poly(A)</b> tail to a messenger RNA. The <b>poly(A)</b> tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E

5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising <b>poly(A)</b> tails.

The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part.

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the <b>poly(A)</b> tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a <b>poly(A)</b> tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E

5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name <b>poly(A)</b> tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction.

The authors have previously given an explicit bound on N, determined by the data of p; namely, the degree, the size of the coefficients and the minimum value of p on the simplex.

5|$|The <b>poly(A)</b> tail is {{important}} for the nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short <b>poly(A)</b> tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the <b>poly(A)</b> tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a <b>poly(A)</b> tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} <b>poly(A)</b> site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on {{the expression of the}} proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak <b>poly(A)</b> sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal.|$|E
