50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> is {{undesirable}} {{for several}} reasons. The oscillations may be coupled into other circuits or radiate as radio waves, causing electromagnetic interference (EMI) to other devices. In audio systems, parasitic oscillations {{can sometimes be}} heard as annoying sounds in the speakers or earphones. The oscillations waste power and may cause undesirable heating. For example, an audio power amplifier that goes into <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> may generate enough power to damage connected speakers. A circuit that is oscillating will not amplify linearly, so desired signals passing through the stage will be distorted. In digital circuits, parasitic oscillations may only occur on particular logic transitions and may result in erratic operation of subsequent stages; for example, a counter stage may see many spurious pulses and count erratically.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> is an {{undesirable}} electronic oscillation (cyclic {{variation in}} output voltage or current) in an electronic or digital device. It is often caused by feedback in an amplifying device. The problem occurs notably in RF, audio, and other electronic amplifiers {{as well as}} in digital signal processing. It is one of the fundamental issues addressed by control theory.|$|E
50|$|In audio systems, if a {{microphone}} is placed {{close to a}} loudspeaker, <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations</b> may occur. This is caused by positive feedback, from amplifier's output to loudspeaker to sound waves, and back via the microphone to the amplifier input. See Audio feedback.|$|R

Preliminary NTSB reports were that the AC track circuit transmitter was breaking into <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation,</b> and that coupled across the rack cabinet to the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Feedback {{control theory}} {{developed}} {{to address the}} problem of <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> in servo control systems [...] - [...] the system oscillated rather than performing their intended function, for example velocity control in engines. The Barkhausen stability criterion gives the necessary condition for oscillation; the loop gain around the feedback loop, which is equal to the amplifier gain multiplied by the transfer function of the inadvertent feedback path, must be equal to one, and the phase shift around the loop must be zero or a multiple of 360° (2π radians).|$|E
50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> in an {{amplifier}} stage occurs when {{part of the}} output energy is coupled into the input, with the correct phase and amplitude to provide positive feedback at some frequency. The coupling can occur directly between input and output wiring with stray capacitance or mutual inductance between input and output. In some solid-state or vacuum electron devices there is sufficient internal capacitance to provide a feedback path. Since the ground is common to both input and output, output current flowing through the impedance of the ground connection can also couple signals back to the input.|$|E
50|$|Amplifiers may {{oscillate}} {{gently in}} ways that are hard to detect without an oscilloscope, or the oscillations may be so extensive that only a very distorted or no required signal at all gets through, or that damage occurs. Low frequency <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been called 'motorboating' due to the similarity to the sound of a low-revving exhaust note.|$|R
5000|$|At low {{frequencies}} parasitic capacitance {{can usually be}} ignored, but in high frequency circuits {{it can be a}} major problem. In amplifier circuits with extended frequency response, parasitic capacitance between the output and the input can act as a feedback path, causing the circuit to oscillate at high frequency. These unwanted <b>oscillations</b> are called <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In high {{frequency}} amplifiers, parasitic capacitance can combine with stray inductance such as component leads to form resonant circuits, also leading to <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In all inductors, the parasitic capacitance will {{resonate with the}} inductance at some {{high frequency}} to make the inductor self-resonant; {{this is called the}} self-resonant frequency. Above this frequency, the inductor actually has capacitive reactance.|$|R
50|$|The {{recurrence}} {{may be in}} {{the form}} of a varying voltage or a varying current. The waveform may be sinusoidal or some other shape when its magnitude is plotted against the duration of its cycle. Electronic oscillation may be intentionally caused, as in devices designed as oscillators, or it may be the result of unintentional positive feedback from the output of an electronic device to its input. The latter appears often in feedback amplifiers (such as operational amplifiers) that do not have sufficient gain or phase margins. In this case, the oscillation often interferes with or compromises the amplifier's intended function, and is known as <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{types of}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> {{are caused by}} small interelectrode {{capacitances}} (parasitic capacitance) or mutual inductance between adjacent wires or electronic components on the circuit board, which create an inadvertent feedback path. However these usually cause oscillations of high frequency, at {{the upper end of}} or above the passband of the equipment. This is because the phase shift of the small reactances in the feedback path, which increases with frequency, only become significant at high frequencies. Low frequency oscillations like motorboating indicate that some device or circuit with a large time constant is involved, such as the interstage coupling capacitors [...] or transformers, or the filter capacitors and supply transformer winding.|$|E
50|$|Ferrite beads {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation.</b>|$|E

40|$|High step-up ratio {{converters}} for low-voltage high-current {{energy sources}} are nowadays {{the focus of}} an intensive research activity by the power electronics community, thanks to the increasing interest for renewable energy sources like those based on photovoltaic modules and fuel-cells. One interesting topology presented in literature {{is based on the}} combination of a boost section and a flyback one, featuring the possibility to boost the output voltage while keeping the switch voltage stress at a reasonable level. However, the basic integrated boost-flyback (IBF) topology suffers of <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations</b> caused by the transformer leakage inductances and the diode <b>parasitic</b> capacitance. These <b>oscillations</b> require a suitable dissipative clamp circuit to reduce the diode voltage stress, thus adversely affecting the overall converter efficiency. In this paper, a clamping diode is added to the original IBF topology that naturally clamp these <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and make the converter operation more {{similar to that of the}} IBF converter with voltage multiplier. It is also shown that a resonance occurs that helps to increase the converter's voltage gain. Experimental results taken from a 300 W rated prototype are included, showing a good agreement with the theoretical expectations...|$|R
50|$|Several {{measures}} {{are used to}} prevent <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation.</b> Amplifier circuits are laid out so that input and output wiring are not adjacent, preventing capacitive or inductive coupling. A metal shield may be placed over sensitive portions of the circuit. Bypass capacitors may be put at power supply connections, to provide a low-impedance path for AC signals and prevent interstage coupling through the power supply. Where printed circuit boards are used, high- and low-power stages are separated and ground return traces are arranged so that heavy currents don't flow in mutually shared portions of the ground trace. In some cases the problem may only be solved by introduction of another feedback neutralization network, calculated and adjusted to eliminate the negative feedback within the passband of the amplifying device.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason the}} two signals, the RF and AF currents, can pass {{simultaneously}} through the amplifier without interfering {{is due to}} the superposition principle because the amplifier is linear. Since the two signals have different frequencies, they can be separated at the output with frequency selective filters. Therefore the proper functioning of the circuit depends on the amplifier operating in the linear region of its transfer curve. If the amplifier is significantly nonlinear, intermodulation distortion will occur and the audio signal will modulate the RF signal, resulting in audio feedback which can cause a shrieking in the earphone. The presence of the audio return circuit from the amplifier output to input made the reflex circuit vulnerable to such <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> problems.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{emission}} {{in physics}} {{is a phenomenon}} where primary incident particles of sufficient energy, when hitting a surface or passing through some material, induce the emission of secondary particles. The term often refers to the emission of electrons when charged particles like electrons or ions in a vacuum tube strike a metal surface; these are called secondary electrons. In this case, the number of secondary electrons emitted per incident particle is called secondary emission yield. If the secondary particles are ions, the effect is termed secondary ion emission. Secondary electron emission is used in photomultiplier tubes and image intensifier tubes to amplify {{the small number of}} photoelectrons produced by photoemission, making the tube more sensitive. It also occurs as an undesirable side effect in electronic vacuum tubes when electrons from the cathode strike the anode, and can cause <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation.</b>|$|E

50|$|A plot of a VFO's {{amplitude}} vs. frequency {{may show}} several peaks, probably harmonically related. Each of these peaks can potentially mix {{with some other}} incoming signal and produce a spurious response. These spurii (sometimes spelled spuriae) can result in increased noise or two signals detected where there should only be one. Additional components {{can be added to}} a VFO to suppress high-frequency <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> should these be present.|$|R
5000|$|In electronics, {{motorboating}} {{is a type}} of {{low frequency}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> (unwanted cyclic variation of the output voltage) that sometimes occurs in audio and radio equipment and often manifests itself as a sound similar to an idling motorboat engine, a [...] "put-put-put", in audio output from speakers or earphones. [...] It is a problem encountered particularly in radio transceivers and older vacuum tube audio systems, guitar amplifiers, PA systems and is caused by some type of unwanted feedback in the circuit. The amplifying devices in audio and radio equipment are vulnerable to a variety of feedback problems, which can cause distinctive noise in the output. The term motorboating is applied to oscillations whose frequency is below the range of hearing, from 1 to 10 hertz, so the individual oscillations are heard as pulses. Sometimes the oscillations can even be seen visually as the woofer cones in speakers slowly moving in and out.|$|E
50|$|Stray {{capacitance}} {{between the}} {{input and output}} in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for feedback, which can cause instability and <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance {{with a combination of}} one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — {{is often referred to as}} a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/K, then an impedance of Z connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a Z/(1 &minus; k) impedance between the first node and ground and a KZ/(K &minus; 1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, C, is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (K &minus; 1)C/K from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.|$|E
50|$|Many {{electronic}} circuits, especially amplifiers, incorporate negative feedback. This reduces their gain, but improves their linearity, input impedance, output impedance, and bandwidth, and stabilises all {{of these}} parameters, including the closed-loop gain. These parameters also become less dependent {{on the details of}} the amplifying device itself, and more dependent on the feedback components, which are less likely to vary with manufacturing tolerance, age and temperature. The difference between positive and negative feedback for AC signals is one of phase: if the signal is fed back out of phase, the feedback is negative and if it is in phase the feedback is positive. One problem for amplifier designers who use negative feedback {{is that some of the}} components of the circuit will introduce phase shift in the feedback path. If there is a frequency (usually a high frequency) where the phase shift reaches 180°, then the designer must ensure that the amplifier gain at that frequency is very low (usually by low-pass filtering). If the loop gain (the product of the amplifier gain and the extent of the positive feedback) at any frequency is greater than one, then the amplifier will oscillate at that frequency (Barkhausen stability criterion). Such oscillations are sometimes called parasitic oscillations. An amplifier that is stable in one set of conditions can break into <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillation</b> in another. This may be due to changes in temperature, supply voltage, adjustment of front-panel controls, or even the proximity of a person or other conductive item.|$|E

5000|$|A {{second problem}} was that the {{multiple}} radio frequency stages, all tuned to the same frequency, were prone to oscillate, and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>oscillations</b> mixed with the radio station's carrier in the detector, producing audible heterodynes (beat notes), whistles and moans, in the speaker.
