40|$|Abstract Recently, {{the number}} of Koreans who <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> has {{increased}} drastically; many <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> to learn English. In this study, one hundred Korean adult ELT (English language teaching) learners were surveyed to investigate their <b>use</b> of <b>smartphones</b> and factors influencing such use. For comparison, sixty-two students of a Korean cyber university were surveyed; these {{students were able to}} study <b>using</b> their <b>smartphones</b> in a smart campus environment. The research results showed that both groups positively <b>used</b> <b>smartphones</b> frequently, and that many intended to continue using them. With regard to ELT, both groups intended to learn English <b>using</b> their <b>smartphones.</b> Furthermore, they preferred certain types of ELT content: thirty-minute or less learning sessions, receptive English skills that focused on listening and reading, and short units of framed language items such as pronunciation and vocabulary. However, few of the respondents in both groups installed ELT apps on their smartphones, and few of the ELT apps satisfied them. The cyber university students responded similarly about <b>smartphone</b> <b>use,</b> although their responses regarding <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> for ELT purposes were less positive. These results indicate that the goal of cyber universities in achieving optimu...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of higher education students’ experiences in <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> for learning purposes, and their perceptions of the suitability of smartphones for learning. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research method is applied to data collection and analysis by following the grounded theory approach. Data were gathered by an online focus group involving Library and Information Science (LIS) students from University of Hong Kong and University of Tsukuba (Japan). Findings – LIS students at both universities regularly <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> for communication, socializing, entertainment and other daily information needs. The findings show that LIS students commonly <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> for learning and consider smartphones to be very useful for their academic work. They <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> to access course materials, search library catalog, discuss course assignments with peers, take notes, etc. Although both academic libraries involved offer a variety of services for mobile devices, these services are still not used frequently. A major barrier to <b>using</b> <b>smartphone</b> for academic learning is the smartphone’s small screen. Research limitations/implications – The study relies on a convenience sample, restricted to students from two universities, one from Hong Kong and the other from Japan. Further research on a larger sample is recommended. Originality/value – The study adds to the knowledge of <b>smartphone</b> actual <b>use</b> for learning purposes and provides study participants’ insights on the usefulness of smartphones for learning...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenon}} that pedestrians <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> while walking has posed great threat to transportation safety. As ubiquitous computing evolves with increased mobile <b>use</b> (e. g. <b>smartphones,</b> heads-up displays, wearable devices), safety {{is becoming increasingly}} needed, especially in urban environments. However, safety was not a major concern in human-computer interaction (HCI), and owing to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, it is highly challenging to develop a framework to deal with safety issues. In this paper, we discussed {{the development of a}} conceptual framework for evaluating and improving safety for pedestrians <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> while walking in safety-critical environments. A preliminary questionnaire based study was conducted to collect smartphone users’ opinions and attitudes towards <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> while walking. Some safety-critical details were also collected to address the users’ needs in interaction design. The proposed framework was explored in theoretical, hardware and software levels respectively, which could provide insights for both ergonomists, application designers and researchers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the utility of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) in Swaziland, mainly the <b>use</b> of <b>smartphones</b> for learning English. Because of the need to enable communicative language practice, and access to authentic content (Chinnery, 2006; Petersen 2 ̆ 6 Divitini, 2004; Sole, Calic, 2 ̆ 6 Neijmann, 2010) the use of MALL is currently the main focus in language learning and technology. Therefore, this study examined the utility of MALL in Swaziland, and students 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about the potential benefits of using MALL for learning English in class. To achieve this goal, the main independent variables in the study were purposes for which students <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> out of class for learning English vis-à-vis their beliefs about the potential benefits of <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> in class for the same reason. The study also investigated students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning for either believing that smartphones can be beneficial or not beneficial in class. To investigate these constructs, the study used two forms of data collection methods. First, a 23 -item Likert scale was used to collect quantitative data, which were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Second, telephone interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data, which were analyzed using both inductive analysis and creative synthesis. The results revealed significant differences among the purposes for which students <b>use</b> <b>smartphones</b> out of class for learning English and the potential benefits of <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> in class for the same reason.

This study employs the Technology Acceptance Model to examine the behavior of people in <b>using</b> <b>smartphones</b> from the perspectives of trust and rural areas. To realize our objective, we conducted a questionnaire survey that involved medical doctors and patients with chronic conditions. Our particular focus was Al Qunfudhah City in Saudi Arabia. More than 200 questionnaires were distributed to people belonging to different healthcare sectors in the rural areas of Al Qunfudhah City. Our aim was to include every possible scenario and to obtain excellent perspectives.

40|$|In two studies, we {{explored}} {{the relation between}} subjective reports of <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> and eve-ryday inattention.

In addition, partici-pants completed four scales assessing everyday attention lapses, attention-related errors, sponta-neous mind wandering and deliberate mind wandering, which were included {{in order to measure}} everyday inattention. The results of both studies revealed a strong positive relation between gen-eral and absent-minded <b>smartphone</b> <b>use.</b> Furthermore, we observed significant positive relations between each of the <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> questionnaires and each of the four measures of inattention. However, a series of regression analyses demonstrated that when both types of <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> were used as simultaneous predictors of inattention, the relation between inattention and <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> was driven entirely by absent-minded <b>use.</b> Specifically, absent-minded <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> consistently had a unique positive relation with the inattention measures, while general <b>smartphone</b> <b>use</b> either had no relation (Study 1) or a unique negative relation (Study 2) with inattention...|$|R
