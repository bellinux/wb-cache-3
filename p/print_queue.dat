40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} maximizing the {{economic}} performance (throughput) of industrial printers under changing operating conditions. An interesting problem for these printers is the cold start, when printing components {{have to be}} heated up {{as soon as possible}} to have minimum delay for the first print. To maximize the throughput of these machines, it is important to determine an optimal heating strategy, as temperature considerably influences the print quality. Also when switching between different media types, the print quality has to be guaranteed. A input dependent model of the system can catch the dynamics for the entire process. A control approach is proposed to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing quality of the system. It is based on a nonlinear dynamic input-dependent predictive controller. MPC is a good choice to control the behavior of printers, because it can deal in an optimal way with hard constraints and available information of the predicted <b>print</b> <b>queue.</b> Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the presence of variation in the constraints and in the <b>print</b> <b>queue...</b>|$|E

The economic performance under nonlinear dynamic behavior and changing operating conditions is discussed. The closed-loop properties are analyzed under suitable assumptions on the model of the plant. Control strategies are discussed and compared to different implementations in the literature. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{economic performance}} design under nonlinear dynamic behavior and changing operating conditions. Two methods to control plants with input-induced nonlinearities {{in the presence}} of hard constraints are presented. A nonlinear predictive controller is designed based on a nonlinear dynamic parameter-dependent model of the system for tracking control. Next a decomposition of the model of the plant is made which allows nonlinear optimal static feedforward and linear dynamic feedback. Model predictive control (MPC) was selected to control the transients while satisfying all constraints without loss of performance. The control scheme has been applied on an industrial printing system. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches {{in the presence of}} variation in the input <b>print</b> <b>queue</b> and constraints...|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} CERN {{had a very}} {{sophisticated}} print server infrastructure [13] which supported several different protocols (AppleTalk, IPX and TCP/IP) and many different printing standards. Todayâs situation differs a lot: we {{have a much more}} homogenous network infrastructure, where TCP/IP is used everywhere and we have less printer models, which almost all work using current standards (i. e. they all provide PostScript drivers). This change gave us the possibility to review the printing architecture aiming at simplifying the infrastructure in order to achieve full automation of the service. The new infrastructure offers both: LPD service exposing <b>print</b> <b>queues</b> to Linux and Mac OS X computers and native printing for Windows based clients. The printer driver distribution is automatic and native on Windows and automated by custom mechanisms on Linux, where the appropriate Foomatic drivers are configured. Also the process of printer registration and queue creation is completely automated following the printer registration in the network database. At the end of 2006 we have moved all (~ 1200) CERN printers and all usersâ connections at CERN to the new service. This paper will describe the new architecture and summarize the process of migration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the operator 2 ̆ 7 s functions for the VAX/VMS operating system and users 2 ̆ 7 environment. This system is of primary interest {{due to its}} adaptability and capability in management of system resources with respect to users and their needs. Within is described and expounded not only the how and when as usually printed {{in the pages of}} most system documentation but also the why, or the reasoning behind the usage, and the what, or the cause and effect within the system interaction when performing the command. The material is presented in a manner to allow a casual user of the system, the functions and procedures, to expand his awareness of system utilities. It first explains and allows a user to create a desire of personal extensibility and design of system commands and utilities. The paper then discusses the various useful utilities with which a system can be better managed and operated. Lastly is presented the commands that allow an operator the ability to tailor the system resources, such as the batch and <b>print</b> <b>queues,</b> for the different devices that are found in academic environments.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, UNIX {{workstations}} {{have provided a}} very powerful program development environment. However, workstations are more expensive than PCs and Macintoshes and require a system manager for day-to-day tasks such as disk backup, adding users, and setting up <b>print</b> <b>queues.</b> Native commercial software for system maintenance and "PC applications" has been lacking under UNIX. Apple's new Rhapsody operating system puts the current MacOS on a NeXT UNIX foundation and adds an enhanced NeXTSTEP object oriented development environment called Yellow Box. Rhapsody simultaneously runs UNIX and commercial Macintosh applications such as word processing or spreadsheets. Thus a UNIX detector Monte Carlo can run for days in the background {{at the same time}} as a commercial word processing program. And commercial programs such as Dantz Retrospect are being made available to make disk backup easy under Rhapsody. Apple has announced that in 1999 they intend to be running Rhapsody, or MacOS X as it will be called in the commercial release, on all their newer computers. MacOS X may be of interest to those who have trouble hiring expert UNIX system managers; and to those who would prefer to have a single computer and operating system on their desktop that serves both the needs of UNIX program development and running commercial applications, simultaneously. We present our experiences running UNIX programs and Macintosh applications under the Rhapsody DR 2 Developer Release.

UMass Amherst Libraries, {{with the support of}} the Friends of the Libraries, are providing our students and faculty with the opportunity to experiment and engage with this new technology through the creation of the MakerBot Innovation Center. The first such center in New England and the first located in a university library, the Innovation Center provides access to over 50 3 D printers, 3 D scanners, and an innovative 3 D printing software platform that links the printers together, providing remote access, <b>print</b> <b>queuing</b> and mass production of 3 D prints, and is designed to streamline productivity and staffing. Why the Libraries? Because UMass Amherst Libraries, through services like the Learning Commons and the Digital Media Lab, provide an environment in which students and faculty feel free to explore new forms of scholarship while being secure in the history and tradition of our print collections and digital information resources. The Libraries provide a neutral territory where all disciplines are welcomed and encouraged to explore and interact with others to create new, interdisciplinary discoveries. Without support from our Friends, the Innovation Center would not be possible. Your contributions to the Innovation Fund, the 21 st Century Technology Fund, the Digital Media Lab, and our Library Facilities Fund have allowed UMass Libraries to move to a level of excellence never possible if we had to depend only on campus funding. In a similar manner, your contributions to a variety of collection and service endowments provide on-going support that builds excellence and quality at a level never before known at UMass Amherst. It’s a broad spectrum of services that the UMass Amherst Libraries staff provide—from maintaining excellent print collections to offering cutting-edge 3 D printing services—because that is what today’s students and faculty desire and deserve. With your continuing support, we will be able to live up to their expectations...|$|R
