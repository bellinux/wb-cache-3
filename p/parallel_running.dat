25|$|Concerning the {{location}} of Thule, a discrepancy in data caused subsequent geographers some problems, and {{may be responsible for}} Ptolemy's distortion of Scotland. Strabo reports that Eratosthenes places Thule at a parallel 11500stadia (1305miles, or 16.4°) north of the mouth of the Borysthenes. The <b>parallel</b> <b>running</b> through that mouth also passes through Celtica and is Pytheas' base line. Using 3700 or 3800 stadia (approximately 420–430miles or 5.3°-5.4°) north of Marseilles for a base line obtains a latitude of 64.8° or 64.9° for Thule, well short of the Arctic Circle. It is in fact the latitude of Trondheim, where Pytheas may have made land.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Determination of the {{economic}} grounded sizes of motion of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings.</b> A research task is distribution in the operative terms of train work at admission of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings.</b> Methodology. Research is executed {{with the use of}} classic methods and methods of the linear programming. Findings. The rational train traffic volume distribution on a railway infrastructure with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> is presently carried out by an expert method on the basis of information about the before executed volumes of transportations without application of feasibility study. For the task solution of train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> of railway direction a linear model and methods of the linear programming are used in operative terms. At a design all train traffic volume on a direction part on undistributed train traffic volume – which remaines unchanging for all variants of operative management and distributed – which it is possible to redistribute in some limits between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> of railway direction. Originality. From the scientific point of view the work is interesting and important by the methods of the linear programming, which allow conducting train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> in operative terms. Practical value. The practical value of this research is in applying of the described economic and mathematical modeling methods of train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> on direction Znamenka - Odessa. 10 pairs transmission of freight trains from basic direction Pomoshnaya – Kolosovka – Odessa on parallel direction Pomoshnaya - Kotovsk – Separate is Odessa can be included with the optimum variant...|$|R

[...] He felt the French ought to retaliate by striking the GUNT at Faya-Largeau, which would {{have served as a}} declaration of war on Libya and escalated the conflict, something Mitterrand wanted to avoid at all costs. Instead, on January 25, French Defence Minister Charles Hernu ordered two Jaguar fighter-bombers to interdict the attackers and pursue them during their retreat. While the advance was blocked, a Jaguar was shot down and its pilot killed, leading to the January 27 decision to move the Red Line from the 15th to the 16th <b>parallel,</b> <b>running</b> from Koro Toro to Oum Chalouba. The French also moved a squadron of four Jaguars from Libreville, Gabon to N'Djamena.|$|E

[...] Wragge appointed Alan McDougall as his first resident engineer on the TG Later one of the resident engineers was Charles Sproatt of Toronto, who later became Toronto City Engineer. Edmund Wragge remained Chief Engineer of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway until its absorption into the CPR.|$|E
