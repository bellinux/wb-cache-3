40|$|Acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and {{velocities}} {{inside a}} normal incidence impedance tube {{have been successfully}} measured {{for a variety of}} pure tone sound fields using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). The DPIV system utilized two 600 -mj Nd:YAG lasers to generate a double-pulsed light sheet synchronized with the sound field and used to illuminate a portion of the oscillatory flow inside the tube. A high resolution (1320 x 1035 pixel), 8 -bit camera was used to capture double-exposed images of 2. 7 -micron hollow silicon dioxide tracer particles inside the tube. Classical spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques were used to ascertain the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and associated velocities for various sound field intensities and frequencies. The results show that <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> spanning a range of 1 - 60 microns can be measured for incident sound pressure levels of 100 - 130 dB and for frequencies spanning 500 - 1000 Hz. The ability to resolve 1 micron <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> at sound pressure levels in the 100 dB range allows the use of DPIV systems for measurement of sound fields at much lower sound pressure levels than had been previously possible.

40|$|Finite Larmor radius (FLR) {{effects on}} non-diffusive {{transport}} in a prototypical zonal flow with drift waves are {{studied in the}} context of a simplified chaotic transport model. The model consists of a superposition of drift waves of the linearized Hasegawa-Mima equation and a zonal shear flow perpendicular to the density gradient. High frequency FLR effects are incorporated by gyroaveraging the ExB velocity. Transport in the direction of the density gradient is negligible and we therefore focus on transport parallel to the zonal flows. A prescribed asymmetry produces strongly asymmetric non- Gaussian PDFs of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements,</b> with Lévy flights in one direction but not the other. For zero Larmor radius, a transition is observed in the scaling of the second moment of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements.</b> However, FLR effects seem to eliminate this transition. The PDFs of trapping and flight events show clear evidence of algebraic scaling with decay exponents depending on the value of the Larmor radii.

40|$|A MLS-based lattice spring {{model is}} {{presented}} for numerical modeling of elasticity of materials. In the model, shear springs between particles are introduced {{in addition to}} normal springs. However, the unknowns contain only <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> but no <b>particle</b> rotations. The novelty of the model lies in that the deformations of shear springs are computed by using the local strain obtained by the moving least squares (MLS) approximation rather than using the <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> directly. By doing so, the proposed lattice spring model can represent the diversity of Poisson’s ratio without violating the requirement of rotational invariance. Relationships between micro spring parameters and macro material constants are derived from the Cauchy-born rules and the hyperelastic theory.

Therefore, {{it is capable of}} simulating solid materials which are initially continuous, but eventually fracture when critical stress and/or displacement levels are reached.

40|$|Kuo and Munidasa [1] have {{reported}} a {{method by which}} a time-dependent optical intensity pattern is produced by the interference of laser light diffracted from a thermally induced bump with {{the light of the}} same laser reflected from the plane of the sample on which the bump was induced. In their experiment the thermal bump was induced by a second laser beam which was optically incoherent with the interfering light, but which was intensity modulated at frequencies ranging from the audio to the ultrasonic range. The resulting time-dependent patterns carry information about the thermal and elastic properties of the sample. The purpose of this work is to provide a first-principles calculation of those patterns so that those material properties can be measured with this technique. The starting point of the calculation is the solution to the coupled thermoelastic equations developed by Favro et al. [2 – 4]. That solution is expressed in terms of the three eigenmodes of the coupled equations: (1) a longitudinal acoustic wave consisting of propagating <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and associated temperature variations arising from the compression and rarefaction of the material; (2) a transverse (shear) wave which consists only of propagating <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and which does not cause any temperature variation as it propagates; and (3) a heavily-damped thermal wave which consists of propagating temperature variations and associated <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> arising from the thermal expansion it causes. The combination of surface displacements (i. e. “thermal bump”) resulting from these three kinds of waves when a modulated laser beam is incident on the surface of an opaque solid can be calculated in a straight forward fashion from expressions given in [4]...|$|R
