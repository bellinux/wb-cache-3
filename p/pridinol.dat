50|$|<b>Pridinol</b> is {{a muscle}} relaxant {{that is used}} as an {{antiparkinsonian}} and anticholinergic drug.|$|E
50|$|Acetophenone is {{used for}} the {{synthesis}} of many pharmaceuticals, for example: pyrrobutamine, dextropropoxyphene, trihexyphenidyl, <b>pridinol,</b> aspaminol, Cycrimine, Biperiden, Procyclidine, acifran, Amixetrine, Mesuximide, and Benmoxin.Allegedly also for phenylpropanolamine (note: in this case it is actually propiophenone not PhAc).|$|E

Simple, sensitive, and economical simultaneous volumetric and HPLC methods for the determination of <b>pridinol</b> mesylate in raw material have been developed. The volumetric method {{is based on the}} reaction of <b>pridinol</b> with sodium lauryl sulphate in diluted sulphuric acid. Dimethyl yellow was used as indicator to detect the end point of the titration in aqueous/organic layer. The HPLC method for the determination of pridinolmesylate employs a reverse phase C 18 column at ambient temperature with amobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: 0. 05 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH adjusted to 5. 0 (1 : 2, v/v). The flow rate was 0. 8 mL/min. Quantitation was achieved with UV detection at 258 nm based on peak area. Bothmethods were found to be suitable for the quality control of <b>pridinol</b> mesylate in raw material. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of meloxicam and <b>pridinol</b> is indicated for treating muscular contractures and low back pain. A dissolution {{test for the}} meloxicam-pridinol combined tablet formulation was developed and validated, using a suitable HPLC method for simultaneously quantitating both dissolved drugs. The optimized conditions {{include the use of}} USP apparatus 2 at a paddle rotation rate of 75 rpm and 900 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH= 7. 5) as dissolution medium, at 37. 0 &# 177; 0. 5 o. The test, which demonstrated to be robust against small changes in bath temperature, paddle rotation speed and pH of the dissolution medium, was applied to two different brands of tablets; the corresponding dissolution profiles were constructed and both brands showed to dissolve at least 75 &#x 0025; of the drugs at the 45 min time point...|$|E
