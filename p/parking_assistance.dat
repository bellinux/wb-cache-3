25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for <b>parking</b> <b>assistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{gives the}} {{possibility}} to wake or alert a sleeping or distracted driver. The C4 Picasso gained a back-up rear view camera, and an optional 360 degree panoramic vision system which consists of four wide angle cameras fitted in the front, the rear door, and the side mirrors to eliminate blind spots and aid parking. A <b>parking</b> <b>assistance</b> system is also optional on the Picasso, which {{with the help of}} mounted ultrasonic sensors can determine a suitable parking space for a semi-automatic parking experience.|$|E

50|$|Using BroadR-Reach {{technology}} in automotive enables {{the migration from}} multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view <b>parking</b> <b>assistance,</b> rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive-qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective.|$|E
50|$|A second {{facelift}} {{was presented}} in 2004. The designer was again Giorgetto Giugiaro. It has a new front, rear, and interior design. The 2004 Siena was the first Brazilian compact 4-door saloon with four airbags (two at front and two side airbags), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, rain sensor and <b>park</b> <b>assistance.</b> These accessories, however, are very expensive for the Brazilian and most other South American markets, so they are generally not found in end-use vehicles. The engines range in South America from a 1.3 Fire 16-valve, a new 1.4 Fire 8-valve with 80 HP (the same of the latest Fiat Punto, and a 1.8 GM Powertrain 8-valve with , shared with the Chevrolet Corsa). The Siena EL was sold with 1.0 and 1.4 engines, both 8-valve units.|$|R

The latest generation of PNA have sophisticated navigation functions such as <b>parking</b> <b>assistance</b> and personalization engines that enhance the user experience. To reduce total cost of ownership and time to market, most modern PNA devices such as those made by Garmin Ltd., Mio Technology Ltd. or TomTom International BV. are running an off-the-shelf embedded operating system such as Windows CE or Embedded Linux on commodity hardware with OEM versions of popular PDA Navigation software packages such as TomTom Navigator, I-GO 2006, Netropa IntelliNav iGuidance, or Destinator.|$|E
