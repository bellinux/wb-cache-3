Observers slowly came to recognize a class of stars that undergo long-term <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in luminosity. Both John Russell Hind in 1848 and Norman Pogson in 1863 had charted stars that underwent sudden changes in brightness. However, these received little attention from the astronomical community. Finally, in 1866, English astronomer William Huggins made the first spectroscopic observations of a nova, discovering lines of hydrogen in the unusual spectrum of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis. Huggins proposed a cataclysmic explosion as the underlying mechanism, and his efforts drew interest from other astronomers.|$|E

A typical <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the near-wake flow is caused by Karman vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the blade. <b>Periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> due to Karman vortex shedding generates a discrete frequency noise even in a rotating flow field. The frequency of the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the rotating flow field increases with the radius of the blade.

40|$|The {{effect of}} tilted {{harmonic}} excitation and parametric damping on the chaotic dynamics in an asymmetric magnetic pendulum is investigated in this paper. The Melnikov method {{is used to}} derive a criterion for transition to nonperiodic motion {{in terms of the}} Gauss hypergeometric function. The regular and fractal shapes of the basin of attraction are used to validate the Melnikov predictions. In the absence of parametric damping, the results show that an increase of the tilt angle of the excitation causes the lower bound for chaotic domain to increase and produces a singularity at the vertical position of the excitation. It is also shown that the presence of parametric damping without a <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> can enhance or suppress chaos while a parametric damping with a <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> can increase the region of regular motions significantly...|$|R

25|$|Baryon {{acoustic}} oscillations (BAO) are regular, <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in {{the density}} of the visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to the early universe's acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy redshift surveys provides a precise estimate of the Hubble constant and the average matter density in the Universe. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} evolutionary dynamics {{related to}} periodicity fossil biodiversity. Coherent <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in origination/extinction of marine genera that survive 45 million years) do {{not participate in}} the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in diversity and differ from those of "short-lived" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these 2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of variation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two previously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in abundance of "long-lived" genera, is probably the source of heretofore unexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr cycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the Phanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal in sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a connection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the vulnerable "short-lived" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a long-term <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in environmental conditions capable of affecting evolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing is more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously identified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining phase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity relates to variation in biotically important stresses. Further work should focus on finding links to physical phenomena that might reveal the causal system or systems. Comment: Paleobiology, in press. 74 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
30|$|The {{appearance}} {{and evolution of}} CO 2 bubbles can be quantitatively investigated using micro particle-image-velocimetry (µPIV) technique, as have been reported by Burgmann and coworkers [7, 8]. They found that the cell performance decay {{is closely related to}} the formation cycles of bubble slugs. An alternative method presented by Numaguchi and co-workers characterized the influence of the CO 2 bubbles in anode flow field by detecting the pressure drop along the channels [9]. Results show that the pressure drop may become unstable with a larger <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> when current density of the cell is increased. As a result, the periodic accumulation and excretion of the CO 2 bubbles in the flow fields were observed, and the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the cell voltage will accordingly occur during this process. Buie et al. [10] and Yang et al. [11] further demonstrated the importance of capillary forces by determining the anode pressure drop in a liquid-feed DMFC.

30|$|Iyemori et al. (2005) {{observed}} a geomagnetic field oscillation after the Sumatra 2004 earthquake. They {{concluded that the}} magnetic field oscillation was generated by acoustic waves in the electric current region, {{at an altitude of}} about 100 km. Choosakul et al. (2009) reported a <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of total electron content (TEC) measured by a GPS receiver network after the Sumatra 2004 earthquake. It had a clear periodicity at 3.7 mHz and 4.4 mHz, and continued for more than three hours {{in the vicinity of the}} epicenter. Shinagawa et al. (2007) explained that the oscillation was caused by the resonance of the acoustic waves that propagated vertically between the ground surface and the lower thermosphere. The resonance is predicted to be limited to the vicinity of the source region, because it was established by the vertical reflection of the acoustic wave. Besides the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> several types of ionospheric variations after earthquakes have been reported (e.g., Afraimovich et al., 2001; Heki and Ping, 2005; Otsuka et al., 2006; Astafyeva and Heki, 2009).|$|R

40|$|Populations can go extinct {{when their}} environments deteriorate, but {{evolutionary}} rescue {{occurs when a}} shrinking population adapts to the new environmental conditions. The emergence of resistance from a drug sensitive bacterial population under treatment {{can be regarded as}} an instance of evolutionary rescue. Understanding evolutionary rescue in a particular context such as drug resistance requires knowledge of how the environment changes and how selection coefficients change as a result. In this study, we propose a model for evolutionary rescue under three different scenarios of environmental change: abrupt change, <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and gradual decay. The model makes use of the notion of reaction norms to describe fitness values that depend on both genotype and environmental state. We find that although drug sensitive bacterial populations may be large, allowing them to generate resistant mutants frequently, a harsh abrupt change due to the drug usually drives them extinct. Evolutionary rescue occurs far more frequently under the milder forms of environmental change we investigated. Rescue is favoured when the absolute fitnesses of individuals remain sufficiently high over the range of environment qualities experienced by the population. The minimum environment quality, which is inversely related to drug dose in the antibiotic context, is thus an important factor. Interestingly, in the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> model, the inter-dose period is less influential in promoting rescue through resistance unless the minimum environment quality is in a particular range. We also investigated fitness trade-offs across environments including the case of a resistant allele not subject to any trade-off (a "superbug"). This fitness trade-off affects the probability of rescue in decaying environments, but surprisingly has only a weak effect in the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> scenario. Finally, we use the model to show how niche construction, whereby organisms are the source of environmental change, produces more complex dynamics. 10 page(s...|$|R
