5|$|Douglas's output {{included}} new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, {{new houses}} and alterations to existing houses, {{and a variety}} of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, <b>pargeting,</b> and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.|$|E
500|$|John Douglas (1830–1911) was an English {{architect}} {{based in}} Chester, Cheshire. His output included new churches, alterations to and restoration of existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, {{and a variety}} of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings.

2500|$|Cromie {{gave the}} {{interior}} up-to-date {{features such as}} inlaid lighting and underfloor heating, and themes such as two-tone colour schemes and wooden fixtures are found throughout. [...] The ground floor has extensive areas of tiling in contrasting colours; most light fittings are partly of wood, and some have multiple branches; the doors are panelled with two-tone wood; some walls have hardwood panels; and <b>pargeting,</b> fluting and decorative mouldings are also visible. [...] The staircase has an ornate chandelier, but its main point of interest is the unusual design of the balusters: a series of right-angled stepped blocks linked by four concentric quarter-circles of bronze. [...] There are other bronze fixtures as well, and some marblework on the ground floor. [...] A variety of built-in furniture also survives, despite the reordering of the interior to cater for the building's present use.|$|E

2500|$|There are 133 listed {{buildings}} in Clare. An online map is available, {{with links to}} each building. Over 40 of the listed buildings are 16th-century or earlier. There are three Grade 1 [...] religious buildings: the Priory, the Priory Chapel and the parish church of Ss Peter and Paul. There are three Grade 1 domestic houses: Cliftons and Nethergate House in Nethergate Street and the Ancient House in Church Street. The Ancient House, which has florid <b>pargeting,</b> is in part a museum, in part available as a holiday-let through the Landmark Trust. A rare 13th-century flint-lined well {{has been found in}} the garden behind the No 1 Deli Cafe. There are fine examples of timber-framed houses throughout the town, from the 14th to the 16th centuries, plus Georgian and Victorian houses. Most of the later houses are constructed in Flemish bond, but there is one example of a rat trap bond in Station Road. [...] Some of the weavers' cottages had cellars through which water ran for fulling their cloth. The heart of the town is a conservation area, one of 35 recognised by St Edmundsbury Council. [...] A full appraisal of buildings was carried out in 2008 within the conservation plan.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pargeting</b> (or {{sometimes}} pargetting) is {{a decorative}} or waterproofing plastering applied to building walls.

50|$|Mowbrays {{seems to}} have had no manor house in the 14th century but there may have been one in 1438. The present house called Mowbrays in Church Street is a late 15th- or early 16th-century timber-framed, jettied, gabled building, which {{originally}} had a central hall and two cross-wings. Late in the 17th century it was raised to two storeys and a west wing was added. Red-brick diagonal chimneystacks were built, which have the date 1690 scratched on them. The back of the house is decorated with <b>pargetting.</b> Mowbrays is a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
50|$|The tea {{house has}} a {{cruciform}} plan. It is a timber-framed building on a red sandstone plinth with a red tiled roof that rises with a concave profile to a point. On the apex is a large lead finial with a small weather vane. At the front is a verandah, the tearoom is in the centre and to the left, and the kitchen is on the right. The wooden posts supporting the verandah are carved, and above these is a <b>pargetted</b> frieze. A flight of six steps leads down to the Dutch Garden.|$|R
50|$|The {{house at}} Middle Farm was a 14th-century hall house, and its service wing {{may be the}} remains of a 13th-century building. In 1589 an upper floor was {{inserted}} in the 14th-century hall and some <b>pargeting</b> was applied. One of the farm's barns has a cruck frame.|$|E
50|$|Parging (or <b>pargeting)</b> {{is usually}} applied with a trowel and {{pressed into the}} {{existing}} surface.

50|$|The {{living room}} is done in a vaguely Adamesque style. The room side of the portal echoes in wood the design done in plaster on the hallway side.

5000|$|Green Paddocks is {{constructed}} in brown brick with red tile roofs; {{it has two}} storeys and attics.

Above this is panelled brickwork and a mullioned window, and over this is a <b>pargetted</b> gable. The lateral bays have mullioned windows in both lower storeys, and in the attics. Above these are shaped gables. The roof is steeply hipped, and at the rear is a small turret-like roof.|$|R
500|$|Several estate cottages near Weston Lodge were {{designed}} by W. E. Nesfield between 1860 and 1866, and are among his earliest works. They include Stowford and Magnolia Cottages (1864–65), which Nikolaus Pevsner describes as [...] "cheerful and just a little Kate Greenaway", Smithy Cottage (around 1865) and Fir Tree Cottage (1865), all listed at grade II, {{as well as a}} half-timbered farmhouse on Weston Road. Rather than either the Jacobean mansion or its High Victorian interiors, their style derives from buildings of the Home Counties, with tile hanging, incised <b>pargetting,</b> half-hipped gables and high chimneys. Pevsner credits Nesfield with introducing these features to Cheshire.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{messuage}} with Brays manor in 1279, but by 1545 {{the house}} on the site had gone. By 1730 the house for the manor was Little Farm, east of the churchyard. This was later combined with the house next door to form Norman Hall, which in 1867 was sold and ceased to be a farmhouse. The oldest part of Norman Hall is not Norman at all but a 15th-century timber-framed medieval hall with a cross-wing. It was altered in the 16th century and added to in the 18th and 19th centuries. The exterior is finished with a combination of flint, brick and 18th-century <b>pargetting.</b>|$|R
