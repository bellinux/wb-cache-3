5|$|Early in Wetherby's term, the state's {{revenues}} were inflated by the Korean War. Having adopted a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise additional revenue after the war ended. He did so by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax.|$|E
25|$|Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> {{is valid}} only to {{purchase}} tickets for London River Services boats operated by Thames Clippers. <b>Pay-as-you-go</b> is not accepted for payment by other riverboat operators.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{availability}} of Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> on {{the whole of the}} National Rail suburban network in January 2010, the validity of PAYG was not consistent across different modes of transport within London, and this gave rise to confusion for Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> users. Many passengers were caught out trying to use Pay as you go on rail routes where it was not valid.|$|E
25|$|He was a cosponsor of <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (PAYGO) budget {{legislation}} that was {{signed into law}} in February 2010.|$|E
25|$|On some National Rail routes where <b>pay-as-you-go</b> was valid, Oyster validators had {{not been}} {{installed}} at some intermediate stations. While Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> users could legally travel along those lines to certain destinations, they were not permitted to board or alight at intermediate stations. If their journey began or ended at an intermediate station, they {{would be unable to}} touch out and consequently be liable for penalty fares or prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Cash fares and <b>pay-as-you-go</b> Oyster Card fares are {{the same}} as on London Buses, {{although}} special fares may apply when using Tramlink feeder buses.|$|E
25|$|Oyster cards {{can be used}} {{to store}} season tickets of both travelcards and bus passes (of one week or more), and a <b>Pay-as-you-go</b> balance.|$|E
25|$|A {{registration}} form {{can be obtained}} at or after the time of purchase, which if not completed restricts the Oyster card to <b>Pay-as-you-go</b> and weekly tickets.|$|E
25|$|Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> {{could be}} used on {{services}} within Greater London. Oyster cards holding season tickets were accepted within the London Travelcard area, {{in the same way}} as normal paper Travelcards and season tickets.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to the immigration question is Canada's low birth rate (see List of countries by birth rate). The theory is that new residents can assist in meeting future government obligations relating to <b>pay-as-you-go</b> liabilities.|$|E
25|$|TfL {{published}} {{guides to}} {{the limitations of}} <b>pay-as-you-go</b> validity diagrammatic maps illustrating PAYG validity were published in November 2006 by National Rail, but these were rarely on display at stations {{and had to be}} obtained from transport websites.|$|E
25|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{estimates}} that implementing S. 517 {{would have no}} significant effect on discretionary spending over the 2015-2019 period. Enacting S. 517 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, <b>pay-as-you-go</b> procedures do not apply.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to have a negative <b>pay-as-you-go</b> balance after completing a journey, but this will prevent the card from being used (even if it is loaded with a valid Travelcard) until the card is topped up.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{boarding}} a Thames Clippers riverbus service must {{present their}} Oyster card {{to the ticket}} office before boarding; staff will use a hand-held card reader to deduct the appropriate fare from their <b>pay-as-you-go</b> balance. Thames Clippers operates a pay-before-boarding policy.|$|E
25|$|London Overground {{services}} are operated by TfL and Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> users use their {{cards in the}} same way as on Underground journeys, touching their card on a card reader at the entry and exit points of their journey to calculate the fare due.|$|E
25|$|Some London bus routes cross {{outside the}} Greater London {{boundary}} before reaching their terminus. <b>Pay-as-you-go</b> users {{are permitted to}} travel {{the full length of}} these route on buses operated as part of the London Bus network, even to destinations some distance outside Greater London.|$|E
25|$|New {{materials}} {{which may}} replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing {{more and more}} people to share cars, on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.|$|E
25|$|Oyster cards {{obtained}} at stations or shops cannot be fully registered online. However, cards can be protected online {{by setting up}} an Oyster online account and linking the card to that account. This allows for a full protection against theft or loss, but the Oyster card {{will be able to}} hold only 7-day season tickets and <b>pay-as-you-go.</b>|$|E
25|$|Passengers enter or exit most London Underground {{stations}} {{through ticket}} barriers which are operated by scanning an Oyster card or inserting a valid ticket. Some tube stations (such as those at National Rail interchanges) and DLR stations have standalone validators with no barriers. In both instances, <b>pay-as-you-go</b> users {{are required to}} touch in and out.|$|E
25|$|To {{capture a}} share of the {{business}} traveller market, Virgin decided to provide a members' lounge facility for travellers. Originally this was called The Blue Room and provided facilities to members and guests on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former Ansett terminals across the country, with the defunct Golden Wing club lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.|$|E
25|$|H.R. 4587 {{would impose}} {{sanctions}} against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support {{civil society in}} that country. The bill’s provisions would expire two years after enactment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4587 would cost $7 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. <b>Pay-as-you-go</b> procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, 2010, Bunning {{objected to}} a {{proposal}} of unanimous consent for {{an extension of}} unemployment insurance, COBRA, and other federal programs, citing that this extension was not <b>pay-as-you-go.</b> He proposed an amendment which sought to find the funds {{to pay for the}} bill from the Stimulus Bill of 2009, and declared that he supported the unemployed, but that a bill such as this only adds to the growing deficit and that it should be paid for immediately.|$|E
25|$|IBM Cloud {{includes}} infrastructure as {{a service}} (IaaS), software {{as a service}} (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers. IBM also offers Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.|$|E
25|$|If users travel {{outside the}} valid zones of their Travelcard (but within Oyster payment zones), any {{remaining}} fare due may be deducted from their <b>pay-as-you-go</b> funds (see below for {{how this is}} calculated). From 22 May 2011, Oyster Extension Permits (OEPs) were no longer required. Before that date, users who travelled outside the zones of their Travelcard, and whose journey involved {{the use of a}} National Rail service, were required to set an OEP on their Oyster card before travelling, to ensure that they paid for the extra-zonal journey.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, TfL {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} Oyster card validator, distinguished from the standard yellow validators by having a pink-coloured reader. They do not deduct funds, but are used at peripheral interchange points to confirm journey details. Oyster <b>pay-as-you-go</b> users travelling between two points without passing through Zone 1 are eligible for a lower fare, and from 6 September 2009 can confirm their route by touching their Oyster cards on the pink validators when they change trains, allowing them to be charged the appropriate fare without paying for Zone 1 travel. The pink validators are located at 15 interchange stations.|$|E
25|$|Forecasting life {{expectancy}} and mortality forms an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in {{life expectancy}} have huge implications for old-age support programs like U.S. Social Security and pension since the cash flow in these systems {{depends on the}} number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in <b>pay-as-you-go</b> systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Virgin Media won an {{exclusive}} contract to provide Wi-Fi access to London Underground platforms until 2017. The company announced mobile internet at 80 stations by July 2012 and a further 40 stations {{by the end}} of 2012. The service, which gives access to mobile internet via a TfL portal offering travel, news and entertainment bulletins, will remain free for Virgin Media customers, along with customers of partnered companies, such as Vodafone and EE, after the 2012 Summer Olympics. Other users will only be able to access a limited amount of free content on the TfL portal, with full mobile internet services offered on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|Tickets for trains between Fenchurch Street and Upminster are inter-available with London Underground {{services}} between Tower Hill and Upminster, at Transport for London fares. All other journeys {{are priced}} by c2c. Oyster card <b>pay-as-you-go</b> {{has been available}} since 2004 at stations between Fenchurch Street/Liverpool Street and Upminster. It was extended to Rainham in 2008 and beyond Travelcard Zone 6 to Grays in January 2010. Oyster cards may be purchased or topped up at some c2c stations that are not also London Underground stations, including Chafford Hundred, Grays, and Purfleet. c2c ticket machines in the Oyster PAYG area have been upgraded so they can read Oyster cards.|$|E
25|$|Once a bill is {{approved}} by one house, it {{is sent to}} the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill. If the second house amends the bill, then {{the differences between the two}} versions must be reconciled in a conference committee, an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills. Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as <b>pay-as-you-go</b> or paygo which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits. If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.|$|E
25|$|Others, such {{as former}} Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, have {{indicated}} {{that some form of}} rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and <b>pay-as-you-go</b> rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{was inaugurated}} as the 90th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 7, 1952. He {{was the first}} mayor to serve under Philadelphia's Home Rule Charter, which had reorganized city {{government}} by merging Philadelphia's city and county offices, establishing a limit of two successive terms for mayor, replacing patronage with a merit system for civil servants, and giving the mayor increased administrative, legislative, and investigative powers. During his administration, he reduced corruption within the Police Department and appointed several African Americans to city jobs. He adopted a $20 million tax increase and established a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> system. He created low-income housing projects, also establishing the position of housing coordinator. He also refused to accept personal gifts. His tenure also saw {{the transformation of the}} Penn Center and the Philadelphia waterfront.|$|E
25|$|Democrats {{support a}} more {{progressive}} tax structure {{to provide more}} services and reduce economic inequality by {{making sure that the}} wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes. Democrats support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military. They oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare programs, believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (<b>pay-as-you-go)</b> budget rule {{at the start of the}} 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, the {{starting}} base salary for incoming police officers was lowered by 20%. At the time If the applicant {{had graduated from}} high school their starting salary would be $45,226, if they had at least 60 college units, with an overall GPA of 2.0 or better, their salary would start at $47,043, and if the applicant had fully completed a college degree, the salary would start at $48,880. In 2014 after negotiations between the city and the police officers union reached an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1,000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut. The agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to $57,420 with an additional increase to $60,552 after 6 months which would become effective in the beginning of 2015. The agreement would also change the current overtime payment system from a deferred payment system, which was implemented to cut costs, to a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> overtime system as well as increasing the overtime budget from $30 million to $70 million.|$|E
500|$|He {{voted for}} the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Reform and Accountability Act. He {{supported}} <b>pay-as-you-go</b> budgeting and believed [...] "that the American government needs to strive {{to build up a}} surplus when possible, so that there are funds to support and sustain our country during tough financial times." [...] Moran called former President George W. Bush [...] "Fiscally irresponsible." ...|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{supported}} {{economic stimulus}} efforts during the late-2000s recession, including the Economic Stimulus Act in February 2008 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in October 2008. He supported the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package. Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for {{running up the}} national debt under George W. Bush, saying: [...] "It is somewhat ironic that {{the very people who}} drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining {{about the size of the}} tow truck." [...] He voted to instate the Statutory <b>Pay-As-You-Go</b> Act in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Hills Capitol, the now [...] "homeless" [...] legislature moved to a nearby Methodist Church. There were soon demands that the capital be relocated to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia; the legislature quickly appropriated money to build a new capitol in Harrisburg. Governor Daniel H. Hastings opted for a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> policy to allow the construction costs to be spread over multiple annual budgets. Governor Hastings also figured that $550,000 was enough to build [...] "a small legislative building" [...] that could be added onto as needed over time. After building designs were submitted by various architects in another competition, Henry Ives Cobb was chosen in 1897 to design the new capitol. Construction of the Cobb Capitol began on May 2, 1898. The legislature met in the finished building, which they had deemed complete, even though it was an [...] "unadorned, unfinished, several-story brown brick structure that looked like a factory", on January 3, 1899. Cobb himself described the building simply as [...] "ugly" [...] but believed that {{he would be able to}} finish it eventually, when more funding became available.|$|E
