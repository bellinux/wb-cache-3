5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E

He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in the face with his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued {{a large number}} of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been {{acquired}} by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|The {{ichthyosaur}} pelvis {{is typically}} rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone,</b> are not fused and {{often do not}} even touch each other. Also, {{the left and right}} pelvic sides do not longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The hip joint is not closed on the inside. The <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the fenestra thyreoidea; other researchers deny that the term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> and ischium, but in this case, the femoral head no longer articulates with the hip joint. Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a single rod.|$|E

25|$|To {{power the}} flippers, the {{shoulder}} girdle and the pelvis had been greatly modified, developing into broad bone plates at {{the underside of}} the body, which served as an attachment surface for large muscle groups, able to pull the limbs downwards. In the shoulder, the coracoid had become the largest element covering the major part of the breast. The scapula was much smaller, forming the outer front edge of the trunk. To the middle, it continued into a clavicle and finally a small interclavicular bone. As with most tetrapods, the shoulder joint was formed by the scapula and coracoid. In the pelvis, the bone plate was formed by the ischium at the rear and the larger <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> in front of it. The ilium, which in land vertebrates bears the weight of the hindlimb, had become a small element at the rear, no longer attached to either the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> or the thighbone. The hip joint was formed by the ischium and the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone.</b> The pectoral and pelvic plates were connected by a plastron, a bone cage formed by the paired belly ribs that each had a middle and an outer section. This arrangement immobilised the entire trunk.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} unhooding of the clitoris {{involves a}} V–to–Y {{advancement of the}} soft tissues, {{which is achieved by}} suturing the clitoral hood to the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> in the midline (to avoid the pudendal nerves); thus, uncovering the clitoris further tightens the labia minora.|$|E

30|$|This {{method was}} {{initially}} defined by Shiego Suzuki and associates from Shiga, Japan {{in the early}} 1990 s and includes the simultaneous examination of both hips using a large linear probe by an anterior approach [20]. A standard plane, showing both <b>pubic</b> <b>bones</b> and femoral heads, is obtained by placing the large linear probe on the pubis while the patient lies supine with the hips extended. Two lines are drawn to make the diagnosis on the image. P is the line drawn along the anterior surface of the <b>pubic</b> <b>bones</b> and E is the line perpendicular to line P drawn from the lateral margins of both <b>pubic</b> <b>bones</b> [20]. In a normal hip, the femoral head lies behind the P line and intersects the E line medially. In a slight dislocation, there exists {{a gap between the}} femoral head and the E line. In a high dislocation, the femoral head crosses the P line and the maximum diameter of the femoral head cannot be seen on the sonogram [20]. When a dislocation is detected, an examination with the hips flexed and abducted is made. The metaphysis of the femur is used to identify the femoral head in an abducted and flexed hip. It was reported that examining both hips in an abduction brace or a plaster cast was possible with this method [20]. Suzuki et al. [20] noted that the diagnostic results obtained by this method was comparable with those by the Graf method.|$|R

25|$|Several autapomorphies {{have been}} established, traits that {{distinguish}} Afrovenator from its nearest relatives. The depression {{in which the}} antorbital fenestra is located, has a front end {{in the form of}} a lobe. The third neck vertebra has a low rectangular spine. The crescent-shaped wrist bone is very flat. The first metacarpal has a broadly expanding contact surface with the second metacarpal.

25|$|From {{the ninth}} {{cervical}} vertebra to the back, the vertebral joints show {{the remains of}} articular capsules. Between the spines at places very thin interspinal and supraspinal ligaments are visible. Six vertebrae are visibly capped by cartilaginous synchondroses, a typical juvenile feature.

Also the pubic foot is capped and the ilium and <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> are separated by cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> which was {{positioned}} backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (Lambeosaurinae), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (Saurolophinae or Hadrosaurinae), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into aralosaurines, lambeosaurines, parasaurolophines, and tsintaosaurines, while saurolophines include saurolophus, brachylophosaurines, and kritosaurines.|$|E
50|$|The {{two species}} of {{chipmunk}} are difficult to distinguish visually, and firm identification may require examination of their <b>pubic</b> <b>bones,</b> but the Lodgepole chipmunk has brighter white stripes.

2500|$|Two such ligaments are the {{superior}} pubic ligament [...] and the inferior pubic ligament, which {{provide the most}} stability; the anterior and posterior ligaments are weaker.

The superior pubic ligament connects together the two <b>pubic</b> <b>bones</b> superiorly, extending laterally as far as the pubic tubercles. The inferior ligament in the pubic arch is also known as the arcuate pubic ligament or subpubic ligament; it is a thick, triangular arch of ligamentous fibers, connecting together the two <b>pubic</b> <b>bones</b> below, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. Above, it is blended with the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina; laterally, it is attached to the inferior rami of the pubic bones; below, it is free, and is separated from the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm by an opening through which the deep dorsal vein of the penis passes into the pelvis.|$|R
25|$|L. argestes is {{the oldest}} known tyrannosaurid, based on its stratigraphic position.

25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on {{the lower}} front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge.

The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E
25|$|Brachiosaurids shared synapomorphies, new traits {{typical for}} the group. They possessed middle and rear back {{vertebrae}} with long, 'rod-like' transverse processes. In the pelvis, the ischium had a shortened pubic peduncle, the contact surface with the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone.</b> Their humeri, upper arm bones, {{had a large}} deltopectoral crest. Their skull roofs showed wide supratemporal fenestrae, openings for the muscles. They had neural arches placed more on front of the vertebrae, shoulder blades that were expanded at the top end, irregularly shaped coracoids in the shoulder girdle, and triangular projections {{on the underside of}} the front branch of their quadratojugal bones at the lower rear corner of the skull.|$|E

25|$|The Gräfenberg spot, or G-spot, is a debated area {{of female}} anatomy, {{particularly}} among doctors and researchers, {{but it is}} typically described as being located behind the female <b>pubic</b> <b>bone</b> surrounding the urethra and accessible through the anterior wall of the vagina; it and {{other areas of the}} vagina are considered to have tissue and nerves that are related to the clitoris. Besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by indirect stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration may be aided by the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, during anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm from it.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lumbar region. Lumbosacral plexopathy is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the presacral space, and may refer to the external genitalia or perineum. Local recurrence of cancer attached {{to the side of}} the pelvic wall may cause pain in one of the iliac fossae. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the iliacus muscle. Pain in the hypogastrium (between the navel and <b>pubic</b> <b>bone)</b> is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in colorectal cancer especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.|$|E
25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (abdominal incision, {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the <b>pubic</b> <b>bone,</b> as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy, meanwhile vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E
