5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest <b>price</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E

Five scenarios of input <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> are empirically examined.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a detailed comparison of price changes for non-tradable and tradable {{items in the}} CPI across Australia and New Zealand. The main result is that relative price movements in Australia and New Zealand are highly correlated in the medium term, although not in the very short term. Sectors that have had large <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in New Zealand have tended to have large <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in Australia, and sectors that have had small <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in New Zealand have tended to have small <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in Australia. In both countries, <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> for non-tradable items have generally outpaced <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> for tradable items. However, the article finds that non-tradable <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> have not been noticeably higher in New Zealand than in Australia. Moreover, price changes have been high relative to Australia’s in several of New Zealand’s ‘tradable’ sectors since June 1998, particularly for non-food retail items. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{distributional}} consequences of housing price, bond price and equity <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> for Euro Area households {{using data from}} the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The capital gains from bond price and equity <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> turn out to be concentrated among relatively few households, while the median household strongly benefits from housing <b>price</b> <b>increases.</b> The capital gains from bond <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> (relative to household net wealth) do not correlate with household net wealth (or income). Bond <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> thus leave net wealth inequality largely unchanged. In contrast, equity <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> largely benefit the top end of the net wealth (and income) distribution, thus amplify net wealth inequality. Housing <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> display a hump shaped pattern over the net wealth distribution, with the poorest and richest households benefitting least. With regard to the latter finding there exists considerable heterogeneity across Euro Area countries...|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas <b>price</b> <b>increase.</b> Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|Some observers, such as {{petroleum}} industry experts Kenneth S.

5|$|In 1919, {{the company}} ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with {{electric}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These {{were the first}} in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit train control. They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket <b>price</b> <b>increase.</b> The HaWa trailers were delivered in 1925. However, the two-axled trailers did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from Atelier Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
40|$|World cereal <b>prices</b> {{have been}} <b>increasing</b> {{substantially}} since 2003. Until 2008, the Asian countries {{examined in this}} paper (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam) had generally been able to contain domestic <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> by using trade policies and {{taking advantage of the}} depreciation of the US dollar. On average, domestic <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in real terms were only about one third of the world <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in real US dollar terms. In the face of large world <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> in early 2008, the transmission to domestic markets was still incomplete, but <b>prices</b> <b>increased</b> substantially in some countries. In other countries, however, <b>prices</b> <b>increased</b> very little, if at all. Trade policies explain some of the different outcomes across countries, but speculative activity by farmers, traders, and consumers also appears to have played a role. While there has been incomplete transmission between world and domestic markets, transmission within national borders has been stronger in the sense that, for any given country, percentage increases in farm and consumer prices have been similar. The overall <b>price</b> <b>increases</b> during the past several years have probably been large enough to create a supply response, {{even in the face of}} higher fertilizer prices. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} {{building}} skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition {{of the real estate}} needed for the site.

5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a <b>price</b> <b>increase</b> of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
