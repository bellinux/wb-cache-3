2500|$|King Oscar II {{performed}} {{a number of}} additions, improvements and modernizations to the palace. Most of the empty facade niches were filled with sculptures during his reign. He had the palace's technical installations updated, such as installing a water pipe system in 1873, installing electricity in 1883, telephone in 1884 and waterborne central heating around 1900. [...] the property is connected to long-distance heating. The king's interest also extended to the decoration of the stairwells, and he commissioned Julius Kronberg to paint <b>plafonds</b> in {{the ceiling of the}} West Stairwell. Author Georg Svensson, wrote about King Oscar II that [...] "his goal was to complete the construction of the palace as intended in Tessin's plans in a manner worthy of this monument".|$|E

Une fontaine artificielle et jaillissante, dont le bassin est d'un prétieux marbre verd qui m'a paru serpentin ou jaspe, s'élevoit directement au milieu, sous le dôme.... Je me trouvai la tête si pleine de Sophas de prétieux <b>plafonds,</b> de meubles superbes, en un mot, d'une si grande confusion de matériaux magnifiques, ... qu'il seroit difficile d'en donner une idée claire."--Voyages, 1727, i. 220, 222.] ...|$|E

40|$|Tibial <b>plafond</b> {{fractures}} are serious, complex injuries of {{the distal}} tibia. Tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures {{are associated with}} many complications, multiple different management approaches and poor outcomes. Different strategies have been described to manage tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures, with no clear consensus as to the best management approach reached. The tibial <b>plafond</b> fracture types and population presenting to Australian trauma centres is unknown. The Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR) database was used to retrospectively identify potential tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures from between September 2003 and July 2009. The VOTOR prospectively collects health related quality of life outcomes from patients at 6 and 12 months post injury. Tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures were confirmed by assessment of radiological records using the AO/OTA fracture classification system. There were 108 confirmed tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures, in 103 patients. Data was collected from the VOTOR database, hospital medical record and radiological records, to identify the patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, fracture management and long term outcomes. All identified patients were invited {{to take part in}} a clinical review. This study described the Australian experience of tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures. Most cases involved young to middle aged men, in traffic or fall related incidents, many of which were compensable in nature. A high proportion were severe AO/OTA Type C fractures and almost one third of fractures were open injuries. The use of a two-stage approach to fracture management, with temporary external fixation was found to be widely used, with the preference for definitive fracture management being ORIF. Complications were identi 1 ied in the short term, largely related to soft tissue trauma and the management associated with superficial and deep infections, wound breakdown and repeat surgery for on-going wound management. Other identified complications included haemorrhage, compartment syndrome and superficial pin-site infections. Radiological outcomes were examined for all tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures, with an emphasis on time to radiological union, the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and mal-union (angular deformities). Time to union was the key short term outcome and the median time to union was 141 days. The onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritic changes was present in 70 % of all tihial <b>plafond</b> fractures. Tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures were associated with long-term tibial angular deformities. A detailed review of l 2 -month post injury patient reported outcomes including return to work, moderate to severe reporting of pain, physical and mental component scores was undertaken throughout this study. Moderate to severe pain was identified within 28 % of tibial <b>plafond</b> fracture patients at 12 months post injury. Significantly lower physical component scores were identified compared with Australian population norms. The low return to work rate of 57 % at 12 months, highlights the profound impact of tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures on patient's lives. Tibial <b>plafond</b> fractures present many management challenges in both the short and long-term, and were associated with a high degree of physical, social and psychological morbidity. Future research must continue to examine the factors associated with tibial <b>plafond</b> injuries and strive to improve the care of tibial <b>plafond</b> fracture patients...|$|R

30|$|Patients {{with type}} 2 tibial hemimelia have a {{proximal}} and distal tibial epiphysis articulating as {{the knee and}} ankle. The knee is mobile but often unstable due to absence of cruciate ligaments and depression or deficiency of part of the tibial plateau. The ankle <b>plafond</b> is present but often dysplastic, and thus does not have much motion despite its presence. The presence of a <b>plafond</b> differentiates it from Paley type 3 tibial hemimelia which is more deficient {{due to the lack}} of a tibial <b>plafond.</b> Ankle diastasis is not typical, but some degree may be present depending on the severity of dysplastic changes of the tibial <b>plafond.</b> The foot is usually in equino-varus.|$|R

50|$|As a {{decorative}} feature of churches and staterooms, <b>plafonds</b> were popular from the 17th century until {{the beginning of}} the 19th century.

50|$|Pushkinskaya (Пушкинская) is {{a station}} on Moscow Metro's Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line. Opened on 17 December 1975, along with Kuznetsky Most as the segment which linked the Zhdanovskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya Lines into one. Like its neighbour, {{the station was}} a column tri-vault type, which had not been seen in Moscow since the 1950s. Arguably the most {{beautiful}} station on the Line, the architects Vdovin and Bazhenov took every effort {{to make it appear}} to have a 'classical' 19th century setting. The central hall lighting is created with stylised 19th century chandeliers with two rows of <b>plafonds</b> appearing like candles, while the side platforms have candlesticks with similar <b>plafonds.</b> The columns, covered with 'Koelga' white marble are decorated with palm leaf reliefs and the grey marble walls are decorated with brass measured insertions based on the works of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The grey granite floor completes the appearance of the masterpiece. Architecturally the station put the final stop to the functionality economy design of the 1960s and went against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of struggle to avoid decorative 'extras', which left the stations of 1958-59 greatly altered in their design.|$|E
