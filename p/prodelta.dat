5000|$|The Gulf of Papua shelf can {{be divided}} into four geomorphic zones: a low-relief, inner-shelf, deltaic zone; a high-relief, mid- to outer-shelf incised valley zone; a high-relief, {{southern}} reef zone; and a moderate to low-relief mid- to outer shelf zone in the east and northeast. The deltaic zone is an extensive flat, shallow surface in 5-30 m water depth. It is bordered by a relatively steep <b>prodelta</b> region in 20-50 m of water, that extends along the coast between the tide-dominated Fly and wave-dominated Purari River mouths. [...] The incised valley zone has a complex, offshore-onshore-trending seafloor topography on the middle to outer shelf between 50 m and 100 m water depth. Evidence suggests that the largest of these valleys formed by erosive tidal currents during the Pleistocene when sea level was about 30-50 m below its present position. [...] The reef zone is a complex of barrier and patch reefs south of 9° 30' lat., the bathymetry is rugged near steep-sided coral reefs which locally may have vertical sides. Between the reefs, however, the shelf is a mostly flat and featureless surface with water depths of 20-50 m. Water depths increase rapidly to the east of the GBR, which is located on the shelf margin of the Coral Sea basin in water 120-140 m deep. The moderate- to low-relief mid- to outer shelf zone lies north of the incised valleys and offshore from the deltaic zone. Although the 60 m to 80 m isobaths suggest the existence of east-west trending valleys, these are much lower in relief than those to the south. Generally, this zone forms a low-relief plain, gently dipping towards the shelf break which is in about 140 m of water. A drowned barrier reef system forms a rim near the shelf break along the southeastern part of the Gulf.|$|E

A two-way nesting technique {{was used to}} focus on the Rhone River <b>prodelta</b> which is considered as a sink for riverine sediment. In addition, to understand the resuspension of trapped sediment over the Rhone <b>prodelta,</b> an in situ experiment, called SCOPE, was conducted during the winter 2007 / 2008. The experiment consisted of measuring hydro-sedimentary parameters using a mooring station comprising a current profiler (ADCP) and an altimeter (acoustic transducer) located {{in the eastern part of}} the Rhone <b>prodelta.</b> The three-dimensional transport model was validated using these data, and used to investigate the effect of sediment dynamics at the <b>prodelta</b> and Gulf of Lions scale. Both modelling and data analysis highlighted the impact of the two strong storms from the south-east which characterised the experimental period. Erosion of bed material (about 2 cm) and an increase in suspended material (up to about 50 – 100 mg/l) in the water were the result of each storm as recorded at the mooring station. The erosion capacity due to waves, combined with a strong current, due to both wind and wave forcing, resulted in strong south-westward export over the whole <b>prodelta.</b> Each storm was responsible for an off-prodelta export estimated at around 2. 1 Mt.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The late Holocene Po delta {{system is}} {{fed by the}} Po river, which drains the E-W-trending Po plain (catchment area 74, 500 km 2) and enters the Adriatic epicontinental sea. The Po delta system {{includes}} an extensive delta plain, a wave-influenced delta front, and a broad asymmetric <b>prodelta</b> deposit. The <b>prodelta</b> shows a steeper and shorter slope {{to the north and}} a very gentle slope to the south, where the thick Po <b>prodelta</b> merges into the late Holocene Adriatic mud wedge. The growth of the late Holocene Po delta started 5. 5 kyr BP, after the present sea-level highstand was attained. The Po delta was characterized by alternating phases of rapid advance and abandonment of its multiple deltaic lobes. This delta history reflects the forcing of high-frequency climate change, autocyclic avulsions, and anthropogenic factors, acting on variable, but typically short, time scales. The Po system has been investigated through: (1) a review of historical cartography extending back several centuries; (2) integrated surveys of VHR seismic profiles recorded offshore of the modern delta from water depths as shallow as 5 m to the toe of the <b>prodelta</b> in about 30 m; and (3) sedimentological and geochronological data from precisely positioned sediment cores. Historical accounts and cartography show that avulsion was an important process in Po delta building, during highstand progradation; with reference to the position of the present-day Po delta, older elements developed both to the north and to the south. During the late Bronze Age (ca. 3 kyr BP), the Po river developed two main branches: the Po di Adria, in the northern sector, and the Po di Spina, to the south. During the Roman Age (ca. 2. 5 - 1. 5 kyr BP) two other branches became dominant, both in the southern sector: the Po di Eridano and the Po di Olano. During the Middle Ages, Po di Primaro activated slightly south of the Po di Eridano, {{and at the same time}} the Po di Ariano branch developed to the north. The Ficarolo avulsion (12 th century, ca. 800 yr BP) shifted the main distributary channel farther to the north, activating the Po delle Fornaci, and threatening the Venice lagoon with siltation over the following centuries. The Porto Viro cut by the Venice Republic (1600 - 1604 AD, ca. 350 yr BP) redirected the northern branch of the Po to a southern outlet (Po Grande), initiating the rapid formation of the Modern Po delta with a protruding morphology on the western Adriatic coast. The rapid outbuilding of the Modern Po delta with rates up to 129 m yr- 1 reflects the impact of the Little Ice Age (1450 - 1850 AD, ca. 500 - 100 yr BP), probably enhanced by anthropogenic forcing of the river regime. The reconstruction of the stratigraphy of the Po <b>prodelta</b> and the correlation to geomorphologic and historical data in the delta plain show: (a) a marked asymmetry of the delta-prodelta system with significant down-drift sediment dispersal to the south of each individual delta mouth and asymmetric <b>prodelta</b> lobes; (b) short-term shifts from supply-dominated to wave-dominated delta lobes; and (c) the presence of two markedly distinct depositional elements in the <b>prodelta.</b> The two main kinds of <b>prodelta</b> deposits are: (1) shingled depositional <b>prodelta</b> lobes characterized by laterally continuous seismic reflectors showing evidence of variably preserved flood deposits in core, and (2) depositional <b>prodelta</b> lobes accompanied by "cut-and-fill" features typically detected offshore of short-lived, very active distributary channels characterized by massive silt in core. In the first kind of <b>prodelta</b> deposit, individual lobes onlap each other laterally, reflecting changes in the relative importance of their feeding systems over short intervals. In the second case, seismic profiles indicate that the channel-like forms have sharp bases and record repeated episodes of cut and fill while the entire lobe is building. The channel-like features typically occur in clusters, with individual widths ranging from 100 to 300 m and depths up to 4 - 5 m, filled with massive silt to very fine sand. The short-lived episodes of cut and fill are hypothetically attributed to episodic flood events of catastrophic reactivation of distinctive Po river branches driven by sudden increases in river discharge of natural origin or by human intervention.

40|$|This paper aims {{to define}} {{seafloor}} sediment distribution and dispersal processes on the Ombrone River delta (Tuscany), a clearly wave-dominated delta type. A total of 108 grab {{samples were collected}} and submitted to high-resolution grain size analysis by a laser instrument. The data set was treated by multivariate analyses, for grouping samples and size fractions. Contour maps based on these statistics were used for interpretation. The seafloor sediment distribution shows a land-sea graded pattern, with sand on the delta front and mud on <b>prodelta</b> areas. Moreover, individual evidences are present on the central delta portion, in response to wave-energy concentration (shallow seafloor) and river sediment overabundance (deeper seafloor). The most significant process is fine river-particles bypassing the delta front and sinking on the <b>prodelta.</b> It is accomplished by protruding buoyancy outflows (single-event dispersion) and by waves expelling river-particles from the delta front (long-term dispersion). In the receiving area of this bypassing (<b>prodelta),</b> particles settle progressively during seaward transport, determining a down current facies differentiation. This dispersion particularly affects the central section of the <b>prodelta,</b> and it is slightly deflected to the north by the Tyrrhenian current flowing parallel to the continent.

The internal structure of the HST deposits shows the repetition of two progradational/aggradational cycles, whose generation seems to be related to the influence of high-frequency climatic changes during the last 6 [...] 7 ka. Those changes probably involved small amplitude (< 3 - 4 m) sea-level oscillations and associated changes of sediment supply, conditioning the development of delta switching processes.

Seabed changes during that period were correlated to hydrodynamic conditions (waves and currents) and river discharge. Low sediment supply prevents full preservation of new sediment strata on this low-accumulation <b>prodelta</b> located on a microtidal, storm-dominated inner shelf. Severe meteorological events caused a rapid succession of erosion and deposition phases. For example, the December 2003 flood and storm produced a flood layer deposit that persisted for 2 months with only slight transformations due to early diagenesis and/or bioturbation, until a new storm event eroded this layer. A typical sedimentary sequence was observed for the secular deposits composed of a 10 -cm-thick sandy layer overlaying siltyclayey layers. These characteristic features were used to analyse the last millennia sedimentary record of the Têt <b>prodelta.</b> The low preservation of freshly deposited sediments and variable sedimentation rates during the last millennia period yield a sedimentary sequence formed by the outcropping of muddy prodeltaic units intersected by heterogeneous siltysandy units similar to those formed under present day hydrodynamic conditions. No flood layer was found related to catastrophic flooding of the last century in the sedimentary record. The Little Ice Age (1550  1850 AD) probably favoured the formation of a well-developed muddy <b>prodelta</b> in the mouth of the Têt River. Later on, the decrease of sediment supply by rivers due to climate change and/or human activities (damming, irrigation), and the increase of the number of high-energy storms reaching the coast, induced a coarsening of the top sediment layer on this <b>prodelta.</b> This modern change of the substrate is also observed in the composition of benthic biota found in the substrat...|$|E

This variation is observed when in-situ material properties are taken into account and can be explained if the different depositional and burial conditions of the sediments are considered.

40|$|An {{approach}} to {{the interpretation of the}} Holocene highstand depositional systems and the influence of shelf circulation patterns on sediment dispersal in the northern Gulf of Cadiz shelf (SW Iberian Peninsula) is reported. The study area comprises the transition from the southern Portuguese shelf, lacking major fluvial input, to the Guadiana and Guadalquivir shelves, receiving sediments from fluvial sources. An integrated study using high-resolution seismic profiles and meteorological and physical oceanography data was undertaken to reach the proposed goals. A lateral transition of shelf environments is evidenced during the most recent sea-level highstand period. The Portuguese shelf can be considered as a moderate to high-energy environment, where the dominance of storm events led to the construction of a significant infralittoral prograding wedge, as a consequence of normal incidence of storm waves and steep shelf profile.

Sedimentary processes overprint the primary distribution of these algae. Resuspension of sediments by waves and bottom currents may transport sediments in the bottom nepheloid layer along the submarine channels to the shelf break. Bottom sediments and microfossils may be incorporated into sea ice during freeze-up in autumn and winter leading to an export from the shelves into the deep sea.

In addition, particle size distribution, organic carbon (OC) and carbonates were also determined. Results {{showed that the}} metal contamination (Cd, P, Cu, Pb and Zn) is mainly introduced by the local rivers and accumulates—via a regulation by OC and silt fraction (2 – 63 mm) —in the direct vicinity of the mouths, in high shear stress environments.

It is demonstrated that the shallow <b>prodeltas</b> are the first repository areas for land-derived particles, exposing local ecosystems to both inorganic and organic contaminations. When going seaward, however, sediment dilution, particle sorting and biodegradation processes make that most riverborne contaminants rapidly reach natural levels. Only some metals (i. e.

A pore-pressure database was compiled using wireline formation interval tests, drillstem tests, and mud weights from 157 wells in 61 fields throughout Brunei. Overpressures are observed in 54 fields both in the inner-shelf deltaic sequences and in the underlying <b>prodelta</b> shales. Porosity vs. vertical effective stress plots from 31 fields reveal that overpressures are primarily generated by disequilibrium compaction in the <b>prodelta</b> shales but have been generated by fluid expansion in the inner-shelf deltaic sequences.

In addition numerous anthropogenic activities have affected these systems, mostly {{during the last two}} centuries. In order to decode the influence of climatic variability and anthropogenic impacts on sediment supplies during the recent past, five sediment cores were collected from the Guadalfeo and Adra submarine deltas. Benthic foraminiferal and sedimentological analyses, combined with radiocarbon dating, were performed. The impact of torrential floods alternating with periods of low rainfall or dry periods were recorded in the Adra and Guadalfeo <b>prodeltas.</b> Periods with low abundance of benthic foraminifera and high amounts of coarse-grained sediments, were interpreted as the result of enhanced sediment supply to the shelf triggered by major flood events. On the other hand, periods with high amounts of fine-grained sediments and high abundances of colonizers and opportunistic foraminiferal species indicate the establishment of new environments with distinct ecological constraints. These environments were driven by lower sediment supplies during low rainfall or dry periods. The most recent sedimentation seems to reflect the human interventions in the rivers basins, such as deviation of the main river courses and dams construction, which reduced the sediment input and promoted the deposition of shallow-water submarine deltas. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Located between 76 °N and 80 °N, western Spitsbergen has seen a climatic transition from a glacial to a paraglacial system. On the northern shore of the Brøgger Peninsula (northwest Spitsbergen), the average temperature increased by 3 °C between 1965 and 2015, and cold-based valley glaciers have retreated more than 1 km from their LIA limits.

Their three-dimensional architectures have been in the focus of several recent studies. Due to some terminological confusion concerning MDCs, the present study sets out to define eight individual MDC types in terms of surface sediment distribution and internal geometry. Under conditions of substantial sediment supply, <b>prodeltas</b> (distal zones off river deltas; triangular sheets), subaqueous deltas (disconnected from deltas by strong normal-to-shore currents; wedge-like clinoforms), and mud patches (scattered distribution) and mud blankets (widespread covers) are formed. Forced by hydrodynamic conditions, mud belts in the strict sense (detached from source; elongated bodies), and shallow-water contourite drifts (detached from source; growing normal to prevailing current direction; triangular clinoforms) develop. Controlled by local morphology, mud entrapments (in depressions, behind morphological steps) and mud wedges (triangular clinoforms growing in flow direction) are deposited. Shelf mud deposition took place (1) during early outer-shelf drowning (~ 14 ka), (2) after inner-shelf inundation to maximum flooding (9. 5 - 6. 5 ka), and (3) in sub-recent times (< 2 ka). Subsequent expansion may be (1) concentric, in cases where the depocenter formed near the fluvial source, (2) uni-directional, extending along advective current transport paths, and (3) progradational, forming clinoforms that grow either parallel or normal to the bottom current direction. Classical mud belts may be initiated around defined nuclei, the remote sites of which are determined by seafloor morphology rather than the location of the source. From a stratigraphic perspective, mud depocenters coincide with sea-level highstand-related, shelf-wide condensed sections.

Relative abundances of marine dinocysts are markedly low, and the maximum abundance of dinocysts is 6. 8 % or 1, 023 cysts g- 1 of sediment in samples recovered from the <b>prodelta.</b> Dinocyst abundances do not exceed 2 % of the total palynological assemblage in the Fraser River, and the number and diversity of dinocysts gradually decreases landward. Organic carbon- 13 enrichment values range from - 26. 55 ‰ in sediments deposited in the freshwater-tidal reach of the Fraser River, to - 21. 08 ‰ in prodeltaic sediments. The δ 13 Corg and palynological signatures of river, delta front, and <b>prodelta</b> sediments indicate a dominance of terrestrially sourced organic matter regardless of brackish-water and tidal influence on sediment deposition...|$|E
40|$|The River Vistula {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{suppliers}} of fresh water and terrigenous matter to the Baltic Sea. The impact of this river on the Baltic coastal system and the fate of the sediment delivered to the Gulf of Gdańsk are not well understood. Spatial transport patterns, as well as the settling, deposition and accumulation of the sediments were studied at the Vistula <b>prodelta</b> in different seasons from January 2012 to January 2013. The concentration of suspended matter in the water column was measured with optical methods, the sedimentation rate was determined with sediment traps, and the sediment accumulation rate was estimated using 210 Pb dating. Our data shows that the annual supply of sediment to the sediment-water interface exceeds the annual rate of sediment accumulation in the outer Vistula <b>prodelta</b> by a factor of three. Sediment trapping during rough weather showed that significant sediment redeposition was taking place, even at depths of 55 m. The dynamic sedimentary processes occurring in the Vistula <b>prodelta</b> mean that that more than two-thirds of the sediment mass can be remobilized and then redeposited in deeper parts of the Gdańsk Basin...|$|E
40|$|A multi-proxy chronological {{framework}} {{along with}} sequence-stratigraphic interpretations unveils composite Milankovitch cyclicity in the sedimentary {{records of the}} Last GlacialeInterglacial cycle at NE Gela Basin on the Sicilian continental margin. Chronostratigraphic data (including foraminifera-based eco-biostratigraphy and d 18 O records, tephrochronological markers and 14 C AMS radiometric datings) {{was derived from the}} shallow-shelf drill sites GeoB 14403 (54. 6 m recovery) and GeoB 14414 (27. 5 m), collected with both gravity and drilled MeBo cores in 193 m and 146 m water depth, respectively. The recovered intervals record Marine Isotope Stages and Substages (MIS) from MIS 5 to MIS 1, thus comprising major stratigraphic parts of the progradational deposits that form the last 100 -ka depositional sequence. Calibration of shelf sedimentary units with borehole stratigraphies indicates the impact of higher-frequency (20 -ka) sea level cycles punctuating this 100 -ka cycle. This becomes most evident in the alternation of thick interstadial highstand (HST) wedges and thinner glacial forced-regression (FSST) units mirroring seaward shifts in coastal progradation. Albeit their relatively short-lived depositional phase, these subordinate HST units form the bulk of the 100 -ka depositional sequence. Two mechanisms are proposed that likely account for enhanced sediment accumulation ratios (SAR) of up to 200 cm/ka during these intervals: (1) intensified activity of deep and intermediate Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) associated to the drowning of Mediterranean shelves, and (2) amplified sediment flux along the flooded shelf in response to hyperpycnal plumes that generate through extreme precipitation events during overall arid conditions. Equally, the latter mechanism is thought to be at the origin of undulated features resolved in the acoustic records of MIS 5 Interstadials, which bear a striking resemblance to modern equivalents forming on late-Holocene <b>prodeltas</b> of other Mediterranean shallow-shelf settings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{investigated}} soils and river {{suspended particulate matter}} (SPM) collected in the Rhône and its tributary basins as well as marine surface sediments taken in the Rhône <b>prodelta</b> (Gulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean). Thereby, we traced the signal of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from the source to sink via the Rhône River and its tributaries and identified sources of brGDGTs in rivers and marine sediments. Soil pH rather than the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) explains most of the observed variances of the brGDGT distribution in our soil dataset. The observed changes {{in the distribution of}} brGDGTs in the river SPM indicate that brGDGTs brought by the river to the sea are primarily derived from the lower Rhône and its tributary soils, even though in situ production in the river itself cannot be excluded. In marine surface sediments, it appears that the input of riverine brGDGTs is the primary source of brGDGTs in the Rhône <b>prodelta,</b> although the brGDGT composition may be further modified by the in situ production in the marine environment. More work is required to assess fully whether brGDGTs can be used to reconstruct the terrestrial paleoenvironmental changes using marine sediment cores taken in the Rhône <b>prodelta</b> close to the river mouth...|$|E
40|$|A {{field of}} {{sediment}} undulations has been mapped {{by means of}} high resolution multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection profiles in the Llobregat River <b>prodelta,</b> off the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Similar features had previously been recognized in other <b>prodelta</b> environments and interpreted either as downslope sediment deformation or sedimentary structures induced by bottom currents or hyperpycnal flows. Since the study area is undergoing significant offshore development, proper interpretation of such sediment undulations is needed for a correct risk assessment. The occurrence of the sediment undulations is restricted to the <b>prodelta</b> front on slope gradients between 3 and 0. 2 º. The undulations have developed at the edge and atop an area of gas bearing sediments within the Late-Holocene high-stand mud wedge. An evaluation is made {{of the characteristics of}} the sediment undulations {{in order to determine the}} most likely process for the origin of these structures. Amongst these characteristics are the continuity of the reflections and lack of diffractions in between different undulations, their size distribution (large to small) both from shallow to deep and with depth in section, the asymmetry (decreasing from proximal to distal), the crest to trough vertical distance on the landward side of the undulations (up to 0. 5 m), and the lack of features that could indicate a progressive movement such as growth structures and drag folds. These characteristics indicate that the sediment undulations on the Llobregat River <b>prodelta</b> do not result from sediment deformation, but rather from the interaction of bottom currents generated by hyperpycnal flows from the Llobregat River with regional sea water circulation. Their identification as sediment waves implies that such features do not pose a major hazard for urther offshore development...|$|E
40|$|Platinum {{contamination}} in estuarine and coastal sediments was evaluated in three cores {{collected in the}} Tagus Estuary and <b>prodelta</b> shelf sediments. Elevated concentrations – up to 25 -fold enrichment compared to background values – in the upper layers of the estuarine sediments were found. The degree of Pt enrichment in the estuarine sediments varied depending on the proximity to vehicular traffic sources, with maximum values of 9. 5 ng/g. A rapid decrease of Pt with depth indicates the absence of significant contamination before the introduction of catalytic converters in cars. Pt distribution in the Tagus <b>prodelta</b> shelf sediment core showed no surface enrichment; instead a sub-surface maximum {{at the base of}} the mixed layer suggests the existence of post-depositional mobility, and thus blurring the traffic-borne contamination signature in coastal sediments...|$|E
40|$|From November 2008 through May 2009, the North Italy {{experienced}} the highest precipitation period recorded {{over the last}} century. As a result, {{a long series of}} flood events occurred in the Po river (North Italy). This series of events ended with a large flood in early May 2009. An event-response sampling was carried out in the Po <b>prodelta</b> in April–May 2009 to characterize this latter event and to investigate the strata preservation in the stratigraphy record {{as a result of this}} series of floods. The water sampling was carried out during two periods of the flood, including early in the event under conditions of moderate river flow (~ 5000 m 3 s− 1 ) and 24 h later during the peak discharge (~ 8000 m 3 s− 1 ). At each station, profiles of conductivity, transmittance, and fluorescence were acquired whereas surface and bottom waters were sampled to collect sediments in suspension. In addition, sediment cores were collected in the Po <b>prodelta</b> before and after the peak flood. Biogeochemical compositions and sedimentological characteristics of suspended and sediment samples were investigated using a multi-proxy approach that included bulk and biomarkers analyses. Furthermore, 7 Be down-core profiles and radiographs were used to analyze the internal stratigraphy of sediment cores. During moderate discharge, the water column did not show evidence of plume penetration. In surface waters, suspended sediment concentrations were found to be similar to low river discharge periods whereas the main OC was autochthonous. After 24 h, during the peak flood, water column properties and biogeochemical parameters exhibited marked changes indicating significant penetration of the turbid plume. However, suspended sediment concentrations and terrigenous OC content in surface waters were still less then expected based on the discharge. These results suggested that, since material enters the Adriatic as buoyancy-driven flow with a reduced transport capacity, settling and flocculation processes result in trapping a significant fraction of land-derived material prior to reaching the subaqueous <b>prodelta.</b> In spite numerous floods occurred from November 2008 through April 2009, sediment cores collected in late April 2009 did not exhibited significant evidence of event-strata preservation. Since these floods were ordinary (2 – 3 y return period), the lack of preservation indicates that most of the sediment supply during these oridinary events does not reach the subaqueous <b>prodelta.</b> However, it is likely that modest sediment deposition occurs during these oridinary floods but thicknesses of these event-strata are not sufficient to compete with post-depositional processes. Stations in the north and central <b>prodelta</b> were re-occupied after the peak of the May 2009 flood. Based on 7 Be and radiographs, we estimated that 17 and 6 cm event-layers, respectively. Selective trapping of coarse material occurred in the central <b>prodelta</b> likely because of the geomorphologic setting of the central outlet characterized by an estuary-like mouth. Despite these settling processes, lignin-based parameters indicated that sources of the terrigenous OC were fairly homogenous throughout the channel network and between size-fractions...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and microhabitat of living benthic fora- minifera (15 calcareous and 6 agglutinated) {{have been studied}} in two box cores from the Tagus <b>Prodelta.</b> Stable oxygen and carbon isotopes were analysed for eight different species from six surface samples from the Tagus <b>Prodelta</b> and Estuary. At the two box core stations, most of the living foraminifera were restricted to the oxygenated top cm of the sediment and generally show a shallow infaunal behavior. Those taxa are e. g. Rectuvigerina phlegeri, Stainforthia fusiformis and species of the genus Bolivina, {{which is the most}} abundant genus in the Tagus <b>Prodelta.</b> Infaunal species are found down to 10 cm depth, and some infaunal taxa, e. g. Bulimina marginata, Globobulimina auriculata and Nonionella turgida, inhabit the low oxic or anoxic sediments. The deep infaunal species are suggested to feed selectively, on refractory organic matter or on the bacterial stocks, while the opportunistic shallow infaunal species are believed to feed on fresh phytodetritus or labile organic matter. Our data show that there is a close connection between the concentration of foraminifera and the distribution of organic matter in the area. The highest abundance of living benthic foraminifera was found in sediments close to the Tagus river plume, where the sediments have relatively high organic carbon contents. The spatial distribution of the stable isotope values of different benthic foraminifera reflects the distribution of the low salinity and relatively high temperature water with high organic carbon fluxes within the Tagus Estuary...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better define the facies {{architecture}} and controlling processes of a wave-dominated delta, a detailed sedimentary and geomorphologic study was undertaken on the New Brazos River delta. The study indicates a much more complex facies architecture than previously postulated and expands the facies model for wave-dominated deltas. The New Brazos delta is primarily composed of fine-grained sediments. <b>Prodelta</b> clay composes {{more than half of}} the sediment volume in the delta. Sands are isolated to the bar and nearshore environments. The facies architecture is distinct from adjacent interfluvial zones and not representative of the strandplain model for wave-dominated deltas. The unique facies architecture is a function of the primary depositional process for the delta [...] floods. In early 1992, statewide flooding facilitated a major constructional phase of the delta. Significant quantities of fine-grained sediments were deposited in the <b>prodelta.</b> One year after the onset of flooding, a bar emerged offshore of the river mouth, and enabled progradation of the delta...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{consequences}} {{of changes in}} the water flow of the Rhône River on surface sediment characteristics and benthic macrofauna composition were assessed within 3 distinct areas: (1) the delta front, (2) the <b>prodelta,</b> and (3) the distal zone. Five stations were sampled during or closely after: (1) an oceanic flood (April 2007), (2) a generalized flood (May 2008), (3) a Cevenol flood (December 2008), and (4) a dry period (July 2011). Measurements of sediment characteristics included granulometry (D 0. 5), bulk descriptors of sedimentary organics (OC, TN and THAA), descriptors of labile components of sedimentary organics (chloropigments, EHAA), and both descriptors of origin (Chl-b/Chl-a, C/N) and lability (Chl-a/(Chl-a+Phaeo-a), EHAA/THAA) of sedimentary organics. Sediment Profile Images were collected during April 2007, May 2008 and July 2011. Temporal changes in both sedimentary organics and benthic macrofauna were more important in the delta front and the <b>prodelta</b> than in the distal zone. Bulk characteristics of sedimentary organics presented decreasing inshore/offshore gradients during both April 2007 and July 2011 but not during May and December 2008. There were significant temporal changes in EHAA/THAA at all stations. Changes in benthic macrofauna composition differed between: (1) the delta front and the <b>prodelta,</b> and (2) the distal zone. In the former area, the dry period was associated with establishing a mature community characterized by high abundances and species richness. The best description of spatiotemporal changes in benthic macrofauna composition by surface sediment characteristics was obtained using D 0. 5, Chl-b/Chl-a, Chl-a/(Chl-a+Phaeo-a) and EHAA, which supports the role of the quality of sedimentary organics in controlling benthic macrofauna composition...|$|E
