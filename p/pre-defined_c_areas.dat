50|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about the product of coefficients is to examine the figure below. Each circle represents the variance of each of the variables. Where the circles overlap represents variance the circles have in common and thus the effect of one variable on the second variable. For example sections c + d represent the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, if we ignore the mediator, and corresponds to τ. This total amount of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable can then be broken down into <b>areas</b> <b>c</b> and d. <b>Area</b> <b>c</b> is the variance that the independent variable and the dependent variable have in common with the mediator, and this is the indirect effect. <b>Area</b> <b>c</b> corresponds to the product of coefficients (αβ) and to (τ &minus; τ’). The Sobel test is testing how large <b>area</b> <b>c</b> is. If <b>area</b> <b>c</b> is sufficiently large then Sobel’s test is significant and significant mediation is occurring.|$|R
