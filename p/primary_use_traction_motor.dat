25|$|Most 567C {{locomotive}} models <b>used</b> D37B <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> until mid 1959 {{when the}} D47B <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> was <b>used</b> in production locomotives. Very early 567C locomotives from 1953 <b>used</b> the D27B <b>traction</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to drive the wheels: either {{directly}} via gears, or <b>using</b> generator-driven <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|These systems <b>used</b> serial <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> All of them {{needed a}} {{separated}} supply system or converters {{to the standard}} 50 Hz electric network.|$|R
50|$|The power heads <b>use</b> AC <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{controlled}} by IGBT inverters which include integrated auxiliary inverters. Signalling systems can include ETCS Level 2, LZB, ASFA and Ebicab900TBS.|$|R
25|$|Inside the locomotive, a {{transformer}} steps the voltage down for <b>use</b> by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> and auxiliary loads.|$|R
50|$|Bodies {{were then}} transported by road to Broadmeadow for rebuilding. There are several major {{changes to the}} locomotives.

50|$|The China Railways HXN3 (EMD {{classification}} JT56ACe) is a 6000 horsepower (4.5 MW) {{diesel-electric locomotive}} designed by Electro-Motive Diesel for export to China. All JT56ACe locomotives <b>use</b> AC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> technology and <b>use</b> the EMD H-Engine as their prime mover.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of the {{locomotive}} asynchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> control with the AC diesel-electric transmission. The limitations of the torque of the <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> when powered by the inverter are determined. The recommendations to improve the <b>use</b> of asynchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> of locomotives with the AC diesel-electric transmission are given...|$|R
50|$|There are, however various schemes {{applied to}} provide a {{retarding}} force <b>using</b> the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The energy generated may {{be returned to the}} supply (regenerative braking), or dissipated by on board resistors (dynamic braking). Such a system can bring the load to a low speed, requiring relatively little friction braking to bring the load to a full stop.|$|R
50|$|The engine drives an AC {{generator}} whose {{current is}} rectified by six-way rectification <b>using</b> 240 diodes. <b>Traction</b> <b>motor</b> power control is achieved via the engine (i. e. using the throttle) and by thyristor 'choppers'.|$|R
50|$|Diesel {{electric}} locomotives may {{have most of}} what they need for regenerative braking since they might already use dynamic braking. This <b>uses</b> the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> as generators to absorb much of the train's energy, but without a way to store the generated electricity it is simply dumped into the atmosphere as heat with large rooftop resistor banks and cooling fans.|$|R
50|$|Because {{alternating}} current is used with high voltages, {{this method of}} electrification is only used on overhead wires, never on third rails. Inside the locomotive, a transformer steps the voltage down for <b>use</b> by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> and auxiliary loads.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} 3100's the {{traction}} for the locomotives is from six DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{comes from the}} 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a rectifier bridge for <b>use</b> by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The TEVan used a 27 hp, 65 hp max (48 kW) Separately-Excited GE DC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> {{coupled to}} a {{two-speed}} FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual {{referred to it}} as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE. The EPIC <b>used</b> an AC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and single speed transmissions.|$|R
50|$|Universal motors {{are widely}} used in small home {{appliances}} and hand power tools. Until the 1970s they dominated electric traction (electric, including diesel-electric railway and road vehicles); many traction power networks still use special low frequencies such as 16.7 and 25 Hz to overcome the aforementioned problems with losses and reactance. Still widely <b>used,</b> universal <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> have been increasingly displaced by polyphase AC induction and permanent magnet motors with variable-frequency drives made possible by modern power semiconductor devices.|$|R
50|$|Traction for the {{locomotives}} is {{from six}} DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{comes from the}} 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a bridge rectifier for <b>use</b> by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The power for each motor is rated at 500 kW whereas those of QR's most powerful diesel-electric locomotives were only rated at 275 kW.|$|R
5000|$|Diesel units do not pollute {{as much as}} steam trains; modern units produce {{low levels}} of exhaust emissions. Diesel-electric {{locomotives}} are often fitted with [...] "dynamic brakes" [...] that <b>use</b> the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> as electrical generators during braking to assist in controlling {{the speed of a}} train on a descending grade. This technology is similar to regenerative braking used in hybrid cars; the key difference is dynamic braking does not store the generated power, instead it is routed to resistors then converted into waste heat.|$|R
5000|$|Braking on the bogies {{is made in}} two ways: {{mechanical}} and [...] "energy recover". The first is a common system with 8 self venting discs on the 4 axles, automatically regulated. The second one is an advanced electric system that <b>uses</b> the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> as generators, recovering some electricity and sending {{it back to the}} line. This is a particularly efficient system on mountain lines, and is currently gaining market shares on different locomotives. The brake has different presets, fitted to cargo trains or passenger trains.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle speed {{capacities}} {{are limited}} due to power supply construction. When <b>using</b> rotation type <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> their mechanical characteristics set the limits. Most common {{linear induction motor}} designs use pantographs, contact pads or wires that due to friction cannot run at extreme speeds. To override these limitations a new design of linear induction motor is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|Inverter. VIA {{claims the}} truck {{can be used}} to power a home in an {{emergency}}. PG&E intends to use the truck to provide emergency street power during outages. The power export capacity is offered in 10 kW or 50 kW options. The inverters <b>used</b> for the <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and generator are supplied by TM4 Electrodynamic Systems.|$|R
25|$|A {{gas turbine}} - {{electric}} locomotive, or GTEL, is a locomotive {{that uses a}} gas turbine to drive an electric generator or alternator. The electric current thus produced is <b>used</b> to power <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> This type of locomotive was first experimented with during the Second World War, but reached its peak in the 1950s to 1960s. Few locomotives use this system today.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] EMD GL8 was {{an export}} {{diesel-electric}} locomotive introduced by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) in 1960. They {{have been designed}} as light locomotives with a low axle loading. Measuring 36 feet 2 inches over the end sills, they are equipped an EMD 8-567CR engine producing [...] for traction, driving four <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> in either A1A-A1A or B-B flexicoil trucks. [...] The EMD GA8 is a derivative designed for very light lines with extremely sharp curves <b>using</b> frame mounted <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> and freight car trucks.|$|R
50|$|Metro's heavy-rail lines (the Red and Purple Lines) run 75 ft {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} cars, powered by electrified third rail. These trains typically run in six-car consists. All of Metro's heavy-rail cars are A650's built by Breda in Italy. The acceleration for cars #530 and up {{is similar to}} that of the cars used by the Washington Metro because they both <b>use</b> General Electric <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The EMD SD89MAC is a [...] C-C {{diesel-electric}} locomotive produced by General Motors Electro-Motive Division. Along with the SD80MAC and SD90MAC, the SD89MAC {{is one of}} the largest single-engine locomotives produced by EMD. The SD89MAC features radial steering trucks and an isolated cab which is mounted on shock absorbers to reduce vibration. The SD89MAC <b>uses</b> AC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> technology. Like the SD90MAC, it is a hood unit fitted with a safety cab and has an enlarged radiator section, nearly the entire width of the locomotive, which makes it easy to spot. Currently EMD has used EMD SD89MAC 92 for Tier 4 Experiments.|$|R
2500|$|The Red Line uses Breda A650 [...] {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} cars built by Breda in Italy. Trains usually run in six-car consists during peak hours and four-car consists outside of peak hours. The acceleration for cars #530 and up {{is similar to}} that of cars used by the Washington Metro because they both <b>use</b> General Electric <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Avenue near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in downtown Los Angeles.|$|R
5000|$|China Railways HXD3D (Chinese: 和谐电3D型电力机车 / 和谐D3D型电力机车) {{is a high}} {{horsepower}} {{electric locomotive}} of China rated at 7.5 MW as it <b>uses</b> 6 Toshiba <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> rated at 1.25 MW. The locomotive was produced by Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company. Like the China Railways HXD1D, China Railways HXD3D is expected to ease the tension in railway operation of quasi-high speed locomotives, and {{to fill a gap}} in China mainland of the actual quasi-high speed application of high power AC locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|William H. Patton filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for a gasoline-electric hybrid rail-car propulsion system in early 1889, and for a similar hybrid boat propulsion system in mid 1889. [...] He went on to test and market the Patton Motor Car, a gas-electric hybrid system used to drive tram cars and small locomotives. [...] A gasoline engine drove a generator that served to charge a lead acid battery in parallel with the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> [...] A conventional series-parallel controller was <b>used</b> for the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> [...] A prototype was built in 1889, an experimental tram car was run in Pullman, Illinois in 1891, and a production locomotive was sold to a street railway company in Cedar Falls, Iowa in 1897.|$|R
5000|$|Inspecting a graph of <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> gear {{efficiency}} [...] shows 98% efficiency at nominal power but only 94% efficiency at 30% of nominal power. To get {{the efficiency of}} the motor and gears (connected in series), the two efficiencies must be multiplied. If the weighted <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> efficiency is 90%, then 90% x 94% = 85% (very rough estimate) which is not too much lower than that estimated the 90% supporters mentioned above. If per the table 75% of power to the substation reaches the locomotive motors then 75% x 85 = 64% (roughly) of the power to the substation (from the USSR's power grid) reaches the wheels of the locomotives in the form of mechanical energy to pull the trains. This neglects the power used for [...] "housekeeping" [...] (heating, lighting, etc.) on passenger trains. This is over the whole range of operating conditions in the early 1970s. There are a number of ways to significantly improve this 64% figure and it fails to take into account savings due to regeneration (<b>using</b> the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> as generators to put power back on the catenary to power other trains).|$|R
2500|$|The SD70MAC (colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Mac" [...] or a [...] "70 Mac") {{is very similar to}} the SD70M and SD70I; the main {{difference}} being that the SD70MAC <b>uses</b> AC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> Production of the model commenced in 1993, competing against GE's AC4400CW. AC motors, while simpler and more reliable than DC motors, require expensive inverters to generate a variable-frequency AC signal, raising the locomotive's purchase cost substantially. The majority of SD70MAC models were produced with the [...] EMD 710 prime mover while later units are rated at [...] and feature EMD SD45-style flared radiators. They were also offered with a head-end power generation system for passenger trains. The truck was replace with HTCR-4, instead of HTCR-I on former model.|$|R
50|$|The 117 series <b>uses</b> type MT54D <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> (rated at 120 kW @ 375 V). It {{was also}} used in 113 series trains. The 117 also had JNR's {{standard}} final drive ratio, 4.82:1. Having the same acceleration rate as the 113 series and 115 series, 6-car sets with four powered and two trailer cars were not quite as powerful as those in use in comparable services by competing private railways. The difference in 4-car sets with only two powered cars was even more pronounced.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} wound motor, the field coils are {{connected}} electrically {{in series with}} the armature coils (via the brushes). In a shunt wound motor, the field coils are connected in parallel, or [...] "shunted" [...] to the armature coils. In a separately excited (sepex) motor the field coils are supplied from an independent source, such as a motor-generator and the field current is unaffected by changes in the armature current. The sepex system was sometimes <b>used</b> in DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> to facilitate control of wheelslip.|$|R
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up <b>using</b> a DC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> instead.|$|R
25|$|All {{these cars}} <b>use</b> {{traditional}} DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> with electromechanical controls manufactured by Westinghouse and can interoperate.

Originally, the 1500s were double-ended and had two cabs, but were converted to single ended during their midlife overhaul. Headlights are still present on the non-cab ends on the 1500s. The 1700s also have headlights on their non-cab end, but they were built with only one cab.|$|R
50|$|A {{repulsion}} motor {{is a type}} of electric motor for using on alternating current (AC). It was formerly <b>used</b> as a <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> for electric trains (e.g. SR Class CP and SR Class SL electric multiple units) but has been superseded by other types of motors. Repulsion motors are classified under single phase motors. In {{repulsion motor}}s the stator windings are connected directly to the AC power supply and the rotor is connected to a commutator and brush assembly, similar to that of a direct current (DC) motor.|$|R
