5000|$|Although Decca had {{recorded}} Ansermet's conducting of Antar in stereo May 1954 {{it took four}} years for the first stereo LPs to be sold. In 1958, {{the first group of}} mass-produced stereo two-channel vinyl records was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the Westrex [...] "45/45" [...] single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a [...] "hill and dale" [...] vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing <b>phono</b> <b>pickup</b> designs (see below).|$|E
5000|$|The {{capacitive}} stylus pickup {{system which}} gives the CED its name can be contrasted with the technology of the conventional phonograph. Whereas the phonograph stylus physically vibrates with the variations in the record groove, and those vibrations are converted by a mechanical transducer (the <b>phono</b> <b>pickup)</b> to an electrical signal, the CED stylus normally does not vibrate and moves only to track the CED groove (and the disc surface—out-of-plane), while the signal from the stylus is natively obtained as an electrical signal. This more sophisticated system, combined with a high revolution rate, is necessary to enable the encoding of video signals with bandwidth of a few megahertz, compared {{to a maximum of}} 20 kilohertz for an audio-only signal—a difference of two orders of magnitude. Also, while the undulations {{in the bottom of the}} groove may be likened to pits, it is important to note that the spacing of vertical wave crests and troughs in a CED groove is continuously variable, as the CED is an analog medium. Usually, the term [...] "pits," [...] when used in the context of information media, refers to features with sharply defined edges and discrete lengths and depths, such as the pits on digital optical media such as CDs and DVDs.|$|E
