50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF dialing technology. Some manufacturers implemented <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> with push-button keypads {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional <b>dial</b> <b>pulses.</b> Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> phones allow for double-speed <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> These allow even faster <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> in exchanges that recognize double-speed <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|R
50|$|While a tone-to-pulse {{converter}} {{could be}} deployed to any existing mechanical office line using 1970s technology, its speed {{would be limited}} to <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> rates.The new central office switches were backward-compatible with rotary dialing.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{their lack}} of modern features, rotary phones {{occasionally}} find special uses. For instance, the anti-drug Fairlawn Coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C., persuaded the phone company to reinstall rotary-dial pay phones in the 1980s to discourage loitering by drug purchasers, since the dials {{could not be used}} to call dealers' pagers. They are also retained for authenticity in historic properties such as the U.S. Route 66 Blue Swallow Motel which date from an era of named exchanges and <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Low digits: in {{the days}} of rotary dial telephones, using only those digits that require the least dial {{rotation}} (1 and 2) permitted a dial lock in hole 3 to effectively disable unauthorised access to the telephone network without preventing access to the emergency number 112. The same choice also maximised dialling speed. Additionally, telephone systems used <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling</b> instead of later DTMF tones; briefly activating the hook once has the same effect as dialling [...] "1", so repeatedly pushing the hook might result in calling 1-1-1. For this reason, Germany's police emergency number was changed from 111 to 110. With numeric keypads, pressing only the first and second button on the keypad is marginally easier in a difficult situation than other keys.|$|E
5000|$|... 111 was {{specifically}} {{chosen to be}} similar to Britain's 999 service. With <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling,</b> New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the UK - dialling 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the UK, dialling 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, the telephone equipment was based on British Post Office equipment, except for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as UK's 999. Number [...] "9" [...] in New Zealand (or [...] "1" [...] in Britain) was not used for the start of telephone numbers because of the likelihood of accidental false calls from open-wire lines tapping together etc.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> {{came into}} use for {{telephone}} exchanges, pen registers had obvious applications as diagnostic instruments for recording sequences of telephone <b>dial</b> <b>pulses.</b> With {{the passage of}} time, any instrument {{that could be used}} for this purpose came to be defined as a pen register. Title 18 of the United States Code defines a pen register as: ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1940s that faster, more accurate dialing could be done with push buttons, but this was too unreliable in customer trials until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public its dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used push-button telephones. In the decades after 1963, <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> was gradually phased out as the primary dialing method to the central office, but many systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch for the selection of tone or <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|A rotary dial is a {{component}} of a telephone or a telephone switchboard that implements a signaling technology in telecommunications known as <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> It is used when initiating a telephone call to transmit the destination telephone number to a telephone exchange.|$|R
50|$|The {{exchange}} used reed relays as the switching medium, and {{the reeds}} themselves were approximately 3 {{inches in length}} and the only ones available. They were provided by Hivac (then the only UK manufacturer of reed inserts), which was an AT&E subsidiary. TXE2 exchanges would later on use reeds that were half this length. It had multi-stage switching divided into A, B and C switches, and there were devices called links to connect the paths together. A typical local call would go ABC Link CBA. There were two types of links: ones with transmission bridges for local calls and others with no bridges for the outgoing junction calls. The bridges for the latter were contained within the outgoing junction units. The exchange had some advanced features for the time, e.g. multi-frequency (MF) tone dialling was an option as opposed to <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling,</b> with no post-dialling delay for own exchange calls. It also {{had the ability to}} detect a switching failure and go for a repeat attempt without the subscriber being aware of it. Any repeat attempts were printed on a standard teleprinter, which can be seen to the right in the Test Console picture. It had a futuristic test console, which monitored all the calls on a digital display. The display was constructed of ten layers of Perspex, one for each digit and holes drilled in each layer to represent the digit e.g. 9 and each Perspex layer had a bulb mounted above it which was lit when that digit was required. The light then shone through the drilled holes to display the digit.|$|E

50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a push-button telephone with <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the touch-tone surcharge.|$|R
50|$|The {{international}} standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the dialed number.|$|R
50|$|The {{conductors}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used {{for a second or}} third telephone line, a ground for selective ringers, low-voltage power for a dial light, or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.|$|R
5000|$|The Tandy 200 was {{introduced}} in 1984 as a more capable sister product of the Model 100. The Tandy 200 has a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display and came with 24 KB RAM which can be expanded to 72 KB (3 banks of 24 KB). Rather than the [...] "button" [...] style keys of the Model 100, its four arrow keys are a cluster of keys {{of the same size}} and shape as those comprising the keyboard, though the function and command [...] "keys" [...] are still of the button type. The Tandy 200 includes Multiplan, a spreadsheet application. It also added DTMF tone dialing for the internal modem, whereas the Model 100 only supports <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> On a phone line that doesn't support <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> users may dial manually using a touch-tone phone and then put the Model 100 online.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> (<b>dial</b> <b>pulse,</b> DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the <b>dial</b> <b>pulses</b> either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special subscriber trunk dialing equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R
50|$|As <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> is {{achieved}} by interruption of the local loop, it was in principle possible to dial a telephone number by rapidly tapping, i.e. depressing, the switch hook the corresponding number of times for each digit at approximately ten taps per second. However, many telephone makers implemented a slow switch hook release to prevent rapid switching.|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring contacts are in practice used for various things such {{as a ground for}} selective ringers, low voltage power for a dial light, or for 'anti-tinkle' circuitry to prevent <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> phones from ringing the bell on other extensions. With tone dialing, anti-tinkle measures are not required.|$|R
50|$|The {{communication}} circuits {{of the public}} switched telephone network continue to be modernized by advances in digital communications; however, other than improving sound quality, these changes have been mainly transparent to customers. In most cases, the function of the local loop presented to the customer for connection to telephone equipment is practically unchanged and remains compatible with <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> telephones.|$|R
50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} touch-tone telephone sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term push-button telephone to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|R
25|$|The rotary dial is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> corresponding to the number dialed. The early form of the rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The rotary dial was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|R
50|$|Automation {{introduced}} <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> {{between the}} telephone and the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|R

5000|$|Note: {{the tone}} signal after dialing [...] "8" [...] is {{compulsory}} on old analog (with <b>pulse</b> mode <b>dialing)</b> exchanges and optional on digital (tone mode dialing) exchanges.|$|R
50|$|A ringer box {{consists}} of bells or gongs and an electromagnetically-driven clapper which strikes the gongs when actuated. The electromagnet of the clapper {{responds to the}} alternating current sent from a central office exchange or another phone via the telephone network wiring. The direct current required by the telephone's audio circuitry is blocked with a capacitor before entering the ringer to prevent the ringer from being triggered by circuit interruptions and <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> Typical ring voltages {{are in the range}} from 60 to over 100 Volts, and alternate at a frequency of 20-30 Hertz.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{service codes}} {{may also be}} {{considered}} as abbreviated dialing, though these prefix the special touch-tone characters * and # (or often 11 for <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing)</b> instead of using only numerals. Most are used to access calling features rather than a called party, and some are specific to each telephone company. Some are used only locally or regionally (such as *FHP (*347) to reach the Florida Highway Patrol); other codes as short as one numeral (like *1) are used to report breaking news or traffic to the newsrooms of local news radio or TV stations.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a brief {{excursion}} from standards, GPO telecoms {{introduced in}} 1967 their first push-button telephone, the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series [...] ), that used neither <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required an ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. The irony was that the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX.|$|R

50|$|The {{most complex}} {{internal}} part was the rotary dial mechanism, an assembly of gears, cams, springs, and electrical contacts which mechanically generated a timed train of line loop-break <b>pulses</b> when the <b>dial</b> finger wheel was released after rotation. During {{the period of}} dial rotation, the receiver was shunted to avoid hearing the <b>dialing</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending <b>dial</b> <b>pulses,</b> equivalent to a rotary <b>dial's</b> <b>pulsing,</b> but sent over trunk circuits between switches.|$|R
50|$|A {{calling party}} wishing {{to speak to}} another party {{will pick up the}} telephone's handset, thereby {{operating}} a lever which closes the switchhook (A4), which powers the telephone by connecting the transmitter (microphone), receiver (speaker), and related audio components to the line. The off-hook circuitry has a low resistance (less than 300 ohms) which causes a direct current (DC), which comes down the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends a dial tone to indicate readiness. On a modern push-button telephone, the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the called party. The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that makes DTMF tones that the exchange receives. A rotary-dial telephone uses <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> sending electrical <b>pulses,</b> that the exchange can count to get the telephone number (as of 2010 many exchanges were still equipped to handle <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing).</b> If the called party's line is available, the exchange sends an intermittent ringing signal (about 75 volts alternating current (AC) in North America and UK and 60 volts in Germany) to alert the called party to an incoming call. If the called party's line is in use, the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party. However, if the called party's line is in use but has call waiting installed, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate an incoming call.|$|R
50|$|When announced, the DTMF {{technology}} {{was not immediately}} available on all switching systems. The circuits of subscribers requesting the feature often had to be moved from older switches that supported only <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> to a newer crossbar, or later an electronic switching system, requiring the assignment of a new telephone number which was billed at a higher monthly rate. Community dial office subscribers would often find the service initially unavailable as these villages were served by a single unattended exchange, often step by step, with service from a foreign exchange impractically expensive. Rural party line service was typically based on mechanical switching equipment {{which could not be}} upgraded.|$|R
50|$|Western Electric experimented {{as early}} as 1941 with methods of using {{mechanically}} activated reeds to produce two tones {{for each of the}} ten digits and by the late 1940s such technology was field-tested in a No. 5 Crossbar switching system in Pennsylvania. But the technology proved unreliable and it was not until long after the invention of the transistor when push-button technology matured. On 18 November 1963, after approximately three years of customer testing, the Bell System in the United States officially introduced dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under its registered Touch-Tone mark. Over the next few decades touch-tone service replaced traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> technology and it eventually became a world-wide standard for telecommunication signaling.|$|R
