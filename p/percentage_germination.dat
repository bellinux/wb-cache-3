50|$|A {{fluorescein}} diacetate (FDA) biochemical {{viability test}} for {{several species of}} conifer seed, including white spruce, estimates the proportion of live seed (viability) in a seedlot, and hence the <b>percentage</b> <b>germination</b> of a seedlot. The accuracy of predicting <b>percentage</b> <b>germination</b> was within +/- 5 for most seedlots. White spruce seed can be tested for viability by an indirect method, such as the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test or ‘Ultra-sound'; or by the direct growth method of ‘germination'. Samples of white spruce seed inspected by Toumey and Stevens (1928) varied in viability from 50% to 100%, but averaged 93%. Rafn (1915) reported 97% viability for white spruce seed.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of seed germination ecology of weeds {{can assist in}} predicting their potential distribution and developing effective management strategies. Influence of environmental factors and seed size on germination and seedling emergence of Convolvulus arvensis (field bindweed) was studied in laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Germination occurred {{over a wide range}} of constant temperatures, between 15 and 40 ºC, with optimum germination between 20 and 25 ºC. Time to start germination, time to 50 % germination and mean germination time increased while <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index decreased with an increase in temperature from 20 ºC, salinity and osmotic stress. However, germination was tolerant to low salt (25 mM) or osmotic stress (0. 2 MPa), but as salinity and osmotic stress increased, <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index decreased. Seeds of C. arvensis placed at soil surface showed maximum emergence and decreased as seeding depth increased. Seeds of C. arvensis germinated over a wide range of pH (4 to 9) but optimum germination occurred at pH 6 to 8. Under highly alkaline and acidic pH, time to start germination, time to 50 % germination and mean germination time increased while <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index decreased. Increase in field capacity caused decreased time to start germination, time to 50 % germination and mean germination time but increased <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index. Bigger seeds had low time to start germination, time to 50 % germination and mean germination time but high <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index. Smaller seeds were more sensitive to environmental factors as compared to larger or medium seeds. It can be concluded that except for pH, all environmental factors and seed sizes adversely affect C. arvensis as regards seed germination or emergence and germination or emergence traits, and larger seeds result in improved stand establishment and faster germination than small seeds, regardless of moisture stress or deeper seeding depth...|$|R

In this study the non-standard germination conditions (suboptimal temperature and salt stress) were evaluated for their possible use as a vigour test in pepper. 11 pepper cultivars grown widely in Turkey were germinated at solutions containing 0, 85, 170 and 215 mM NaCl (salt stress) for 14 days in 20 °C. Seeds of 11 pepper cultivars were also germinated at 14 °C (suboptimal temperature). <b>Germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> rate were determined during the <b>germination.</b> <b>Germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> rate were decreased with the increasing NaCl concentrations and in 14 °C compared to the control conditions.

Seed from a single genetic line were grown under field, greenhouse and controlled environment growth chamber conditions. At abscission, a small fraction (< 10 %) of S. faberi seed germinated under favorable conditions. Seed were dissected and germination of caryopses and embryos also tested. Removal of seed structures exterior to the embryo increased <b>percentage</b> <b>germination.</b> As the seed rain progressed mean <b>percentage</b> <b>germination</b> and variation among samples increased. Changes in germination were correlated with tiller development and relative time of seed maturity within a panicle.

Seed that matured later on a panicle were more likely to germinate than seed that matured earlier on the same panicle. A consistent trend toward later maturing seed having less dormancy was found for seed grown under different environments which implies an inherent or parental source for variation in giant foxtail seed dormancy.

The influence of relative humidity on the viability of the urediniospores of Puccinia graminis tritici Form III is very pronounced and closely associated with temperature. 2. At high relative humidities, depending somewhat on the temperature, the <b>percentage</b> of <b>germination</b> is low and the period over which the spores are viable is very short. 3. The same relation exists at the low relative humidities except that it is not so pronounced and is more variable. 4. The highest <b>percentage</b> of <b>germination</b> and the longest viable period of the spores occur at the medium relative humidities. High temperatures lower the <b>percentage</b> of <b>germination</b> and shorten the viable period while at low temperatures the opposite occurs, at the medium relative humidities...|$|R
40|$|In four grasspea {{varieties}} include ardabil, sharekord, mashhad and zanjan, {{the effects}} of different salinity concentrations on seed germination percent, proline concentration, malondialdehyde (MDA), germination index, radicle and hypocotyl length and weight were studied. Result showed that salinity had significant effects on seed <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> and <b>germination</b> index. The most and least of <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> were observed in 6 and 18 dS m - 1, respectively. Salinity had significantly effect on radicle and hypocotyl length, dry and fresh weight, MDA and proline concentration of seedlings. Salinity had not effect on dry weight of seedling. Increasing salinity reduced radicle and hypocotyl length, dry and fresh weight of seedlings and enhanced proline and malondialdehyde in them. Sharkord cultivar had the most <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> at 18 dS m - 1 sodium chloride. Sharkord and ardabil varieties were the most tolerance and sensitive varieties to salinity stress, respectively...|$|R
30|$|The <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> of {{the active}} {{components}} at concentrations of 1.0 and 0.1  mg/Petri dish were expressed relative to the percentages of the controls for the R. sativus and B. rapa seeds (Figs.  2, 3). With the exception of terpinolene, the <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> of the hydrocarbon type monoterpenes for the R. sativus and B. rapa seeds at a concentration of 0.1  mg/Petri dish were almost identical {{to those of the}} control. The <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> of the R. sativus seeds in the presence of thymol at a concentration of 0.1  mg/Petri dish was 68.9  %, revealing that thymol exhibited a negligible inhibitory effect on the seed germination process. It was recognized that the hydrocarbons and phenols showed only weak or no inhibitory activity against both types of seeds. Of the alcohols at a concentration of 0.1  mg/Petri dish, (−)-terpinen- 4 -ol, (−)-carveol and (−)-menthol showed inhibitory effects on the R. sativus seeds, with <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> of 14.4, 27.0 and 37.8  %, respectively. The <b>percentage</b> of <b>germination</b> in the B. rapa seeds in the presence of isopulegol and (−)-dihydrocarveol were 27.3 and 29.1  %, respectively. The inhibitory effects of these compounds were relatively high compared to those of the other alcohols. The <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> of the R. sativus seeds in the compounds containing ketones at a concentration of 0.1  mg/Petri dish were 18.9, 20.0 and 31.1  % for piperitone, (+)-pulegone and (−)-carvone, respectively. The <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> of the B. rapa seeds in the presence of (+)-pulegone and piperitone were 21.6 and 27.3  %, respectively. Taken together, these data demonstrate that all of the ketone containing compounds exhibited significant inhibitory effects against both types of seeds.|$|R
