However, it is surprising that neither the academic nor the international development community has as of yet, systematically examined the influence of international inequalities upon poverty and conflict. The project proposes that the prevalence of poverty and conflict is strongly conditioned by countries' position within the international economic system. The nature of a country's economic ties with the rest of the world - often deeply unequal - can create significant dependencies and / or incentives to challenge the status quo, resulting in poverty-provoked violence. The <b>project</b> uses <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> and matching methods. The <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> is used to map out key international economic networks (aid, trade, and FDI) and generate measures of countries' direct and indirect relations with other states plus their position within the overall structure. These network measures are then used in a statistical method of matching countries to infer whether dependent countries are more likely to succumb to poverty-provoked conflict. The findings from the project will identify the extent to which international inequality traps lead to poverty and conflict traps in developing countries, and help to draw out the policy implications of this...|$|R

40|$|Activities of {{a project}} often must be {{scheduled}} under limited resources. In general, {{the aim of the}} scheduling task is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the project duration. However, obtaining feasible and optimal schedule for most practical problems have been computationally intractable. Therefore attention has been focused on heuristic procedures for solving such problems. ^ This dissertation presents a heuristic procedure (SEARCH) for project scheduling under single resource constraint. The procedure takes into consideration three basic factors in deciding the priority of an activity: activity time, activity resource, and activity location in the network. Furthermore, five new measures of performance are proposed. They are resource utilization, project delay, resource range, number of iteration, and deviation from the best answer. ^ The proposed measures of performance are used to study the scheduling ability of the developed procedure using two published sets of <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> An <b>analysis</b> of variance is also used to study the relationship between the <b>project</b> duration and <b>network</b> topologies, resource levels, and the scheduling method employed. The results indicate that the network structure is the most significant factor affecting project duration. It is also found that although none of the existing or the proposed heuristic procedures perform consistently well {{for a wide variety of}} <b>project</b> <b>network</b> topologies and resource levels, yet the proposed heuristic gives, in most of the networks tested, better results compared to the other techniques. ...|$|R

Little empirical research exists about how information and communication (ICT) affects the network structure and social capital in rural communities.

Research shows that the idiosyncrasies of participants, their roles {{in the system and}} the contextual differences between sections of the industry make this a highly complex problem. There is considerable evidence that informal social networks {{play a key role in}} diffusion of innovations. The aim is to identify informal communication <b>networks</b> of <b>project</b> participants and the role these play in the diffusion of construction innovations. The characteristics of this network will be analysed in order to understand how they can be used to accelerate innovation diffusion within and between <b>projects.</b> Social <b>Network</b> <b>Analysis</b> is used to determine informal communication routes. Control and experiment case study projects are used within two different organizations. This allows informal communication routes concerning innovations to be mapped, whilst testing if the informal routes can facilitate diffusion. Analysis will focus upon understanding the combination of informal strong and weak ties, and how these impede or facilitate the diffusion of the innovation. Initial work suggests the presence of an informal communication network. Actors within this informal network, and the organization's management are unaware of its' existence and their informal roles within it. Thus, the network remains an untapped medium regarding innovation diffusion. It is proposed that successful innovation diffusion is dependent upon understanding informal strong and weak ties, at project, organization and industry level...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technics}} {{of project}} stakeholder management are analyzing a dyadic relation and engagement with stakeholders {{based on their}} individual attributes. However in real world you can hardly find isolated relations. Based on Social <b>Network</b> <b>Analysis</b> (SNA) any change in one relation has ramifications on others. Therefore {{it can be said}} that the interaction of different actors and specially the project manager with the other actors need to be considered more. Those who implement project stakeholder analysis need to go beyond studying single actors, two-person ties, and small groups to examining the computer-supported project-networks that flourish in complex projects like construction <b>projects.</b> Social <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> looks at the power of the individuals from their position in the net and their relations. The behavior of individuals to a large extend is defined by their network attributes rather than individual characteristics. This thesis is an attempt to bring the influence of relations to stakeholder management. Here I have taken an endeavor to use SNA to study stakeholder networks beyond dyadic relations. In theory chapter, the current project stakeholder management and analytical tools for that purpose is presented. Also it shows that to what extent current methods of analysis are based on individual attributes of stakeholders. This paper?s focus is not going deep in to speaking of stakeholder?s stake. It is about facilitating project stakeholder management with SNA. Therefore here three quite new tools and frameworks are introduced based on the research done during writing the thesis. Also the economics of being transparent and ethical for has been discussed. In a new tool I use each stakeholder centrality and network density to categorize individual stakeholders and based on this categorization we can analyze stakeholders and strategize for managing them. The tools (power- interest grid of social networks, table of meditating local networks dynamics and Density-Centrality grid of stakeholder management) that I have tried to start developing here, relies on social network constructs and is an initial attempt to consider not only the dyadic relations with stakeholders but also the influence of the multiple interactions comprising stakeholder environments on each other?s behaviors, project management and project itself. This thesis states that by studying stakeholders in isolation we lose some part of information that are unsorted and consequently we cannot retrieve invaluable information that are critical for successful project stakeholder management. But SNA can be utilized to sort this information and help the project manager to analyze and strategize within <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> </p...|$|R

In addition, during the process of investigating patterned high-critical-temperature superconductors, several non-contacting techniques for the determination of the transport properties of high T(sub c) films were developed and implemented. These are a transient, optical pump-probe, time-resolved reflectivity experiment, an impulsive-stimulated Raman scattering experiment, and a terahertz-beam coherent-spectroscopy experiment.

The results showed a significant difference in constructors&# 039; degree centrality for cases with high and low risk control efficacy scores. Constructors had significantly higher degree centrality in cases with high compared to low quality OSH risk control outcomes. The results provide preliminary evidence that integrating construction process knowledge into pre-construction decision-making produces better OSH outcomes. The research also highlights the potential usefulness of social <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>network</b> metrics in OSH performance measurement and benchmarking...|$|R

40|$|Engaging {{the right}} {{stakeholders}} {{at the right}} time is a key factor to successfully complete a construction project. However, the decision which stakeholders to engage within a project can often be difficult. This research looks into the applicability of visualizations of Social Networks as a tool to support project managers to decide which stakeholders to engage and with consecutively engaging these chosen stakeholders. To provide empirical evidence for the utility of Social <b>Network</b> <b>Analysis,</b> we conducted a case study on a public-private redevelopment project in the Netherlands. The findings from this case study show that representations of social <b>networks</b> give <b>project</b> managers a quick overview of the cliques, key players, and the general position of stakeholders in the social <b>project</b> <b>network.</b> This overview helped the project managers to identify which stakeholders to engage. At the same time, our findings show that visual representations of social networks help to engage stakeholders by giving them clear insights into their respective position in the social <b>project</b> <b>network.</b> Overall, the study illustrates the utility of social network visualizations to understand and engage stakeholders on public-private construction and design projects...|$|R
