25|$|Home shrines can be {{as simple}} or as {{elaborate}} as the householder can afford.

The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a tray with puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it.

25|$|Once selected, {{the cast}} were {{gathered}} together and told by Hiroi and Tanaka of their goals, along with being handed <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> respective characters. The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato, who followed Hiroi's {{request that the}} characters be portrayed as real people. Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and being told {{it was just one}} third of the entire script. Sato's instruction to the cast was that they would be the characters' main emotive force as their faces would not move much. Sakura was the last character to be recorded, so Sato could concentrate on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire. The sheer amount of voice acting was the main reason the game was delayed.|$|E

500|$|Originally, the {{character}} resembled a [...] "burlier leading man", described by Greno as [...] "a muscular commoner/farm boy". However, the directors had always envisioned Flynn as [...] "a dashing thief". To {{assist with the}} development of Flynn's design, Howard and Greno held a large meeting with thirty of Tangleds female employees. Calling it the [...] "Hot Man Meeting", the employees were encouraged to [...] "bring in <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> favorite hunky men". The Hot Man Meeting was created because the directors, who found that they were very much impressed with Rapunzel's design, felt that [...] "Flynn [...] to be up to [...] level". Greno described the Hot Man Meeting as [...] "crazy", elaborating, [...] "Photos of all the hottest men in Hollywood [...] being thrown around a room. Photos being torn in half and pasted back together. Eyes were ripped from one picture and put on another. Heads were torn from photos," [...] concluding, [...] "I've never seen anything like it." [...] Howard cited American actor Clark Gable and English footballer David Beckham among several celebrities by whom Flynn was influenced during the meeting, joking that the employees eventually [...] "started using Nathan and me as examples of what not to do".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the applause}} {{given to the}} Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 {{magazine}} Propaganda called the result [...] "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It {{was one of those}} ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know – but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E

2500|$|Many brands are now heavily {{using this}} mobile app {{to boost their}} {{marketing}} strategy. Instagram {{can be used to}} gain the necessary momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smartphone users. Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: Starbucks, MTV, Nike, Marc Jacobs, and Red Bull are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with Harper's Bazaar to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose [...] "outfit of the day" [...] photos on Snapchat get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture. According to Harper's Bazaar, industry estimates say that brands are spending more than $1 billion per year on consumer-generated advertising. Founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom even went to Paris Fashion week, going to couture shows and meeting with designers to learn more about how style bloggers, editors, and designers are currently dominating much of the content on his application.|$|E
