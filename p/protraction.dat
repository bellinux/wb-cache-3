The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. <b>Protraction</b> (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|To some extent, the {{difficulties}} both Gebhard and Ernst faced {{in winning the}} war were the same the Spanish had in subduing the Dutch Revolt. The <b>protraction</b> of the Spanish and Dutch war—80 years of bitter fighting interrupted by periodic truces while both sides gathered resources—lay {{in the kind of}} war it was: Enemies lived in fortified towns defended by Italian-style bastions, which meant the towns had to be taken and then fortified and maintained. For both Gebhard and Ernst, as for the Spanish commanders in the nearby Lowlands, winning the war meant not only mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless cycle of enemy artillery fortresses, but also maintaining the army one had and defending all one's own possessions as they were acquired. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt in that respect, was also a war of sieges, not of assembled armies facing one another on the field of battle, nor of maneuver, feint, and parry that characterized wars two centuries earlier and later. These wars required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating. The Spanish faced another problem, distance, which gave them a distinct interest in intervening in the Cologne affair: the Electorate lay on the Rhine River, and the Spanish road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{evolutionary}} {{success of}} macrostomatan (enlarged-gape) snakes has {{been attributed to}} their ability to consume large prey, in turn made possible by their highly kinetic skulls. However, prey can be ‘‘large’’ in several ways, and we have little insight into which aspects of prey size and shape affect skull function during feeding. We used X-ray videos of broad-banded water snakes (Nerodia fasciata) feeding on both frogs and fish to quantify movements of the jaw elements during prey transport, and of the anterior vertebral column during post-cranial swallowing. In a sample of additional individuals feeding on both frogs and fish, we measured the time and the number of jaw <b>protractions</b> needed to transport prey through the buccal cavity. Prey type (fish vs. frog) did not influence transport kinemat-ics, but did influence transport performance. Further-more, wider and taller prey induced greater movements of most cranial elements, but wider prey were trans-ported with significantly less anterior vertebral bending. In the performance trials, heavier, shorter, and wider prey took significantly more time and a greater number of jaw <b>protractions</b> to ingest. Thus, the functional challenges involved in prey transport depend not only upon prey mass, but also prey type (fish vs. frog) and prey shape (relative height, width and length), suggesting that {{from the perspective of a}} gape-limited predator, the difficulty of prey ingestion depends upon multiple aspects of prey size...|$|R

40|$|Active sensing, which {{incorporates}} closed-loop behavioral {{selection of}} information during sensory acquisition, {{is an important}} feature of many sensory modalities. We used the rodent whisker tactile system as a platform for studying the role cortical sensory areas play in coordinating active sensing motions. We examined head and whisker motions of freely moving mice performing a tactile search for a randomly located reward, and found that mice select from a diverse range of available active sensing strategies. In particular, mice selectively employed a strategy we term contact maintenance, where whisking is modulated to counteract head motion and sustain repeated contacts, but only when doing so {{is likely to be}} useful for obtaining reward. The context dependent selection of sensing strategies, along with the observation of whisker repositioning prior to head motion, suggests the possibility of higher level control, beyond simple reflexive mechanisms. In order to further investigate a possible role for primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in coordinating whisk-by-whisk motion, we delivered closed-loop optogenetic feedback to SI, time locked to whisker motions estimated through facial electromyography. We found that stimulation regularized whisking (increasing overall periodicity), and shifted whisking frequency, changes that emulate behaviors of rodents actively contacting objects. Importantly, we observed changes to whisk timing only for stimulation locked to whisker <b>protractions,</b> possibly encoding that natural contacts are more likely during forward motion of the whiskers. Simultaneous neural recordings from SI show cyclic changes in excitability, specifically that responses to excitatory stimulation locked to whisker retractions appeared suppressed in contrast to stimulation during <b>protractions</b> that resulted in changes to whisk timing. Both effects are evident within single whisks. These findings support a role for sensory cortex in guiding whisk-by-whisk motor outputs, but suggest a coupling that depends on behavioral context, occurring on multiple timescales. Elucidating a role for sensory cortex in motor outputs is important to understanding active sensing, and may further provide novel insights to guide the design of sensory neuroprostheses that exploit active sensing context...|$|R
40|$|Active sensing {{requires}} {{the brain to}} distinguish signals produced by external inputs from those generated by the animal's own movements. Because the rodent whisker musculature lacks proprioceptors, we asked whether trigeminal ganglion neurons encode the kinematics of the rat's own whisker movements in air. By examining the role of kinematics, we have extended previous findings showing that many neurons that respond during such movements do not do so consistently. Nevertheless, the majority (∼ 70 %) of trigeminal ganglion neurons display significant correlations between firing rate and a kinematic parameter, and a subset, ∼ 30 %, represent kinematics with high reliability. Preferential firing to movement direction was observed but was strongly modulated by movement amplitude and speed. However, {{in contrast to the}} precise time-locking that occurs in response to active whisker contacts, whisker movements in air generate temporally dispersed responses that are not time-locked to the onset of either <b>protractions</b> or retractions...|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the ancestral escape {{mechanism}} was most likely a backwards jump due to the simultaneous <b>protraction</b> of the legs driven by the ancestors of the Giant Fibers.

It is likely that this mechanism {{was replaced by the}} tail flip since the wide surface area of the tail made this behavior more selectively advantageous. This most likely occurred when the ancestral flexor motor neurons in each segment formed connections with one of these limb motor neurons. The Squilla mechanism seems be similar to this ancestral state because [...] a large diameter axon in the dorsal nerve chord facilitates limb promoter motor neurons. This seems to match the ancestral condition, but it is not known for sure whether the circuitry is homologous.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [59]- 66) In this thesis, I describe {{patterns of}} sexual and microgeographical variation in body size and relative head dimensions among island populations of water snakes (Nerodia sipedon). Female water snakes had bigger bodies and relatively larger heads than male snakes. There {{were significant differences}} among islands in relative head dimensions but not in body size. There was a significant positive correlation between physical condition and relative jaw length in both males and females. Furthermore, path analysis revealed that the total effects of all head dimensions on physical condition were positive, suggesting that head size has an observable effect on fitness. To test whether some {{of the variation in}} body size and relative head size may be a phenotypically plastic response to feeding experience in snakes, I assigned neonate N. sipedon from four litters (N = 48) to two feeding treatment groups: large fish versus small fish. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant effects of treatment, sex, and Utter on body size. Repeated measures MANCOVA (with body length as the covariate) also revealed a significant litter effect on change in head dimensions. The multivariate effect of feeding treatment on head dimensions approached statistical significance (P = 0. 102), while the univariate effect of feeding treatment was significant for jaw length (P = 0. 010). Snakes offered large fish increased in body size and relative jaw length more than snakes offered small fish. Also, females increased in body size significantly faster than males. To investigate whether the observed variation in head size has an effect on swallowing performance, I investigated whether individual snakes differ in their ability to swallow prey, and whether this variation in swallowing ability is correlated with variation of trophic structures. An ANCOVA (with prey size as the covariate) revealed that larger prey items took longer to ingest than smaller prey. There was a significant effect of snake identity on swallowing performance (measured as number of mandibular <b>protractions).</b> Spearman rank correlation of expected number of mandibular <b>protractions</b> with relative jaw length was negative (rs = - 0. 39) and approached significance (P = 0. 08), suggesting that relative jaw length may influence swallowing performance.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of gait {{generation}} for a six-legged robot walking on irregular terrain and subject to changes in speed and direction commanded by a human driver or by an independent, higher-level decision process. 1 Introduction A fundamental issue in the control of a walking robot is that of gait generation, that is, the determination of the movement each leg must perform to follow a desired trajectory. In the particular case of a straight line trajectory on completely flat ground, gait generation reduces, in practice, to the determination of a gait pattern, which involves only the relative times at which each leg leaves and reaches the ground or, more precisely, the relative times at which each leg begins its recover and support phases.

40|$|Whisking {{mediated}} {{touch is}} an active sense whereby whisker movements are modulated by sensory input and behavioral context. Here we studied the effects of touching an object on whisking in head-fixed rats. Simultaneous movements of whiskers C 1, C 2, and D 1 were tracked bilaterally and their movements compared. During free-air whisking, whisker <b>protractions</b> were typically characterized by a single acceleration-deceleration event, whisking amplitude and velocity were correlated, and whisk duration correlated with neither amplitude nor velocity. Upon contact with an object, a second acceleration-deceleration event occurred in about 25 % of whisk cycles, involving both contacting (C 2) and non-contacting (C 1, D 1) whiskers ipsilateral to the object. In these cases, the rostral whisker (C 2) remained {{in contact with the}} object throughout the double-peak phase, which effectively prolonged the duration of C 2 contact. These "touch-induced pumps" (TIPs) were detected, on average, 17. 9 ms after contact. On a slower time scale, starting at the cycle following first touch, contralateral amplitude increased while ipsilateral amplitude decreased. Our results demonstrate that sensory-induced motor modulations occur at various timescales, and directly affect object palpation...|$|R

40|$|During {{exploratory}} behaviors, {{the velocity}} of an organism’s sensory surfaces can have a large effect on the incoming flow of sensory information. In this study, we quantified variability in the velocity profiles of rat whisking during natural exploratory behavior that included head rotations. A wide continuum of profiles was observed, including monotonic, delayed, and reversing velocities during <b>protractions</b> and retractions. Three alternative hypotheses for {{the function of the}} variable velocity profiles were tested: (1) that they produce bilateral asymmetry specifically correlated with rotational head velocity, (2) that they serve to generate bilaterally asymmetric and/or asynchronous whisker movements independent of head velocity, and (3) that the different pump types – despite increasing variability in instantaneous velocity – reduce variability in the average whisking velocity [...] Our results favor the third hypothesis and do not support the first two. Specifically, the velocity variability within a whisk can be observed as a shift in the phase of the maximum velocity. We discuss the implications of these results for the control of whisker motion, horizontal object localization, and processing in the thalamus and cortex of the rat vibrissal system.

40|$|Some rodent species show rhythmic {{bouts of}} vibrissal <b>protractions</b> and retractions, {{referred}} to as whisking, that are among the fastest movements performed by mammals. To better understand the muscular basis of whisking, we compared (1) whisker movements of two whisking species (mouse, rat) and a non-whisking species (guinea pig), (2) the muscle fiber composition of intrinsic whisker muscles of whisking and a non-whisking species, and (3) the muscle fiber composition of intrinsic whisker muscles and of selected skeletal muscles. Using high-speed videography, we found that mice, rats, and guinea pigs can generate fast and large-amplitude whisker movements. Guinea pigs do not show bouts of fast, strictly rhythmic whisker movements, and the average speed of their whisker movements is much lower than in mice and rats. Analysis of mRNA expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms, myofibrillar ATPase staining, and antibody labeling indicate that in all three species intrinsic whisker muscles are composed predominantly of type 2 B muscle fibers. Intrinsic whisker muscles of mice consisted of type 2 B (� 90 %) and type 2 D fibers. In rats we observed, in addition to type 2 B/ 2 D fibers, � 10 % of slow type 1 fibers, and in guinea pigs we observed � 3 % of slow type 1 fibers and 20 % of type 2 A fibers.

5000|$|In rats, whisking {{movements}} {{occur in}} bouts of variable duration at rates between 3 and 25 whisks/second. [...] The movements have an amplitude over a range from ∼10 to 100°, {{at an average}} <b>protraction</b> velocity of ∼1000°/sec, and at a predominant frequency of 5-7 Hz. [...] Three types of whisk are described, single, delayed (there is an inflection point somewhere in the whisk's velocity) or double-pumped (slight retraction {{in the middle of}} the whisk followed by <b>protraction</b> to complete the whisk cycle).|$|E
