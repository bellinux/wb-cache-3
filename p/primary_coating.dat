40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{delamination}} of polymeric coatings from glass fibers, temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be always smaller than its interfacial shear strength {{in a long}} time.

The thickness of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> can be increased if the spring constant of the optical fiber is selected to prevent low temperature microbending of the glass fiber. Meanwhile, Poisson's ratio of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be selected to be very close to 0. 5.

40|$|Caveolin- 1, the <b>primary</b> <b>coat</b> protein of caveolae, {{has been}} implicated as a {{regulator}} of signal transduction through binding of its "scaffolding domain" to key signaling molecules. However, the physiological importance of caveolin- 1 in regulating signaling {{has been difficult}} to distinguish from its traditional functions in caveolae assembly, transcytosis, and cholesterol transport. To directly address the importance of the caveolin scaffolding domain in vivo, we generated a chimeric peptide with a cellular internalization sequence fused to the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain (amino acids 82 - 101). The chimeric peptide was efficiently taken up into blood vessels and endothelial cells, resulting in selective inhibition of acetylcholine (Ach) -induced vasodilation and nitric oxide (NO) production, respectively. More importantly, systemic administration of the peptide to mice suppressed acute inflammation and vascular leak to the same extent as a glucocorticoid or an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor. These data imply that the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain can selectively regulate signal transduction to eNOS in endothelial cells and that small-molecule mimicry of this domain may provide a new therapeutic approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the interfacial shear strength between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> in double-coated optical fibers on humidity and temperature is experimentally investigated. The interfacial shear strength is determined from the mechanical stripping force. The effect of humidity on the interfacial shear strength is governed by the diffusion of water vapor through the polymeric coatings to the interface between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating.</b> After several days, the diffusion of water vapor reaches a steady state. The degradation of the interfacial shear strength is unrelated to {{the total amount of}} water vapor in the polymeric coatings, does depend on the amount of water vapor on the glass/polymer interface. Consequently, the degradation of interfacial shear strength caused by the humidity is proportional to the squared cube-root of the water vapor pressure. Results of this study demonstrate that the relationship between the fiber strength and the humidity resembles that between the interfacial shear strength and the humidity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} commercial UV-cured polymeric coatings of optical fibers is evaluated using dynamic mechanic analysis. The {{results indicate that}} relaxation of stresses and/or strains in these coatings occurs by creep deformation. The axial strain-induced viscoelastic stresses in optical fibers are derived from the exact viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coatings. Compressive radial stress on the glass fiber produces microbending losses, and therefore, microbending losses in double-coated optical fibers that are caused by axial strain-induced creep deformation of polymeric coatings are investigated. These microbending losses can be minimized by suitably selecting the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coatings, as follows. The radius, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be increased, but the Young's modulus and relaxation time of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be decreased. The radius, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the secondary coating should be decreased, but the relaxation time of the secondary coating should be increased. When the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coating are chosen to minimize the microbending loss, the thickness and Young's modulus of the secondary coatings should {{be large enough to}} withstand an external mechanical force.

We show that delivery of Cav- 1 amino acids 82 - 101 (Cav) fused to an internalization sequence from Antennapedia (AP) blocks NO release in vitro and inflammation and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. To characterize the molecular {{mechanism by which}} the AP-Cav peptide and Cav- 1 mediate eNOS inhibition, we subdivided the Cav portion of AP-Cav into three domains (Cav-A, -B, and -C), synthesized five overlapping peptides (AP-Cav-A, -AB, -B, -BC, and -C), and tested their effects on eNOS-dependent activities. Peptides containing the Cav-B domain (amino acids 89 - 95) induced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS-dependent NO release in cultured endothelial cells, NO-dependent inflammation in the ear, and hydraulic conductivity in isolated venules. Alanine scanning of AP-Cav-B revealed that Thr- 90 and - 91 (T 90, 91) and Phe- 92 (F 92) are crucial for AP-Cav-B- and AP-Cav-mediated inhibition of eNOS. Mutation of F 92 to A 92 in the Cav- 1 cDNA caused the loss of eNOS inhibitory activity compared with wild-type Cav- 1.
