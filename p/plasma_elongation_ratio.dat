Tilt stability is predicted, independent of s, for FRC`s with low E(oblate), while the tilt {{stability of}} FRC`s with large E (prolate) depends on s/E. It is found that plasma rotation due to ion diamagnetic drift can stabilize the tilt mode when s/E is {{less than or equal}} to 1. 7. The so-called collisionless ion gyroviscosity also is identified to stabilize tilt when s/E is {{less than or equal to}} 2. 2. Combining these two effects, the stability regime broadens to s/E is less than or equal to 2. 8, consistent with previously developed theories. A small additional rotation (e. g., a Mach number of 0. 2) can improve tilt stability significantly at large E. A similar approach is taken to study the physics of the shift stability. It is found that radial shift is unstable when E is 1. However, unlike tilt stability, gyroviscosity has little effect onshift stability...|$|R

Several international manuals/guidelines explicitly state that elongation improves the legibility distance of pavement markings. Furthermore, some countries use greater <b>elongation</b> <b>ratios</b> on roadways with higher speed limits, while some others use a single <b>elongation</b> <b>ratio</b> regardless of the speed limit of the roadway. Therefore, research is needed to explore the relationship between speed and <b>elongation</b> <b>ratio.</b> Most of the available research on this topic has used stationary observers rather than subjects driving at posted roadway speeds, which makes a full-scale driving simulator an invaluable tool to study the effects of sign elongation on recognition distance while driving. Sixteen drivers, between the ages of 21 and 54, participated in the driving simulator study. Five <b>elongation</b> <b>ratios</b> that were tested in the driving simulator, 1 : 1, 1 : 2. 5, 1 : 5, 1 : 7. 5 and 1 : 10. The ?Curve? (W 1 - 2) sign, ?Speed Limit? (R 2 - 1) sign, and ?Pedestrian Crossing? (W 11 - 2) sign were chosen for this research. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the effect of <b>elongation</b> <b>ratio</b> on recognition distance through a random effects linear model. All variables were initially included and through the procedure it was found that age, gender, years of driving experience, and if the participant wore corrective lenses were not statistically significant covariates.

The relationship between recognition distance and <b>elongation</b> <b>ratio</b> was found to be a quadratic function. While sign type is statistically significant, it is not meaningful for real world applications, therefore, the model was adjusted to be useful for all sign types.

Positive correlation (r = 0. 59, p <= 0. 05)) was observed between aroma and kernel elongation in these selected 10 genotypes.
