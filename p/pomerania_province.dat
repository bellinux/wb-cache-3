500|$|In 1914 Dmowski {{praised the}} Grand Duke Nicholas's Manifesto to the Polish Nation of 14 August, which vaguely assured the Tsar's Polish {{subjects}} {{that there would}} be greater autonomy for [...] "Congress Poland" [...] after the war, and that the Austrian provinces of East and West Galicia, together with the <b>Pomerania</b> <b>province</b> of Prussia, would be annexed to the Kingdom of Poland when the German Empire and Austria-Hungary were defeated. However, subsequent attempts on the part of Dmowski to have the Russians make firmer commitments {{along the lines of the}} Grand Duke Nicholas's manifesto were met with elusive answers. Nonetheless, Dmowski's pro-Russian and anti-German propaganda succeeded in frustrating Piłsudski's plans of causing an anti-Russian uprising, and bolstered his position as an important Polish political figure on the international scene, especially with the Triple Entente. In November he became one of the active members of the Polish National Committee.|$|E

50|$|The Great Northern War had now entered {{upon its}} later stage, when Sweden, beset {{on every side}} by foes, {{employed}} her fleet principally to transport troops and stores to the distressed Swedish <b>Pomerania</b> <b>provinces.</b> The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point.

He {{was a part of}} Gyldenløve's fleet which succeeded in destroying a large number of Swedish transport ships at Rügen on 29 September 1712, and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to Captain Lieutenant.

In turn for their support in the Thirteen Years' War, the Griffin dukes in 1455 gained the Pomerelian Lauenburg and Bütow Land as a Polish fief, which upon the extinction of the dynasty in 1637 fell back to the Polish Crown and by the 1657 Treaty of Bromberg {{was given to the}} Brandenburg margraves, who also ruled over the adjacent Imperial <b>Pomerania</b> <b>Province.</b>|$|E

After World War I Pomerania was divided between Poland and Germany. After the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II as Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia, Western Pomerania was part of the Free State of Prussia within the Weimar Republic, while the eastern part (Pomerelia) became a part of Poland, and organized into the Pomeranian Voivodeship.
