Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} an algebraic version of Lagrangian Floer homology for immersed curves inside the <b>pillowcase.</b> We first associate to the <b>pillowcase</b> an algebra A. Then to an immersed curve L inside the <b>pillowcase</b> we associate an A infinity module M(L) over A. Then we prove that Lagrangian Floer homology HF(L,L') is isomorphic to a suitable algebraic pairing of modules M(L) and M(L'). This extends the <b>pillowcase</b> homology construction - given a 2 -stranded tangle inside a 3 -ball, if one obtains an immersed unobstructed Lagrangian inside the <b>pillowcase,</b> one can further associate an A infinity module to that Lagrangian.

25|$|A {{vacuum cleaner}} uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's <b>pillowcases</b> to serve as the dust bag.|$|E

Mortal hands could not lay spread smoother, adjust pillows more accurately, sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly, than Topsy, when she chose,--but she didn't very often choose. If Miss Ophelia, after three or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as to suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do without over-looking, and so go off and busy herself about something else, Topsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two hours. Instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the <b>pillowcases,</b> butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it would sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various directions; she would climb the posts, and hang head downward from the tops; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment; dress the bolster up in Miss Ophelia's night-clothes, and enact various performances with that,--singing and whistling, and making grimaces at herself in the looking-glass; in short, as Miss Ophelia phrased it, [...] "raising Cain" [...] generally.|$|E

Using the Earth Ambulance, Aylon gathered dirt from Strategic Air Command nuclear bases, uranium mines, and nuclear reactors from across the United States. She stuffed the dirt into <b>pillowcases</b> and used them in a demonstration at the United Nations during the Second Special Session on Nuclear Disarmament on June 12, 1982.

In 1992, to celebrate the end of the Cold War, she installed a seed-filled ambulance at the Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage, an alternative space in New York City. <b>Pillowcases</b> from previous projects were hung around the installation. For her later Bridge of Knots, Aylon created chains of knotted <b>pillowcases,</b> inscribed with dreams and nightmares about nuclear war, which were draped around the façades of the Knoxville Museum of Art in 1993, Berkeley Art Museum in 1995, and American University Museum in 2006.|$|E
