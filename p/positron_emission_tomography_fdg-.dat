40|$|AbstractBackground 2 -[18 F]-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> {{has been}} {{established}} as a standard diagnostic imaging method in the preoperative workup of suspicious pulmonary focal lesions, showing a sensitivity of more than 90 % and a specificity of about 80 %. Determination of malignant pulmonary lesions with FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> depends on the assessment of glucose metabolism. However, false-positive findings can occur in inflammatory processes, such as sarcoidosis or pneumonia. The thymidine analogue 3 -deoxy- 3 [18 F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) is a new <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> tracer that more specifically targets proliferative activity of malignant lesions. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether FLT <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> in comparison with FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> provides additional information in the preoperative workup of central pulmonary focal lesions. MethodsIn this prospective study FLT and FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> examinations were performed as a part of the preoperative workup in 20 patients with histologically confirmed bronchial carcinoma, 7 patients with benign lesions, and 1 patient with an atypical carcinoid. Results were compared with final pathologic findings. ResultsFor staging of the primary tumor, FLT <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> revealed a sensitivity of 86 % and a specificity of 100 % compared with a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 73 % for FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography.</b> For N staging, the sensitivity of FLT <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was 57 % and the specificity was 100 %, and for FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> the sensitivity was 86 % and the specificity was 100 %, respectively. ConclusionsOur preliminary findings indicate specific FLT uptake in malignant lesions. The number of false-positive findings in FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> might be reduced with FLT <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography.</b> Therefore <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> imaging with FLT represents a useful supplement to FDG in assessing the malignancy of central pulmonary focal lesions...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{review the}} current role and the {{limitations}} of F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> {{in the management of}} lymphoma, with a particular focus on studies published since January 2004. RECENT FINDINGS: F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> should be routinely performed at the initial diagnosis of patients with suffering from Hodgkin's disease because it adds useful informations to conventional staging techniques. Residual F-fluorodeoxygenase uptake is an important prognostic factor after one or a few cycles of chemotherapy, but it is clearly too early to change patient treatment on the basis of F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> results. F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> is the best noninvasive imaging technique after treatment; however, it is always indicated to correlate <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> findings with clinical data, other imaging modalities, a biopsy, or all three {{to reduce the risk of}} false positive results. There are some concerns about the positive predictive value of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> after treatment, especially in childhood lymphoma. Clinicians should be aware of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> findings in specific clinical conditions in this patient population. F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> combined with computed tomography offers advantages over the two used separately and read side by side. It may be particularly useful for the planning of radiation therapy or for the planning of a surgical biopsy. Several studies have shown that F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> is definitively superior to Ga scintigraphy. New radiotracers such as F-fluorothymidine may be useful for the noninvasive assessment of proliferation in vivo. SUMMARY: F-fluorodeoxygenase <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> has become the most important nuclear medicine imaging modality in the field of lymphoma. It should be routinely used in the treatment of lymphoma patients. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> {{scanning}} has {{an established}} {{role in the}} diagnostic work-up of many malignant diseases {{and also in the}} evaluation of cancer treatment response. Fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> may, however be non-specific as infectious processes are depicted as well. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with longstanding leg pain and weakness due to plexopathy developed a few years after treatment for prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen was raised and magnetic resonance imaging showed contrast uptake in thickened sacral nerves, suspicious for metastasis. While fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> showed increased uptake in the plexus region, (11) C-Choline- <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> did not show any uptake. It was concluded that the FDG uptake reflected plexus neuritis and no tumor. Treatment for pain relief was started. CONCLUSION: (11) C-Choline- <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> can be used to detect metastasis in patients with plexopathy suspicious for malignancy, while fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> is more sensitive to inflammatory processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and MR in one system is currently emerging and opens up new domains in the functional examinations of living systems. This article reports on relevant influences of a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> insert on MR imaging. The basic conditions of main magnetic field and RF field homogeneity were measured {{as well as}} image quality and signal-to-noise ratio when applying the usual MR sequence types including echo-planar techniques. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> insert on the RF noise level and on RF interferences was measured by comparing results achieved with and without the <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> insert. The temporal stability of EPI imaging with and without the <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> insert was assessed. Small but significant decreases in the signal-to-noise ratio were revealed when the <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> insert was present, whereas B(0) and B(1) homogeneity as well as RF noise level were not adversely affected. A higher signal intensity drift was found for EPI imaging studies; however, this can be compensated by post processing. In summary, this study shows that <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> inserts can be designed for and used within an MR system practically, without substantially affecting the MR image quality...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{accumulation}} of amyloid-β {{is thought to}} be the starting mechanism in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β can be detected by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 42 or amyloid <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> but it is unknown if any of the methods can identify an abnormal amyloid accumulation prior to the other. Our aim was to determine whether cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 42 change before amyloid PET during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. We included 437 non-demented subjects from the prospective, longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. All underwent (18) F-florbetapir <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 42 analysis at baseline and at least one additional <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> after a mean follow-up of 2. 1 years (range 1. 1 - 4. 4 years). Group classifications were based on normal and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> results at baseline. We found that cases with isolated abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β and normal <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> at baseline accumulated amyloid with a mean rate of 1. 2 %/year, which was similar to the rate in cases with both abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (1. 2 %/year, P = 0. 86). The mean accumulation rate of those with isolated abnormal cerebrospinal fluid was more than three times that of those with both normal cerebrospinal fluid and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (0. 35 %/year, P = 0. 018). The group differences were similar when analysing yearly change in standardized uptake value ratio of florbetapir instead of percentage change. Those with both abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> deteriorated more in memory and hippocampal volume compared with the other groups (P < 0. 001), indicating that they were closer to Alzheimer's disease dementia. The results were replicated after adjustments of different factors and when using different cut-offs for amyloid-β abnormality including a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> classification based on the florbetapir uptake in regions where the initial amyloid-β accumulation occurs in Alzheimer's disease. This is the first study to show that individuals who have abnormal cerebrospinal amyloid-β 42 but normal amyloid-β <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> have an increased cortical amyloid-β accumulation rate similar to those with both abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and higher rate than subjects where both modalities are normal. The results indicate that cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 42 becomes abnormal in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, before amyloid <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and before neurodegeneration starts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{examined}} {{the sizes of}} lymph nodes and metastatic foci within the lymph nodes that affect false-positive and false-negative lymph node staging by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> in lung cancer. MethodsPreoperative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> and computed tomography scans were performed for 564 lymph node stations in 80 patients with peripheral-type lung cancer. The sizes of both the lymph nodes and the metastatic foci within the lymph nodes were measured, and these measurements were compared with those obtained with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scanning. To establish general sizes of metastatic foci within the lymph nodes, 277 metastatic lymph nodes in operative specimens previously resected from another 111 patients with lung cancer were examined as a control. ResultsThe sensitivity was significantly higher for <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> than for computed tomographic scanning (P =. 026). The sizes of metastatic foci within lymph nodes that showed false-negative (n = 8) and true-positive (n = 28) with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> ranged from 0. 5 to 9 mm (3 ± 1 mm) and from 4 to 18 mm (10 ± 3 mm), respectively (P <. 001). None of the metastatic foci smaller than 4 mm could be detected with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scanning. The review of the 277 previously resected metastatic lymph nodes showed that 89 (32 %) had metastatic foci smaller than 4 mm. The sizes of true-positive (n = 28) and false-positive (n = 10) lymph nodes ranged from 6 to 15 mm (10 ± 2 mm) and from 9 to 16 mm (12 ± 2 mm), respectively (P <. 01). None of the false-positive lymph nodes was smaller than 9 mm. ConclusionsAlthough <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was superior to computed tomography scanning in lymph node staging in lung cancer, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was unable to distinguish metastatic foci smaller than 4 mm, which were not unusual sizes for lymph node metastases in lung cancer.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPositron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to improve the detection of distant metastases in patients with lung cancer. This study compares the efficacy of PET to mediastinoscopy in mediastinal staging of patients with non–small cell lung cancer. MethodsBetween May 1995 and May 2000, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was performed on 1988 patients with known or suspected non–small cell lung cancer at Duke University Medical Center. Cervical mediastinoscopy was subsequently performed in patients without demonstrable evidence of distant metastases. The efficacy of mediastinal staging was analyzed by comparing the prospective results of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> with the histopathologic results of mediastinoscopy by nodal station. ResultsIn this study 202 patients with non–small cell lung cancer (116 of whom were male) underwent mediastinoscopy after <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography.</b> Of the 65 patients with positive results of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> only 29 patients had positive results of mediastinoscopy in the corresponding nodal station. Of the 137 patients with negative results of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> 16 patients were demonstrated to have N 2 or N 3 disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> were 64. 4 %, 77. 1 %, 44. 6 %, 88. 3 %, and 74. 3 %, respectively. Histologic findings in patients with non–small cell lung cancer and false-positive results of mediastinal <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> included granulomatous inflammation, sinus histiocytosis, and silicosis.

40|$|Introduction: The 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> {{is being}} {{considered}} as an excellent imaging modality for bone metastases detection. This ability was {{compared with other}} imaging techniques. Material and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 114 patients who underwent 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/ computed tomography. Of these, 49 patients also had bone scintigraphy, 61 18 F-FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> and  10 18 F-FCH <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography.</b> We identified the technique that detected {{the largest number of}} bone metastases. For the detection of skeletal metastases with the 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> study, the contribution of the <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> component was compared with the contribution of the computed tomography component. Cases in which 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> and bone scintigraphy required further additional tests for diagnosis clarification were registered. Results: The 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> was superior to bone scintigraphy in 49 % of the patients (p < 0. 001); it was superior to 18 F-FDG <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> in 59 % of the patients (p < 0. 001) and it was superior to 18 F-FCH <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> in 40 % of the patients (p < 0. 001). None of the compared imaging techniques were superior to 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography.</b> The <b>positron</b> emission tomography component was superior to computed tomography in 35 % of the cases (p < 0. 001). Further investigation was suggested in only 3. 5 % of patients who underwent 18 F-NaF <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> (45 % for bone scintigraphy)  (p < 0. 001).

The data collection was performed in 2012 – 2017 in 19 <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> departments in 12 regions of the Russian Federation by questioning the staff. The majority of the Russian <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> departments were equipped by modern <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scanners combined with computed tomography. In each investigated department, data on all types of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> examinations, radiopharmaceuticals, administered activities used for standard patient (body mass 70 ± 5 kg) and parameters of computed tomography protocols was collected. The effective doses of patients from combined <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography</b> examinations were estimated as a sum of the dose from the internal exposure (injected radiopharmaceutical) and the external exposure (computed tomography scan). Whole body <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> examinations in Russia were commonly performed with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG), 18 F-choline, 11 С-choline, 68 GaPSMA, 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE, 68 Ga-DOTA-NOC, brain examinations – 18 F-FDG, 11 С-metionine, 18 F-choline, 18 F-tyrosine, myocardial perfusion – 13 N-ammonie. The highest patient effective doses (about 17 mSv) were observed for whole-body <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography</b> examinations; for brain examinations – 3, 4 – 4, 8 mSv; for myocardial perfusion – 2, 8 mSv. The computed tomography scan contributes up to 65 – 95 % to the total patient effective dose for whole body examinations; 20 – 30 % for head examinations. For the multiphase computed tomography scan effective doses may be increased to: 15 mSv for head examinations, 25 – 30 mSv for whole body examinations and 35 – 40 mSv for myocardial examinations.

MethodsA total of 303 eligible patients registered from 22 institutions underwent <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> after routine staging (computed tomography of chest and upper abdomen, bone scintigraphy, and brain imaging) had deemed their tumors resectable. Positive findings required confirmatory procedures. ResultsPositron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was significantly better than computed tomography for the detection of N 1 and N 2 /N 3 disease (42 % vs 13 %, P =. 0177, and 58 % vs 32 %, P =. 0041, respectively). The negative predictive value of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> for mediastinal node disease was 87 %. Unsuspected metastatic disease or second primary malignancy was identified in 18 of 287 patients (6. 3 %). Distant metastatic disease indicated in 19 of 287 patients (6. 6 %) was subsequently shown to be benign. By correctly identifying advanced disease (stages IIIA, IIIB, and IV) or benign lesions, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> potentially avoided unnecessary thoracotomy in 1 of 5 patients. ConclusionsIn patients with suspected or proven non–small cell lung cancer considered resectable by standard staging procedures, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> can prevent nontherapeutic thoracotomy in a significant number of cases. Use of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> for mediastinal staging should not be relied on as a sole staging modality, and positive findings should be confirmed by mediastinoscopy.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of clinical stage IA non–small cell lung cancer when determined by both computed <b>tomography</b> and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scans and to determine factors associated with understaging. MethodsA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with non–small cell lung cancer was performed. Patients with clinical stage IA cancer determined by preoperative computed <b>tomography</b> and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scan were reviewed. The influence of the following factors was analyzed with regard to accuracy of clinical staging: tumor size, location, histology, and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> positivity. ResultsOf the 266 patients identified, cancer was correctly staged in 65 %. Final pathologic stages also included IB (15 %), IIA (2. 6 %), IIB (4. 1 %), IIIA (4. 9 %), IIIB (7. 5 %), and IV (. 08 %). Positive lymph nodes were found in 11. 7 % of patients. Pathologic T classification changed in 28. 2 % of patients. Cancer in patients with clinical tumor size greater than 2 cm (n = 68) was significantly more likely to be understaged than in patients with tumors 2 cm or less (49 % vs 29 %, P =. 003). Cancer in patients with a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-positive (<b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> +VE) primary evaluation (n = 218) was also more likely to be understaged (39 % vs 15 %, P =. 001).

40|$|To {{assess the}} ability of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> for the early {{prediction}} of response in patients with relapsed metastatic germ cell tumours undergoing salvage high-dose chemotherapy. The role of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was compared with established means of tumour response assessment such as CT scans/MRI and serum tumour marker changes. In addition, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was compared with a current prognostic score which differentiates three prognostic groups with failure-free survival rates ranging from 5 – 50 %. [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of metastases from germ cell tumours as well as CT scans and serum tumour marker were acquired after 2 – 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy but {{before the start of}} high-dose chemotherapy and CT scans/serum tumour marker were compared with the baseline examinations in 23 patients with relapsed germ cell tumours. To evaluate the validity of early response prediction by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography,</b> radiological monitoring and serum tumour marker decline, histopathologic response after resection of residual masses and/or the clinical course over 6 months after the end of treatment (relapse vs freedom of progression) were used. Overall, 10 patients (43 %) achieved a marker-negative partial remission, three (13 %) a marker-positive partial remission, five (22 %) a disease stabilization and five (22 %) progressed during treatment. Nine patients (39 %) remained progression-free over 6 months following treatment, whereas 14 (61 %) progressed. The outcome of high-dose chemotherapy was correctly predicted by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/CT scan/serum tumour marker in 91 / 59 / 48 %. Eight patients with a favourably predicted outcome by CT scans plus serum tumour marker but a positive <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> prior to high-dose chemotherapy, failed treatment. This results in the following sensitivities/specificities for the prediction of failure of high-dose chemotherapy: <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> 100 / 78 %; radiological monitoring 43 / 78 %; serum tumour marker 15 / 100 %. The positive and negative predictive values of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> were 88 and 100 %, respectively. As compared with the prognostic score, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> was correctly positive in all patients of the three risk groups who failed treatment. In addition, a negative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> correctly predicted a favourable outcome in the good and intermediate group. [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> imaging can be used to assess response to chemotherapy in patients with relapsed germ cell tumours early in the course of treatment and may help to identify patients most likely to achieve a favourable response to subsequent high-dose chemotherapy. In patients with response to induction chemotherapy according to CT scans or serum tumour marker evaluation, <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> seems to add information to detect patients with an overall unfavourable outcome. It may also be a valuable addition to the prognostic model particularly in the good and intermediate group for further selection of patients who will profit from high-dose chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{retrospective}} analysis examined whether diffusion-weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} might be as useful as <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> with fludeoxyglucose F 18 for (1) discriminating between non–small cell lung cancer and benign pulmonary nodules and (2) predicting aggressiveness of non–small cell lung cancer. MethodsDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> were performed before surgery in 110 patients with 124 pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm, including 96 non–small cell lung cancers and 28 benign nodules. Diffusion of water molecules in magnetic resonance imaging was measured by minimum value of apparent diffusion coefficient. The criterion standard {{was the result of}} histologic diagnosis or follow-up examination. Sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between cancers and benign nodules were compared between diffusion-weighted imaging and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography.</b> Apparent diffusion coefficient in diffusion-weighted imaging and fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> were examined with respect to pathologic tumor stage; lymphatic, vascular and pleural involvements; and histologic differentiation. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences between}} diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> in sensitivity or specificity for non–small cell lung cancer. Whereas <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> showed significant differences in fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake between pathologic stages IA versus IB or more advanced stages; between tumors with and without lymphatic, vascular, or pleural involvement; and between well-differentiated and moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (P <. 01 – 0. 001), no significant differences in apparent diffusion coefficient values in were observed. ConclusionDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is equivalent to <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> in distinguishing non–small cell lung cancer from benign pulmonary nodules but is not as useful for predicting aggressiveness of non–small cell lung cancer...|$|R
