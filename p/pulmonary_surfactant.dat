500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary {{bronchial}} buds {{on each side of the}} trachea. During the fifth week the right bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two secondary bronchial buds. These give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three on the right and two on the left. Over the following week, the secondary buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. From the sixth week to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli. From week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly vascularised. Bronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. By week 26 the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles. During the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood–air barrier is established.

40|$|AbstractDipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} component in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>surfactants</b> and {{is believed to be}} responsible for maintaining low surface tension in alveoli during breathing. In this work, a kinetic model is introduced that describes the phase separation in DPPC films that produces the liquid-condensed (LC) and liquid-expanded (LE) fractions, which differ according to the area density of DPPC. The phase separation in an initially homogeneous film has been investigated numerically. Furthermore, explicit simulations of periodic compression-expansion cycles are reported. In this process, a moderate change of the surface area resulted in a dramatic change in the total amount of LC fraction, {{as well as in the}} surface morphology. Depending on the extent of the film's compression, the simulated surface morphologies comprised individual nanosized LC domains embedded in the LE fraction, interconnected networks of such domains, or continuous LC films with nanopores. Equilibration of the total area of the LC nanodomains occurred over a few milliseconds, indicating that the rate of the LE-LC phase transformation is sufficient for maintaining low surface tension during breathing, and that nanoscale LC domains are likely to play a major role in this process. Unlike the total content of the LC fraction, which stabilized quickly, the average size of LC nanodomains showed a tendency to increase slowly, at a rate determined by the diffusivity of DPPC. The computed average domain size seems to be compatible with published experiments for DPPC films. The numeric results also elucidate the distinction between thermodynamically determined and kinetically limited structural properties during phase separation in the major structure-forming component of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>surfactants...</b>|$|R

Methods: We recruited (clinical trials. gov identifier: NCT 00569712) 7 smokers without COPD and 30 ex and current smokers with COPD who were free of exacerbations for at least 4 weeks.

One mechanism of surfactant damage {{appears to be the}} hydrolysis of phospholipid by phospholipases activated in the inflamed lung.

We considered two mechanisms of surfactant disruption by five human sPLA 2 s; including generation of lysophospholipids and the depletion of specific phospholipids. All five sPLA 2 s studied ultimately caused surfactant dysfunction. Each enzyme exhibited a different pattern of hydrolysis of surfactant phospholipids. Phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid in surfactant and the greatest potential source for generation of lysophospholipids was susceptible to hydrolysis by group IB, group V and group X sPLA 2 s, but not groups IIA or IID. Group IIA hydrolyzed both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol while group IID was active against only phosphatidylglycerol. Thus, with groups IB and X, the generation of lysophospholipids corresponded with surfactant dysfunction. However, hydrolysis of and depletion of phosphatidylglycerol had a greate...|$|R
