40|$|The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA- 1) {{is required}} for the replication of episomal viral genomes. Regions in its N-terminal and C-terminal domains mediate the interaction with host cell chromatin. Several cellular nuclear proteins, e. g., BRD 2 /RING 3, histones H 2 A and H 2 B, MeCP 2, DEK, and HP 1 α, have been suggested to mediate this interaction. In this work, we identify the double-bromodomain proteins BRD 4 and BRD 3 /ORFX as additional LANA- 1 interaction partners. The carboxy-terminal region of the short variant of BRD 4 (<b>BRD</b> 4 <b>S)</b> containing the highly conserved extraterminal domain directly interacts with an element in the LANA- 1 carboxy-terminal domain. We show that ectopically expressed <b>BRD</b> 4 <b>S</b> and <b>BRD</b> 2 /RING 3 delay progression into the S phase of the cell cycle in epithelial and B-cell lines and increase cyclin E promoter activity. LANA- 1 partly releases epithelial and B cells from a BRD 4 S- and BRD 2 /RING 3 -induced G 1 cell cycle arrest and also promotes S-phase entry in the presence of <b>BRD</b> 4 <b>S</b> and <b>BRD</b> 2 /RING 3. This is accompanied by a reduction in BRD 4 S-mediated cyclin E promoter activity.

Thus, flagellin proteins represent a particularly attractive target for the development of vaccine candidates. In this study, we investigated the immune response by increasing the flagella number in the iacP mutant strain and the adjuvant activity of the flagellin component FljB of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that the iacP mutant strain expresses two flagellin proteins (FliC and FljB), which result in increased NF-κB-dependent gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages. Using an oral immunization mouse model, we observed that the administration of a live attenuated <b>S.</b> typhimurium <b>BRD</b> 509 strain expressing the FliC and FljB flagellins induced significantly enhanced flagellin-specific IgG responses in the systemic compartment.

Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium) vaccine strain BRD 509 and, upon immunisation, to induce an antibody response against the carried antigen. The H(C) fragment expression cassette containing the transcription/translation signals, H(C) fragment open reading frame and the downstream TrpA terminator, was excised from pTETtac 4 and incorporated into the plasmids pIC 20 H, pBR 322, pACYC 184 and pRSF 1010. The resulting constructs were transferred into attenuated <b>S.</b> typhimurium, <b>BRD</b> 509, {{and the level of}} H(C) fragment expression was examined by Western blot analysis. The relative stability of each plasmid in S. typhimurium was determined in vitro in the absence of antibiotic selection, and in vivo following immunisation. The ability of each H(C) fragment-expressing strain to induce lipopolysaccharide- and tetanus toxoid-specific antibody responses was assayed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These studies showed that all the vaccine vector constructs, except the S. typhimurium carrying the expression vector based on pIC 20 H, were able to elicit a high titre immune response. The level of tetanus toxoid-specific antibody induced by S. typhimurium directly correlated with the level of in vitro and in vivo stability of the H(C) fragment expression plasmid carried by the bacterium, and not with an increased copy number of the parent plasmid vector.

The reporter genes encoding beta-galactosidase and firefly luciferase {{were used to assess}} the comparative levels of promoter activity in S. typhimurium in vitro in response to different induction stimuli and in vivo in immunized mice. It was determined that the ppagC construct directed the expression of more beta-galactosidase and luciferase in S. typhimurium than the pnirB and pkatG constructs, both in vitro and in vivo. The gene encoding the C fragment of tetanus toxin was expressed in the aroAD mutant of <b>S.</b> typhimurium (<b>BRD</b> 509) {{under the control of the}} three promoters. Mice orally immunized with attenuated S. typhimurium expressing C fragment under control of the pagC promoter [BRD 509 (pKK/ppagC/C frag) ] mounted the highest tetanus toxoid-specific serum antibody response. Levels of luciferase expression in vivo and C-fragment expression in vitro from the pagC promoter appeared to be equivalent to if not lower than the levels of expression detected with the constitutive trc promoter. However, mice immunized with BRD 509 (pKK/ppagC/C frag) induced significantly higher levels of tetanus toxoid-specific antibody than BRD 509 (pKK/C frag) -immunized mice, suggesting that the specific location of foreign antigen expression may be important for immunogenicity. Mutagenesis of the ribosome binding sites (RBS) in the three promoter/C fragment expression plasmids was also performed. Despite optimization of the RBS in the three different promoter elements, the expression levels in vivo and overall immunogenicity of C fragment when delivered to mice by attenuated S. typhimurium were not affected.

40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) was {{expressed}} in Salmonella typhimurium {{in an attempt}} to increase the mucosal immune response against the bacterium. Murine IL- 6 was PCR amplified from cDNA, cloned, sequenced, and found to be functionally active when expressed in <b>S.</b> typhimurium <b>BRD</b> 509, the (delta) aroA (delta) aroD vaccine strain. Expression of murine IL- 6 did not appear to adversely affect the growth of salmonellae, as the construct was retained in the absence of antibiotic selection and the growth rate was unaffected compared with that of the parent strain in vitro. However, IL- 6 expression led to a significant reduction in bacterial invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. Splenocytes and small intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes were isolated from mice orally immunized with BRD 509 expressing IL- 6 (pKK 233 - 2 /IL- 6), and the number of antibody-secreting cells was determined by the ELISPOT technique. No differences were observed between mice immunized with BRD 509 (pKK. 233 - 2 /IL- 6) and those immunized with BRD 509 (pKK 233 - 2) with respect to the antibody subclass-specific responses elicited despite the markedly reduced invasiveness of the former. Serum antibody responses were also examined by a kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and equivalent levels of antibody response were detected in mice given BRD 509 (pKK 233 - 2 /IL- 6) and those given BRD 509 (pKK 233 - 2). The humoral immune response against bacterial lipopolysaccharides was also examined in transgenic IL- 6 -deficient mice given oral inocula of BRD 509.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of preexisting immunity to homologous (Salmonella typhimurium) or heterologous (S. dublin) serotypes of Salmonella {{on the ability of}} an attenuated S. typhimurium aroA aroD vector (BRD 509) to immunize mice against the heterologous antigen fragment C (FrgC). We studied two strains, BRD 847 and BRD 937, expressing FrgC carried on plasmids that differ only with respect to the promoter controlling FrgC expression, the nirB promoter in the case of BRD 847 and the htrA promoter in the case of BRD 937. Mice were preimmunized orally with <b>S.</b> typhimurium <b>BRD</b> 509, <b>S.</b> dublin aroA aroD (BRD 620), or saline. Forty-four days later, they were immunized orally with BRD 847 or BRD 937. Prior immunity to S. typhimurium severely depressed the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA anti-FrgC response in both BRD 847 - and BRD 937 -immunized mice. Mice with existing immunity to S. dublin also had lower IgG anti-FrgC geometric mean titers (GMTs) than did mice preimmunized with saline, but this difference was significant only in the case of mice immunized with BRD 937. However, in nonimmune mice or in mice preimmunized with S. typhimurium or S. dublin, the anti-FrgC IgG GMTs were always higher in mice in the BRD 937 groups than in the equivalent BRD 847 groups. This is reflected in the effect of prior immunity on the ability of oral immunization with BRD 847 or BRD 937 to protect mice from challenge with a lethal dose of tetanus toxin. All of the mice preimmunized with saline and then immunized with BRD 847 or BRD 937 survived challenge. Only 20 % of the animals immunized with BRD 847 and 60 % of the mice in the BRD 937 group survived tetanus toxin challenge if they were preimmunized with BRD 509. Preexisting immunity to S. dublin did not affect the ability of BRD 937 to immunize mice against tetanus, but it did reduce the efficiency of BRD 847 : only 60 % percent of the mice survived challenge. The intestinal secretory IgA responses to FrgC were very similar in the BRD 847 and BRD 937 groups. Prior immunity did depress the IgA anti-FrgC titers but only significantly so in the mice preimmunized with BRD 509. These results show that preexisting Salmonella immunity, particularly to homologous serotypes, can severely compromise the ability of live Salmonella vectors to deliver heterologous antigens to the mammalian immune system. However, the results also indicate that this may be overcome by the design of more powerful in vivo expression systems...|$|R
40|$|While {{debates over}} the memory and {{representation}} of the National Socialist past have dominated public discourse in Germany over the last forty years, the literary scene has been the site of experimentation with the genre of the autobiography, as authors developed new strategies for exploring their own relationship to the past through narrative. Since the late 1970 s, this experimentation has yielded a series of autobiographical novels which focus {{not only on the}} authors' own lives, but on the lives and experiences of their family members, particularly those who lived during the NS era. In this dissertation, I examine the relationship between two waves of this autobiographical writing, the Väterliteratur novels of the late 1970 s and 1980 <b>s</b> in the <b>BRD,</b> and the current trend of multi-generational family narratives which began in the late 1990 s. In a prelude and three chapters, this dissertation traces the trajectory from Väterliteratur to the Generationenromane through readings of Bernward Vesper's Die Reise (1977), Christoph Meckel's Suchbild. Über meinen Vater (1980), Ruth Rehmann's Der Mann auf der Kanzel (1979), Uwe Timm's Am Beispiel meines Bruders (2003), Stephan Wackwitz's Ein unsichtbares Land (2003), Monika Maron's Pawels Briefe (1999), and Barbara Honigmann's Ein Kapitel aus meinem Leben (2004). I read these texts as examples of genealogical writing, in which protagonists seek to position themselves in relation to their family histories through the construction of family narrative. The formal similarities between the two trends - (inter) textual dialogue, hybridity of prose style, vignette or essayistic structure - cast their underlying differences into greater relief. While the author-narrators of Väterliteratur seek to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the question of the father's complicity in Nazism, the authors of Generationenromane allow for greater nuance in categories such as victim and perpetrator. In both cases, however, the subjectivity of the individual protagonist shapes his or her engagement of the family past, as they seek to negotiate between personal family relationships and public discourses of collective memory in contemporary Germany...|$|R
40|$|Murine {{infection}} {{with the natural}} mouse pathogen S. typhimurium is the most widely accepted model for studying immunity to typhoid fever. Attenuated strains of Salmonella {{have been developed for}} use as live vaccines, and there is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating their efficacy both in human and animal studies [1]. Several attenuated strains of S. typhimurium were engineered to express defined cytokines, including IL- 10, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, TNF-o or IFN-γ. Moreover these recombinant strains {{have been shown to be}} efficient vectors for the delivery of cytokines in experimental disease models [2],[3], Thus targeted delivery of cytokines can potentially be used as a therapeutic approach in treatment of autoimmune conditions, infectious disease and cancer. The main aim of this research was to develop animal models to facilitate the investigation of the role of cytokines by assessing their potential of modulating the immune response to microbial infections, namely using an attenuated strain of S. typhimurium, which expresses IFN gamma (IFN-γ). For this purpose, two attenuated strains of S. typhimurium were compared for their efficacy in inducing protective immune responses in a number of different genetically-defined inbred mouse lines differing in their genetic susceptibility profile; mice expressing wild type allele of Nramp 1 gene (Nramp 1 n), but differing in their expression of TLR 4 gene, key genes controlling mouse susceptibility to Salmonella infection, C 3 H/HeN (TLRn/Nrampn), and C 3 H/HeJ (TLRd/Nrampn) mice. Mice on C 57 BLl 6 background with defective Nramp 1 gene (TLRn/Nrampd), the other critical determinant of susceptibility to Salmonella infection In order to characterise further the potential mechanism of the enhanced influence of the IFNγ-expressing Salmonella strain, two additional recombinant mouse strains, on the C 57 BLl 6 background with a second gene defect in CD 154 (CD 40 L) or MyD 88 protein, a critical adaptor molecule essential for signalling through most of the TLRs were also used. It was hypothesised that host immune responses may be amenable to manipulation by cytokine-expressing bacterial strains. The nature of the immune response to {{infection with}} a parental attenuated strain of <b>S.</b> typhimurium (designated <b>BRD</b> 509) compared with its recombinant derivative that has been engineered to express IFN-γ (designated GIDIFN). The two bacterial strains used in this study were the aroA aroD double auxotrophic strain (designated BRD 509,) and its recombinant derivative that has been genetically engineered to express murine IFN-γ (designated GIDIFN). The investigations focused on assessment of the immunoregulatory influence of bacteria-expressed IFN-γ on the Immune response to Salmonella infection by following in vivo bacterial survival in peritoneal cavity (site of inoculation). The role of IFN-γ as a mediator at the different stages of infection, including the early innate response, plateau clearance stages, as well as the developments of protective memory responses were defined. The level of bacterial load in the peritoneal cavity was assessed during the first 48 hrs post i. p infection with - 1 x 106 BRDq 09 or GIDIFN organisms per mouse. Rapid clearance of IFNγ-expressing Salmonella in vivo host target organs, mice were inoculated i. p. with - 0. 5 - 1 x 106 CFUs/mouse and at the indicated time points were sacrificed and the bacterial load in spleens and livers enumerated, as well as bacterial shedding in faeces. Outcome of the infection on animal morbidity and mortality were assessed, Production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 12 p 40, and TNF-a) and nitric oxide by ex vivo cultured splenocytes and peritoneal exudates cells, the levels of IFN-y in the serum was determined. Phenotype of cellular infiltrates in the peritoneal cavity was assessed using flow cytometry. While infiltrates in spleens and livers of infected mice were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry at different time points after inoculation. The potential influence of bacteria-expressed IFN-γ on the production of systemic/mucosal Salmonella-specific antibodies (lgM, IgG and slgA isotypes was determined titre and isotype of anti-Salmonella antibodies up to 2 months following inoculation. Efficacy of BRD 509 and GIDIFN strains in affording protection against virulent challenge using titrated doses for vaccination was assessed and efficacy of the Salmonella strains as vaccines was demonstrated through their capacity to protect against virulent challenge. The results of this investigation demonstrated that IFNγ-expressing Salmonella strain (GIDIFN) has immunopotentiating effects on the host's immune response, in comparison to non-IFNγ-expressing stain (BRD 509). The data obtained demonstrated that the GIDIFN strain was able to induce more vigorous innate and adaptive immune responses and, hence, was cleared more rapidly from the infected host than the parental BRD 509 strain in all mouse strains tested. The major experimental findings that GIDIFN strain enhanced the early, proinflammatory cytokine response to infection, including IL- 6, IL- 12, TNF-a and IFN-y, improved inflammatory cell recruitment into infected tissues/organs, increased bacterial shedding in the faeces and lead to a stronger mucosal IgA response. GIDIFN enhanced the Th 1 -driven Immunoglobulin isotype response in susceptible mice. The GIDIFN-induced immune responses resulted in significantly enhanced host survival following infection in susceptible mouse strains. Moreover, there was a small but significant enhancement in the survival of immunised animals following lethal challenge with virulent Salmonella. The present study demonstrates that IFNγ-expressing Salmonella strains has immunopotentiating effects on the host's immune response and provide direct evidence for the utility of IFNγ-expressing attenuated Salmonella in enhancement of immune responsiveness in immune-deficient hosts. Thus, the expression of IFN-y by attenuated S. typhimurium renders the recombinant strain safer and more immunogenic to use, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, and open the way for further fine-tuning of immune responses. These findings point to the possibility of constructing more efficacious vaccines for protection against typhoid fever in humans and in animals. Moreover, IFNγ-expressing Salmonella may well be useful as bacterial vectors that act as effectors to manipulate unwanted immune responses in chronic diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions.
