40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} of different routing and resilience mechanisms to avoid congestion in a network {{for a set of}} protected failures. A routing mechanism is more efficient than another one if it achieves a lower maximum link utilization in the same networking scenario. With resilience requirements, the maximum link utilization over the set of <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios becomes the critical value. We consider standard and optimized configurations of single shortest path (SSP) and equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing as well as several types of end-to-end (e 2 e) path protection and MPLS fast reroute (FRR). We investigate how well these resilience mechanisms can cope with different network structures and with different sets of protected failures. The results show that routing optimization reduces the maximum link utilization significantly both with and without protection of failures. The optimization potential for resilient routing is limited by the applied mechanism and heavily depends on the network structure and the set of <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} several {{end-to-end}} protection switching mechanisms for application in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). In case of local outages in the network, they deviate the traffic around the failed element over backup paths. They {{are easy to}} implement and reduce the additional capacity to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) on the backup paths. We study the capacity savings of the presented methods for various protection schemes with different traffic matrices. We further test the influence of different resilience constraints such as the set of <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios, bandwidth reuse restrictions due to optical communication, and traffic reduction due to failed border routers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{self-protection}} multipath (SPM) is {{a simple}} protection switching mechanism. It distributes the traffic over several disjoint paths from source to destination according to a traffic distribution function. When a path fails, the traffic is redistributed to the working paths according to another traffic distribution function, i. e., the traffic distribution function depends on the failed path. The contribution of this work is {{the introduction of a}} failure-specific traffic distribution function for the SPM that depends on the exact failure of the paths. We present a linear program for the global optimization of the traffic distribution function of all SPMs in all <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios. Finally, we compare the amount of protected traffic that can be transported in the network for the conventional SPM and the new failure-specific SPM (FSPM). I...|$|E

40|$|Recently, major vendors have {{introduced}} new router platforms {{to the market}} that support fast IP-level failure pro- tection out of the box. The implementations {{are based on the}} IP Fast ReRoute–Loop Free Alternates (LFA) standard. LFA is simple, unobtrusive, and easily deployable. This simplicity, however, comes at a severe price, in that LFA usually cannot protect all possible failure scenarios. In this paper, we give new graph theoretical tools for analyzing LFA failure case coverage and we seek ways for improvement. In particular, we investigate how to optimize IGP link costs to maximize the number of <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios, we show that this problem is NP- complete even in a very restricted formulation, and we give exact and approximate algorithms to solve it. Our simulation studies show that a deliberate selection of IGP costs can bring many networks close to complete LFA-based protection...|$|E
40|$|The IP Fast ReRoute-Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) {{standard}} {{is a simple}} and easily deployable technique to provide fast failure protection right in the IP layer. To our days, most major IP device vendors have prod- ucts on the market that support LFA out of the box. Unfortunately, LFA usually cannot protect all possible failure scenarios in a general network topology. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} develop LFA-based network optimization tools in order to assist operators in deciding whether deploying LFA in their network will supply sufficient resiliency. In this paper, we give a new graph theoretical framework for analyzing LFA failure case coverage, and then we investigate how to optimize the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) link costs in order to maximize the number of <b>protected</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios. We show that this prob- lem is NP-complete even in a very restricted formulation, and we give an exact algorithm as well as a complete family of heuristics to solve it. Our simulation studies indicate that a deliberate tuning of the approximation strategy can significantly improve the quality of the IGP link costs, and we conclude that LFA cost optimization has the potential for boosting LFA-based resilience in most operational networks significantly...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 until today affected {{the banking industry}} to a large extent. Many banks failed or got bailed out by governments. To <b>protect</b> against banking <b>failures</b> and new financial crises the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has reviewed, renewed and extended the banking regulations. The result is a framework for banking regulations called Basel III. This study examines the Basel III framework and its potential effect on protecting the banks. The study answers the question: if Basel III may protect against new banking failures. The study has used a qualitative approach. The theoretical framework has been built up {{by the use of}} the literature review. Literature has mainly been found by use of the university library’s online databases. For the empirical results interviews were made with banks and supervisors from Sweden and from Finland to see their view on the emerging framework. The views of supervisors and banks are that Basel III should have tougher requirements than it now has. The capital requirements are seen as too low and the risk-weights are criticized not to reflect the reality. Supervisors are still positive and believe that Basel III will give a better protection, but it will not fully <b>protect</b> against <b>failures.</b> Banks have a similar view, some are positive and believe that it will give a better protection while others do not think it will <b>protect</b> against <b>failures</b> any better...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—IP Fast ReRoute (IPFRR) is the IETF {{standard}} for providing fast failure protection in IP and MPLS/LDP networks and Loop Free Alternates (LFA) {{is a basic}} specification for implementing it. Even though LFA is simple and unobtrusive, it has a significant drawback: it does not guarantee protection for all possible failure cases. Consequently, many IPFRR proposals have appeared lately, promising full failure coverage {{at the price of}} added complexity and non-trivial modifications to IP hardware and software. Meanwhile, LFA remains the only commercially available, and therefore, the only deployable IPFRR solution. Deployment, however, crucially depends {{on the extent to which}} LFA can <b>protect</b> <b>failures</b> in operational networks. In this paper, therefore, we revisit LFA in order to give theoretical insights and practical hints to LFA failure coverage analysis. First, we identify the topological properties a network must possess to profit from good failure coverage. Then, we study how coverage varies as new links are added to a network, we show how to do this optimally and, through extensive simulations, we arrive to the conclusion that cleverly adding just a couple of new links can improve the quality of LFA protection drastically...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} commodity {{nature of}} storage and our insatiable tendency to produce, store, and use {{large amounts of}} data exacerbates the problem of ensuring data survivability. The advent of large robust networks has gained the idea of replicating data on remote hosts wide-spread acceptance. Unfortunately, the growth of network bandwidth is far outstripped by both the growth of both storage capacity [17] and our ability to fill it. Thus, most replication systems, which traditionally replicate data blindly, fail under the onslaught of this lopsided mismatch. We propose a Policy Driven Replication (PDR) system that prioritizes the replication of data, based on userdefined policies that specify which data is to be <b>protected,</b> from which <b>failures,</b> and to what extent. By prioritizing which data is replicated, our system conserves limited resources and ensures that data which is deemed most important to and by the user is <b>protected</b> from <b>failures</b> that are deemed most likely to occur...|$|R
