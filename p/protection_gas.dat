Male seahorses and pipefish have evolved specialized brooding pouches that provide <b>protection,</b> <b>gas</b> exchange, osmoregulation, and limited nutrient provisioning to developing embryos. Pouch structures differ widely across the Syngnathidae, offering an ideal opportunity to study the evolution of reproductive complexity. However, the physiological and genetic changes facilitating male pregnancy are largely unknown.

Using a unique time-calibrated RNA-seq data set including brood pouch at key stages of embryonic development, we identified transcriptional changes associated with brood pouch remodeling, nutrient and waste transport, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and immunological protection of developing embryos at conception, development and parturition.

40|$|The reflow {{soldering}} process, which has growing {{requirements for the}} purity of electronic components, is applied frequently with nitrogen as a <b>protection</b> <b>gas.</b> The nitrogen reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere and leads to lower use of flux and activators. This common nitrogen technology is connected with high gas consumption, and for this reason, it is also expensive. The newly developed auto-protection gas soldering (APG soldering) works with a low boiling point liquid. This liquid is vaporized in the soldering machine. The resulting vapor displaces the air and {{is used as a}} protective atmosphere. In a convection soldering machine, the vapor is overheated up to the soldering temperature, and is also used as a carrier gas for the convection heating. In the cooling zone of soldering machines, the vapor condenses and can be transferred back as a liquid. It is therefore possible to work with a nearly closed circulation and with low consumption of auto-protection gas. Another advantage is the very good heat transition of the vapor in comparison to a dry gas. This allows smaller temperature differences on the boards during the soldering process...|$|E

The tensile strength of welds was slightly increased by adding CaO to the filler metal, which resulted from the decreased grain size in the weld metal. When welding Mg alloys, fumes have been unavoidable so far because of the low boiling temperature of Mg. Fume reduction was successfully demonstrated with a wire composed of the novel ECO Mg filler. In addition, stable droplet transfer was observed and spatter suppression could be expected by using CaO-added Mg filler wire...|$|R

Generally, the mechanical properties characteristics {{of this type of}} welded joint depend mainly on two parameters: the quality of weld metal and the quality of gaseous protection. Three qualities of molten metal: (UP-CNM 18 16), (SG-X 2 /CNM 19 12) and (SG-X 12 /CNM 19 10) were used. On each of the configurations, mechanical tests of characterization were carried out: tensile test, impact strength, rupture and of folding. In order to simulate the holding of corrosion of the weld, the specimens were emerged in a device corrosion test during one week. The observation made and the results obtained from different mechanical tests had been correlated in order to propose for welding of austenitic stainless steels 316 L containing a high concentration of chrome (Cr) and lower concentration of nickel (Ni) in order that a fraction of ferrite can be stabilized during solidification. There is, also, the use of welded metal combination containing 30 % of ferrite associated to helium as <b>protection</b> <b>gas.</b> The weld joint obtained is austenito-ferritie, giving a structure with content in adequate ferrite of 15 %, this leads to the expected mechanical characteristics which is the closest to the band of scatter of the base metal...|$|E
40|$|Manual brazing, {{as it is}} {{used today}} in the {{manufacture}} of automobile bodywork, can be of variable quality and may be responsible for thermal damage to both base material and filler metal. Reworking is often necessary, but the need for this expensive and time-consuming process can be minimised by the automation of the brazing procedure. If Nd:YAG-lasers are used as heat sorce for brazing, the laser energy can be controlled with ease and specific temperature fields can be set up. Fibre-optic laser routing also makes it easy to integrate the technology into manufacturing systems. The goal of this project was the systematic development and optimisation of process controls and associated systems technology for automated flux-free brazing using double-beam laser technology. The system developed in the project was designed to handle modern bodywork materials (DC 04; DC 04 +ZE) and materials for lightweight construction (AlMg 0, 4 Sil, 2; AlMg 5 W 17) as well as aluminium alloys in combination with construction steels. The highest brazing quality was achieved with L-CuZn 40 and L-Ag 55 Sn filler metals. The use of 95 % N_ 2 and 5 % H_ 2 as a <b>protection</b> <b>gas</b> allowed flux-free brazing. If allowances are made for capillary action and gravity, it is possible to produce high quality joints using laser brazing and spacial seam-orientation. It is advantageous to use on-line process controls for the processing of critical contours. In flux-free laser brazing of aluminium alloys, an additional pulsed Nd:YAG-laser is used to modify the surface activity, making the surface more wettable to the filler metal. The different heat dispersal coefficients of aluminium and its oxide coat lead to disruption of this oxide layer and enable the filler metal to wet the surface. Combinations of construction steel and aluminium alloy can be brazed without flux by using the reducing gas and a zinc-based solder which is capable of wetting both materials. (orig.)

40|$|The {{decision}} {{reached at}} the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris provides to keep global warming temperature increase below 1. 5 °C, which should limit {{the impact of}} climate change. To achieve this, especially within the energy sector, new low emission and efficient energy conversion systems must be provided. The new systems must have a flexible part load capacity in order {{to compensate for the}} fluctuating influence of renewable energy sources on the power grid. Solid oxide fuel cell systems achieve a high partial load flexibility, and at the same time, a high electrical efficiency and thus fulfill today already the requirements for future energy conversion systems. The research objective of this work is an efficiency increase of a solid oxide fuel cell system developed at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, with a particular focus on the development of an innovative safety gas generator for the heating and cooling phases. In particular this means the removal of premixed safety gas compressed in gas cylinders, which currently limits the system’s suitability for everyday use. To achieve these objectives, dynamic component simulation models were developed {{on the basis of a}} stirred tank reactor cascade. With these models different system concepts were then investigated to ensure their feasibility and efficiency. Of the chosen criteria, the most suitable concept is a solid oxide fuel cell system with an anode off-gas recirculation, in combination with a low temperature blower. With this concept, electrical efficiency could be increased from 41 % to 60 %. In order to enable the release of premixed safety gas, a new safety gas release strategy was developed. This includes a component that uses the resources provided by the infrastructure to generate a hydrogen-rich atmosphere within the safety gas requiring operating phases. The functionality of the developed anode off-gas recirculation concept, as well as of the <b>protection</b> <b>gas</b> strategy, has been experimentally demonstrated. Through the combination of dynamic simulation models and experiments, a highly efficient system, consisting of anode off-gas recirculation and own safety gas generation, was achieved. Thereby, the challenges of operating the system could be resolved by developing a recirculation measuring method, an operation strategy to achieve maximum electrical efficiency, an analysis of the carbon-free operation window, as well as an innovative operating strategy within the safety gas requiring operating phases...|$|E

A preliminary study was carried out to determine the initial conditions to exploration of the parameters, after that it was carried through the welding of a complete factorial. In a last exploration of welding parameters was applied the Taguchi Method to carry out to the analysis of diverse factories of control with a reduced number of experiments. The geometric profile of weld filet was raised in the transversal section of the test specimen. After it obtained the results, some adjustments were made to carry out weldings of coverings. The results showed that the correct adjustments of the Distance of the Tip of the Wire Workpiece (DTWW) influenced in the geometry and diluition weld filet and in the arc stability. It was also seen that to obtain minors levels of dilution, a Distance of the Tip of the Electrode Workpiece (DTEW) depends of the level of energy employed, for lesser energies use lesser DTEWs and, for higher energies, higher DTEWs must be used. The levels of dilution and reinforcement were reduced {{with the use of the}} weaving technique.
