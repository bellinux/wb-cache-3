40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{a unique}} drug-induced hepatotoxicity in cynomolgus monkeys treated orally {{with a novel}} potassium sparing experimental diuretic, [2, 6 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) - 4 -pyridinecarboxylic acid]. Groups of 6 adult male and female monkeys were treated orally with vehicle diluent, modified vehicle # 122 or a suspension of the drug at 5. 0, 12. 5, or 32. 0 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Another group of 5 monkeys were treated orally with 25. 0 mg/kg/day of the drug for 2 weeks. Disposition of the drug was evaluated in 2 monkeys in the later group that received 27. 4 mg/kg of radiolabelled drug on the 1 st and last day of dosing. Hepatic toxicity was characterized biochemically, light and electron microscopically, histochemically, immunocy-tochemically, and toxico-kinetically. Conjugated serum bilirubin, alanine transaminase, and aspartate trans-aminase levels were increased in monkeys treated with over 12. 5 mg/kg/day of the diuretic. The periacinar hepatic plates of monkeys treated with 25. 0 or 32. 0 mg/kg/day were distorted by accumulation of PAS and oil red-O positive multinucleated Kupffer cells. The cytosol of these cells was expanded by phagolysosomes containing granular materials of varying electron densities. Granular electron dense materials were also in endothelial cells and bile canaliculi. Fatty change, cholestasis, and rare <b>piecemeal</b> hepatic <b>necrosis</b> were minimal.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the changes of serum biochemical parameters and liver pathology {{in patients with}} 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane (TTCE) -induced hepatotoxicity. METHODS: A total of 18 patients were diagnosed as TTCE-induced hepatotoxicity with an incubation period of 1156 days. Blood samples were obtained from all patients and liver biopsy was performed in 16. RESULTS: All patients had fatigue, poor appetite and dark urine, 15 of whom suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension and other gastrointestinal disorders. All patients had various degrees of liver function damage, and one died from liver failure. The prothrombin time was significantly prolonged in 6 patients. Histological findings showed varying degrees of necrosis, fatty degeneration and fibrosis in portal areas without cirrhosis. Patients with more severe jaundice had more severe pathologic changes, including <b>piecemeal</b> and bridge <b>necrosis,</b> and cholestasis. CONCLUSIONS: TTCE-induced hepatotoxicity may cause the changes in serum biochemical parameters and liver pathology. Most patients might recover with regular treatment.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the histologic effects of interferon-α (IFNα) therapy on chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a semiquantitative study using a modified Knodell's numeric histologic scoring system {{was performed on}} paired pre- and post-treatment liver biopsy specimens from 127 adult Chinese patients from two trials of IFNα therapy (IFNα, n = 86; control, n = 41). The effects of IFNα therapy on the hepatic expression of HBV antigens were also determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Serologic response with clearance of HBV e antigen (n = 18) was associated with reduction in lobular activity, periportal <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> portal inflammation, and total histologic scores.

In contrast, there was an increase in hepatic expression of HBV surface antigen after IFNα therapy. Patients who lost HBV e antigen with IFNα therapy were characterized by more severe initial periportal <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> before treatment.

40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} inter-relation between hepatic {{fibrosis}} and other histological features of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: Liver biopsy specimens from 200 consecutive {{patients with chronic}} HCV infection were graded and staged separately for necro-inflammatory activity and for fibrosis. The interaction between fibrosis and other histological features was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis, followed by hierarchical log linear modelling. RESULTS: The most striking feature was the presence of portal tract inflammation in 177 (89 %) of 200 samples. Lymphoid aggregates/follicles were observed either alone {{or as part of}} the general inflammatory infiltration of the portal tracts in 120 (60 %) of 200 samples. Fatty change (macro- and microvesicular steatosis) was observed in 76 (38 %) samples: mild to moderate in 60 (30 %) and diffuse in 16 (8 %). Bile duct damage was found in 30 (15 %) of 200 specimens. Lobular activity was found in 154 (77 %) of 200 samples and was significant in 44; <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> was present in 79 (40 %). Thirty one (16 %) patients had stage 0 liver fibrosis, 27 (14 %) had stage 1, 69 (35 %) had stage 2, 43 (22 %) had stage 3, 16 (8 %) had stage 4, and 12 (6 %) had stage 5. On log linear analysis, <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> lobular inflammation and steatosis were linked directly with fibrosis. Portal tract inflammation was linked directly and indirectly via <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> and lobular inflammation with fibrosis. The presence of lymphoid aggregates was associated with bile duct damage. CONCLUSIONS: Portal tract inflammation with lymphoid aggregates or follicles, together with fatty change, bile duct damage and/or lobular activity, are characteristic of chronic HCV infection, confirming previous reports. <b>Piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, and steatosis are linked directly with fibrosis in this statistical model, suggesting a close inter-relation in the development of fibrosis/cirrhosis...|$|E

40|$|Liver biopsy {{specimens}} from 95 {{patients with}} chronic active hepatitis type B were studied to define the incidence of portal tract and/or septal neutrophilic infiltration and its relationship with other morphohistologic factors and with liver function tests. Neutrophils were identified in the portal tracts and fibrous septa in 59 cases (62 %), among which 19 cases (20 %) showed four or more neutrophils per high-power field. Significant neutrophilic infiltration (> 6 per high-power field) was observed in only seven (7. 4 %) of 95 cases. Multiple-regression analysis revealed that neutrophilic infiltration {{was significantly associated with}} marginal duct proliferation, bile duct proliferation, and an elevated alanine aminotransferase level. Applying a partial correlation coefficient, it was shown that neutrophilic infiltration was not related to <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> after controlling for marginal duct proliferation.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of HLA-A,B,C, HLA-D/DR and HLA-D/DQ molecules was studied by indirect immunofluorescence with an avidin-biotin technique and monoclonal antibodies, in unfixed cryostat sections of liver biopsies from 76 {{patients with chronic}} liver diseases of various aetiologies and five normal liver biopsy specimens. In pathological liver, strong cytoplasmic or membrane-like positivity for HLA-A,B,C of hepatocytes was observed in <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> areas in all groups. Cytoplasmic staining was mainly seen in lobular areas in autoimmune, cryptogenic and HBV-related cases with viral replication, while membrane-like positivity was more frequently observed in primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic and HBV-related cases without viral replication. A weak cytoplasmic staining for HLA-D/DR was observed in <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> and lobular areas mainly in HBV-related cases with viral replication. While bile duct cells were positive for both HLA-D/DR and HLA-D/DQ, hepatocytes were consistently HLA-D/DQ negative. The increased HLA-A,B,C expression on hepatocytes should allow T cytotoxic cell aggression. Hepatocellular HLA-D/DR expression is definite but weak and probably does not allow direct autoantigen presentation and induction of autoimmunity. Negativity for HLA-D/DQ further supports this hypothesis. Since cytoplasmic staining for Class I and II molecules is greatly lowered by fixing cryostat liver sections, prestaining conditions {{should be taken into}} account when comparing different studies...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: In chronic active liver {{diseases}} (CALD) with viral aetiology, {{a population}} of plasma cells localised in the <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> areas was previously detected by means of autoradiography after in vitro 3 H-proline incorporation, a method which proved much more sensitive than conventional immunohistochemical procedures. These plasma cells, characteristically located in niches among hepatocytes, {{in close contact with}} collagen fibrils, have been hypothesised to exert a role in fibrogenesis stimulation, and particularly in collagen synthesis, possibly through secretion of lymphokines. Specifically, we investigated the presence of interleukin- 1, well known to {{play a crucial role in}} inflammation and production of collagen by epithelial cells, and to be present in activated plasma cells of myeloma. Methods: The immunohistochemical localisation of interleukin-l/beta in biopsies of patients suffering from chronic active hepatitis was studied, using an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody. Results: The strongest interleukin-l/i immunostaining was observed in the above-described plasma cell population, identified by anti-immunoglobulin antibodies, and 3 H-proline incorporation. Conclusions: The ability of plasma cells to produce interleukin- 1 during viral CALD suggests that in these pathologies plasma cells play a major role, mainly of paracrine nature. Interleukiu- 1, possibly together with other mediators, might in turn stimulate the production of collagen. Hepatocytes of the <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> area appear to be possible candidates for this synthesis, as they show a significant labelling after 3 H-proline incorporation, which is absent from hepatocytes far from necrotic areas...|$|E

The study group (n = 174) included 104 patients with normal aminotransferase concentrations and no cases with clinically apparent cirrhosis. The specimen length and number of portal tracts were measured at light microscopy examination. Sampling error analysis was related to the discrepancies between aminotransferase concentrations versus histological grade. Detailed histological scorings were undertaken by the reference pathologist and compared with laboratory and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA precore sequence data. Sampling error seemed to be a constant feature, even for biopsies > or = 20 mm, but increased dramatically in biopsies 5 mm long and should contain more than four portal tracts. In addition, the new grading terminology might give the clinician an inappropriately mild impression of the severity of <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Furthermore, even in the presence of normal aminotransferase concentrations, considerable liver pathology can be found in 10 - 20 % of HBsAg and anti-HBe positive individuals; such pathology is not associated with the occurrence of precore stop codon mutation...|$|E

40|$|Using a double-staining {{immunohistochemical}} procedure, the topographical {{relationship between}} viral antigens {{on the one}} hand and the expression of major histocompatibility complex products by hepatocytes on the other hand was analyzed in a series of 19 liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In areas of <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> periportal hepatocytes demonstrated Class I major histocompatibility complex products or HLA-A, B and C antigens, but did not show a preferential expression of either HBcAg or HBsAg. The cellular infiltrate of <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> consisted of helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and was admixed in four cases with branching dendritic processes of sinusoidal lining cells which strongly expressed Class II major histocompatibility complex products or HLA-DR antigens. The latter surrounded small groups of periportal hepatocytes. In areas of spotty necrosis, the hepatocytes expressed HLA-A, B and C antigens in all cases, and were admixed with variable numbers of suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. In 14 cases, the clustered hepatocytes in areas of spotty necrosis expressed HLA-DR antigens, associated in 11 of the cases with immunoreactive HBcAg in the nuclei of some of the HLA-DR-positive hepatocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy, performed in one such case, demonstrated the presence of HLA-DR antigen in a discontinuous pattern at the plasma membrane of some hepatocytes, together with the presence of core particles in the nucleus of HLA-DR-positive hepatocytes. Our findings further contribute to the growing evidence that HBcAg represents the major target antigen for T-cell attack in areas of spotty necrosis.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{has become}} a major public health issue. It is {{prevalent}} in most countries. HCV infection frequently begins without clinical symptoms, before progressing to persistent viremia, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the majority of patients (70 % to 80 %). Alcohol is an independent cofactor that accelerates the development of HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate ethanol-induced hepatic changes in HCV core-Tg mice and mutant core Tg mice. Wild type (NTG), core wild-Tg mice (TG-K), mutant core 116 -Tg mice (TG- 116) and mutant core 99 -Tg mice (TG- 99) were used in this investigation. All groups were given drinking water with 10 % ethanol and 5 % sucrose for 13 weeks. To observe liver morphological changes, we performed histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Histopathologically, NTG, TG-K and TG- 116 mice showed moderate centrilobular necrosis, while severe centrilobular necrosis and hepatocyte dissociation were observed in TG- 99 mice with increasing lymphocyte infiltration and <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis.</b> In all groups, a small amount of collagen fiber was found, principally in portal areas.

These histological features are characteristically found in the autoimmune disorder of chronic active hepatitis, in which anti-LSP antibodies are almost invariably present.

In contrast, intra-epithelial S 100 + DC were not found with any consistency in sclerosing cholangitis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia, or chronic liver allograft rejection, {{all of which are}} characterized by inflammatory bile duct damage. The possible relevance of DC in the pathogenesis of PBC is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of immunoreactive alpha interferon was examined in 78 liver biopsy specimens using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Biopsy specimens included cases of acute viral hepatitis, {{chronic active hepatitis}}, primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, large bile duct obstruction and normal liver. Kupffer cells were positive for alpha interferon in all cases. Hepatocytes were negative for alpha interferon in normal liver but in acute viral hepatitis were positive in perivenular and necrotic areas. Hepatocytes were positive in periportal areas, associated with <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> in chronic active hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, and were positive in perivenular areas in alcoholic hepatitis and large bile duct obstruction. The unexpected finding of alpha interferon in hepatocytes in non-viral liver disease indicates {{that the presence of}} this substance in liver cells cannot be taken as a specific marker of viral infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract - To {{study the}} histogenetic {{recovery}} of hepatic lesions due to portal bacteremia, a complication of some clinical conditions, an experimental animal model had developed. Portal bacteremia {{was performed in}} 8 -week rats and the morphological recovery of liver was histologically checked 1 to 6 days after bacteria inoculation. The major injuries, such as acute inflammatory exudate of the portobiliary spaces, <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis</b> of muralium, micro-abscesses and areas of hepatocyte necrosis of the liver parenchyma, and thrombosis in the centrolobular vein were recorded 1 day after inoculation. Minimal signs of vacuolar degeneration, steatosis, necrosis areas, vessel congestion and focal hemosiderosis together with a small hepatocyte proliferative activity was instead appreciable with longer time. The results seem to suggest a role of vascular structures and Kupffer cells in the morphological repair. This experimental model could serve to understand better similar clinical hepatology conditions, such as portal bacteremia. Informazioni util...|$|E
40|$|We {{recognized}} {{two distinct}} clinical and histologic syndromes of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in irradiation chimeric dogs given hemopoietic grafts from DLA-nonidentical littermate donors. Clinically acute GVHD developed, {{with a median}} onset of 13 days after the transplant, and was characterized by skin erythema, jaundice, diarrhea, and gram-negative infections; the median survival of these dogs was 29. 5 days. Chronic GVHD developed a median of 124 days after the transplant and was characterized by generalized skin ulcerations, massive ascites, and gram-positive infections; the median survival of these dogs was 150 days. Chronic GVHD could be distinguished histologically from acute GVHD by epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis and by bile duct proliferation, bridging, <b>piecemeal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> and portal fibrosis in the liver. Questions related to GVHD in man can be investigated in this model of acute and chronic GVHD in a large outbred species...|$|E
