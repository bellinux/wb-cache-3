25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped {{two inches of}} rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just {{three days before the}} scheduled concrete foundation <b>pour.</b> <b>The</b> earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard. Because many cooks could not afford to buy new shortening to replace what they used, they would <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> liquefied cooking grease into a container. After cooling completely, the grease re-solidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard.|$|E

25|$|The vault door is also molded {{of special}} {{concrete}} {{used to make}} the panels, but it can be made in several ways. The door mold differs from the panel molds because there is a hole for the lock and the door will be clad in stainless steel. Some manufacturers use the steel cladding as the mold and <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> concrete directly into it. Other manufacturers use a regular mold and screw the steel on after the panel is dry.|$|E

25|$|The funding request {{fared better}} in 1966. Once again, the House Appropriations Committee cut the administration's $45.7 million funding request in May. But {{with the land}} for the {{structure}} almost completely cleared, GSA would be left holding an empty lot if funding was not forthcoming. This prompted Congress to act. In October, a House-Senate budget conference committee recommended spending $11.3 million to excavate and build the foundation and to <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> first floor's concrete slab. Both chambers of Congress approved this expenditure late in the month.|$|E

25|$|To {{properly}} cool a fire, splash {{water on}} all embers, including {{places that are}} not glowing red. Splashing the water is both more effective and efficient in extinguishing the fire. The water boils violently and carries ash {{in the air with}} it, dirtying anything nearby but not posing a safety hazard. <b>Pour</b> <b>the</b> water until the hissing stops. Then stir the ashes with a stick {{to make sure that the}} water penetrates all the layers. If the hissing continues, add more water. When the fire is fully extinguished, the ashes are cool to the touch.|$|E
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, {{a pint of}} Guinness {{should be}} served in a {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 {{of the way up}} the glass). To begin the <b>pour,</b> <b>the</b> server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the tap and fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of the}} tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E
25|$|Arnaz {{appeared}} in several {{movies in the}} 1940s such as Bataan (1943). He received his draft notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the United States Army during World War II. He was assigned to direct United Service Organization (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Discovering {{the first thing the}} wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend Marco Rizo to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for I Love Lucy.|$|E

25|$|Blake's great {{innovation}} in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, {{parts of the}} plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> acid {{about a quarter of}} an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. <b>Pour</b> <b>the</b> Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E
500|$|During an attack, castle or {{fortification}} defenders could launch or <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> substances on {{the heads}} of attackers below. [...] This could be done over the battlements, but also through purpose-built holes such as machicolations and murder-holes. [...] Indian records suggest smoke and fire was used defensively within a fortress to confuse and disorient attackers; iron grills could also be heated and used to block passageways. [...] During night attacks, defenders could drop lighted bundles over the walls so the enemy could be seen; Chinese and Muslim sources also describe the light gained by torches hung on the walls.|$|E

5000|$|Kazakhs {{like other}} Central Asian nations have some special rules of [...] "tea ceremony". Traditionally {{it is not}} allowed to <b>pour</b> tea to <b>the</b> brim of the cup called [...] "piala". The less tea is <b>poured</b> <b>the</b> more respect is given to the guest. It is {{explained}} by saying that if <b>the</b> host <b>pours</b> too much tea, it looks like he wants the guest to leave sooner. The less tea is <b>poured,</b> <b>the</b> more the host has to pour it over and over again, so that the guest always has hot tea, which shows care for the guest.

500|$|Stimulated by {{antiquarian}} writings about British viticulture, Bute {{decided to}} reintroduce commercial grape vines into Britain in 1873. He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France {{for training and}} planted a [...] vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875. The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles. Punch magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that [...] "it would take four men to drink it—two to hold the victim and one to <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> wine down his throat". By 1887, the output was 3,000 bottles of sweet white wine of reasonable quality. Bute persevered, commercial success followed and 40 hogsheads of wine, including a red varietal using Gamay grapes, were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|Many beers {{are sold}} in cans, though there is {{considerable}} variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans. People either drink from the can or <b>pour</b> <b>the</b> beer into a glass. A technology developed by Crown Holdings for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the 'full aperture' can, so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process, turning the can into a drinking cup. Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing [...] "skunked" [...] beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining {{the quality of a}} beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles. Plastic (PET) bottles are used by some breweries.|$|E
500|$|The first {{concrete}} was {{poured into}} the dam on June 6, 1933, 18months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous <b>pour,</b> <b>the</b> concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as [...] and [...] high. Each five-foot form contained a series of [...] steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a refrigeration plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase {{the strength of the}} joins.|$|E
