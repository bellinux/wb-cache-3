50|$|The modern {{design of}} block ciphers {{is based on}} the concept of an {{iterated}} <b>product</b> <b>cipher.</b> In his seminal 1949 publication, Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, Claude Shannon analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as substitutions and permutations. Iterated product ciphers carry out encryption in multiple rounds, each of which uses a different subkey derived from the original key. One widespread implementation of such ciphers, named a Feistel network after Horst Feistel, is notably implemented in the DES cipher. Many other realizations of block ciphers, such as the AES, are classified as substitution-permutation networks.|$|E

Next, we {{take into}} {{consideration}} the fact that multiple iterations of chaotic functions lead to slow ciphers while a small number of iterations may raise security problems, so that the encryption algorithm is both fast and secure [35]. In order to make possible a single iteration of the chaotic systems while maintaining high security standards, the proposed scheme combines a simple chaotic stream cipher and two simple chaotic block ciphers (with time variant S-boxes) to implement a complex <b>product</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E

In [29], nonlinear diffusion has been added to quantized ciphertexts. Zhang et al.

Avalanche is a desirable cryptographic property {{that is necessary to}} ensure that a small difference between two plaintexts results in a seemingly random difference between the two corresponding ciphertexts. In order to examine the behaviour of DES-like ciphers in relation to the avalanche property, a model of the cipher is developed which allows us to analyze the avalanche characteristics of the cipher for different cipher parameter values. In particular, the results suggest that large, symmetric S-boxes which satisfy the guaranteed avalanche property are effective in combining efficiency and good avalanche characteristics of the cipher.

In this contribution we introduce a new <b>product</b> <b>cipher</b> which encrypts large blocks of plain-text (images) by repeated intertwined application of substitution and permutation operations. While almost all of the current product ciphers use xed (predened) permutation operations on small data blocks, our approach involves parameterizable (keyed) permutations on large data blocks (whole images) induced by specic chaotic systems (Kolmogorov ows). By combining these highly unstable dynamics with an adaption of a very fast shift register based pseudo-random number generator we obtain a new class of computationally secure product ciphers which are rmly grounded on systems theoretic concepts, oering many features that make them superior to contemporary bulk encryption systems when aiming at ecient image data encryption...|$|E

RC 4 is one of the most popular encryption algorithms and finds its applications in many security protocols such as Wi-Fi Protocol Access (WPA) and Wired Equivalence Privacy (WEP). Although being a versatile encryption technique, RC 4 faces numerous loopholes and weaknesses. Encrypted messages can sometimes be broken by cryptanalysis, also called codebreaking. It uses three secret keys- two secret keys K 1 and K 2 as seeds for Enhanced RC 4 and K 3 as the key for Vigenère Cipher substitution. It also uses two S-Boxes S 1 and S 2. Both of them contain N elements from 0 to N- 1. Although being a versatile encryption algorithm, Vigenère Cipher is not resistant to the Kasiski Attack.

Linear structures [4] are also examined, which are a form of linearity that leads to degeneracy in the key, meaning that certain bits do not affect the ciphertext. We show that most functions {{are not expected to}} have a linear structure, though even partial linearity in this respect leads to a powerful attack known as differential cryptanalysis.
