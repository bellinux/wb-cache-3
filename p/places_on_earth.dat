5|$|With the {{exception}} of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows {{the study of the}} chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E

25|$|French Polynesia {{as we know}} {{it today}} was one of the last <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> to be settled by humans.

The first islands of French Polynesia to be settled were the Marquesas Islands in about 200 BC. The Polynesians later ventured southwest and discovered the Society Islands around AD 300.|$|E
25|$|Some lakes can {{disappear}} seasonally. These {{are called}} intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes {{and can be}} found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graubünden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth,</b> like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.|$|E

25|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction {{that the}} Moon exerts on Earth {{is the cause}} of tides in the sea; the Sun has a lesser tidal influence. If Earth had a global ocean of uniform depth, the Moon would act to deform both the solid Earth (by a small amount) and the ocean in the shape of an ellipsoid with the high points roughly beneath the Moon and {{on the opposite side of}} Earth. However, because of the presence of the continents, Earth's much faster rotation and varying ocean depths, this simplistic visualisation does not happen. Although the tidal flow period is generally synchronized to the Moon's orbit around Earth, its relative timing varies greatly. In some <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> there is only one high tide per day, whereas others have four, though this is somewhat rare.|$|E
25|$|Worf {{was born}} in 2340 on Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld) {{as the son of}} Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf's parents were killed during a {{surprise}} attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS Intrepid. Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and took him in after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents' native city of Minsk, later recommending it to Miles O'Brien as one of his favorite <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to some traditions, it is {{believed}} that an angry Shiva performed the fearsome and awe-inspiring Tandava dance with Gauri's charred body on his shoulders. During this dance, Gaurī's body came apart and the pieces fell at different <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth.</b> According to another version, Shiva placed Gauri's body on his shoulder and ran about the world, crazed with grief. The Gods called upon the Lord Vishnu to restore Shiva to normalcy and calm. Vishnu, used his Sudarshana Chakra to dismember Gauri's lifeless body, following which Shiva regained his equanimity. Both versions state that Gauri's body was thus dismembered into 64 pieces which fell on earth at various places. These 64 holy places, known as Shakti Peethas,. Some of these places, like the Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Temple, have become major centers of pilgrimage as they are held by the Goddess-oriented Shakta sect to be particularly holy.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Atlantic coast has warm summers (28°C to 32°C, {{but with}} relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs of about 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10°C or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. It only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, {{and the city}} of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24°C to 28°C, nights of 12°C to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250mm of rain. However, there is a drastic drop as we move south to Santa Cruz: Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17°C to 21°C, (nights between 6°C and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2°C to 6°C, with nights between −5°C and 0°C despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> with winds reaching 100km h occasionally.|$|E
25|$|Multimillion-dollar {{investments}} {{beginning in}} the 1990s by the World Bank have reclaimed desert and turned the Ica Valley in Peru, one of the driest <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth,</b> into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, {{one of the fastest}} rates of aquifer depletion in the world. The wells of small farmers and local people are beginning to run dry and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat. As a cash crop, asparagus has provided jobs for local people, but most of the money goes to the buyers, mainly the British. A 2010 report concluded that the industry is not sustainable and accuses investors, including the World Bank, of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries. Diverting water from the headwaters of the Ica River to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of Huancavelica, where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E
