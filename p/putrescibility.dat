25|$|The most {{important}} initial issue {{when considering the}} application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of <b>putrescibility</b> is the key factor in its successful application. The more putrescible (digestible) the material, the higher the gas yields possible from the system.|$|E
40|$|Lab scale {{tests in}} {{bioreactor}} {{were carried out}} in the framework of the characterization studies of a landfill where in situ aeration followed by landfill mining has been proposed as part of the novel waste management strategy in a region in northern Italy. The results obtained showed positive effects of the aeration on leachate quality and a significant reduction of waste <b>putrescibility.</b> The experiments were carried out with focus on carbon and nitrogen balance in the reactors; the data obtained provided information to be considered for full scale application...|$|E
