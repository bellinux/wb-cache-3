40|$|This work {{combines}} two well-established {{technologies to}} generate a breakthrough in protein production and purification. The first is the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules in engineered strains of Escherichia coli. The second is a recently developed group of self-cleaving affinity tags based on protein splicing elements known as inteins. By combining these technologies with a PHB-specific binding protein, a self-contained protein expression and purification system has been developed. In this system, the PHB-binding protein effectively acts as an affinity tag for desired <b>product</b> <b>proteins.</b> The tagged <b>product</b> <b>proteins</b> are expressed in E. coli strains that also produce intracellular PHB granules, where they bind to the granules via the PHB-binding tag. The granules and attached proteins can then be easily recovered following cell lysis by simple mechanical means. Once purified, the product protein is self-cleaved from the granules and released into solution in a substantially purified form. This system has been successfully used at laboratory scale to purify several active test proteins at reasonable yield. By allowing the bacterial cells to effectively produce both the affinity resin and tagged target protein, the cost associated with the purification of recombinant proteins could be greatly reduced. It is expected that this combination of improved economics and simplicity will constitute a significant breakthrough in both large-scale production of purified proteins and enzymes and high-throughput proteomics studies of peptide libraries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Scaffold {{proteins}} play {{an important}} role in the promotion of signal transmission and specificity during cell signaling. In cells, signaling proteins that make up a pathway are often physically orgnaized into complexes by scaffold proteins [1]. Previous work [2] has shown that spatial localization of scaffold can enhance signaling locally while simultaneously suppressing signaling at a distance, and the membrane confinement of scaffold proteins may result in a precipitous spatial gradient of the active <b>product</b> <b>protein,</b> high close to the membrane and low within the cell. However, cell-fate decisions critically depend on the temporal pattern of <b>product</b> <b>protein</b> close to the nucleus. In this paper, when phosphorylation signals cannot be transfered by diffusion only, two mechanisms have been proposed for long-range signaling within cells: multiple locations of scaffold proteins and dynamical movement of scaffold proteins. Thus, here we have unveiled how the spatial propagation of the phosphorylated <b>product</b> <b>protein</b> within a cell depends on the spatially and temporal localized scaffold proteins.

It is the ligand-activated transcription factor that controls the lipid metabolism and is now studied from etiology viewpoint of obesity and type 2 diabetes. A large number of genes have already been identified as target genes activated or repressed by the receptor, experimental e#orts are continued to find complete list of such genes. This subject is related to identification of regulatory region of arbitrary gene or binding site of transcription factors, therefore informatics approach is expected. Since a pure computational approach in identifying the target genes and cis-regulatory (response) elements is currently impossible, knowledge-based approach combined with algorithmic approach is a practical solution.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{mercaptan}} compounds were studied {{with respect to}} their ability to inhibit the growth of poliovirus in cultured cells. Of the compounds tested only d-penicillamine possessed antiviral activity. There was no direct effect on the virus itself, nor were the processes of adsorption, penetration and uncoating, or virus-induced “shut-off” of host cell protein synthesis inhibited. At concentrations where there was no effect on host cell RNA or protein synthesis, d-penicillamine caused a marked inhibition of virus-specific RNA and protein synthesis. Although much reduced, the relative concentrations of single-stranded and double-stranded viral RNA synthesized in the presence of d-penicillamine was unchanged. Similarly, all apparent precursor and cleavage <b>product</b> <b>proteins</b> could be synthesized {{in the presence of the}} drug.

To further clarify the role of the monomer shuffling, we have performed a computational modeling of interactions among Kai proteins assuming the allosteric transition of KaiC hexamer as well as the monomer shuffling. The results show that the existence of both monomer shuffling and allosteric transition can synchronize the phosphorylation level of the KaiC hexamers, and stabilizes its oscillation...|$|E
