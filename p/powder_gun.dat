40|$|Summary- We {{conducted}} epth of penetration experiments into grout {{and concrete}} targets with ogive-nose steel projectiles. <b>Powder</b> <b>guns</b> launched 0. 064 kg, 12. 9 mm diameter projectiles into grout targets with {{unconfined compressive strength}}s of 13. 5 M Pa (2. 0 ksi} and 21. 6 MPa (3. 1 ksi). For the concrete targets, <b>powder</b> <b>guns</b> launched projectiles with length-to-diameter ratios of 10; a 0. 48 kg, 20. 3 mm diameter od, and a 1. 60 kg, 30. 5 mm diameter od. Concrete targets had unconfined compressive strength of 62. 8 M Pa (9. 1 ksi) for the 0. 48 kg rods and unconfined compressive strength of 51. 0 MPa (7. 4 ksi) for the 1. 60 kg rods. For these xperiments, penetration depth increased as striking velocity increased until nose erosion became xcessive. Thus, we determined experimentally the striking velocities corresponding to maximum penetration depths. Predictions from a previously published model are in good agreement with data until nose erosion becomes excessive. Copyrigh...|$|R

Although it was {{predicted}} that there would be an increase in the use of black <b>powder</b> <b>guns</b> due to their greater ease of procurement with less government control on sales, this {{does not seem to have}} been the general experience. To determine the rate of use of black powder handguns in shooting deaths in Berlin, Germany, review of the files of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin was conducted over a 10 -year period from 1997 to 2006. Out of total 85 gunshot deaths, there were only 3 where black powder handguns were used (3. 5 %). The cases involved 3 males aged 55, 62, and 63 years, respectively, all of whom had committed suicide with black powder percussion handguns, using 0. 45, 0. 56, and 0. 36 caliber weapons. The source of the guns could not be determined. Wounds were characterized by excessive soot and propellant soiling and tattooing. The low number of fatalities involving black <b>powder</b> <b>guns</b> in a large forensic institution in Berlin, Germany, suggests that limiting access to such weapons would have little effect on total numbers of gunshot deaths.

40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{increasing}} employment of powder coating technology, the complex interrelations in the powder application, mainly the particle size distribution and its influence, must be understood. For that, in the first part a new measuring method had to be developed, to make visible the problematics and in the next part to find a solution for it. This includes: the monitoring of the process control parameters (powder mass flow rate, particle size distribution, electrostatics, air flow and climate), {{the development of a new}} testing method for powder spray systems, the development of a simulation method to predict the recycling behaviour (KAP-SIM-method), the employment of a newly developed charge spectrometer for coating powder. With the aim of these methods in the experimental optimization measures the following process parameters were taken into consideration: particle size spectrum of coating powder, coating powder recovery method and the distribution nozzles of the spray systems. For an increasing and efficient use of powder coating systems in the future, the users demand more flexible <b>powder</b> spray <b>guns.</b> That means <b>powder</b> <b>guns</b> with which the dimensions of the spray cloud may be shaped continuously. The present thesis was aimed at realizing such powder spray systems in form of <b>powder</b> spray <b>guns</b> using aerodynamical and electrostatical solution approaches. Two completely different solutions were separately realized. On the field of electrostatics mainly the influence of steering electrodes was tested. In combination with tribo charging powder this electrodes are very effective. On the other hand, a new pistol could be dimensioned and optimized with the help of numerical simulation. The continuous regulation of the spray cloud was realized with additional controlling airs. In the future, the simulation will be an important tool in the investigation of complex powder coating processes. In the development of such systems the simulation will be used more and more. With it, the development time of the product is reduced. Therein the <b>powder</b> <b>guns</b> are only one part in the coating process.

The dynamic liner radiographs are acquired with radially oriented X-ray heads that are instrumental for observing and diagnosing liner shape and symmetry, Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth, and liner-glide plane interaction (see Fig. 1). Multiframe radiographs acquired along the axis of a cylindrical target are used to provide physical data on phenomena such as shock-driven target hydrodynamics, Richtmyer-Meshkov instability growth, spall, fiction, and equations of state.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{vertical}} impacts of aluminum projectiles into quartz sand are reported.

The present data, together with previous experimental data and the 'late-stage equivalence' of Dienes and Walsh, are seen as indicating that the crater diameter is expressed by {{a function of the}} 'late-stage effective energy' but not of the impact kinetic energy. The diameter of a crater formed in a noncohesive sand is found to be proportional to one-fourth the power of the late-state effective energy. For general impact cratering in a target with a finite strength, a relation is given between the velocity and the diameter, suggesting that there are four regimes in the crater diameter versus kinetic energy relation...|$|E

After the oncoming projectiles impact the targets fired from the 37 -millimeter gun, these targets are recovered by allowing them to impact into Celotex and soft wooden blocks.

40|$|AbstractThe shock {{response}} and spall strength of Kovar®, an alloy of Fe- 29 Ni- 17 Co, are obtained using a single stage <b>powder</b> <b>gun</b> to achieve pressures between 6 and 55 GPa by performing symmetric, planar impact tests. Above ~ 6. 5 GPa, the behavior shifts from a dispersive, continuous pressure {{rise to a}} shock, and it is shown that the material displays anomalous behavior at low pressures. Above 6. 5 GPa, the Hugoniot is described by a linear relationship between shock and particle velocity of US= 2. 06 UP+ 3. 54 km/s. The spall strength, an engineering description of the spall phenomenon, was calculated and shown to increase from 3. 6 - 7. 4 GPa as stress increases from 6 - 55 GPa, and it is shown that the method of spall strength computation has a large effect. From previous studies on the iron-nickel system, the authors expected to observe evidence of an α → E phase transition in the material but did not. Upon examining the shock and metallurgical literature, high concentrations of Ni and Co will have competing effects on the phase transition, but the effect of Ni will likely dominate and decrease the phase transition pressure. Further experiments on the high alloy Fe-Ni-Co system are needed to understand Kovar's complex low pressure mechanical behavior...|$|E

Further, the effect of partial devitrification on the shock {{response of}} bulk metallic glasses is examined by conducting experiments on two iron-based in situ metallic glass matrix composites, containing varying amounts of crystalline precipitates, both with initial composition Fe_(49. 7) Cr_(17. 7) Mn_(1. 9) Mo_(7. 4) W_(1. 6) B_(15. 2) C_(3. 8) Si_(2. 4). The samples, designated SAM 2 X 5 - 600 and SAM 2 X 5 - 630, are X-ray amorphous and partially crystalline, respectively, {{due to differences in}} sintering parameters during sample preparation. Shock response is determined by making velocity measurements using interferometry techniques at the rear free surface of the samples, which have been subjected to impact from a high-velocity projectile launched from a <b>powder</b> <b>gun.</b> Experiments have yielded results indicating a Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) to be 8. 58 [*]±[*] 0. 53 GPa for SAM 2 X 5 - 600 and 11. 76 [*]±[*] 1. 26 GPa for SAM 2 X 5 - 630.

SAM 2 X 5 - 600 catastrophically loses post-yield strength whereas SAM 2 X 5 - 630, while showing some strain-softening, retains strength beyond the HEL.
