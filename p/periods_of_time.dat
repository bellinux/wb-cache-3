5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather over long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It {{is measured by}} assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|Byne's disease, more {{accurately}} known as Bynesian decay, is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction) which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display for long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
50|$|To {{calculate}} the equity-risk premium, subtract the risk free rate from {{the return of}} a stock over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> For example, if the return on a stock is 17% and the risk-free rate over the same <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is 9%, then the equity-risk premium would be 8% for the stock over that <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

5|$|Similar to {{tropical}} cyclones, extra-tropical storms {{cause an}} offshore rise of water. However, unlike most tropical cyclone storm surges, extra-tropical storms can cause higher water levels across {{a large area}} for longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> depending on the system.|$|E

30|$|The typical {{temporal}} queries include querying {{the number}} of non-on-time events over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and querying the routes that have the most non-on-time events over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{conference calls}} are {{typically}} recorded. There is typically a fixed <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{devoted to the}} presentation of information followed by another fixed <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for questions and answers.|$|R

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{combat in}} the game follows a {{strictly}} turn-based formula, the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character, {{and in some cases}} characters are allowed to strike before enemies can act if they possess sufficient speed. Different attacks can take varied <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to execute.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{respondents}} {{record the}} fantasies they experience over a given <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> via checklists or diaries. This method requires a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to be representative, {{and may be}} impractical.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{covered by}} a {{reservation}} is represented {{by a set of}} [...] "top-nodes". This set is the minimal set of nodes that exactly cover the reservation <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another system, {{known as}} VACMA, oversees the driver's alertness. It {{consists}} of a foot pedal control that the driver needs to hold down for the TGV to move. This pedal must be released then re-pressed once every 60 seconds if no other activity takes place. There is one <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before a buzzer sounds, and another <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before the automatic emergency brakes come on. The control can be released for a very short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before a buzzer sounds, and another very short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before the automatic emergency brakes come on.|$|R

5|$|Book V covers law and chronology. Isidore distinguishes natural, civil, international, {{military}} and public law among others. He discusses {{the purpose of}} law, legal cases, witnesses, offences and penalties. On chronology, Isidore covers <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> such as days, weeks, and months, solstices and equinoxes, seasons, special years such as Olympiads and Jubilees, generations and ages.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine {{the composition of the}} Solar System 4.5billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system. Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.|$|E

5|$|In {{the past}} Banagher was noted {{for a number}} of crafts, {{including}} pottery and a popular pottery company, called Crannóg Pottery, was established at the West End by Valerie Landon in the early 1950s.

5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so.

5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres.
