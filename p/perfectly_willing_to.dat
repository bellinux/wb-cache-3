500|$|The film also {{explored}} Bird's {{dislike for}} {{the tendency of}} the children's comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening. In the film, Dash and Violet {{have to deal with}} villains who are <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> use deadly force against children. On another level, both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them, such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him, or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside, in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable. Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: [...] "The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me. Look, it's a mainstream animated movie, and how often are those considered thought provoking?" ...|$|E

"There are sins {{that men}} commit {{for which they}} cannot receive {{forgiveness}} in this world, or in that which is to come, {{and if they had}} their eyes open to see their true condition, they would be <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have their blood spilt upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins, and the smoking incense would atone for their sins." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the vessel}} was {{preparing}} to leave in June for Guam, [...] shipmaster Matthew McFie had William Hughes, one of the crew, charged with insubordination. While in court Hughes appeared [...] "excessively loquacious and irregular in Court, being apparently {{under the influence of}} drink. In the course of his garrulous, but disconnected statement, {{he said that he was}} <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go on board and resume duty". Due to this misconduct he was goaled for 24 hours.|$|E

He would be <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and glad <b>to</b> do anything you do, and to live in any way you live. Besides, he told me, not very long ago, that he often thought of the joys of an humble life, without care, without anxiety, enough, no more, and a peaceful mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing she has," [...] said I; [...] "it's quite {{evident that}} she, for some reason, means {{to conform to}} this position. You seldom have a girl apply for work who comes dressed with such severe simplicity; her manner is retiring, and she seemed <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and desirous <b>to</b> {{undertake}} {{any of the things}} which you mentioned as among her daily tasks." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} {{understand}} Walkirk's objections {{to this sort of}} work, for he was a ready writer, a good stenographer, and had shown himself <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and able <b>to</b> perform duties much more difficult and distasteful than I imagined this possibly could be. But there are many things I do not understand, and which I consider it a waste of time to try to understand; and this was one of them.|$|R
2500|$|Neisser {{concluded}} that the brain does not encode conversational memory verbatim and often has trouble remembering the gist of single independent conversations, but what Dean's memory and likely everyone else's does do well is retain [...] "the common characteristics of {{a whole series of}} events." [...] In other words, Dean may have gotten some details wrong, who said what at what time, but he did get the big picture of all the conversations combined right. [...] "Nixon wanted the cover-up to succeed; he was pleased when it went well; he was troubled when it began to unravel; he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> consider illegal activities if they would extend his power or confound his enemies." [...] Dean's mind is [...] "not a tape recorder, but it certainly received the message that was being given." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946 Soviet {{jet engine}} {{designers}} approached Stalin with {{a request to}} buy jet designs from Western sources to overcome design difficulties. Stalin {{is said to have}} replied: [...] "What fool will sell us his secrets?" [...] However, he gave his assent to the proposal, and Soviet scientists and designers travelled to the United Kingdom to meet Cripps and request the engines. To Stalin's amazement, Cripps and the Labour government were <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide technical information on the Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal-flow jet engine designed by RAF officer Frank Whittle, along with discussions of a licence to manufacture Nene engines. The Nene engine was promptly reverse-engineered and produced in modified form as the Soviet Klimov VK-1 jet engine, later incorporated into the MiG-15 which flew in time to deploy in combat against UN forces in North Korea in 1950, causing the loss of several B-29 bombers and cancellation of their daylight bombing missions over North Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Rundgren did {{the final}} mix {{for the whole}} album. He was upset to not receive a co-production credit {{for any of the}} Harrison-produced tracks, later telling author Peter Doggett: [...] " [...] didn't finish any of the songs, though he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take the credit for the songs that I finished." [...] Although admiring of Rundgren's {{technical}} abilities in the studio, Badfinger were vocal in their opposition to his working methods; Matovina wrote in a 1979 article for Trouser Press: [...] "According to the band, he was totally domineering and had little respect for their ideas. Todd made the album slick and simple, and an abundance of the group’s natural energy was lost." [...] While Ham was especially positive about working with Harrison, and Molland described it as [...] "a great experience, he was a master in the studio … very encouraging and co-operative", Molland has also rued the band's loss of creative control, such that the result was far from their original vision.|$|E
60|$|Ma {{was delighted}} with her trip, {{but she was}} disgusted with the girls for {{allowing}} me to embrace and kiss them--and she was horrified at the Schottische as performed by Miss Castle and myself. She was <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> for me <b>to</b> dance until 12 o'clock at the imminent peril of my going {{to sleep on the}} after watch--but then she would top off with a very inconsistent sermon on dancing in general; ending with a terrific broadside aimed at that heresy of heresies, the Schottische.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Geoffrey Langford {{offered to}} escort his {{sister-in-law}} from Devonshire, {{but she did}} not like his holidays to be so wasted. She had no merely personal apprehensions, and new as railroads were to her, declared herself <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and able <b>to</b> manage with no companions but her daughter and maid, with whom she was to travel to his house in London, there to be met {{in a day or two}} by the two school-boys, Frederick and his cousin Alexander, and then proceed all together to Knight Sutton.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you see, {{though she}} is <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and anxious <b>to</b> begin again, poor dear Kally really can't. She did try to arrange a design that had been running in her head for a long time, {{and she was so}} bad after it that Dr. Dagger said she must not attempt it. Then, {{though she is}} {{discreet}} enough for anything, Mr. White is not really her uncle, and could not take her about with him alone or even with Maura; so I gather from some expressions in his letter {{that he would like to}} take her out with them, spend the summer at Rocca Marina, and let her have a winter's study at Florence. Then, I suppose she might come back and superintend on quite a different footing.|$|R

60|$|Nearly a {{week was}} {{required}} for the execution of this work, and during this time I took a rest from literary composition and visited some friends, leaving all the arrangements for my new secretary {{in the hands of}} my grandmother and Walkirk. When I returned, the iron grating was in its place. It was a neat and artistic piece of work, but I did not like it. I object decidedly to anything which suggests restraint. The whole affair of the secretary was indeed very different from what I would have had it, but I had discovered that even in our advanced era of civilization one cannot always have everything he wants, albeit he be <b>perfectly</b> able and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for it.|$|R
25|$|Asceticism is {{indigenous}} to the religions which posit as fundamental the wickedness {{of this life}} and the corruption under sin of the flesh. Buddhism, therefore, as well as Christianity, leads to ascetic practices. Monasteries are institutions of Buddhism no less than of Catholic Christianity. The assumption, found in {{the views of the}} Montanists and others, that concessions made to the natural appetites may be pardoned in those that are of a lower degree of holiness, while the <b>perfectly</b> holy <b>will</b> refuse <b>to</b> yield in the least to carnal needs and desires, is easily detected also in some of the teachings of Gautama Buddha. The ideal of holiness of both the Buddhist and the Christian saint culminates in poverty and chastity; i.e., celibacy. Fasting and other disciplinary methods are resorted to curb the flesh.|$|R

60|$|The {{diplomatic}} Lafitte, having {{finished for}} a time his negotiations with the British, lost no time in communicating with the American authorities. He sent to Governor Claiborne, of Louisiana, all the documents he had received from Captain Lockyer, and wrote him a letter in which he told him everything that had happened, and thus gave to the United States the first authentic information of the proposed attack upon Mobile and New Orleans. He then told the Governor {{that he had no}} intention of fighting against the country he had adopted; that he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and anxious <b>to</b> aid her in every manner possible, and that he and his followers would gladly join the United States against the British, asking nothing in return except that all proceedings against Barrataria should be abandoned, that amnesty should be given to him and his men, that his brother should be released from prison, and that an act of oblivion should be passed by which the deeds of the smugglers of Barrataria should be condoned and forgotten.|$|R

2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, <b>perfectly</b> <b>willing</b> and able <b>to</b> talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|R

60|$|Why not? I ask. To {{say that}} God cannot appear to men is simply silly; {{for it is}} {{limiting}} God's Almighty power. He that made man and all heaven and earth, cannot he show himself to man, if he shall so please? To say that God <b>will</b> not appear <b>to</b> man because man is so insignificant, and this earth such a paltry little speck in the heavens, is to limit God's goodness; nay, it {{is to show that}} a man knows not what goodness means. What grace, what virtue is there higher than condescension? Then if God be, as he is, perfectly good, must he not be <b>perfectly</b> condescending--ready and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> stoop to man, and all the more ready and the more willing, the more weak, ignorant, and sinful this man is? In fact, the greater need man has of God, the more certain is it that God will help him in that need.|$|R

40|$|Until {{automated}} cars function <b>perfectly,</b> drivers <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> {{take over}} control when automation fails or reaches its functional limits. Two simulator experiments (N = 24 and 27) were conducted, each testing four automation levels ranging from manual control (MC) to highly automated driving. In both experiments, participants about once every 3 min experienced {{an event that}} required intervention. Participants performed a secondary divided attention task while driving. Automation generally resulted in improved secondary task performance and reduced self-reported physical demand and effort as compared to MC. However, automated speed control was experienced as more frustrating than MC. Participants responded quickly to the events when the stimulus was salient (i. e., stop sign, crossing pedestrian, and braking lead car), but often failed to react to an automation failure when their vehicle was driving slowly. In conclusion, driving with imperfect automation can be frustrating, even though mental and physical demands are reduced...|$|R
