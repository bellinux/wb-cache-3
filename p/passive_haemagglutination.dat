40|$|Reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination,</b> a novel microtitre based assay, was {{compared}} with the Streptex (Wellcome UK) latex slide agglutination kit for streptococcal grouping in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Three hundred and fifty two extracts from 349 consecutive primary isolation plates were assayed by both methods. Reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> gave identical grouping results for 98. 0 % of the 345 streptococci identified by Streptex, and the kappa coefficient of agreement between the methods for all 352 extracts tested was 0. 973. Cross reactions with Listeria spp seen with Streptex were not found by reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination.</b> In the reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> method 11 streptococci could be grouped on each 96 -well plate and most reactions were stable for at least 30 minutes. Reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> is more rapid to perform than latex slide agglutination when many organisms are to be grouped, and the patterns of haemagglutination are easily recognised. If the method was taken into routine use in a diagnostic laboratory, the persistence of reverse <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> reactions would enable grouping results to be checked for quality control purposes...|$|E
40|$|A <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test, using sheep {{red blood}} cells sensitised with Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide, was {{compared}} with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area. The results obtained on sera from 152 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid and 183 patients {{who did not have}} typhoid were analysed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and rapidity of the respective tests. The <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test was found to be more sensitive (80 %) than the S typhi O antigen (71 %) but marginally less sensitive than the H antigen (82 %) of the Widal test. The false positive rate on control sera was 1. 2 % and 6. 6 %, respectively, for the Widal O and H antigens, and 1. 6 % for the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test. Our findings indicate that the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test is comparable with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in endemic areas, but is more simple, rapid, and economic. The <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test may be a useful alternative to the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in busy microbiology laboratories in areas in which the disease is endemic...|$|E

40|$|A test is {{described}} which {{is capable of}} differentiating and measuring by titration the individual classes of antibody reacting with a bacterial suspension. The serum or fluid under test is incubated with the bacteria which are then very well washed and added to indicator red cells linked with specific antiglobulin reagents. Sensitization of the bacteria by a particular class of antibody is shown by <b>haemagglutination</b> (<b>passive)</b> of the appropriate red cells. Agglutination of the bacteria themselves does not preclude an analysis. The reaction, which has been developed on a brucella system, has been designated Mixed Reverse <b>Passive</b> Antiglobulin <b>Haemagglutination</b> (or MRPAH for short) ...|$|R

40|$|Serum IgE {{levels can}} be {{measured}} by reverse <b>passive</b> antiglobulin <b>haemagglutination</b> (RPAH) using trypsin-treated human red cells coupled to anti-human IgE by chronic chloride. The results are read after only 90 min incubation. RPAH and double antibody radioimmunoassay {{have been used to}} measure IgE levels in 100 sera, with levels ranging from 5 to 43, 000 international units (i. u.) /ml. Correlation between the two assays was high over the whole range, provided that affinity-purified anti-IgE was used in the RPAH test. When two non-affinity-purified anti-IgE reagents were used in the RPAH, correlation was poor for sera with levels below 1000 i. u. /ml. It is concluded that RPAH tests for IgE are of comparable sensitivity and specificity to radioimmunoassay procedures, and provide a useful simple, yet more rapid alternative...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} 100 foals was given either a {{commercial}} bacterin or an autogenous vaccine consisting of whole cells and an acid extract of Streptococcus equi. During the study, {{some of the}} foals developed clinical strangles. Various sets of sera were collected from these foals prevaccination, during vaccination, postvaccination and postinfection. The serological response of these foals was measured by <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> and long chain tests. In foals which remained healthy, the highest titres were reached within one to two months postvaccination with a <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> 10 x log 2 mean titre of 6. 78 and the long chain indices of 4. 41. These levels persisted for 120 days postvaccination. Those foals which had clinical strangles exhibited lower <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> titres (3. 78) at one to two months postimmunization, but rose significantly after recovery. Four ponies immunized with formalinized Str. equi bacterin showed a partial protection against the challenge infection.

40|$|Summary. A new {{and simple}} method of {{serotyping}} campylobacters {{has been developed}} which utilises co-agglutination to detect the presence of heat-stable antigens. Campylobacters are heated at 75 °C for 30 min to destroy antigenic protein and allowed to react on a glass slide with staphylococci coated with antibody. Of 74 isolates, 67 gave the same result by co-agglutination and the previously described <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> method.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} {{and specificity}} of potyctonal and monoclonal anti‐idiotypic antibodies raised against monoclonal anti‐progesterone and anti‐arsonate antibodies {{have been studied}} by solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) with immobilized idiotype and by <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> with idiotype‐coupled red cells. The sensitivity of the two methods was comparable, though some cross‐reactions were only detected by RIA. <b>Passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> {{was found to be}} especially suitable in screening for monoclonal anti‐idiotypes in hybridoma supernatants and ascites. and had advantages over RIA in detection of syngeneic anti‐idiotypes. Demonstration of binding site‐associated idiotopes was possible by haemagglutination inhibition. RIA and haemagglutination were used to investigate the idiotypic relationships between BALB/c antiprogesterone and anti‐arsonate monoclonal antibodies which share heavy chains encoded by VHIX variable region genes.

40|$|The <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> and {{bentonite}} flocculation {{tests were}} compared for detecting plant viruses, using antibody-sensitized tanned red cells or bentonite particles. Parsnip yellow fleck, raspberry ringspot, turnip yellow mosaic, narcissus mosaic, potato X and tobacco rattle viruses were detected by both tests in purified preparations and, where studied, in crude plant extracts. The highest antigen titres were obtained {{only when the}} red cells or bentonite particles were sensitized with optimal amounts of antibody; these had to be found experimentally because they differed between antisera and between the two tests. In comparative experiments the bentonite flocculation and <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> tests were respectively about 2 to 5 and IOO to 125 times more sensitive than tube-precipitin tests for detecting the elongated viruses and about IO to 2 o and 5 oo to 6 oo times more sensitive for detecting the isometric viruses. The minimum concentrations of virus detected were 1. 8 to 2. 6 /,g. /ml. with the bentonite flocculation test and o'o 4 to o' 24 /,g. /ml, with the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test. Red cells treated with formalin before they were tanned and sensitized with antibody could be preserved at- 14 ° for up to 8 weeks without loss of activity. In experiments with turnip yellow mosaic virus, extracts from healthy plants of eight species tested {{had little or no}} effect on either test but concentrated extracts from Chenopodium amaranticolor and Spinacia oleracea plants caused non-specific agglutination of unformalinized red cells, and dilute extracts from Petunia hybrida plants decreased eightfold the sensitivity of the <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test. These effects did not occur with formalinized red cells. Antibody-sensitized red cells were used in haemagglutination-inhibition tests to determine antiserum titres; antisera to turnip yellow mosaic and raspberry ringspot viruses gave titres 32 times higher than those obtained in tubeprecipitin tests...|$|E

40|$|Chickens of the Obese strain (OS) {{exhibit a}} hereditary, {{spontaneous}} auto-immune thyroiditis. Thyroglobulin auto-antibodies {{have so far}} been demonstrated by <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> and precipitation. A standardized indirect immunofluorescent staining system has been established as an additional technique for the demonstration of these antibodies. Two kinds of circulating thyroglobulin antibodies were found in OS chickens, one demonstrable by <b>passive</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> only, the other by both precipitation and indirect immunofluorescence using a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate directed predominantly against chicken IgG. Results obtained in chessboard type indirect immunofluorescence blocking tests and with column chromatographic fractions of OS sera are suggestive that the haemagglutinating kind of thyroglobulin antibodies are of the IgM class, while the antibodies reactive in precipitation and indirect immunofluorescence are of IgG type. The autoantibody nature of the thyroglobulin antibodies in OS chickens was demonstrated by indirect and direct immunofluorescent staining of autologous thyroid sections.
