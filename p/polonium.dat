5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own <b>polonium</b> samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study <b>polonium</b> separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing <b>polonium</b> sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of <b>polonium.</b> This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of <b>polonium,</b> which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of <b>polonium</b> to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to <b>polonium</b> either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of <b>polonium</b> was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the <b>polonium.</b> Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with <b>Polonium,</b> Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available <b>polonium</b> isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>polonium</b> {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. <b>Polonium</b> dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. <b>Polonium</b> solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from <b>polonium</b> ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, <b>polonium</b> solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, <b>polonium</b> ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{freelance}} killer {{would probably}} {{not be able to}} manufacture <b>polonium</b> from commercially available products in the amounts used for Litvinenko's poisoning, because more than microscopic amounts of <b>polonium</b> can only be produced in state-regulated nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Irène Joliot-Curie {{was the first person}} to die from the radiation effects of <b>polonium.</b> She was accidentally exposed to <b>polonium</b> in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench. In 1956, she died from leukemia.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{hypothesis}} exists for how <b>polonium</b> does this; one {{suggestion is that}} small clusters of <b>polonium</b> atoms are spalled off by the alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of <b>polonium</b> compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is {{one of the very few}} naturally occurring <b>polonium</b> compounds, as <b>polonium</b> alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> is a {{very rare}} element in nature because of the short {{half-life}} of all its isotopes. 210Po, 214Po, and 218Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus <b>polonium</b> {{can be found in}} uranium ores at about 0.1mg per metric ton (1 part in 1010), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. <b>Polonium</b> has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. <b>Polonium</b> was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. <b>Polonium</b> has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Polonium</b> Restaurant (a Polish {{restaurant}} in Sheffield, England, owned by Boguslaw Sidorowicz and named after his folk {{band in the}} late 1970s) experienced increased interest and business {{as a result of}} internet searches for the phrase <b>polonium</b> restaurant.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using <b>polonium</b> {{provided}} by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from <b>polonium</b> substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. <b>Polonium</b> is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Besides Litvinenko, {{only two}} people left <b>polonium</b> trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked {{previously}} for Russian intelligence in the KGB and the GRU, respectively. They left more significant traces of <b>polonium</b> than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the radioactive material directly, and did not ingest it.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, <b>polonium,</b> or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, <b>polonium,</b> and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of <b>polonium</b> were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with <b>polonium</b> without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of <b>polonium</b> in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|Halides of the {{structure}} PoX2, PoX4 and PoF6 are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoClX in HCl, PoBrX in HBr and PoI4 in HI. <b>Polonium</b> dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl4 with SO2 and with PoBr4 with H2S at room temperature. Tetrahalides {{can be obtained by}} reacting <b>polonium</b> dioxide with HCl, HBr or HI.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. <b>Polonium</b> {{may now be}} made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making <b>polonium</b> exceedingly rare.|$|E
5|$|Marina Litvinenko : UK reports state Litvinenko's widow tested {{positive}} for <b>polonium,</b> though she is not seriously ill. The Ashdown Park hotel in Sussex has been evacuated as a precaution, possibly to do with Scaramella's previous visit there. According to the 6pm Channel 4 (9 December 2006) news the intake of <b>polonium</b> she suffered would only result in a dose of 100 mSv, leading to a 1 in 200 chance of cancer.|$|E
5|$|More {{efficient}} {{weapons would}} require less efficient initiators. This meant that less <b>polonium</b> would be required. At {{the time of}} Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of <b>polonium,</b> and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from <b>polonium</b> better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> has 33 known isotopes, all {{of which}} are radioactive. They have atomic masses that range from 188 to 220 u. 210Po (half-life 138.376days) is the most widely {{available}} and is made via neutron capture by natural bismuth. The longer-lived 209Po (half-life , longest-lived of all <b>polonium</b> isotopes) and 208Po (half-life 2.9years) can be made through the alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> is a {{radioactive}} element {{that exists in}} two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with an edge length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral. The structure of <b>polonium</b> has been characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polonium</b> {{is found}} in the food chain, {{especially}} in seafood.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{began in}} 1943 when Monsanto's Charles Allen Thomas was {{recruited}} by the Manhattan Project to coordinate the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at various sites. Scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory calculated that a plutonium bomb would require a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources used radioactive <b>polonium</b> and beryllium, so Thomas undertook to produce <b>polonium</b> at Monsanto's laboratories in Dayton.|$|E
5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for <b>polonium</b> {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than <b>polonium,</b> but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than <b>polonium</b> (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like <b>polonium</b> it should also form an α and a β allotrope. The electron of the hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like <b>polonium</b> and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate <b>polonium</b> and radium in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the {{chemical}} separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of <b>polonium</b> had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and <b>polonium</b> was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating <b>polonium,</b> which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and <b>polonium,</b> but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of <b>polonium</b> extraction and gave specific instructions for the type of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, <b>polonium</b> had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both <b>polonium</b> and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E
5|$|Detectives traced three {{distinct}} <b>polonium</b> trails {{in and out}} of London, at three different dates, which according to the investigation suggests Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun made two failed attempts to administer <b>polonium</b> to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in all places visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the poison to his tea, but he did not drink it.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Monsanto rented {{three floors}} of a {{warehouse}} at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially {{it was used}} to receive and store equipment used by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on the fifth floor where studies were carried out on the effects of <b>polonium</b> on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of <b>polonium</b> contamination of the samples.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} Dombey {{pointed out}} that Avangard delivers a metallic <b>polonium,</b> which must have been further processed into a solution as used in the Litvinenko assassination, involvement of an FSB poison laboratory was also likely.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of <b>polonium</b> as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to <b>polonium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 2014 {{television}} series Forever (episode 15), a king is assassinated with <b>polonium</b> and {{the assassination of}} Alexander Litvinenko specifically mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>polonium</b> was {{produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. <b>Polonium</b> and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen <b>polonium.</b> Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and <b>polonium),</b> and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the basic}} physics of <b>polonium</b> was {{classified}} until after the war. The {{fact that it was}} used as an initiator was classified until the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope <b>polonium.</b> Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat died of natural causes (without explaining which) and the agency had no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by <b>polonium</b> poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the <b>polonium</b> and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera {{published}} {{the results of}} a nine-month investigation, which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat’s death suggested in several rumors could be true. Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of <b>polonium</b> in quantities much higher than could occur naturally on Arafat's personal belongings. On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of <b>polonium</b> poisoning.|$|E
