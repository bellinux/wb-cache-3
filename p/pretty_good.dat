5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You just have to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E

5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> against the run, making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached from the press box.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pretty</b> <b>Good</b> Privacy (PGP) is an {{encryption}} program that provides cryptographic {{privacy and authentication}} for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.|$|E
25|$|You're {{sitting in}} the stands {{and you can see}} he's a big guy, but when I walked up to {{him for the first time}} face-to-face, I go, 'Wow, this is a big man.' He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> idea how to hit.|$|E
25|$|If {{one were}} to put {{a small number of}} {{specially}} cast blocks into the general inventory, chances are <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> that you’d never find them again, so Kaplan painted all the blocks in a bright orange so they could identify them on the transfer line. Kaplan drew on about 12 of these special castings during his development program and two were eventually (much later) sold to customers.|$|E

25|$|Jagannathan (Mohanlal), an Indian {{politician}} is <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> at {{solving problems}} using wit and unorthodox ideas. To {{get rid of}} him, fellow politician Francis Kunjappan (Mukesh) offers him a never-did-before task in the United States which could give him enough money to fulfill his dream of a sports academy. Jagannathan ends up being the chief political adviser for a struggling candidate John Kory (Sean James Sutton) in the California governor's election campaign and his use of tactics standard in Indian politics to win the election.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Cushing Graham, in a December 2008 interview, {{noted that}} her first trip with Frost {{was to the}} Muhammad Ali fight in Zaire, and that the two had been {{together}} {{for more than five}} years prior to when the film shows the two meeting. She remembered Frost as feeling that he did a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> job on every interview, whereas the film depicts him feeling he did a poor job with the first two interviews. She added that while the movie shows Frost driving, in fact they were always chauffeured because he was always making notes for the work he was doing.|$|E
25|$|Then in November 1995, {{while playing}} in the L.A. band Mad Reign, Starr {{was hit by a}} drunk driver, while driving Mad Reign's Rob Thrall's {{motorcycle}} down Sunset Strip. Starr suffered a severe head injury which left him in a coma. Dave Lizmi carried on with the band as the sole remaining original member, releasing Gettin' <b>Pretty</b> <b>Good...</b> at Barely Gettin' By in 1996 on the Magnetic Air label, and embarking on a tour with vocalist Ron Young, formerly of Little Caesar, replacing Starr. Though it was initially hoped that Starr would recover, he eventually died on June 18, 1999. Following Starr's death, the band broke up.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Independent, [...] "the record peaks with a {{cover of}} Siouxsie’s [...] "Hong Kong Garden" [...] which raises one eyebrow for {{existing}} {{and the other for}} actually being <b>pretty</b> damn <b>good,</b> leaving you looking like Paul McCartney by the end." ...|$|R

25|$|Morton: Oh, I'll sing {{you some}} scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> for an introduction of a song.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{there were}} several {{challenges}} to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's <b>Pretty</b> <b>Good</b> Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed. Daniel J. Bernstein, then {{a graduate student at}} UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|They were <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was}} a saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E
