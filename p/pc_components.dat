2500|$|The Macintosh was expensive, which {{hindered}} {{its ability}} to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, {{as well as the}} IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the Power Mac, in line with the PowerBook) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity <b>PC</b> <b>components</b> and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.|$|E
2500|$|Patil Systems, Inc., {{was founded}} in Salt Lake City in 1981 by Dr. Suhas Patil, in 1983 the company was reorganized by Dr. Patil, Kamran Elahian, and venture {{capitalist}} Fred Nazem, whose firm, [...] Nazem and Company provided the company's first/start-up round of financing. [...] Later the company was renamed as Cirrus Logic when it moved to Silicon Valley in 1984 to focus on solutions for the growing <b>PC</b> <b>components</b> market. Michael Hackworth was named {{president and chief executive}} officer in January 1985, and served as CEO until February 1999. It joined the Nasdaq market listing in 1989 (symbol: CRUS). Cirrus Logic acquired Crystal Semiconductor, a supplier of analog and mixed-signal converter ICs, in 1991. In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic became a supplier of PC graphics chips, audio converters and chips for magnetic storage products. David D. French joined Cirrus Logic, Inc., as president and chief operating officer in June 1998 and was named chief executive officer in February 1999. Soon after joining the company, through an acquisition strategy Mr. French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high-performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards, Mr. M. Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing, contributing further to its success. The company announced in April 2000 that it had completed moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas. In June 2005, Cirrus Logic sold its video products operation to an investment firm, creating privately owned Magnum Semiconductor. After French resigned in March 2007, Jason Rhode, formerly the vice president and general manager of Cirrus Logic's Mixed Signal Audio Division, was named president and CEO in May 2007. Today, Cirrus Logic is focused on its high-precision technologies for digital signal processing components for audio and energy markets. In 2014 Cirrus Logic bought Wolfson Microelectronics for £291 million.|$|E

40|$|Background: Practice {{improves}} {{human performance}} in many psychophysical paradigms. This kind of improvement {{is thought to}} be the evidence of human brain plasticity. However, the changes that occur in the brain are not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> has previously been associated with visuo-spatial attention. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether the N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> changed during long-term visual perceptual learning. Thirteen subjects completed several days of training in an orientation discrimination task, and were given a final test 30 days later. The results showed that behavioral thresholds significantly decreased across training sessions, and this decrement was also present in the untrained visual field. ERPs showed training significantly increased the N 2 pc amplitude, and this effect could be maintained for up to 30 days. However, the increase in N 2 pc was specific to the trained visual field. Conclusion/Significance: Training caused spatial attention to be increasingly focused on the target positions. However, this process was not transferrable from the trained to the untrained visual field, which suggests that the increase in N 2 pc ma...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} recent {{interest in the}} identification of neural correlates of the Attentional Blink (AB), and the development of neurally explicit computational models. A prominent example is the Simultaneous Type Serial Token (ST 2) model, which suggests that when the visual system detects a task-relevant item, a spatially specific Transient Attentional Enhancement (TAE), called the blaster, is triggered. This paper reports on our investigations into EEG activity during the AB, and a hypothesized correlation between the blaster and the N 2 <b>pc</b> ERP <b>component.</b> Specifically, we demonstrate that the temporal firing pattern of the blaster in the model matches the N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> in human ERP recordings, for targets that are seen and missed inside and outside the attentional blink window. Such a correlation between a computational account of the AB and ERP data provides useful insights into the processes underlying selectivity in temporal attention...|$|R

An ERP marker of spatially selective attention (N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component)</b> was delayed when either target or distractor colours were swapped across successive trials, demonstrating that intertrial feature priming systematically affects the onset of focal-attentional target processing. Results support the hypothesis that priming of pop-out effects are primarily generated at early perceptual/attentional stages of visual processing...|$|R
30|$|Another {{method in}} the CS family is {{principal}} component substitution (PCS) {{that relies on}} the principal component analysis (PCA) mathematical transformation. The PCA, {{also known as the}} Karhunen-Loéve transform or the Hotelling transform, is widely used in signal processing, statistics and many other areas. This transformation generates a new set of rotated axes, in which the new image spectral components are not correlated. The largest amount of the variance is mapped to the first component, with decreasing variance going to each of the following ones. The sum of the variances in all the components is equal to the total variance present in the original input images. PCA and the calculation of the transformation matrices can be performed following the steps specified in [20]. Theoretically, the first principal <b>component,</b> <b>PC</b> 1, collects the information that is common to all bands used as input data to the PCA, i.e., the spatial information, while the spectral information that is specific to each band is captured in the other principal components [42, 33]. This makes PCS an adequate technique when merging MS and PAN images. PCS is similar to the IHS method, with the main advantage that an arbitrary number of bands can be considered. However, some spatial information may not be mapped to the first component, depending on the degree of correlation and spectral contrast existing among the MS bands [33], resulting in the same problems that IHS had. To overcome this drawback, Shah et al.[53] proposed a new adaptive PCA-based pansharpening method that determines, using cross-correlation, the appropriate <b>PC</b> <b>component</b> to be substituted by the PAN image. By replacing this <b>PC</b> <b>component</b> by the high spatial resolution PAN component, adaptive PCA method will produce better results than traditional ones [53].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Salient visual {{singleton}} stimuli produce spatial cueing effects {{indicative of}} attentional capture {{only when they}} match current task sets, suggesting that capture is subject to top-down control. However, such task-set contingent capture effects could {{be associated with the}} top-down controlled disengagement of attention from non-matching stimuli that follows their initial bottom-up salience-driven selection. Using the N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> as an event-related potential marker of attentional capture, we demonstrate that top-down task set already controls the initial rapid selection of salient visual singleton stimuli prior to any subsequent attentional disengagement. These findings provide new evidence for the primacy of top-down control over bottom-up salience in attentional capture...|$|R
