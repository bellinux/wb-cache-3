5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

Jefferson included his written responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785). He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography. The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy, and wrote at length about slavery, miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> society because of justified resentments of the enslaved. He also wrote of his views on the American Indian and considered them as equals in body and mind to European settlers.|$|E

500|$|Detailed {{information}} on the executions in the Kalinin NKVD prison was provided during a hearing by Dmitry Tokarev, {{former head of the}} Board of the District NKVD in Kalinin. According to Tokarev, the shooting started in the evening and ended at dawn. The first transport, on 4 April 1940, carried 390 people, and the executioners had difficulty killing so many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> night. The following transports held no more than 250 people. The executions were usually performed with German-made [...]25 ACP Walther Model 2 pistols supplied by Moscow, but Soviet-made 7.62×38mmR Nagant M1895 revolvers were also used. The executioners used German weapons rather than the standard Soviet revolvers, as the latter were said to offer too much recoil, which made shooting painful after the first dozen executions. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD—and quite possibly the most prolific executioner in history—is reported to have personally shot and killed 7,000 of the condemned, some as young as 18, from the Ostashkov camp at Kalinin prison, over a period of 28 days in April 1940.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Al-Kateb centred {{on the fact that}} he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the Migration Act about refugees were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, [...] "SHDB" [...] (in matters concerning asylum seekers, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice Kirby said that [...] "there often is a very good reason... because people suffer great risks if their name goes on the Internet that that will become known to the country that they want to avoid," [...] to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, [...] "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{two years}} of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.

Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted [...] "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!"
