50|$|The {{developmental}} {{trends of}} interface relay technology suggest {{the use of}} opto-isolator as the prevailing design principle of interface relays. An opto-isolator can be implemented {{in terms of an}} LED and a phototransistor (or <b>photothyristor</b> or a photodiode) or a lamp and a photoresistor. An example of an opto-electronic interface relay is shown in the figure. The transparent high voltage insulating barrier provides galvanic isolation of the circuits under the difference of potentials up to 5-7 kV. For higher voltages, they use an optical fiber, the length of which (depending on the voltage level) can take from dozens of centimeters to several meters.|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} interconnection density, bandwidth, nonlocality and fan-out-fan-in {{offered by}} optics over conventional electronic technologies {{make it a}} very attractive medium {{for a variety of}} application particularity in the field of communication system implementation for all types of computing engines is achieved. This is especially true for neural networks in which the demand for communication resources is extremely high. In this study, the implementation of a neural network that exploits an optical interconnect to perform a real task is described. A pnpn semiconductor device has been connected in parallel with a common load resistance for optical switching. When illuminated, only this device with maximum input will turn on. The voltages across the other devices drop and inhibit their switching ability. With suitable biasing, the winning device can be recall at any time. The result shows, a much faster response (< 10 ns) can be obtained from thyristors made of III-V compound semiconductors, because their carrier lifetime is considerably shorter than in silicon. With III-V <b>photothyristor,</b> it is possible to combine light emission (even lasing) and <b>photothyristor</b> action in the same unit...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of optoelectronic switches based on high-voltage silicon photodiodes, phototransistors or <b>photothyristors</b> and triggered-on by picosecond laser pulses {{has been studied}} for the first time. For given values of resistive load, amplitude and duration $t_R$ of voltage pulses it is shown that there exist optimal sets of values for the device area, energy and absorption coefficient for triggering illumination, which provide the maximal general {{efficiency of}} the switch about 0. 92. All three types of switches have almost identical efficiencies at short $t_R$, and in case of long $t_R$ <b>photothyristors</b> possess a noticeable advantage among them.

2500|$|<b>Photothyristors</b> are {{activated}} by light. The advantage of <b>photothyristors</b> is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. [...] Since no electronic boards need to be provided at {{the potential of the}} thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. [...] Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; [...] they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.|$|R
2500|$|Two common <b>photothyristors</b> {{include the}} light-activated SCR (LASCR) and the light-activated TRIAC. A LASCR {{acts as a}} switch that turns on when exposed to light. Following light exposure, when light is absent, if the power is not removed and the {{polarities}} of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed, the LASCR {{is still in the}} [...] "on" [...] state. A light-activated TRIAC resembles a LASCR, except that it is designed for alternating currents.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of switching process of high-voltage silicon photodiodes, phototransistors and <b>photothyristors</b> those triggered-on homogeneously {{over the area}} by picosecond laser pulses, has been performed for the first time. The analysis of results allowed to obtain "empirical" relationship between key parameters of switches (energy of control pulses, a radiation absorption coefficient, the area of structures) and parameters those characterizing the switching process in a circuit with the resistive load. For some of these relationship the approximate analytical formulas which seem to be quite adequate to the simulation results has been deduced. It is noted that distinctions between switching processes in structures of the three different types become apparent only at long duration of voltage pulses at a final stage when the blocking capability of photodiodes and phototransistors is recovered.
