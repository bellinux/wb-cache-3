In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E

25|$|The cost {{of heavy}} nectar also impacts the {{currency}} used by the bees. Unlike the starlings in the previous example, bees maximize energy efficiency (energy gained per energy spent) rather than net rate of energy gain (net energy gained <b>per</b> <b>time).</b> This is because the optimal load predicted by maximizing net rate of energy gain is too heavy for the bees and shortens their lifespan, decreasing their overall productivity for the hive, as explained earlier. By maximizing energy efficiency, the bees are able to avoid expending too much energy per trip {{and are able to}} live long enough to maximize their lifetime productivity for their hive. In a different paper, Schmid-Hempel showed that the observed relationship between load size and flight time is well correlated with the predictions based on maximizing energy efficiency, but very poorly correlated with the predictions based on maximizing net rate of energy gain.|$|E

25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids <b>per</b> <b>time</b> per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|One common {{approach}} to analysing fMRI data {{is to consider}} each voxel separately {{within the framework of}} the general linear model. The model assumes, at every time point, that the HDR is equal to the scaled and summed version of the events active at that point. A researcher creates a design matrix specifying which events are active at any timepoint. One common way is to create a matrix with one column per overlapping event, and one row <b>per</b> <b>time</b> point, and to mark it if a particular event, say a stimulus, is active at that time point. One then assumes a specific shape for the HDR, leaving only its amplitude changeable in active voxels. The design matrix and this shape are used to generate a prediction of the exact HDR response of the voxel at every timepoint, using the mathematical procedure of convolution. This prediction does not include the scaling required for every event before summing them.|$|E
25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain <b>per</b> <b>time</b> spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and wind erosion, that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without numerical model. Such a technique requires that down slope debris instability is a timedependent function of slope angle, in units of volume <b>per</b> <b>time</b> per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we can conclude that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E
500|$|For {{decades after}} Libby {{performed}} the first radiocarbon dating experiments, {{the only way}} to measure the [...] in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms.

AMS counts the / ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and / ratio can be converted into each other exactly. For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but as of 2014 AMS is more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements. [...] In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting; and it is much faster– an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.|$|E
