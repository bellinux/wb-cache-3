500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to <b>put</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|This already {{applied at}} the top: the {{constitution}} contained an age-requirement {{for the members}} of the Uitvoerend Bewind, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented [...] "young Turks" [...] that were appointed Agents, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel. The tenor of the Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: Amstel (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), Texel (the northern peninsula) and Delf (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel, and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often <b>put</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain [...] "national unity" [...] through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes, {{got in the way of}} the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.|$|E

Recalling the Brasilia declaration, the ministers agreed upon the sharing of expertise in diverse areas such as food security, health, education, human rights etc. The Ministers also endorsed a proposal by Brazil to host a seminar on [...] "Economic Growth with Social Equity" [...] with the aim to promote better knowledge among IBSA members of their national policies and strategies to promote economic and social development.|$|E

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and I've got to <b>put</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} looking through the Report of your classes, and two things have rather struck me, which I will mention. One {{of them is the}} very large {{attendance}} in the French classes. This appears a singularly satisfactory thing, because you could scarcely do a hard-working man of whatever class a greater service than to give him easy access to French literature. Montesquieu used to say that he had never known a pain or a distress which he could not soothe by half an hour of a good book; and perhaps it is no more of an exaggeration to say that a man who can read French with comfort need never have a dull hour. Our own literature has assuredly many a kingly name. In boundless riches and infinite imaginative variety, there is no rival to Shakespeare in the world; in energy and height and majesty Milton and Burke have no masters. But besides its great men of this loftier sort, France has a long list of authors who have produced a literature whose chief mark is its agreeableness. As has been so often said, the genius of the French language is its clearness, firmness, and order; to this clearness certain circumstances in the history of French society have added the delightful qualities of liveliness in union with urbanity. Now {{as one of the most}} important parts of popular education is to <b>put</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the way of amusing and refreshing themselves in a rational rather than an irrational manner, it is a great gain to have given them the key to the most amusing and refreshing set of books in the world.|$|E
