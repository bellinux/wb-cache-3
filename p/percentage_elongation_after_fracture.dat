The machinability was evaluated from measurements of drilling torque and drilling thrust force in cutting tool and surface roughness of the machined surface during drilling process. Samples of 6351 aluminum alloy were produced with different levels of copper (Cu) (0. 07, 0. 23, 0. 94, 1. 43 and 1. 93 %). Cutting speed and feed rate were varied in five levels (60 to 100 m/min and 0. 1 to 0. 3 mm/rev). The results showed that increasing the copper content in a Al-Si-Mg-Cu aluminum alloy increase the precipitation hardening through the stabilization of hardening phases like Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 and Al 2 Cu, also the increase in amount of Al 2 Cu. Thus, the samples of 6351 aluminum alloy with higher copper content, in general, showed higher hardness and ultimate tensile strength values, while the <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> was lower.

Based on the similarity between Mg 2 Si and Si phases in crystalline structure and crystallization process, {{the present study investigated}} the effects of different concentrations of Bi on the microstructure, tensile properties, and fracture behavior of cast Al- 15 wt. %Mg 2 Si in-situ metal matrix composite. The results show that the addition of the proper amount of Bi has a significant modification effect on both primary and eutectic Mg 2 Si in the Al- 15 wt. %Mg 2 Si composite. With an increase in Bi content from 0 to 1 wt. %, the morphology of the primary Mg 2 Si is changed from irregular or dendritic to polyhedral shape; and its average particle size is significantly decreased from 70 to 6 μm. Moreover, the morphology of the eutectic Mg 2 Si phase is altered from flake-like to very short fibrous or dot-like. When the Bi addition exceeds 4. 0 wt. %, the primary Mg 2 Si becomes coarse again. However, the eutectic Mg 2 Si still exhibits the modified morphology. Tensile tests reveal that the Bi addition can improve the tensile strength and ductility of the material.

Metallographic techniques were used to quantify the microporosity and evaluate its distribution; the effect of the shrinkage microporosity on the sand cast material was measured through tensile tests on miniaturised specimens extracted along the longitudinal direction of the plate. Image analyses allowed estimation of the threshold Niyama value for microporosity in the investigated material. An analogous threshold for the Niyama parameter was determined from the mechanical data arising from tensile tests in which specific microporosity levels (and Niyama values) were identified that corresponded to minimum required levels of yield stress, UTS and <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> as specified by the ASTM standard.

40|$|Abstract. Steels with carbide free {{bainitic}} (CFB) microstructures show excellent strength, toughness {{and wear}} resistance. Cast or wrought products produced by conventional metallurgy have become introduced in manufacturing of machine components. The required silicon addition {{of more than}} 1. 5 wt % in CFB-steels limits the possibilities to produce components by P/M methods. The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibilites to produce CFB-steels by pressing and sintering. Four different powder mixtures based on Distaloy DC powder have been pressed to a relative density of 90 % and sintered in a N 2 -H 2 atmosphere at 1150 oC. The sintered components were austenitized followed by austempering above the martensite start temperature. Tensile and impact testing together with microhardness measurements have been performed. The microstructures were studied by optical microscopy as well as SEM and XRD-methods. The tensile strength values achieved varied from 313 to 737 MPa, the <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> were between 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. The impact toughness values varied between 4 and 11 J. The hardness of the bainite after short sintering time varied between 630 and 710 HV and the hardness of the CFB was 350 HV after short sintering time but reached 573 after prolonged sintering. The microstructure consisted mainly of bainite, small amount of CFB mixed with austenite but also of ferrite and retained austenite after short sintering time. A longer sintering time created a structure consisting of mainly CFB with bainite and {{a small amount of}} ferrite. The most interesting applications for P/M produced CFB-containing steels should be components subjected to sliding or rolling-sliding wear loads, as gears. The hardness and strength values achieved in the present work indicate that P/M produced CFB-steels can prove superior to conventional P/M steels in many applications...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{steel grades}} with yield {{strength}} higher than 420 MPa are considered as high strength steels. They undoubtedly have lower ductility than mild steels {{in terms of}} engineering measures of ductility, such as ultimate-to-yield strength ratio, uniform strain and elongation at fracture. A typical values for high strength steels are: ultimate-to-yield strength ratio fu/fy = 1, 05, uniform strain εu = 0, 05 and <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> εfr = 15 %. The problem is that inelastic behaviour is hidden in numerous nominally elastic resistances checks of steel structures and therefore sufficient local ductility has to be assured. The focus is set on structural elements with holes subjected to tension and to tension splices with bolts in shear. Local ductility in terms of plastic deformations has to be sufficient in order to assure bolthole elongation, so the loading transfers through all bolts. An extensive experimental research of plates with holes and tension splices made of steel grade S 690 was conducted to determine maximum resistance and ductility. The reliability of the Eurocode design rules for net cross- section resistance to was statistically evaluated. The statistical analysis was substantiated by additional test results on net cross-section failure of high strength steel members available in literature. Moreover, the experiments were numerically simulated to look inside the stress state. The test results served as a guideline for the accuracy of numerical simulations. A comprehensive numerical parametrical study of tension splices and in addition, the numerical analyses of tests on tension splices found in literature were performed. The Eurocode design bearing resistance was critically assessed {{on the basis of}} the database of 266 connection results. In certain cases the Eurocode design bearing resistance formula gives inadequate results. Therefore, a new, simple design bearing resistance formula was proposed...|$|R

The cold-rolled copper samples, at different degrees of deformation, were annealed and their mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength, impact, hardness, percentage reduction in area, and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> were observed <b>after</b> cold working and annealing. The results obtained showed that the hardness of copper during cold rolling increases with the degree of deformation due to strain hardening. The maximum value of hardness obtained from cold-rolled copper was 117 HB at 40 % reduction in area, while the average hardness values obtained after annealing temperatures of 300 ºC, 400 ºC and 500 ºC were 79. 2, 67. 2 and 45. 7 HB, respectively. During tensile test, the material fractured with very little elongation at 35 % reduction in area. The maximum ultimate tensile stress obtained was 188. 4 N/mm 2 at 20 % reduction in area. Anneal strengthening effect was observed in the copper. The amount of strengthening effect increases with increasing degree of prior cold work.

40|$|The use of {{radiation}} as a sterilization process is increasing. The well-developed {{technology of the}} radiation sterilization as applied to medical devices has assured the food industry that the process is reliable. Due to the food industry 2 ̆ 7 s possibility of widespread use, it is especially crucial that an appropriate packaging material be chosen so that its integrity is maintained after irradiation. This is because the commercial food packaging process carries products through more rigorous paths and channels than medical supplies. Many polymers used in the medical field show various degrees of degradation after radiation exposure, which can be determined either by visual or physical measurement. This paper studies the mechanical properties of polymeric films after irradiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads {{and the extent to}} which this process causes film degradation. In this study, two mechanical properties will be measured: tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break. Eight polymeric films commonly used in the food packaging industry are selected as the material samples. These materials will be irradiated with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads to determine cause-effect and dose related effect. Data collected for tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break for each sample of one type of film before and after irradiation is analyzed and compared with data collected for other samples. Two primary purposes in undertaking this analysis are (1) to determine if the type of film significantly changes or degrades after irradiation, and (2) to study the relationship between the changes in mechanical properties of each film and the radiation doses of 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis at 0. 05 level of significance, polyethylene film (TD-transverse direction) is the only film which did not significantly change in either tensile strength or <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break. The polyester/polyethylene film (MD-machine direction) significantly changed in <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break although not in tensile strength. The rest of the film samples -PP, OPP, PETG, Polyester/PE(TD), polyester-MYLAR, PE(MD), PE/Nylon and PS film- exhibited significant changes in both mechanical properties after irradiation with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis of the degree of relationship between mechanical properties of each film and radiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads [0. 0 (non-irradiated), 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, andlO. O Mrads] found in this study can be catagorized into three types: the dose-dependent, the dose-independent, and the weak correlation. Among three film samples which exhibited the 2 ̆ 2 dose-dependent 2 ̆ 2 relationship, only oriented polypropylene(OPP) film was found to have the correlation between mechanical properties (both tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break) and radiation doses; both mechanical properties decreased as the dose increased. Polypropylene (PP) was determined to exhibit the same correlation but only between tensile strength and radiation dose. For polyethylene (machine direction only), this correlation was found only for <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break and radiation dose. The rest of the film samples were found to have no correlation between either mechanical property and radiation doses such as that indicated above. They are either 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 or exhibit a weak relationship between the two variables. For example, the polyester-MYLAR film exhibited obvious 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 characteristics since both mechanical properties increased significantly from 0. 0 to 5. 0 Mrads and then decreased at 7. 0 Mrads. The films which obviously showed a very weak relationship between the mechanical properties and the radiation doses are two films which exhibited no change in mechanical properties after irradiation in the first study [PE(TD-tensile 2 ̆ 6 <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> and polyester/PE (MD- <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> ]. The films which exhibited a somewhat weak relationship between the two variables are PS (MD 2 ̆ 6 TD- tensile 2 ̆ 6 <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> and PE (MD-tensile). These last two films also showed a very small change in the mechanical properties after irradiation although not as small as the films irradiated in the first study...|$|R

Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to measure the weight loss of the above mentioned blend systems at a heating rate 10 oCmin- 1 in nitrogen atmosphere. It is evident that formaldehyde is acting as a cross linker for Chitosan-PVA blend which have high thermal degradation or high thermal stability when compared with Chitosan-PVA-glycerol and Chitosan-PVA blends. The presence of cross linking agents like formaldehyde decreases the solubility to certain extent, and also increases the thermal stability due to the presence of aldehyde (-CHO-) group in the formaldehyde, forming cross links with amine(-NH 2 -) group present in the Chitosan.

The maximum load and breaking load were found to be highest for weld formed between rotating flat and stationary tapered at 500 RPM and the values were 19. 219 kN and 14. 28 kN respectively.

40|$|The chief {{objection}} {{to the use of}} dental porcelain as a restorative material is its low tensile and shear strengths. Fortunately, the esthetic qualities of ceramic materials can be combined with the strength and toughness of metals to produce restorations that have both natural tooth like appearance and very good mechanical properties. Since ceramic alloys are subjected to heat treatment during porcelain application, mechanical tests of such alloys should be performed with heat treatment as an experimental variable. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the effect of simulated porcelain firing cycles on the ultimate tensile strength, ductility and estimated toughness of a Ni-Cr and a Co-Cr ceramic alloys. The microstructural changes of each alloy as a consequence to the heat treatment were also studied. Thirty tensile specimens of each alloy were cast. The specimens were divided into six groups having five specimens in each. Group 1 (Control) : the specimens were kept in the as-cast condition. In groups II-VI, a standard heat treatment simulating porcelain firing was performed. Group II was subjected to four firing cycles representing preoxidation, opaque application, body application and glaze. Groups III-VI were subjected to 5, 6, 7 and 8 firing cycles where the extra cycles represented porcelain body corrections. Tensile testing was carried out on a universal testing machine and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> were calculated. The toughness values were estimated by multiplying the <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> by their corresponding UTS values. Photomicrographs of the microstructure were obtained after etching of the specimens of each alloy utilizing its specific metallurgic etchant. The results showed that heat treatment simulating porcelain firing was not a significant variable for both the UTS of the investigated Ni-Cr alloy, and the <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> of the investigated Co-Cr alloy. On the contrary the estimated toughness values were markedly reduced following heat treatment simulating porcelain firing. The microstructure of the heat-treated groups showed more massive and continuous carbides. Some fine carbides were also observed inside the grainsEgyptian Dental Associatio...|$|R

This was done by exposing the entire specimen to the corrosives (NaCl) at concentrations of 0. 3 M, 0. 5 M, 0. 7 M, and 1 M. After every seven days one specimen from each of these corrosives was removed and loaded on a tensometer until fracture. <b>Percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> and <b>percentage</b> reduction in cross sectional area were used to investigate the SCC behavior of the steel. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fracture {{healing is}} orchestrated by a {{specific}} set of events that culminates in the repair of bone and reachievement of its biomechanical properties. The aim of our work was to study the sequence of gene expression events involved in inflammation and bone remodeling occurring in the early phases of callus formation in osteoporotic patients. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fifty-six patients submitted to hip replacement surgery after a low-energy hip fracture were enrolled in this study. The patients were grouped according to the time interval between fracture and surgery: bone collected within 3 days <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> (n = 13); between the 4 th and 7 th day (n = 33); and after one week from the fracture (n = 10). Inflammation- and bone metabolism-related genes were assessed at the fracture site. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in the first days <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> The genes responsible for bone formation and resorption were upregulated one week <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> The increase in RANKL expression occurred just before that, between the 4 th– 7 th days <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> Sclerostin expression diminished during the first days <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> Conclusions: The expression of inflammation-related genes, especially IL- 6, is highest at the very first days <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> but from day 4 onwards there is a shift towards bone remodeling genes, suggesting that the inflammatory phase triggers bon...|$|R
