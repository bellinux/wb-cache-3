25|$|Numbers '09 {{includes}} {{a system for}} categorizing data similar to pivot tables. Pivots were introduced in Improv and were manipulated by dragging the category headers, allowing the user to quickly rotate rows into columns or vice versa. Although Numbers has similar draggable objects representing formulas, they are not used for this feature and the direct manipulation is missing. Instead, Numbers places pop-up menus in the column headers allowing the user to collapse multiple rows into totals (sums, averages, etc.) based on data that is common across rows. This is similar functionality to a <b>pivot</b> <b>table,</b> but lacks the ease of re-arrangement of the Improv model and other advanced features.|$|E

[...] In addition to its inherent utility as a stand-alone desktop application, Excel overlaps and complements the functionality of DBMS in several ways: storing and arraying data in rows and columns; performing certain basic tasks such as <b>pivot</b> <b>table</b> and aggregating values; and facilitating sharing, importing and exporting of database data. [...] Excel’s chief limitation relative to a true database is capacity; Excel 2003 is limited to some 65k rows and 256 columns; Excel 2007 extends this capacity to roughly 1million rows and 16k columns. [...] By comparison, SQL Server is able to manage over 500k terabytes of memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The query for triple {{information}} on product– attribute (property) –value {{is one of}} the most frequent queries in e-commerce. In storing the triple (product–attribute– value) information, a vertical schema is effective for avoiding sparse data and schema evolution, while a conventional horizontal schema often shows better query performance, since the properties are queried as groups clustered by each product. Therefore, we propose two storage schemas: a vertical schema as a primary table structure for the triple information in RDBMS and a <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index created from the basic vertical table as an additional index structure for accelerating query processing. The <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index is beneficial to improving the performance of the frequent pattern query on the group properties associated with each product class.

40|$|The <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} metric access method optimized for a number of distance computations in similarity search. In this work the new modification of the <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> method was proposed that is besides distance computations optimized also for a number of I/O operations. Proposed Clustered <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> method is indexing clusters of similar objects that were created by another metric access method - the M-tree. The indexing of clustered objects has a positive effect for searching within indexed database. Whereas the clusters are paged in second memory, page containing such cluster, which do not satisfy particular query, is not accessed in second memory at all. Non-relevant objects, that are out of the query range, are not loaded into memory, what has the effect of decreasing number of I/O operations and total volume of transferred data. The correctness of proposed approach was experimentally proved and experimental results of proposed method was compared to selected metric access methods...|$|R
