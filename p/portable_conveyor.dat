5000|$|The {{intermodal}} {{facility has}} approximately 160000 sq ft of storage space, a loading system consisting of three 25-ton cranes, one 100-ton crane, eight front-end loaders, <b>portable</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems, and a truck scale. [...] Products shipped through the terminal include fertilizer, grain, corn, meal, bark, rock clinker, salt, rolled and coiled steel, H-beams, plate steel, rebar and petroleum coke. The terminal {{is served by}} the Union Pacific Railroad, with extensive rail track at the facility for loading and unloading containers.|$|E
50|$|A seventh kiln {{was erected}} {{at the western}} end of the south battery in the 1940s, which was used to dry chalk with the eighth kiln being added at the {{opposite}} end in 1958. By the end of the 1950s, the north battery had been demolished and only the eastern end wall now remains. Following the demolition of the north battery, the overhead crane was also dismantled and the south battery was enlarged and converted to draw kilns. Following the dismantling of the crane, the kilns were loaded using a dragline excavator placed on the higher ground to the south and unloaded by a <b>portable</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt pushed into the draw holes.|$|E
50|$|As far as {{growth is}} {{concerned}} the material handling and conveyor system makers are getting utmost exposure in the industries like automotive, pharmaceutical, packaging and different production plants. The <b>portable</b> <b>conveyors</b> are likewise growing {{fast in the}} construction sector and by the year 2014 the purchase rate for conveyor systems in North America, Europe and Asia is likely to grow even further. The most commonly purchased types of conveyors are Line shaft roller conveyor, chain conveyors and conveyor belts at packaging factories and industrial plants where usually product finishing and monitoring are carried. Commercial and civil sectors are increasingly implementing conveyors at airports, shopping malls, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to design <b>portable</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> for aggregate of given parameters. The introduction contains classification of conveying machines and devices. Further chapters {{are dealing with the}} actual design of the conveyor, functional description of individual parts, selection of components, and functional calculation according to ISO 5048 standard. The final chapter specifies maximum weight delivery and overall review of the machine. The work is suplemented by mechanical drawings...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the construction design of the <b>portable</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> for aggregate and crushed rubble. The thesis contains the description of basic parts of the belt conveyor and their choice. It also contains a functional calculation according to the valid norm ČSN ISO 5048, the determination of main dimensions of the belt conveyor, {{the design of the}} drive and the strength calculation of the tension device. The required technical drawings are attached to the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} design of <b>portable</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> according to specified parameters.

The next part of thesis deals with functional calculation, which is solved according to ČSN ISO 5040 and other specified sources. In the end of bachelor thesis is contained proposal of implemented tensioning device. Technical drawing of conveyor is also attached to the bachelor thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Portable Modular Conveyor-Material Placer (PMC) is a quick, easy, {{dependable}} {{and cost}} {{effective way to}} place materials in {{the limits of the}} confined grade or work area. This specialized piece of equipment was developed to place concrete in front of a concrete slip form-paving machine. The typical method of placing concrete requires a self-propelled belt placer, which is very expensive to purchase and mobilize to the jobsite. The PMC creates a significant cost savings in labor and equipment with the PMC. It is a direct replacement for conventional material placing equipment, including all in grade belt placing machines. As well as placing concrete, it is capable of placing asphalt, aggregate, sand, topsoil, or any flow-able materials. The <b>Portable</b> Modular <b>Conveyor</b> was conceived in the summer of 2007 to minimize mobilization expense, increase portability, and enhanced productivity. It is a unique solution to material placement, and has a patent award (Patent Number: 6034 - 01001) from the United States Patent Office. It was first used on the reconstruction of Carpenter Road in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the fall of 2007. In August of 2008 the second Prototype was used on an I- 75 reconstruction project near Saginaw, Michigan, on a concrete overlay project at the Cobb County Airport in Kennesaw, Georgia, at Detroit Metropolitan Airport North Terminal Project and various other paving projects in Michigan...|$|R
