40|$|The {{concept of}} {{integrating}} metrology systems into production processes has generated significant interest in industry {{due to its}} potential in reducing production time and defective parts. One {{of the most interesting}} methods of integrating metrology into production is the usage of external metrology systems to compensate machine tools and robots in real time. Continuing the work described in our previous paper of a prototype laser tracker-assisted 3 -axis positioning system (Wang and Maropoulos Int J Adv Manuf Technol 69 (1 - 4) : 919 - 933, 2013), this paper describes experimental results of the dynamic <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> tests of the machine under real-time laser tracker compensation. Experiments show that the real-time corrections of the machine tool’s absolute volumetric error have significantly increased the dynamic <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the machine. This result is also validated by a ballbar acting as an independent measurement instrument, reducing the 95 th percentile error from 60  μm to less than 10  μm, without any prior calibration or error mapping, showing that the proposed methods are feasible and can have very wide applications...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the study of}} the accuracy of an industrial robot KR 5 arc HW, used to perform quality inspections of components with complex shapes. Metrology techniques such as laser tracking and large volume photogrammetry were deployed to quantify both pose and dynamic <b>path</b> <b>accuracies</b> of the robot in accordance with ISO 9283 : 1998. The overall positioning pose inaccuracy of the robot is found to be almost 1 mm and path inaccuracy at 100 % of the robot rated velocity is 4. 5 mm. The maximum pose orientation inaccuracy is found to be 14 degrees and the maximum path orientation inaccuracy is 5 degrees. Despite of the significant maximum inaccuracies, uncertainty of a robotic scanning application is estimated to be 0. 5 mm. Local positional errors manifest pronounced dependence on the position of the robot end effector in the working envelope. The uncertainties of the measurements are discussed and deemed to be caused by the tool center point calibration, the reference coordinate system transformation and the low accuracy of the photogrammetry system...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} {{work of the}} authors, trajectory generation for immediate path-accurate stopping is presented. It turns out that, with some extensions, this method is also applicable to generic trajectory generation, especially for computing a velocity profile for online modifications of the desired path, e. g. due to unexpected sensor data. The method computes a trajectory that satisfies constraints on the velocity, the acceleration, and the jerk, while staying {{as close as possible}} to the sensed desired path. A feasible solution is always found, even if exact <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> is not reachable. In contrast to time-optimal execution of the desired path, in this presentation the goal is to synchronize with the original robot program. So, e. g. after the execution of a sensed deviation the robot continues the original trajectory, maybe shifted by a sensed offset. The new trajectory is computed by iterative forward scaling and backtracking, where in contrast to other {{previous work}} the arc length is interpolated (ALI). In this way the <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> is superior to that with direct pose interpolation (DPI), which may feature undesired blending of subsequent path segments. Because of its time-efficiency the algorithm can be applied in each sampling step, e. g. every 4 ms for a standard KUKA robot with RSI interface...|$|E

40|$|Radiated {{electromagnetic}} fields from a PCB {{can be estimated}} when the source current distribution is known. From a measured near-field distribution, the PCB source current distribution can be found. Accuracy depends on the measurement method and its limitations, the radiation model and {{the choice of the}} observation area. Many known methods are based on optimization algorithms for inverse problems that vary a set of elementary radiation sources and create a radiation model. However, apart from the time-consuming optimization process, such methods find one possible solution for a near-field distribution. As this distribution might not reflect the real current distribution, accuracy outside of near-field scan area can be low. Furthermore numerical problems can often be observed. Solving the given inverse problem with a system of linear equations and complex near-field data it can be very sensitive to noise. Regularization methods and an adjusted preconditioning can increase the accuracy. In this paper, an improved radiation model creation approach based on complex near-field data is presented. This approach is based on regularization methods and extended by current estimations from near-field data. Preconditioning is done considering some physical properties of the PCB and its possible current <b>paths.</b> <b>Accuracy</b> and stability of the method are investigated in the presence of noisy data...|$|R

40|$|The Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{process has}} been under {{constant}} developmentsince its invention, more than 20 years ago. Whereas most industrial applicationsuse a gantry machine to weld linear joints, there are applications which consistof complex three-dimensional joints, requiring more degrees of freedom fromthe machines. The use of industrial robots allows FSW of materials alongcomplex joint lines. There is however one major drawback when using robotsfor FSW: the robot compliance. This results in vibrations and insufficient pathaccuracy. For FSW, <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> is important as it can cause the welding toolto miss the joint line and thereby cause welding defects. The {{first part of this}} research is focused on understanding how welding forcesaffect the FSW robot accuracy. This was first studied by measuring pathdeviation post-welded and later by using a computer vision system and laserdistance sensor to measure deviations online. Based on that knowledge, a robotdeflection model has been developed. The model is able to estimate thedeviation of the tool from the programmed path during welding, based on thelocation and measured tool forces. This model can be used for online pathcompensation, improving <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> and reducing welding defects. A second challenge related to robotic FSW on complex geometries is thevariable heat dissipation in the workpiece, causing great variations in the weldingtemperature. Especially for force-controlled robots, this can lead to severewelding defects, fixture- and machine damage when the material overheats. First, a new temperature method was developed which measures thetemperature at the interface of the tool and the workpiece, based on the thermoelectriceffect. The temperature information is used as input to a closed-looptemperature controller. This modifies primarily the rotational speed of the tooland secondarily the axial force. The controller is able to maintain a stablewelding temperature and thereby improve the weld quality and allow joining ofgeometries which were impossible to weld without temperature control. Implementation of the deflection model and temperature controller are twoimportant additions to a FSW system, improving the process robustness,reducing the risk of welding defects and allowing FSW of parts with highlyvarying heat dissipation...|$|E

40|$|The paper extends a {{previously}} proposed method {{for improving the}} <b>path</b> <b>accuracy</b> of robots. Especially during high speed movements nonlinear couplings between the joints deteriorate and degrade the robot's accuracy. Such couplings cannot be compensated by linear feedforward control.

Linear controllers and multilayer perceptrons are combined after training to improve the execution of sensor planned paths which are not explicitely trained before. The method is verified in experiments using a high speed path which originally is sensed by a compliant force- / torque sensor. 1 Introduction For most industrial robots the accuracy achievable with the standard control system does not exceed some millimeters for off-line programmed paths.
