40|$|Designing a {{standardised}} {{sampling method}} for invertebrate monitoring: a pilot experiment in a motorway retention pond The {{implementation of the}} European Water Framework Directive revealed the necessity to develop new tools designed for freshwater ecosystems monitoring. As a new assessment approach employing invertebrate monitoring, three articial substra-tes (two benthic and one <b>pelagic)</b> were <b>tested</b> for 7, 14, 21 and 35 days of exposure in a motorway retention pond located in Southern France. Two of these articial substrates appeared to sample too narrow a range of taxa, which was conrmed by two-way ANOVA tests and diversity and evenness indices. Samples taken by the remaining articial substrate, composed of six plastic plant stems xed on a 15 × 15 cm square tile, were representative of the species assemblage found in the stormwa-ter retention ponds. The use of an articial substrate as a standardised method for long term invertebrate monitoring in ponds holds much potential.

40|$|Export of <b>pelagic</b> {{carbonate}} <b>tests</b> from {{surface waters}} and their deposition at the seafloor plays {{a significant role}} in the CO 2 cycle and ability of the oceans to absorb atmospheric CO 2. Sediment 230 Th and 3 He measurements have been interpreted as evidence that significant lateral advection of pelagic material occurs in the water column, leading to marked spatial variations in deposition rates and, in particular, to significant focusing of deposits on the Pacific equator. We report spatially continuous stratigraphy from two 1000 km seismic lines that show evidence of depositional anomalies near the equator. Accumulation rates were apparently enhanced locally by a factor of two, similar to the proposed modern sediment-focusing factors, but the anomalies are surprisingly patchy over the 20 m. y. period analyzed—they are not confined to an equatorial region, and they are not necessarily found on adjacent seismic profiles. These intermediate-scale anomalies are 3 ̆e∼ 100 km across and represent areas of seafloor that received more deposits for one period, less in following periods, and vice versa. Variogram analysis was used to determine how the spatial scales of deposition changed over the Neogene. The period when the spatial scale of depositional variability was largest correlates with hiatuses in drill cores, a correlation that we interpret as caused by enhanced and spatially heterogeneous carbonate dissolution at that time. The study suggests that seismic stratigraphy has the potential to reveal spatial patterns related to unsteady bottom-water flow and chemistry...|$|R

The predicted, concentration range in the estuaries around the North Sea, (0. 9 - 9 pg LAS l - 1) was validated by monitoring data (1 - 9 µg LAS l - 1). In offshore sites of the North Sea, it is estimated - and experimentally verified for a few sites that the LAS concentration is below analytical detection limit (i. e., 0. 5 µg LAS l - 1). The effects of LAS on marine organisms have been reviewed. For short-term acute tests, {{there was no significant}} difference (p = 0. 83) between the mean LC 50 values of freshwater and marine organisms (mainly <b>pelagic</b> species <b>tested,</b> 4. 1 and 4. 3 mg LAS l - 1, respectively). For longer-term chronic tests, it appeared that the sensitivity (mean no-observed effect concentration (NOEC value) of marine and freshwater organisms (0. 3 and 2. 3 mg LAS l - 1, respectively) was significantly different (p t-test = 0. 007). The predicted no-effect-concentrations (PNEC) were 360 and 31 µg LAS l - 1, for freshwater and marine pelagic communities, respectively. Given that the maximum expected estuarine and marine concentrations are 3 to > 30 times lower than the PNEC, the risk of LAS to pelagic organisms in these environments is judged to be low...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Although {{the study}} of lakes has {{traditionally}} focused on pelagic production pathways, recent stable isotope and diet evidence indicates that benthic algal production is an important contributor to fish production. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that energy may be more efficiently passed along benthic food chains relative to their <b>pelagic</b> counter-parts. To <b>test</b> this idea, we combined stable isotope based assessments of energy flow pathways with estimates of pe-lagic- and benthic-based primary and secondary production in Castle Lake, California. Approximately 50 % of whole-lake primary production and 30 % of whole-lake secondary production occurred in benthic habitats. Stable carbon iso-topes and dietary data indicated that fish were predominantly supported by benthic (63 %) and terrestrial (24 %) second-ary production. Ecological efficiencies (algal production / invertebrate production) were low in Castle Lake (< 3 %), though zoobenthic production was more efficiently passed to fish than was zooplankton production. The larger size of benthic prey relative to pelagic prey may affect fish prey selection and foraging efficiency, resulting in differences in ecological efficiency between pelagic and benthic trophic pathways. Résumé: Alors que l’étude des lacs s’est traditionnellement concentrée sur les voies de production pélagiques, des données récentes provenant d’études des isotopes stables et des régimes alimentaires indiquent que la production des algues benthiques contribue de façon substantielle à la production de poissons.

40|$|Species {{sensitivity}} distributions (SSDs) are statistical distributions which extrapolate single-species {{toxicity test}} results to ecosystem effects. This SSD approach assumes that ecological interactions between populations, such as grazing and competition, do not influence {{the sensitivity of}} ecosystems. The validity of this assumption in a simple freshwater <b>pelagic</b> ecosystem was <b>tested</b> using ecosystem modelling. For each of a 1000 hypothetical toxicants, a lognormal SSD was fitted to chronic single-species EC 10 s of the species present. As such, these distributions did not account for ecological interactions and were therefore termed 'conventional SSDs' (cSSDs). Next, sensitivity distributions that did take into account ecological interactions were constructed (eco-SSD) for the same 1000 toxicants, using an ecosystem model. For 254 of the 1000 hypothetical toxicants, mean and/or variance of the cSSD {{were significantly higher than}} mean and/or variance of the eco-SSD, as such rejecting the general validity of the tested assumption. A classification tree approach indicated that especially toxicants which directly affect phytoplankton (i. e. herbicides) may have a higher mean for cSSD than for eco-SSD. Conversely, means of eco-SSD and cSSD tend to be equal for toxicants directly affecting zooplankton and fish, e. g. insecticides. For the 254 hypothetical toxicants for which the tested assumption was false, a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) calculated as the lowest single-species EC 10 divided by an application factor of 10 was on average a factor 10 lower than the corresponding ecosystem-NOEC calculated by the ecosystem model...|$|R

Comparing phenotypic variation among several hierarchical levels {{can be used}} to test hypotheses about selection, phenotypic evolution and speciation. Such hierarchical comparisons have only been performed in threespine stickleback, and so here we use a hierarchical pattern of divergences between near-shore littoral and off-shore <b>pelagic</b> habitats to <b>test</b> for selection on the evolution of body form in Lepomis sunfish in lakes. We compare variation in external body form between fish from littoral and pelagic habitats at three levels: among ecomorphs within individual lake populations (intrapopulation), among populations of the same species in different lakes (interpopulation), and between bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish species (interspecifically). Using geometric morphometric methods, we first demonstrate that interpopulation variation in mean body form of pumpkinseed sunfish varies with the presence of pelagic habitat. We then incorporate these results with existing data in order to test the similarity of phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic habitats at different hierarchical levels. Parallel relationships between certain body form traits (head length, caudal length and pectoral length) and habitat occur at all three levels suggesting that selection persistently acts at all levels to diversify these traits and so may contribute to species formation. For other traits (caudal depth and pectoral altitude), divergence between habitats is inconsistent at different hierarchical levels. Thus, nested biological variation in Lepomid body form reflects a history of deterministic selection and historical contingency, and also identifies traits that likely have likely influenced fitness and so serve important functions...|$|R

We <b>tested</b> the effects of elevated CO 2 on the early life history development and behaviour of yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi. Eggs and larvae were reared in current day control (450 µatm) and two elevated CO 2 treatments for a total of 6 d, from 12 h post-fertilization until 3 d post-hatching (dph). Elevated CO 2 treatments matched projections for the open ocean by the year 2100 under RCP 8. 5 (880 µatm CO 2) and a higher level (1700 µatm CO 2) relevant to upwelling zones where pelagic fish often spawn. There was no effect of elevated CO 2 on survival to hatching or 3 dph. Oil globule diameter decreased with an increasing CO 2 level, indicating potential effects of elevated CO 2 on energy utilization of newly hatched larvae, but other morphometric traits did not differ among treatments. Contrary to expectations, there were no effects of elevated CO 2 on larval behaviour. Activity level, startle response, and phototaxis did not differ among treatments. Our results contrast with findings for reef fish, where a wide range of sensory and behavioural effects have been reported. We hypothesize that the absence of behavioural effects in 3 dph yellowtail kingfish is due to the early developmental state of newly hatched pelagic fish. Behavioural effects of high CO 2 may not occur until larvae commence branchial acid-base regulation when the gills develop; however, further studies are required to test this hypothesis. Our results suggest that the early stages of kingfish development are tolerant to rising CO 2 levels in the ocean...|$|R
40|$|How do {{populations of}} highly mobile species inhabiting open environments become reproductively {{isolated}} and evolve into new species? We test {{the hypothesis that}} elevated ocean-surface temperatures can facilitate allopatry among pelagic populations and thus promote speciation. Oceanographic modelling has shown that increasing surface temperatures cause localization and reduction of upwelling, leading to fragmentation of feeding areas critical to <b>pelagic</b> species. We <b>test</b> our hypothesis by genetic analyses of populations of two closely related baleen whales, the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whose current distributions and migration patterns extent are largely determined by areas of consistent upwelling with high primary production. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA control-region nucleotide sequences collected from 467 whales sampled in four different ocean basins were employed to infer the evolutionary relationship among populations of B. acutorostrata by rooting an intraspecific phylogeny {{with a population of}} B. bonaerensis. Our findings suggest that the two species diverged in the Southern Hemisphere less than 5 million years ago (Ma). This estimate places the speciation event during a period of extended global warming in the Pliocene. We propose that elevated ocean temperatures in the period facilitated allopatric speciation by disrupting the continuous belt of upwelling maintained by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our analyses revealed that the current populations of B. acutorostrata likely diverged after the Pliocene some 1. 5 Ma when global temperatures had decreased and presumably coinciding with the re-establishment of the polar-equatorial temperature gradient that ultimately drives upwelling. In most population samples, we detected genetic signatures of exponential population expansions, consistent with the notion of increasing carrying capacity after the Pliocene. Our hypothesis that prolonged periods of global warming facilitate speciation in pelagic marine species that depend on upwelling should be tested by comparative analyses in other pelagic species...|$|R
40|$|Scyphomedusae are {{important}} components in trophic and community structures of marine and estuarine systems worldwide. Behavior likely {{has a significant}} influence on medusa population dynamics and growing evidence points to the disproportionate effect individual behavior has on population responses, yet there are few quantitative studies of medusa behavior and no method for quantifying the behavior of individual pelagic organisms. A numerical model of medusa swimming behavior would be an important tool for assessing its effect on spatial patterns and foraging efficiency. An approach was developed that uses a suite of statistical techniques to quantitatively describe time-dependent changes in behavior of <b>pelagic</b> organisms and <b>tested</b> on the swimming behavior of Aurelia aurita and the foraging behavior of Chrysaora quinquecirrha. An individual-based model of medusa swimming behavior was formulated as a correlated random walk of velocity vectors in three dimensions. Each A. aurita medusa exhibited a unique swimming behavior, including varying swimming bell pulsations, speed, and turning at characteristic frequencies. C. quinquecirrha swam in mostly linear trajectories that alternated between periods of slow and fast swimming while searching for prey, but swam at a constant moderate rate with increased anisotropic turning while feeding. Foraging behavior by medusa groups depended on interindividual and intraindividual variability in medusa behavior, including deterministic changes in swimming pulsation strength and turning. Empirical and model results showed that variability of behavior among medusae and by individual medusae over time are integral components determining the aggregated population response. Medusa foraging behavior appears adapted for patchily distributed prey. Alternating between slow and fast swimming while searching for prey may minimize energy expended while periodically generating prey-entraining currents. Increased turning {{in the presence of}} prey increases the likelihood of remaining in prey patches. Anisotropic turning created vertically spiraling paths, well suited to horizontally compressed prey patches. Model results demonstrated that medusae tend to swim toward and accumulate at the surface, avoid direct contact with the bottom, orient search patterns to long-range stimuli (e. g. gravity) and feeding patterns to local stimuli (e. g. prey contact), and exhibit periodicities of velocity outside prey patches and turning within patches that result from deterministic behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of fish in}} Croatia is relatively low for a Mediterranean country. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is the inadequate supply of fish. The supply of fish is usually limited to expensive species of whitefish, while the supply of pelagic fish is very scarce. Pelagic fish can rarely be found in restaurants, and in the fish- markets it reaches very high prices. The basic goal of the project "Srdela Snack" (srdela - Croatian word for sardine) was to set up and test a new model of commercialization of pelagic fish through franchise "fast - food" outlets. In the paper we will describe the concept of this new model which includes the whole distribution channel, from fishermen, through processors, restaurants to consumers. In this model fishermen supply fresh pelagic fish to approved restaurant s (members of the franchise) which prepare the fish according to traditional recipes. In this way a completely new product is introduced in the Croatian market. The main idea was to offer a high- quality, simple and convenient meals made of pelagic fish from the Croatian Adriatic. This model of commercialization of <b>pelagic</b> fish was <b>tested</b> through a pilot project. In the pilot project the standards of food quality were determined, the traditional recipes for preparing the food were selected, and the menu, consisting entirely of pelagic fish dishes was made. Finally, the logo of the franchise restaurant was designed. The test restaurant was opened in the summer 2004. The visitors of the restaurant participated in a survey which was used to determine the degree of their satisfaction with the new product and the new model of pelagic fish commercialization. The results of the survey showed that there is a strong demand for pelagic fish in the Croatian market. Most of the interviewed consumers liked the new product; they consider it very healthy, affordable, tasty, and typical for Mediterranean and Croatia. Fishermen and restaurant - owners also showed a great interest for this new model of commercialization because it could provide them with a bigger income. Since the results of the pilot project showed that this kind of innovation in the distribution channel is very successful, this model of franchise restaurants offering pelagic fish "fast - food" can be implemented on the national level.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 227 - 253). Human {{perception of}} sea fisheries {{has evolved from}} an inexhaustible resource paradigm towards a generalized concern on the degraded state of fish stocks and ecosystems. Accordingly, fisheries science and management are expanding from the traditional single-species approach towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Marine communities are organized as webs of interactions that are affected by external natural (climate) and anthropogenic (fishing) forcing, with their relative effects poorly known, but hypothesised to strongly depend on internal food web structure (i. e., who eats and controls whom). This thesis approaches relevant ecological considerations for an ecosystem approach to fisheries in the upwelling ecosystem off central Chile (33 ºS- 39 ºS). The main objective is to assess the effects of internal (trophic structure) and external (fishing and environment) forcing factors at the fish stock and food web level in the study area. The methodology includes i) the construction of snapshot and dynamic food web models to test hypothesis {{of changes in the}} food web in the last century, and the relative contribution of fishing, trophic controls and bottom-up environmental variability to those changes, ii) the computation and analysis of a set of ecosystem indicators to test hypotheses of changes in different aspects of the exploited community (mean trophic level, age and length at maturity, network properties and system variability), iii) the analyses of the relationships between time series of abundance of species with known trophic interactions (Chilean hake-red squat lobster and Chilean hake-small <b>pelagic</b> fish) to <b>test</b> hypothesis of top-down and bottom-up control versus alternative hypotheses of fishing and/or environmental control in the same populations, and iv) simulation experiments to test hypotheses of ecosystem change and recovery under fishing and environmental forcing. Models and indicators are constructed using data series of abundance, catches, production, consumption and diets of the main functional groups in the study area. Snapshot and dynamic food web models are constructed and analyzed using the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 5. 1 and routines therein. The observed trends in indicators and model results are in accordance with what is theoretically expected in stressed ecosystems (shift towards a food web dominated by short-lived, low trophic level and high turnover rate species), and suggest that the food web could be in a state that is more susceptible to external forcing. Fishing and the environment (bottom-up anomaly in PP) may have affected the upwelling ecosystem off central Chile both at the stock and at the food web level between 1970 and 2004. The effects of these forcing factors may have been mediated by trophic controls operating in the food web. There is also evidence to support the hypothesis that trophic controls beyond fishing, e. g., trophic (internal) and environment (external) may operate in the analysed populations and this information should be considered in their assessment and management. While target objectives are set and agreed, it is proposed that the main objective for the ecosystem approach to fisheries should be to avoid fishing-induced regime shifts, since results from simulation experiments suggest that fishing can induce ecosystem changes of lower recovery than bottom-up forcing...|$|R
40|$|Hole 633 A was {{drilled in}} the {{southern}} part of Exuma Sound on the toe-of-slope of the southeastern part of Great Bahama Bank during ODP Leg 101. The top 55 m, collected as a suite of six approximately 9. 5 -m-long hydraulic piston cores, represents a Pliocene-Pleistocene sequence of periplatform carbonate ooze, a mixture of pelagic calcite (foraminifer and coccolith <b>tests),</b> some <b>pelagic</b> aragonite (pteropod <b>tests),</b> and bank-derived fine aragonite and magnesian calcite. A 1. 6 -m. y. -long hiatus was identified at 43. 75 mbsf using calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. The 43. 75 -m-thick periplatform sequence above the hiatus is a complete late Pliocene-Quaternary record of the past 2. 15 m. y. The d 18 O curve, primarily based on Globigerinoides sacculifera, clearly displays high-frequency/low-amplitude cycles during the early Pleistocene and low-frequency/high-amplitude cycles during the middle and late Pleistocene. Variations in aragonite content in the fine fraction of the periplatform ooze show a cyclic pattern throughout the Pleistocene, as previously observed in piston cores of the upper Pleistocene. These variations correlate well with the d 18 O record: high aragonite corresponds to light interglacial d 18 O values, and vice versa. Comparison of the d 18 O record and the aragonite curve helps to identify 23 interglacial and glacial oxygen-isotope stages, corresponding to 10. 5 aragonite cycles (labeled A to K) commonly established during the middle and late Pleistocene (0. 9 Ma-present). Strictly based on the aragonite curve, another 11 aragonite cycles, labeled L to V, were identified for the early Pleistocene (0. 9 to 1. 6 Ma). Mismatches between the d 18 O record and the aragonite curve occur mainly at some of the glacial-to-interglacial transitions, where aragonite increases usually lag behind d 18 O depletion. When one visually connects the minima on the Pleistocene aragonite curve, low-frequency (0. 4 to 0. 5 m. y.) supercycles seem to be superimposed on the high-frequency cycles. The timing of this supercycle roughly matches the timing of the Pleistocene carbonate preservation supercycles described in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. Mismatches between aragonite and d 18 O cycles are even more obvious for the late Pliocene (1. 6 to 2. 15 Ma). Irregular aragonite variations are observed for the late Pliocene, although after the onset of late Pleistocene-like glaciations in the North Atlantic Ocean 2. 4 m. y. ago the d 18 O record has shown a mode of high-frequency/low-amplitude cycles. Initiation of climatically induced aragonite cycles occurs only at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, 1. 6 m. y. ago. After that time, aragonite cycles are fully developed throughout the Quaternary. The 11 -m-thick periplatform sequence below the hiatus represents a lower Pliocene interval between 3. 75 and 4. 45 Ma. The bottom half (4. 25 - 4. 45 Ma) has a fairly constant, high aragonite content (averaging 60 %) and high sedimentation rates (28 m/m. y.) and corresponds to the end of the prolonged early Pliocene interglacial interval (4. 1 - 5. 0 Ma), established as a worldwide high sea-level stand. The second half (3. 75 - 4. 25 Ma), in which aragonite content decreases by successive steps, paralleled by a gradual 5180 enrichment in Globigerinoides sacculifera and low sedimentation rates (10 m/m. y), corresponds to the climatic deterioration established worldwide between 4. 1 and 3. 8 Ma, to a decrease of carbonate preservation observed in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and to a global sea-level decline. Dolomite, a ubiquitous secondary component in the lower Pliocene, is interpreted as being authigenic and possibly related to diagenetic transformation of primary bank-derived fine magnesian calcite. Transformation of the primary mineralogical composition of the periplatform ooze was evidently minor, as the sediments have retained a detailed record of the Pliocene-Pleistocene climatic evolution. Clear evidence of diagenetic transformations in the periplatform ooze includes (1) the disappearance of magnesian calcite in the upper 20 m of Hole 633 A, (2) the occurrence of calcite overgrowths on foraminiferal tests and microclasts at intermittent chalky core levels, and (3) the ubiquitous presence of authigenic dolomite in the lower Pliocene...|$|R
