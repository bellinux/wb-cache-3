5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS. The submission stated that the allocation of free units to industry was too generous {{and the length of}} the phase-out of free allocation was too slow. Without a carbon price signal to invest in low carbon technologies, emissions would continue to rise.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for the Environment {{considered}} {{that there was}} insufficient evidence to justify leaving agriculture out of the NZ ETS until 2015. A submission from the Institute of Policy Studies (New Zealand) and The New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute {{considered that}} the delayed entry of agriculture into the NZ ETS would reduce long term competitiveness of the New Zealand economy by supporting industry that can not compete in an emissions constrained world.|$|E

25|$|As Bercow {{lacked a}} party {{endorsement}} {{and therefore a}} campaign team, he sought to build one {{and a group of}} his supporters known as 'Friends of Speaker Bercow' solicited donations for the campaign, aiming to raise £40,000. When one of their letters was received {{by a member of the}} UK Independence Party, the recipient referred it to the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards, complaining that it appeared that Bercow's fundraising campaign was operating from the Speaker's Office, which is required to remain politically neutral. The Commissioner declined to launch an investigation because of the lack of evidence of involvement of the Speaker's Office.|$|E
25|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the appearance of Queenborough Castle comes from a plan in an Elizabethan manuscript preserved at Hatfield House, also from a view by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677) which is now lost but is known from some 18th century copies and impressions. There are also written descriptions, the most detailed being the 1650 report of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioners.</b>|$|R

He was ejected from his fellowship by the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>commissioners</b> under the ordinance of 13 February 1646, in 1650.|$|R
50|$|In 1643 Bainbridge ineffectually {{wrote to}} Honywood {{urging him to}} return, {{so as not to}} exceed the statutable limit of absence, which would defeat his wish that Honywood should succeed him as master. In 1645 Honywood was still abroad. Over Bainbridge's protests, the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>commissioners</b> for Leicestershire sequestered Honywood's living of Kegworth, and a new rector was {{appointed}} in 1649.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Prescott {{gave up a}} {{grace and}} favour home that he had rented from the RMT Union in Clapham; {{he had left the}} union in June 2002. Prescott paid £220 a month for the {{property}} – a fifth of its market value. Though he had not declared the flat in the register of members' interests, he was subsequently exonerated by MPs who overruled Elizabeth Filkin, the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards. On 12 January 2006, Prescott apologised after it was revealed that the council tax for the government flat he occupied at Admiralty House was paid for using public money, rather than his private income. He repaid the amount, which came to £3,830.52 over nearly nine years.|$|E

2500|$|The Ministry for the Environment and Office of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for the Environment were {{established}} by the Environment Act 1986.

2500|$|The Liberal Democrats {{said he had}} a [...] "moral obligation" [...] to pay an {{estimated}} £55,000 in capital gains tax to the public purse which he had saved through the designation or [...] "flipping" [...] of his London property as his main home. He had previously paid back £1,193 spent on chauffeur fares and overpayments on his mortgage after a complaint from a Labour activist, and it also emerged that he had claimed £47 for two copies of a DVD of his own speech on [...] "value for taxpayers' money". The report of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards found that although Osborne had breached the rules, the offence was [...] "unintended and relatively minor". Osborne said he had received [...] "flawed" [...] advice and not benefited personally.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 2016, Vaz was {{appointed}} to the Justice Select Committee, after he had put himself forward and was nominated by his party. A House of Commons motion to block this development was defeated; they are rare on such an issue. According to Laura Hughes of The Daily Telegraph, Conservative Party whips told their MPs to vote for Vaz in the division to prevent a precedent being created of such appointments being rejected by MPs. Over 150 Conservative MPs voted in support of Vaz. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen asked in the chamber of Vaz: [...] "what makes him think that he is a fit and proper person this month?" [...] The <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards, Kathryn Hudson has previously announced an investigation into Vaz's conduct.|$|E
50|$|In 1645, Lord Deincourt {{was created}} Earl of Scarsdale.

His son procured some friends to be the purchasers, he paying the sum of £18,000, fixed by the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>commissioners</b> as the composition.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards {{keeper of the}} rolls and records in the Tower.

2500|$|On 21 February 2005, the {{constituency}} party chairman's wife Mrs Valmai A Green {{and another}} member {{wrote to the}} <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards, enclosing a letter Sayeed had sent {{to members of the}} Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association, and asking if Sayeed should have used House of Commons stationery and facilities for this. [...] "The Committee issued a second report on 17th March 2005 criticising Sayeed for failing to apologise for his conduct as the first report had ordered, for sending out a circular on House of Commons stationery to members of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association asking for their support in his reselection, and misuse of allowances to pay for work on his home. Following this report, the Conservative Party removed the whip from Sayeed permanently." [...] Under Conservative Party rules, a sitting MP can only be an approved Conservative party candidate in a parliamentary election if he/she has the Conservative Party whip. This enables the Conservative Party leader to over-rule local constituency Conservative Party branches who want to retain their sitting MP as candidate.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011 the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Standards {{reported}} to the Standards and Privileges Committee on the investigation into his conduct. The Committee concluded that Laws was guilty of breaking six rules with regard to expenses. [...] The Commissioner reported {{that none of the}} claims for the London properties was acceptable under the rules but that he had not intended to benefit himself or Lundie directly. In addition to finding against Laws with regard to the payment of rent to his friend, the investigation also found irregularities in phone bill and building work expenses. The Committee concluded that [...] "... the rental agreements submitted [...] between 2003 and 2008 were misleading and designed to conceal the nature of the relationship. They prevented any examination of the arrangements that in fact pertained over the entire period". [...] Further, his claims for rent were in excess of market levels for a lodging agreement and a market-level agreement would not have included contributions from the lodger towards building repairs and maintenance which were claimed. The Committee concluded that it was inappropriate to judge whether the claims on a particular property were appropriate by reference to potential payments on another property, which was not in fact claimed for.|$|E
60|$|Bless us, what {{a number}} of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up and down, and how few of them wanted their horses held! A good city {{speculator}} or a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>commissioner</b> could have told to a fraction, from the crowds that were cantering about, what sum of money was realised in London, {{in the course of}} a year, by holding horses alone. And undoubtedly it would have been a very large one, if only a twentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to alight; but they had not; and it is often an ill-natured circumstance like this, which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world.|$|E
