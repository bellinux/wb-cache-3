5|$|Freddie Stowers was {{the first}} of only two African American to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I. Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, {{continuing}} to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never processed. In 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based on results of the investigation the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was <b>presented</b> <b>on</b> April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action.

5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was <b>presented</b> <b>on</b> the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{charges against}} the group were <b>presented</b> <b>on</b> June 4, the {{indictment}} running to 2,800 pages. By late June 2012, disquiet over the trio's detention without setting a trial date and concern over what was regarded as excessive and arbitrary treatment, led to the writing of an open letter. It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election. Singer Alla Pugachyova appealed on the women's behalf, stating that they should be ordered to perform community service rather than imprisoned. Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he would gladly sign an open letter against them.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book <b>presented</b> <b>on</b> prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was <b>presented</b> <b>on</b> 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.|$|E

Such repeating motifs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed by the macrophages.
