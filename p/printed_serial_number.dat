In order to solve the problem, inefficiency in production and traceability of the products, this thesis try to introduce RFID technology into the production of PHC tubular pile. By designing a production management system of precast concrete components, the enterprise will achieve the control of the entire production process, and realize the informatization of enterprise production management. RFID technology has been widely used in many fields like entrance control, charge management, logistics and so on. RFID technology will adopt passive RFID tag, which is waterproof, shockproof, anti-interference, so it’s suitable for the actual working environment. The tag will be bound to the precast component steel cage (the structure of the PHC tubular pile before the concrete placement), which means each PHC tubular pile will have a unique ID number. Then according to the production procedure, the precast component will be performed with a series of actions, put the steel cage into the mold, mold clamping, pouring concrete (feed), stretching, centrifugalizing, maintenance, mold removing, welding splice. In every session of the procedure, the information of the precast components can be read through a RFID reader. Using a portable smart device connected to the database, the user can check, inquire and management the production information conveniently. Also, the system can trace the production parameter and the person in charge, realize the traceability of the information. This system can overcome the disadvantages in precast components manufacturers, like inefficiency, error-prone, time consuming, labor intensity, low information relevance and so on.

50|$|A {{predictable}} <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{attack is}} a form of security exploit in which the algorithm for generating <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> for a particular purpose is guessed, discovered, or reverse engineered, a new <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is predicted using the algorithm, and the newly generated <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is then used for a fraudulent purpose, either to obtain an undeserved benefit or to deny service to the legitimate holder of the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|A common {{approach}} to prevent predictable <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> attacks {{is to use}} a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 to generate the actual <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Internally, the issuing organization creates a (pseudo-)random nonce as a salt for generating the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> and keeps it secret. The issuer increments their internal <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and appends it to the salt, and the computed message digest is used to create the actual <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> The issuer does have to take care to prevent collisions between existing values so as not to wrongly issue two identical <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} Nisshin Onpa (Maxon) pickups {{from the early}} 1980s that have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> that start with a 5 and these <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> follow a reverse <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> format.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are often}} used in network protocols. However, most {{sequence}} numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> may duplicate very old <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> but not other recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, [...] "Serial Number Arithmetic", defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{machine was}} given a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and user manuals were printed. At first, Thomas {{differentiated}} machines by capacity and therefore gave the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> to machines of different capacities. This was corrected in 1863 and each machine was given its own unique <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> starting with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> of 500.|$|R
