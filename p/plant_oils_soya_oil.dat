We evaluated the effect of acute consumption of these types of oil on endothelial function, oxidative stress and inflammation in healthy adults. Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomised to receive an oral amount of each type of oil or water. Endothelial function was evaluated by gauge-strain plethysmography at baseline and 1, 2 and 3 h after consumption. Oxidative stress status was determined by total lipid peroxides (PEROX), while inflammatory process was estimated by measuring the soluble form of vascular adhesion molecule 1. Serum levels of the two previous markers were measured at baseline and 3 h after oil consumption. Reactive hyperaemia (RH) was significantly decreased after maize oil consumption compared with controls (P < 0. 05). However, the consumption of cod liver <b>oil</b> and <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> induced a significant improvement of RH after 1 h, compared with controls (P < 0. 05).

Many lung problems are connected with particulate matter emitted by diesel vehicle including dust, soot and smoke. People are exposed to pollution even as they talk or when stir up the dust when they walk. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable fuel. Compared to diesel fuel, biodiesel produces no sulfur, no net carbon dioxide, less carbon monoxide and more oxygen. More free oxygen leads to the complete combustion and reduced emission. Overall biodiesel emissions are very less compared to diesel fuel emissions which is promising pollution free environment.

In this study, three different vegetables <b>oils</b> (rape seed <b>oil,</b> <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> and waste oil) were esterified and the resulting biodiesels were then tested in an inline four cylinder direct injection engine, typically used in small diesel genset applications, as blends of 5 % and 50 % in mineral diesel, or as the pure methyl ester. The engine performance and emissions of the engine were then recorded at five load conditions and at two different speeds. The data were then compared to those obtained under the same operating conditions for mineral diesel. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion employs premixed homogeneous air and fuel mixture, but the combustion is ignited by compression. It has the potential to deliver high efficiency, low NOx and particulate emissions. The auto-ignition nature ensures that the HCCI has the potential to burn different fuels. It is therefore a potential alternative technology for diesel applications. However, unlike conventional CI and SI combustion methods, the combustion process of HCCI is predominantly governed by chemical kinetics of the air/fuel mixture. It has been proved difficult to effectively controlling the ignition timing and combustion heat release rate over wide engine speed / load range over recent years of investigation. In the research work reported in this paper, four various diesels type fuels: N-heptane, Dimethyl Ether (DME), Methyl Butanoate (MB) surrogating heavy bio-diesel and Methyl Formate (MF) substituting light bio-diesel were studied using a single-zone combustion model with convective heat transfer loss and detailed chemical kinetics.

40|$|With this paper, {{we provide}} the first {{quantitative}} investigation of vertical price transmission in the biodiesel supply chain in Germany with {{the focus on}} the developments during the food crisis and the impact of subsidized US biodiesel exports. With the strong promotion of the production and use of biodiesel {{during the first half of}} the past decade, the German biodiesel market became the largest national biodiesel market worldwide. This analysis utilizes prices of rapeseed <b>oil,</b> <b>soya</b> <b>oil,</b> biodiesel and crude oil over a sample period covering the rapid growth of the German demand in 2002 until its decline in 2009. The effects of both the market development and different policies on price transmission are analyzed in detail. Due to the numerous changes in the market, a regime-dependent Markov-switching vector error correction model is applied. The results indicate that regimes with differing error-correction behavior govern the transmission process among the various prices. Evidence was found for a strong impact of crude oil price on biodiesel prices, and of biodiesel prices on rapeseed oil prices. However, in both cases, the price adjustment behavior is found to be regime dependent, and the regime occurrence in both market segments shows similar patterns. In relation to crude oil a weak adjustment of biodiesel prices is found to be dominating in the phase of market expansion. This changed from 2007 on when stronger error-correction is found, reflected by a stronger role of the crude oil price developments. In the relationship of biodiesel to the vegetable oils, most of the growth period was dominated by a regime characterized by weak price adjustments. From 2007 on, past own price changes and past changes in <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> prices had a strong impact particularly on rapeseed oil prices. The biodiesel price development was less important. Reasons for this are substantial changes in the market structure. The biodiesel market developed as an insulated market; biodiesel was mainly produced from rapeseed oil until 2006. Thereafter, biodiesel was increasingly used for blends and sales decreased during the food crisis when agricultural commodity prices rose sharply. At the same time, strong import competition arose from subsidized US B 99. The superiority of rapeseed oil for biodiesel production diminished. The uncertainty prevailing in the market from 2007 onwards is reflected by frequent regime changes.

The study revealed that the three vegetable seeds are good sources of edible <b>oils.</b> <b>Soya</b> bean <b>oil</b> is considered to be the most suitable for food formulation as well as drying oil in pharmaceutical, paints, soap and perfume industries because of its higher level of unsaturation in the fatty acid contents...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} changes in laying {{performance}} and egg weight, four diets were added with 30 g/kg of <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> (control), sunflower acid oil, stearin and Bergafat (acid oil). Totally hundred and ninety two brown layer hens {{at the age of}} 31 weeks were randomly allocated to 48 cage replicates. Egg production, egg weight, feed intake and feed conversion ratio of the hens receiving the diets of acid oil, stearin and Bergafat was not significantly (P> 0. 05) {{different from that of the}} hens receiving the diet of <b>soya</b> <b>oil.</b> The diet with Bergafat insignificantly (P> 0. 05) leads to reduced egg weight being 59. 3 g compared to the other diets with 61. 2, 61. 2 and 61. 9 g values, respectively. The reduced egg weight with Bergafat might be associated with the low level of unsaturated fatty acid which resulted in less lipid deposition in the egg yolk. The linoleic acid contents of studied oils ranged from 23. 9, 23. 0, 21. 4 and 11. 6 g/kg for <b>soya</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower acid oil, stearin and Bergafat, respectively. The results indicated that the diet linoleic acid content over 12 g/kg is not critical for egg weight...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the performance of}} biofuels in diesel engines. Generally, the basic combustion and emission characteristics of Rapeseed <b>Oil</b> (RSO) and <b>Soya</b> <b>Oil</b> (SO) result in a lower in-cylinder pressure peak than diesel. This led to the reduction of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions and to relatively high soot emissions. Further measurements of RSO were done in order to investigate the influence of injection pressure, injection timing and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) on combustion and emission characteristics. A high soot emission from RSO was reduced by increased injection pressure. Moreover, injection timing also had to be varied {{in order to reduce the}} soot emissions from RSO. The retarded injection timing (3 deg bTDC) and increased injection pressure (1200 bar) for the blend of 30 % RSO resulted in a reduction of soot emission to the same level as from diesel fuel. Further investigation regarding the soot emissions was done for Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) under turbocharged engine operation. The application of the boost pressure resulted in stable engine operation at a late injection timing of 5 deg aTDC. A simultaneous reduction of soot and NOx emissions has been achieved for RME at an injection timing of TDC and high EGR percentage (40 – 50 %) ...|$|R
