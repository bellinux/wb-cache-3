5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double <b>play</b> <b>or</b> triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double <b>play</b> <b>or</b> triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E

5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during <b>play</b> <b>or</b> when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E

However, he has collaborated with other artists at times for vocals or other instruments that he cannot <b>play</b> <b>or</b> create electronically.|$|E

5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage <b>play</b> <b>or</b> musical than read the book.

Several characters often <b>play</b> <b>or</b> sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others.

5|$|Air Force {{began the}} final quarter of play in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down at the Virginia Tech 29-yard line. Needing sevenyards for a first down, the Falcons picked up six. Instead of attempting a field goal on fourth down, DeBerry ordered another fourth-down conversion, which was successful. Three plays later, Tech's defense again forced a fourth down, and again DeBerry ordered a fourth-down conversion. The try was again successful, and Air Force earned another first down. Virginia Tech's defense continued to prevent Air Force from gaining a big <b>play</b> <b>or</b> a touchdown, however, and forced another fourth down. Considering his third fourth-down conversion in the same drive, coach DeBerry instead sent in kicker Joey Ashcroft, who kicked a 21-yard field goal to cut Virginia Tech's lead to 17–13 with 9:50 {{to go in the}} quarter.|$|E
5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match <b>play</b> <b>or</b> fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would <b>play</b> <b>or</b> do homework there after school.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to <b>play</b> <b>or</b> aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of <b>play</b> <b>or</b> when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school <b>play</b> <b>or</b> following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1898 the Tower Theatre was opened, sited {{between the}} legs of the tower. Capable of {{accommodating}} an audience of 2,500, it was the largest theatre in England outside London. Each season at the theatre was different; some years it would show a <b>play</b> <b>or</b> an opera, others it would focus on variety acts such as magicians, comedians and lion tamer Mademoiselle Marguerite, with her seven lions. Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903, and had become a weekly event by 1937. When the Americans occupied the site during the Second World War they used the Tower Theatre to show their own roadshows to the troops.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at <b>play</b> <b>or</b> traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
