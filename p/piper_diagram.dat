30|$|<b>Piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> is a {{graphical}} {{method of}} representation of chemical analysis. It {{is based on}} the concentration of dominant cations and anions. This trilinear diagram was proposed to show the percentages at milliequivalents per liter of cations and anions in water samples. The <b>Piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> is very useful in bringing out chemical relationships among groundwater in more definite terms. This is useful to understand the total chemical character of water samples in terms of cation–anion pairs.|$|R
30|$|For {{the present}} study, {{two sets of}} 26 {{borewell}} water samples have been collected in consecutive post-monsoon and pre-monsoon sessions. For analyzing the samples, quantitative chemical analysis methods were adopted in the laboratory. Fluoride ion concentration in water was determined using the ion-selective electrode setup (APHA 1995). Identification of dominant mineral phases and calculation of their saturation indices {{have been carried out}} using the USGS geochemical model PHREEQC 3.0. 3. Simulations have been carried out on two sets of data for each sampling session—one where highest value of fluoride has been recorded and another where the lowest value of fluoride has been recorded. The rest of the interpretations have been made using hydrogeochemical facies in form of the <b>Piper’s</b> <b>diagram</b> (<b>Piper</b> 1944).|$|R
30|$|The {{statistical}} analysis {{was carried out}} using SPSS 13 to identify the correlation between selected water quality parameters. <b>Piper</b> <b>diagrams</b> were developed using AquaChem software version 2011.1 to have conclusive information about hydrogeochemical facies of all the rivers. Water quality index (WQI) of all the rivers have been calculated to find its suitability for drinking purposes by Weight Arithmetic WQI using 11 water quality parameters. Parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (Na%) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) were determined to assess the suitability of river water for irrigation purposes.|$|R
30|$|The <b>piper</b> <b>diagram</b> reveals {{composition}} of different ions in percentage. A major conclusion {{can be drawn}} from the <b>piper</b> <b>diagram</b> of the collected leachate samples. More importantly it indicates predominance of select cations as Na+ and K+ in comparison to calcium and magnesium. Bicarbonates and carbonates are the dominant anion found in the leachate samples compared to sulphates and chlorides. High chloride builds up are possibly due to leaching of percolating water from the MSW. The analyzed leachate sample can be thus categorized as the Na–HCO 3.|$|E
30|$|Also, <b>piper</b> <b>diagram</b> {{identifies}} the hydrogeochemical facies. Based on <b>piper</b> <b>diagram</b> a few {{conclusions can be}} inferred of the collected water’s bodies samples. Firstly, it indicates large percentages of the samples within the Ca–SO 4 category followed by Na–HCO 3 type. Secondly, bicarbonates and carbonates dominated the anions compared to chloride. However, anions like sulphates were very meager in concentrations {{in relation to other}} anions. Chloride content is high in ground water can be possibly domestic effluents, fertilizers, septic tanks, and leachate. Moreover, the above plot shows Ca 2 + concentrations being noticeably high in well sample. However, Na+ and K+ dominated the pond samples.|$|E
30|$|The hydrochemical {{compositions}} of {{the water}} samples were plotted on a <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> (Fig.  6) to understand the processes affecting the groundwater {{of the study area}} (Piper 1953). Two main hydrochemical water types have been identified. These are sodium chloride and mixed water types.|$|E
30|$|For each class, a <b>Piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> was plotted to {{interpret}} the overall water type and a pie diagram to present the ratio of Na:Ca (sodium:calcium) ratio which increases gradually as fluoride concentration in water increases (Beg et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|Graphical {{representation}} of groundwater major dissolved constituents (major cations and major anions) helps in understanding its hydrochemical evolution, grouping and areal distribution. In the present study, <b>Piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> and Chadha’s plot were constructed to evaluate variation in hydrochemical facies.|$|R
30|$|The hydrochemical facies {{of river}} {{water can be}} {{obtained}} through <b>Piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> (<b>Piper</b> 1994). This <b>diagram</b> effectively classifies the water quality by the distribution of major cations like Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and some major anions like Cl−, SO 4 2 − CO 3 2 − and HCO 3 −. This diagram represents the cations and anions composition of samples on a single graph in which major groupings or trends in the data can be distinguish visually (Pradhan and Pirasteh 2011). It consists of geometrical combination of two outer triangles and a middle or inner diamond shaped quadrilateral. The distribution of major cations and anions in meq/l are shown by {{the left and right}} and these plotted points in the triangular fields are projected further into the central diamond-like quadrilateral structure, which provides the overall characteristics of the water samples.|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} {{water samples}} have been classified {{according to their}} chemical composition using the <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> (Piper 1944). This classification {{is based on the}} concentration of the four major anions bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride and nitrate and on the four major cations sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{determine}} the quality of water from hand-dug wells in Kuje, Federal Capital Territory Abuja Nigeria. The study area lies between latitudes 080 53 ’ 24 ’’N and 080 53 ’ 47 ’’N and longitude 070 14 ’ 24 ’’E and 070 14 ’ 35 ’’E. Water from twenty wells were randomly sampled. The physical properties investigated are pH, temperature, total dissolved solid (TDS) and electrical conductivity. The chemical analysis involved determination of the concentration of anions (SO 42 -, HCO 3 -, Fl-, CO 3 -, Cl-, NO 3) and cations (Ca 2 +, Mg+, Na+,K+, Zn+, Fe 2 +, Cu 2 +. A <b>piper</b> <b>diagram</b> based on the relative percentages of the ions was plotted for classification according to hydrogeochemical facies of each water sample based on their dominant ions. The <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> indicated Ca 2 + and HCO 3 - as the dominant ions and therefore it is Ca−HCO 3 water type. The physical properties of the water {{were found to be}} good based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and National Drinking Water Quality Standard (NDWQS) and therefore water in the study area is safe for human consumption...|$|E
30|$|The trilinear <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> was {{prepared}} using the software GW chart. The diagram reveals very clearly the relative concentrations of major ions {{present in the}} groundwater samples collected. The diagram shows a combination of two triangles and a single diamond above the adjacent triangles in terms of anions like Cl−, SO 42 −, HCO 3 −, CO 32 −and cations like Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. The left triangle shows major cation concentrations and the right one major anion concentration. The collected groundwater samples collected show the major composition as a Ca 2 +−Mg 2 +−Cl−−SO 42 − type, calcium type, no dominant type, calcium chloride type and chloride type. Ca 2 +−Mg 2 +−Cl−−SO 42 −-type composition of groundwater has been reported previously (Laluraj et al. 2006; Ravikumar et al. 2010; Dar et al. 2011; Jasmin and Mallikarjuna 2006; Yadav et al. 2018; Aher 2017). Calcium chloride-type water may be produced by either reverse ion exchange between sodium and calcium (Adams et al. 2001; Sappa et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2017 a, b) or mixing of freshwater and older saline water (Adams et al. 2001). According to Chebotarev’s sequence, the chloride concentration of water increases along groundwater flow from recharge zone to discharge zone (Yakubo et al. 2009). The presence of chloride-type water indicates its withdrawal from very deep strata, i.e., a discharge zone in groundwater. Chloride-type dominated water has recently been reported (Chitradevi and Sridhar 2011; Kshetrimayum and Bajpai 2012). The presence of chloride in groundwater results from weathering of rock materials, industrial effluents, domestic effluents (Karanth 1987; Srinivas et al. 2017), and leaching of chloride-based pesticides applied to agro-ecosystems. The <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> shown here {{is similar to that}} presented by Saleh et al. (1999). Analysis of the <b>Piper</b> <b>diagram</b> reveals that groundwater samples from the Reoti and Belhari blocks are very similar in origin.|$|E
3000|$|The hydrochemical {{evolution}} of groundwater {{can be understood}} by plotting the major cations and anions in <b>piper</b> trilinear <b>diagram</b> (<b>Piper</b> 1944).

This diagram is very useful in bringing out chemical relationships among groundwater in more definite terms (Walton 1970).

The problem is that the quaternary catchment scale approach does not provide the scientific bases for site specific scale. The current study argues that such approach provides realistic, practical information at site specific scale and therefore informs the issuing of licences more accurately. The aim of the current study is to improve understanding of how the assessment of groundwater abstraction water use licence should be carried out at a site specific scale to improve decision making during licence issuance. The objective of the study is to outline the scientific study and demonstrate how the investigation that leads to the decision making can be conducted. The study was carried out using hydraulic methods such as pumping test and geochemical analysis method. Hydraulic properties were determined and chemical elements were analysed for and compared with the SANS 241 water quality standards for domestic and agricultural use. Hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity (K), transmissivity (T), yield and storativity (S) were determined. Major and minor ions that are required to be analysed for domestic and agricultural water use were analysed. <b>Piper</b> <b>diagrams</b> and FC method were used to analyse data. The <b>piper</b> <b>diagrams</b> plotted indicated that surface water is mixing with groundwater and that means there is connection between groundwater and surface water. The chemical elements analysed for were compared with SANS 241 water quality standards for domestic and agricultural use. The water quality on the investigated site can be categorized as having good water quality. A sustainable yield estimated from the two boreholes (BH 03 and BH 05) which was 1. 02 Ɩ/s. The available drawdown estimated with reference to the boreholes water strikes that were determined by EC profiling were 135 mbgl from both boreholes.

30|$|The {{analyses}} of 180 groundwater samples of Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia, recorded that most groundwaters are unsuitable for drinking uses {{due to high}} salinity; however, {{they can be used}} for irrigation with some restriction. The electric conductivity of studied groundwater ranged between 1.05 and 10.15  dS m− 1 with an average of 3.0  dS m− 1. Nitrate was also found in high concentration in some groundwater. <b>Piper</b> <b>diagrams</b> revealed that the majority of water samples are magnesium–calcium/sulfate–chloride water type. The Gibbs’s diagram revealed that the chemical weathering of rock-forming minerals and evaporation are influencing the groundwater chemistry. A kriging method was used for predicting spatial distribution of salinity (EC dS m− 1) and NO 3 − (mg L− 1) in Al-Kharj’s groundwater using data of 180 different locations. After normalization of data, variogram was drawn, for selecting suitable model for fitness on experimental variogram, less residual sum of squares value was used. Then cross-validation and root mean square error were used to select the best method for interpolation. The kriging method was found suitable methods for groundwater interpolation and management using either GS+ or ArcGIS.|$|R
