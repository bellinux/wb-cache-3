They are the report form and the account form. Individuals and small businesses tend to have simple <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> Larger businesses {{tend to have more}} complex <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> and these are presented in the organization's annual report. Large businesses also may prepare <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> for segments of their businesses. A <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> is often presented alongside one for a different point in time (typically the previous year) for comparison.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of a central bank {{contains}} valuable information {{for the quality of}} a currency. As an illustration we analyze the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Federal Reserve System (FED) during the subprime crisis between June 2007 and December 2008. Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically. The calculation of certain <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios supports the assessment of an important decrease {{of the quality of the}} currency. Our analysis shows that the analysis of central bank <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> policies should not rely solely on quantitative issues but rather include qualitative issues. subprime crisis, quality of money, qualitative easing, central banks´ <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> analysis...|$|R

40|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> {{developments}} of the Federal Reserve System have received increased attention during recent events. The Fed has expanded its <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and also changed its composition {{in order to support}} the financial system. As a consequence the average quality of the assets have, on average, deteriorated. In a similar way, the ECB has recently implemented novel <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> policies. In this article we compare the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> policies of these two central banks.

40|$|Most {{macroeconomic}} models {{treat the}} central bank and the trea-sury as a unified entity.

However, due to tax secrecy thay were barred from analyzing tax documents. Using archival evidence, we analyze tax <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> from which the reliability of disclosed <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of the interwar period can be assessed.

40|$|We analyse {{corporate}} <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment {{episodes in}} Germany and Japan, {{as well as}} a sample of 30 countries, using national account data. Corporate <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment tends to be long lasting and associated with a strong impact on current accounts, wages and investment. Adjustment episodes lead to significant changes in corporate <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios with a buildup of liquidity and a reduction of leverage. The adjustment is generally achieved by reducing investment and increasing savings {{on the back of a}} falling wage share. A panel econometric exercise shows that <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment periods are triggered by macroeconomic downturns as well as <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> stress due to high debt, low liquidity and negative equity price shocks. ...|$|R
50|$|Without an {{accumulated}} depreciation account on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> depreciation expense is usually charged against the relevant asset directly. The {{values of the}} fixed assets stated on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> will decline, even if the business has not invested in or disposed of any assets. The amounts will roughly approximate fair value. Otherwise, depreciation expense is charged against {{accumulated depreciation}}. Showing accumulated depreciation separately on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> {{has the effect of}} preserving the historical cost of assets on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> If there have been no investments or dispositions in fixed assets for the year, then the values of the assets will be the same on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> for the current and prior year (P/Y).|$|R
