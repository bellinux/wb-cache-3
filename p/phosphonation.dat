40|$|The {{principle}} {{objectives of}} this research were to chemically modify cellulose using either carboxylic acids or phosphorus containing acids. Carboxylic acids were reacted with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate, in order to synthesise reactive anhydrides, amides and polyamide compounds. The application of these intermediate compounds to cellulose was in tempted. The <b>phosphonation</b> of cellulose using phosphorous acid resulted in a substrate which exhibited flame retardant properties. Firstly, the stability {{and the nature of}} the reagents were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) and Capillary electrophoresis (CE). Secondly, the process of <b>phosphonation</b> was investigated to determine the optimum reagents / concentrations / pH and other application conditions on various cellulose substrates. The treated cotton fabrics were found to give excellent flame retardancy; such fabrics were analysed by different technique, including FTIR, FT -Raman, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), fluorescence microscopy and cationic dye staining. All the analysis results clearly showed that these <b>phosphonation</b> treatments introduced flame retardant properties to cotton fabrics which were durable to repeated alkaline launderings. The results {{of this research}} have been used to help launch a commercially viable flame retardant product.

The methodologies of chemo- and regioselective synthesis of highly functionalized deazapurines have been developed by using modern C-H activation chemistry. Various functional groups such as amino-, imido-, silyl- and phosphonyl- were introduced by C-H activation reactions. Amino deazapurine derivatives were synthesized by developed Pd/Cu-catalyzed direct C-H amination and C-H chloroamination of 6 -substituted 7 -deazapurines with N-chloro-N- alkyl-arylsulfonamides. C-H imidation reactions of pyrrolopirimidines were performed under ferrocene catalysis with N-succinimido- or N-phtalimidoperesters.

The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the influence of particle size, morphology and surface modifications of diatom silica microparticles on their drug release properties. Raw diatomaceous earth (DE) material was purified and classified to obtain high purity DE silica porous particles with different size and shapes. Comparative scanning electron microscope and particle characterization confirmed their particle size including irregularly shaped silica particles (size 0. 1 - 1 mum, classified as "fine"), mixed fractions (size 1 - 10 mum, classified as "mixed") and pure unbroken DE structures (size 10 - 15 mum, classified as "entire"). Surface modification of isolated DE with silanes and phosphonic acids were done using standard silanisation and <b>phosphonation</b> process. Water insoluble (indomethacin) and water soluble (gentamicin sulphate) drugs were loaded to study the release performances of modified DE particles.

Moreover, synthesis of triethyl citrate (TEC), a non-toxic plasticizer by esterification of CA with ethanol over heterogeneous catalyst would be renewable and sustainable catalytic process. In this context, parent Ultrastable Y (USY) and different percentage phosphonated USY (P-USY) zeolites were used for the synthesis of TEC in a closed batch reactor, for the first time. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by N 2 -adsorption desorption isotherm, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and NH 3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD. Effect of reaction conditions, such as the molar ratio of ethanol to CA (5 : 1 - 20 : 1), the catalyst to CA ratio (0. 05 - 0. 25) and reaction temperature (363 - 403 K), were studied in view to maximizing CA conversion and TEC yield. Phosphonated USY catalysts were found to be superior in activity (CA conversion and TEC yield) than parent USY, which is attributed to the increased in total acidity with <b>phosphonation.</b> Among the studied catalysts, the P 2 USY (2 % phosphorous loaded on USY) was found to be an optimum catalyst with 99 % CA conversion and 82 % TEC yield, which is higher than the reported values.
