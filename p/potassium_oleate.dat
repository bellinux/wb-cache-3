40|$|The {{effects of}} sodium {{polyacrylate}} (NaPAA) {{as well as}} <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> on the nucleation and calcium carbonate crystal growth on hard surfaces, i. e., stainless steel and silica, have been investigated at different temperatures. The relation between the surface deposition and the corresponding bulk processes has been revealed by combining dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry. The aim was to further {{our understanding of the}} crystal deposition/growth mechanism and how it can be controlled by the presence of polyelectrolytes (NaPAA) or soap (<b>potassium</b> <b>oleate).</b> The addition of polyelectrolytes (NaPAA) or soap (<b>potassium</b> <b>oleate)</b> decreases the size of CaCO 3 particles in bulk solution and affects both crystal structure and morphology in the bulk as well as on hard surfaces. The amount of particles on hard surfaces decreases significantly in the presence of both <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> and NaPAA. This was found to be a consequence of <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> or NaPAA adsorption on the hard surface {{as well as on the}} CaCO 3 crystal surfaces. Here, the polymer NaPAA exhibited a stronger inhibition effect on the formation and growth of CaCO 3 particles than <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate...</b>|$|E

Millions of dollars are spent annually on fungicides to control these pathogens. There are multiple environmental and human health issues associated with some of the more common fungicides used. These problems dictate a demand for alternative, safe, and environmentally friendly fungicides available on the market. Two fungicide efficacy trials were conducted at the Douglas Research Conservatory at the University of Washington. Four fungicide treatments were evaluated: ammonium <b>oleate,</b> <b>potassium</b> laurate, malic acid, and sesame oil. A popular ornamental plant, Chrysanthemum x morifolium, was inoculated with a species of powdery mildew. The species was identified as Euoidium chrysanthemi at Washington State University Puyallup Research and Extension Center by sequencing its DNA and looking at key morphological features. This was the first case of E. chyrsanthemi recorded on C x morifolium in the United States. Ammonium <b>oleate</b> and <b>potassium</b> laurate inhibited E. chrysanthemi from colonizing C x morifolium and suppressed E. chrysanthemi growth. However, potassium laurate cannot be recommended because it proved to be phytotoxic at the percent concentration tested. Sesame oil was found to suppress E. chrysanthemi growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of land based oil reserves has necessitated {{the exploration of}} off shore oil. This exploration is often carried out in pristine waters {{and the use of}} green chemicals is essential to reduce environmental degradation. In the recovery of oil and gas from rocky formations, well bore fluids such as packer fluids, fracturing fluids, conformance and permeability control fluids are extensively employed. <b>Potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> as viscoelastic surfactants gives a low partition coefficient when in contact with hydrocarbon. Bromination of the oleate chain has been shown in this work to increase the partition coefficient and still maintaining its viscoelasticity. The partition coefficient increased to ca 8 % compared to negligible for <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate.</b> A gel was formed when a 20 % solution of potasssium 9 -bromo stearate was mixed with 8 % KCl. Contacting this gel with hydrocarbon resulted in a loss of viscosity due to the improved solubility of the brominated compound in hydrocarbon. This facilitates the removal of the surfactants after its use as a fracturing fluid. The viscoelastic properties were demonstrated using a Bohlin rheometer. The graph of viscosity vs shear rate shows at first a shear rate independence up to a shear rate of 0. 2 s- 1 and then falling with shear rate typical of a viscoelastic fluid. The zero shear viscosity ηo varied from 18 Pa s to 220 Pa s whilst the shear viscosity at 100 s- 1 ranged from 0. 16 Pa s to 1. 5 Pa s for surfactant concentration from 20 % to 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of different types}} of surfactants on ultrafiltration membranes has been investigated. A basic approach to membrane-surfactant interactions is also presented. A nonionic (Triton X- 100), two anionic (<b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate) and a cationic (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) surfactant were investigated. The effects on commercial membranes of polysulphone, poly(vinylidene fluoride) and cellulose acetate were studied. The flux reductions of the hydrophobic membranes were found to be much more pronounced than the flux variations of the hydrophilic membranes. Both the material and the molecular weight cut-off were found to influence the performance of the hydrophobic membranes. A drastic {{influence of}} hydrophobic impurities was demonstrated. The retention of the nonionic surfactant was low at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. The retention of the ionic surfactants was quite high, even at low concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{effects on}} the {{rheological}} properties of viscoelastic solutions containing entangled wormlike micelles of <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> and hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide were studied {{in a wide range}} of polymer concentrations. A very pronounced drop of viscosity by four orders of magnitude was observed at heating from 20 to 78 °C both in the presence and in the absence of polymer indicating that the wormlike micelles are mainly responsible for this effect. The highly thermosensitive behavior was attributed to the shortening of micellar chains induced by heating. Although the decrease in viscosity is almost the same for both surfactant and surfactant/polymer systems, the absolute values of the viscosity in the presence of polymer are by few orders of magnitude higher, which is due to the formation of a common network of entangled polymer and micellar chains. As a result, the added polymer allows one to get highly temperature responsive system that keeps viscoelastic properties in a much wider range of temperatures, which makes it very promising for various practical applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to add to}} {{the current}} knowledge available for miniemulsion polymerization reactions and to use this knowledge to synthesize multifunctional nanosized latex particles that have the potential to be used in catalysis. The physical properties of the latex can be adjusted to suit various environments due to the multiple functional groups present. For this research, styrene, pentafluorostyrene, azidomethyl styrene, pentafluorostyrene with azidomethyl styrene and pentafluorostyrene with styrene latexes were produced, and analyzed by dynamic light scattering. The latexes were synthesized using a miniemulsion polymerization technique found through this research. <b>Potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> and potassium 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 -nonafluorobutane- 1 -sulfonate were used as surfactants during the miniemulsion polymerization reaction to synthesize pentafluorostyrene with azidomethyl styrene latex. Transmission electron microscopy data and dynamic light scattering data have been collected to analyze the structure of this latex, and it has been synthesized using a number of conditions, differing in reaction time, surfactant amount and sonication methods. We have also improved the solubility of the latex through a copper(I) catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar azide-alkyne reaction, by clicking (polyethylene glycol) 5000 onto the azide functional groups...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus {{is known}} to form a biofilm and colonize on damaged skin of the hands. We {{investigated}} changes in the quantity of S aureus on the hands and changes in skin damage when using a hand-cleansing formulation with <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> but without a sanitizer (formulation A), which is highly effective in removing S aureus biofilm and causes minimal skin damage. Material and MethodsThe participants (14 medical staff members) used 2 types of hand-cleansing formulations (formulations A and B), each for 4 weeks. S aureus of the hands was cultured from swab samples on agar plates. Surface of hands was measured using an ultraviolet light microscope. Results and DiscussionThe quantity of S aureus after using formulation A for 4 weeks was 101. 08 [*]±[*] 0. 05 CFU/mL, a statistically significant decrease from the quantity of S aureus (101. 59 [*]±[*] 0. 19 [*]CFU/mL) just before use (P[*]=[*]. 029). Also, dryness of hand surfaces decreased. With formulation B, the quantity of S aureus did not significantly change from before to after use (P[*]>[*]. 05). This presumably occurs because formulation A gently removes S aureus biofilm.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} plant protection treatments on foliar infestation by Phytophthora infestans and on tuber yield {{were tested in}} field trials from 1999 to 2001 under organic farming conditions. Foliar treatments with plant extracts of Potentilla erecta, Salvia officinalis, seaweed extracts, <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate,</b> some other plant vigorisers and combinations with an adjuvant as well as copper hydroxide resulted in different Area Under Crop Health Curves and tuber yield increase. Experiments were conducted at an ecologically-managed farm in the North of Germany (near Hamburg) on a sandy soil or loamy sand (pH 5. 2 – 5. 7) {{with the possibility of}} sprinkler irrigation. In all field trials copper hydroxide showed the lowest AUCHC and the highest yield (+ 17. 7 - 25. 9 %) compared to the control. According to the application of plant extracts there was no significant effect on late blight infestation of leaves and the yield increase of up to 15 % was not significant. Also the seaweed extracts and the other plant vigorisers showed no significant effect on the AUCHC and the tuber yield. At the moment there is no effective alternative for the use of copper to reduce late blight infestation in organic potato production...|$|E
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} appearance and microstructure in the dilute {{corner of the}} ternary monoolein (MO) -sodium oleate (NaO) -water ((H 2 O) -H- 2) system have been investigated by visual inspection and by using direct structural imaging with light microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The microstructural transformations that take place between the micellar phase (binary NaO-(H 2 O) -H- 2 axis) and the dispersed cubic phase (binary MO-(H 2 O) -H- 2 axis) upon increasing the ratio of MO to NaO are micelles, ruptured multilamellar vesicles together with flexible threads, various vesicle structures, vesicles in equilibrium with densely packed layers that either represent bilayers or domains of H- I tubes visible from the side, and finally a pattern that may be either a cubic phase or domains of HII tubes visible in a cross section. Spontaneously formed uni- and multilamellar vesicles that show long-term stability {{are found to be}} the dominant structure for mixed dispersions over almost the entire concentration range. The addition of NaOH to the non-bilayer-forming system, the ternary MO-OA (oleic acid) -(H 2 O) -H- 2 system, leads to the fort-nation of vesicles. Vesicles were also observed in other ternary MO-aqueous-based systems with <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate,</b> cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium taurodeoxycholate, or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine instead of NaO.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{electrocardiography}} it was the recognized practice to place a patient's hands and left foot in three large saline pots. With the introduction of contact electrodes more than fifty years ago (James and Williams, 1910) and their later improvement by Cohn (1920), this ritual of partial immersion slowly gave way to swathing the limbs in bandages incorporating saline pads and malleable metal electrodes. Saline pads, however, brought new difficulties: bedclothes were liable to become moistened with saline in bedridden patients resulting in short-circuiting, and drying of the pads caused increasing skin resistance particularly during prolonged experimental observation. These disadvantages were overcome by Boas (1928) who dispensed with saline pads for the purpose of cardiotachometry. He found that two concave metal chest electrodes of one inch diameter filled with soft green soap as a contact material and tied to the chest by tapes gave consistently satisfactory tracings during three hours of continuous recording. Following this early demonstration that a simple contact medium, consisting of an almost neutral mixture of <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> and glycerine, could give acceptable electrical recordings of the heart beat, it later became fashionable in electrocardiography to use an abrasive electrode jelly or paste rich in sodium chloride.

40|$|Ever-stringent {{environmental}} constraints dictate that future coal cleaning technologies {{be compatible with}} micron-size particles. This research program seeks to develop an advanced coal cleaning technology uniquely suited to micron-size particles, i. e., aqueous biphase extraction. The partitioning behaviors of hematite in the dextran (Dex) /Triton X- 100 (TX 100) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) /dextran systems were investigated {{and the effects of}} some ionic surfactants on solid partition were studied. In both biphase systems, the particles stayed in the bottom dextran-rich phase under all pH conditions. This behavior is attributable {{to the fact that the}} hydrophilic oxide particles prefer the more hydrophilic bottom phase. Also, the strong favorable interaction between dextran and ferric oxide facilitates the dispersion of the solids in the polysaccharide-rich phase. In the Dex/TX 100 system, addition of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) or <b>potassium</b> <b>oleate</b> had no effect on the solid partition; on the other hand, addition of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) transferred the particles to the top phase or interface at high pH values. In the PEG/Dex system, the preferred location of hematite remained the bottom phase in the presence of either SDS or DTAB. The effects of anionic surfactants on the partition behavior are attributable to the fact that they are not able to replace the strongly adsorbed polysaccharide layer on the ferric oxide surface. The results with the cationic surfactant are due to electrostatic interaction between the cationic surfactant and the charged surface of the solid particles. The difference in solids partitioning in the two systems is the result of the different distribution of DTAB in these systems. In the Dex/TX 100 system, DTAB prefers the top surfactant-rich phase, while it concentrates in the bottom phase in the PEG/dextran system...|$|E
