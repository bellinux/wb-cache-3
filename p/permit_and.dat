5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles.

5|$|On 22 December 2007 the Central Electoral Commission {{turned down}} Bukovsky's application, {{on the grounds}} that (1) he had failed to give {{information}} about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents, (2) he was holding a British residence <b>permit,</b> <b>and</b> (3) he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years.

5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> halting the project in its tracks.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the {{basement}} of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he turned it into a showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> closed down.|$|E

5|$|Dutch records {{suggest that}} at least 453 civilians died during the battle, either {{as a result of}} Allied bombing on the first day or during the {{subsequent}} fighting. After the battle, the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> most did not return until after the war. The Dutch homes were then systematically looted, with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany. The Germans continued to fight Allied forces on the plains between Arnhem and Nijmegen, and the bridge that the 1st Airborne had fought so hard for was eventually destroyed by the Allies to deny German forces its use. On 7 October, it was bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. The buildings of Arnhem were heavily shelled by the Allies {{over the next few months}} and suffered further when the city was eventually liberated in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. And {{this raises the}} {{question}} whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and cultivate a particular place designated in the <b>permit,</b> <b>and</b> {{which was in the}} Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
