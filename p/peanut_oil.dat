5000|$|Most highly refined <b>peanut</b> <b>oils</b> {{remove the}} <b>peanut</b> allergens {{and have been}} shown to be safe for [...] "the vast {{majority}} of peanut-allergic individuals". However, cold-pressed <b>peanut</b> <b>oils</b> may not remove the allergens and thus could be highly dangerous to people with peanut allergy. Since the degree of processing for any particular product is often unclear, [...] "avoidance is prudent." [...] If quality control is neglected, peanuts that contain the mold that produces highly toxic aflatoxin can end up contaminating the oil derived from them.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, <b>peanut</b> <b>oil,</b> canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains <b>peanut</b> <b>oil.</b> Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{product was}} first {{prepared}} by Alberta farmer Joe St. Denis in July 2002 who {{noted that the}} brown pea had certain similarities to <b>peanuts.</b> <b>Oils</b> such as Canola and cottonseed are combined with icing sugar and mixed with crushed Solido brown peas to form the spread. Besides the absence of peanut material, Peabutter is devoid of gluten and cholesterol. A small amount of hydrogenated oil, a trans fat, is present.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of cooking oils from plant sources such as olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, canola oil (rapeseed oil), corn oil, <b>peanut</b> <b>oil</b> and other {{vegetable}} oils, as well as animal-based oils like butter and lard.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{particularly}} the American South, turkeys {{may also be}} deep fried in hot oil (often <b>peanut</b> <b>oil)</b> for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey {{has become something of}} a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel {{originated}} from experiments conducted by German scientist and inventor Rudolf Diesel for his compression-ignition engine he invented in 1892. Diesel originally designed his engine to use coal dust as fuel, and experimented with other fuels including vegetable oils, such as <b>peanut</b> <b>oil,</b> {{which was used}} to power the engines which he exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition and the 1911 World's Fair in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that these}} figures include {{industrial}} and animal feed use. The majority of European rapeseed oil production {{is used to}} produce biodiesel, or used directly as fuel in diesel cars which may require modification to heat the oil to reduce its higher viscosity. The suitability of the fuel should come as little surprise, as Rudolf Diesel originally designed his engine to run on <b>peanut</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, <b>peanut</b> <b>oil,</b> canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, <b>peanut</b> <b>oil,</b> canola oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E

25|$|Frying French fries in beef tallow, lard, {{or other}} animal fats adds {{saturated}} fat to the diet. Replacing animal fats with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing animal fats with partially hydrogenated oil reduces cholesterol but adds trans fat, {{which has been}} shown to both raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. Canola/Rapeseed oil, or sunflower-seed oil are also used, as are mixes of vegetable oils, but beef tallow is generally more popular, especially amongst fast food outlets that use communal oil baths. Accordingly, many restaurants now advertise their use of unsaturated oils; for example, both Five Guys and Chick-fil-A advertise that their fries are prepared with <b>peanut</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many Indian {{dishes are}} cooked in {{vegetable}} oil, but <b>peanut</b> <b>oil</b> is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India, and coconut oil {{along the western}} coast, especially in Kerala. Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma. In recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India. Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium. Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used frequently, though less than in the past. Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton {{tend to be the}} most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.|$|E

In many of these contaminated food products, the aflatoxin exceeded the safe limits of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or other regulatory agency.|$|R

2500|$|An ROC Navy tank {{landing ship}} (LST 210, Chung Lung (中榮)) was {{anchored}} near the PLA's landing site on October 25, and used its significant firepower (2x2 40mm guns, 6x1 40mm guns, 8x1 20mm guns) to destroy beached PLA landing craft, again made up mostly of wooden junks and fishing boats, during the battle. LST 210 {{was supposed to}} leave {{on the evening of}} October 24 after offloading its cargo, but remained, offering an official excuse of [...] "bad weather". The unmentioned real reason the ship remained in the area was that it was running a side business of smuggling brown sugar from Taiwan island in exchange for <b>peanut</b> <b>oil.</b> However, there was not enough <b>peanut</b> <b>oil</b> on the whole island for the deal, so the ship was forced to stay for another day while waiting for more <b>peanut</b> <b>oil</b> to be produced, making it the accidental hero of the battle.|$|E

The argan oil extracts were characterized in terms of acid, peroxide and iodine values, total tocopherol, carotene, and fatty acids content. Significant compositional differences were not observed between the oil samples obtained using different pressures and temperatures. The antioxidant capacity of the argan oil samples was high in comparison to those of walnut, almond, hazelnut, and <b>peanut</b> <b>oils</b> and {{comparable to that of}} pistachio oil. The physicochemical parameters of the extracted oils obtained by SFE, Soxhlet, and traditional methods are comparable.
