Both are weekly newspapers providing news via online {{as well and}} their headquarters {{are located in the}} neighborhood of Dongcheon-dong. The Gyeongju Sinmun was founded in 1989 and provides various news and critics on anything concerning Gyeongju. Its online newspaper, Digital Gyeongju Sinmun opened in December, 2000 to provide live local news out of the limit as a weekly newspaper and to establish mutual information exchanges from Gyeongju locals. In 2001, Gyeongju Sinmun started to present Gyeongju Citizen Awards to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> develop the local industry and economy, culture and education, and welfare service. Since 2003, the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant headquarter co-hosts the awards with Gyeongju Sinmun.|$|E

Even <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help or reason with him are just as likely to be killed by the inhuman fiend.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2013 SPIN {{magazine}} article—a reflection at the ten-year {{anniversary of}} Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was [...] "a sick man without his medicine" [...] {{during the last}} 31 days of his life, {{when he was not}} only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E

500|$|Dishonored {{takes place}} in the {{industrial}} city of Dunwall, where technology and otherworldly forces coexist. The city's design is modeled on London and Edinburgh between the late 1800s and the early 1900s. The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall, is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter. The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city. After a philosopher discovered that whale oil—known in the city as trans—can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption. The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as [...] "weepers", cry blood and can become violent. The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as [...] "Walls of Light", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a cosmetic touch, the hedges have proven to be an effective (though perhaps unintended) measure of crowd control. While not apparent in photos, the hedges are growing around a chain link fence which stops <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> push through to the field. [...] Even though a major traffic path to exit the stadium from both stands runs directly alongside the hedges, fans have only stormed the field and torn down the goalposts once in the entire history of Sanford Stadium. [...] This occurred after the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on Oct. 7, 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{award was}} criticised by some American and European Jewish groups, while other groups offered {{support for the}} award. Parties opposed to the award {{included}} AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, the European Jewish Congress, and John R. Bolton. John R. Bolton, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that those in the administration who recommended her either ignored her anti-Israel history, or missed it entirely. On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organizations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated [...] "as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, {{we do not see}} such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award." [...] In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was “surprised and dismayed” and that [...] "this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,” “I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to be on the side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,” Robinson said. [...] "There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism," [...] Robinson also said. In an open letter to Robinson, Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticize her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. [...] "You {{may not have been the}} chief culprit of the Durban debacle, but you will always be its preeminent symbol", he added. When asked about the opposition to the award by AIPAC and other Jewish groups, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied [...] "Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland, and she is somebody whom we are honoring as a prominent crusader of women's rights in Ireland and throughout the world." ...|$|E

Evidently they had been {{overlooked}} by the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help.|$|E
60|$|Every {{twenty-four hours}} in the year Dr. Barnardo snatches nine waifs from the streets; so the {{enormous}} field he has to work in may be comprehended. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help have something to learn from him. He does not play with palliatives. He traces social viciousness and misery to their sources. He removes the progeny of the gutter-folk from their pestilential environment, and gives them a healthy, wholesome environment in which to be pressed and prodded and moulded into men.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help, who {{gather up}} the Ghetto {{children}} {{and send them}} away on a day's outing to the country, believe that not very many children reach the age of ten without having {{had at least one}} day there. Of this, a writer says: [...] "The mental change caused by one day so spent must not be undervalued. Whatever the circumstances, the children learn the meaning of fields and woods, so that descriptions of country scenery in the books they read, which before conveyed no impression, become now intelligible." ...|$|E
50|$|George Brown was {{a notable}} {{personality}} and powerful communicator and was widely sought as an after-dinner speaker, on which occasions {{he could be}} informative as well as witty, spicing his speeches with many amusing anecdotes.

6000|$|One day in {{the fields}} and woods, if they are lucky enough to be picked up by the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help!

And {{for the rest of the}} days, as the boy told a certain bishop, [...] "At ten we 'ops the wag; at {{thirteen}} we nicks things; an' at sixteen we bashes the copper." [...] Which is to say, at ten they play truant, at thirteen steal, and at sixteen are sufficiently developed hooligans to smash the policemen.|$|E
60|$|Concerning the {{futility}} of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help, I wish to make one notable, noble exception, namely, the Dr. Barnardo Homes. Dr. Barnardo is a child-catcher. First, he catches them when they are young, before they are set, hardened, in the vicious social mould; and then he sends them away {{to grow up and}} be formed in another and better social mould. Up to date he has sent out of the country 13,340 boys, most of them to Canada, and not one in fifty has failed. A splendid record, when it is considered that these lads are waifs and strays, homeless and parentless, jerked out from the very bottom of the Abyss, and forty-nine out of fifty of them made into men.|$|E
60|$|The old Englishman and his daughters, in the {{opposite}} balcony, must have seen something unutterably absurd in the sculptor's deportment, poring into this whirlpool of nonsense so earnestly, in quest {{of what was to}} make his life dark or bright. Earnest <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get a reality out of human existence, are necessarily absurd {{in the view of the}} revellers and masqueraders. At all events, after a good deal of mirth at the expense of his melancholy visage, the fair occupants of the balcony favored Kenyon with a salvo of confetti, which came rattling about him like a hailstorm. Looking up instinctively, he was surprised to see the abbate in the background lean forward and give a courteous sign of recognition.|$|E
