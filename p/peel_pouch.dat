40|$|BBL ™ CultureSwab ™ Plus are sterile {{ready-to-use}} systems {{intended for}} the collection, transport and preservation of clinical specimens for bacteriological examination. SUMMARY AND PRINCIPLES One of the routine procedures in the diagnosis of bacterial infections involves the collection and safe transportation of a clinical specimen from the patient to the laboratory. This can be accomplished using the BBL CultureSwab Plus collection and transport device. Each BBL CultureSwab Plus unit is comprised of a sterile <b>peel</b> <b>pouch</b> containing a rayon-tipped swab applicator used to collect the sample and a tube containing transport medium into which the swab applicator is placed after sampling. The BBL CultureSwab Plus are available with Amies Medium Without Charcoal and Amies Medium With Charcoal. These transport media are non-nutritious, buffered with phosphate and provide a reduced environment, due to their formulation with sodium thioglycollate. 1 Organisms in the sample material are protected from drying by moisture in the transport medium. The medium is designed to maintain the viability of organisms during transit to the laboratory. Survival of fastidious bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be prolonged due {{to the presence of}} charcoal in Amies Medium With Charcoal. BBL CultureSwab Plus pouches are made of a plastic film which retards the penetration of atmospheric ai...|$|E
40|$|BD ™ Universal Viral Transport System is {{intended}} for the collection and transport of clinical specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas from the collection site to the testing laboratory. This system can be processed using standard clinical laboratory operating procedures for viral, chlamydial, mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal culture. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION One of the routine procedures in the diagnosis of infections caused by viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas involves the collection and safe transportation of biological samples. This can be accomplished using the BD Universal Viral Transport System. This system includes a universal transporting medium that is room temperature stable, which can sustain viability (and infectivity) of a plurality of organisms that include clinically important viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas during transit to the testing laboratory. The formulation of BD Universal Viral Transport medium includes protein for stabilization, antibiotics to minimize bacterial and fungal contamination, and a buffer to maintain a neutral pH. BD Universal Viral Transport System is provided with labeled capture-cap vials designed for transport of the clinical sample. This system is also supplied as a sample collection kit that comprises a package containing one capture-cap vial of medium and a <b>peel</b> <b>pouch</b> incorporating sterile polyester or nylon flocked specimen collection swabs, wit...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} (HP) kinetics of {{the microbial}} destruction {{and changes in}} the physicochemical characteristics of milk and pork were studied. Raw milk samples containing indigenous microflora of approximately 106 CFU/mL were heat sealed in dual <b>peel</b> sterilization <b>pouches</b> and subjected to HP treatment from 150 [...] 400 MPa with holding times ranging 5 [...] 120 min. The kinetic parameters (rate constant, k and decimal reduction time, D) for the microorganisms, alkaline phosphatase, color and viscosity were evaluated, based on first order kinetics and the pressure dependence of kinetic parameters was evaluated using pressure destruction time (PDT) and Arrhenius models. Kinetic data was well described by the first order model (R 2 > 0. 90). The application of pressure pulse was explored for pressure destruction of microorganisms as well as changes in physical-chemical characteristics of pork chops. Pork chops (2 days post-rigor) were subjected to HP treatment from 200 [...] 350 MPa for 0 [...] 120 min. Results showed that pressure changes of pork variables followed a dual effect consisting of an instantaneous pressure kill (IPK) with the application of pressure pulse (no holding) and a subsequent first order rate of destruction during the pressure hold time. The IPK values were pressure dependent and increased with pressure level. Parameters k and D indicated a higher rate of pressure destruction of microorganisms compared to quality attributes. Kinetics of pressure destruction of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A were studied in relation to those of indigenous microorganism of milk and pork. The IPK was more pronounced with L. monocytogenes than with indigenous microflora. However, the kinetic parameters (k and D values) indicated a larger pressure resistance for L. monoctyogenes. HP processes were developed based on the standard plate count (SPC) kinetic data for indigenous microflora of milk as well as L. monocytogenes in milk and pork. The results showed that SPC kinetics permitted good estimation of microbial destruction in low pressure-lethality processes of milk and pork but its application at higher pressure-lethality levels were inaccurate. On the other hand, processes established based an destruction of L. monocytogenes were more predictable. Pressure pulse application to microbial lethality was also well predicted. The shelf-life of milk and pork increased with the level of applied pressure lethality, but Q 10 values suggested that low storage temperature was nevertheless required to control microbial growth and maintain quality. Storage of HP treated park offered some improvement in the texture but resulted in large color changes and drip losses. L. monocytogenes were not detected in any of the stored milk samples HP treated to achieve a lethality ≥ 10 D...|$|R
