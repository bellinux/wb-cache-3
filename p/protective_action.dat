Only {{a few studies}} have analyzed risk perception of and <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> to technological threats. Mileti and Peek (2000) reviewed the process of forming perceptions and how this process affects public response to warnings of a nuclear power plant emergency. The authors found that the formation of risk perception is guided by the stimulations, cues, and so on that people secure from their environment (for example, warning information), and that this risk perception formation leads to <b>protective</b> <b>actions.</b> This process is not different than that found for other types of hazard agents (Mileti and Peek 2000).

25|$|On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan {{published}} its {{views on}} the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents. Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent <b>Protective</b> <b>Action</b> Planning Zones, or UPZ. This definition was {{in line with the}} emergency response requirements proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate {{in the event of an}} accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more than the present figure.|$|E

The guard at Peking and along the route to the sea was maintained until 1941. In 1927, the United States had 5,670 troops ashore in China and 44 naval vessels in its waters.

INTENT The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this regulatory issue summary (RIS) to endorse the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) guidance titled “Range of <b>Protective</b> <b>Actions</b> for Nuclear Power Plant Incidents, April 2005, ” as an acceptable range of early-phase <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> that licensees may use {{in the event of}} a nuclear power plant incident. This RIS requires no action or written response on the part of addressees. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 50. 47 (b) (10), requires, in part, that licensees develop a range of <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> for the public in the plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ). Also, 10 CFR 50. 47 (b) (10) requires that guidelines for the choice of <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, be developed and in place. Section III, “The Final Safety Analysis Report, ” of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 requires that plans for coping with emergencies contain information to provide assurance of coordination among the supporting groups and with the licensee. Therefore, changes to a licensee’s emergency plan related to <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> should be coordinated with the offsite response organizations. In this context, “coordinated ” means that the licensee has contacted offsite response organizations and informed them of the proposed change. ML 050870432 RIS 2005 - 08 Page 2 of 3 Due to the varied options in existing Federal guidance related to <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> that may be taken {{in the event of a}} nuclear power plant accident, NEI developed the attached guidance to summarize a range of early-phase <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> that may be used for nuclear power plant incidents.

The present study examines B-SAFER assessments conducted by police employees, related <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> and repeat IPV crimes in order to study: 1) to what extent risk- and victim vulnerability factors in the B-SAFER predicted global risk assessments, 2) the predictive accuracy of each B-SAFER item and the global risk assessments with regard to repeat IPV, 3) to what extent recommended <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> were implemented and 4) the preventive effect of the implemented <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> on repeat IPV.

This finding is consistent with an earlier study on households’ immediate response to the 2009 American Samoa earthquake and tsunami (Lindell et al. 2015). The authors also found that people did not leave immediately after the earthquake shaking but attempted to obtain additional information, packed an emergency kit, or protected property.

Furthermore, a relatively large group of respondents (32.4 %) continued their normal activities after perceiving the Natech accident.

40|$|Interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) {{has been}} {{reported}} to stimulate prostaglandin synthesis by the rat stomach in vitro and to inhibit gastric acid secretion in vivo. We have therefore tested the hypothesis that IL- 1 beta might have <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> in experimental models of gastroduodenal ulceration. IL- 1 beta, given i. p., dose and time dependently reduced the severity of ethanol-induced gastric damage. A pretreatment time of 90 min was found to produce the greatest reduction of damage, while doses of 0. 1 micrograms/kg or greater were found to produce significant effects. The <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> of IL- 1 beta were abolished by prior boiling or by pretreatment of the animals with indomethacin, and were not shared by the nonapeptide fragment 163 - 171. IL- 1 beta also reduced the severity of gastric damage induced by indomethacin and the duodenal ulceration induced by cysteamine. The results indicate that IL- 1 beta has <b>protective</b> <b>actions</b> in three separate experimental models of gastroduodenal ulceration. The mechanism of action of IL- 1 beta is not entirely clear, but contributions of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis and inhibition of gastric acid secretion cannot be excluded...|$|R
