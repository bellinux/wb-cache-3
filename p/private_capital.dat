5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from <b>private</b> <b>capital</b> markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional <b>private</b> <b>capital.</b> A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from <b>private</b> <b>capital.</b> Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E
5|$|To {{facilitate}} the colonial expeditions, the Brandenburg African Company {{was founded on}} 7 March 1682, initially with its headquarters in Berlin and its shipyards in Pillau, since 1683 in Emden. Throughout its existence, the company was underfunded, and expeditions were financed also by <b>private</b> <b>capital,</b> including payments by Raule and Frederick William. In July 1682, an expedition under East Prussian Otto Friedrich von der Groeben was sent to Guinea to erect the fortress Großfriedrichsburg. On 24 February 1684, another treaty with indigenous chiefs was signed that allowed the erection of a second fort in nearby Accada (now Akwida), named Dorotheenschanze after Frederick William's second wife. On 4 February 1685, a treaty was signed with the chiefs of Taccararay (now Takoradi), some 30 kilometers east of Großfriedrichsburg. A fourth fort was built at a spring {{near the village of}} Taccrama, between Großfriedrichsburg and Dorotheenschanze, named Loge or Sophie-Louise-Schanze. Overall, the colony comprised roughly 50 kilometers of coastline, and did not extend into the hinterland.|$|E

40|$|Venture Capital firms (VCs), {{compared}} with other sources of financing, {{are known to be}} a value-adding source of finance for high-growth entrepreneurial firms. Venture capital has transitioned from a local to an international subject in recent years. In this thesis, I address three important aspects of the international venture capital research area. In the first essay, I answer these questions: do venture capital firms decide to invest in a cross-border company based solely on their own international experience, or do they also decide based on other venture capital firms’ behaviour in investing in that country? I address these questions by investigating vicarious and experiential learning in the venture capital context, focusing on US cross-border venture capital investment data from 2000 to 2013. The analysis indicates that, on average, venture capital firms use both experiential and vicarious learning strategies in making their cross-border investment decisions. Moreover, the effect of experiential learning is greater than that of vicarious learning, and a venture capital firm’s size moderates this effect. In the second essay, I answer this question: do government venture capital funds crowd-in or crowd-out international <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> investment? The crowding-in effect arises when international <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> benefits from government subsidies through the enhancement of an entrepreneurial ecosystem and investment syndication. The crowding-out effect arises when government venture <b>capital</b> competes with <b>private</b> venture <b>capital,</b> bidding up deal prices and lowering returns, thereby spurring local private venture capitalists to invest internationally. I examine data from 26 countries from 1998 to 2013. The analysis indicates that, on average, more mixed-structured government venture capital investments than pure-structured government investments in a country crowds-in domestic and foreign private venture capitalists internationally. Moreover, the effect of both structures is greater on domestic private venture capitalists than on foreign ones. In the third essay, I investigate whether government venture capital practices in Canada promote a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem, by analyzing the effect of these practices on domestic and cross-border venture <b>capital</b> investments by <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> firms separately. I research the following two questions in parallel: a) Does Canadian government venture <b>capital</b> investment attract <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> firms to invest in the domestic market? b) Does Canadian government venture capital investment lead to, or prevent, domestic <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> firms from investing in other countries? I find that Canadian government venture capital investment has no measurable impact on <b>private</b> venture <b>capital</b> firms’ decisions to invest in the domestic market. I also find that certain of the Canadian government’s venture capital programs have displaced <b>private</b> venture <b>capital,</b> although with negligible impact, towards cross-border VC markets, primarily to the United States...|$|R

Less than three years ago, the nation’s tourism budget was U.S. $400,000; today, it is over $2 million. Nicaragua's economy has also produced a construction boom, the majority of which is in and around Managua.|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} effects of inflows of <b>private</b> foreign <b>capital</b> on some major macroeconomic variables in India using quarterly data for the period 1993 - 99. The analyses of trends in <b>private</b> foreign <b>capital</b> inflows and some other variables indicate instability. Whereas net inflows of <b>private</b> foreign <b>capital</b> (FINV), foreign currency assets, wholesale price index, money supply, real and nominal effective exchange rates and exports follow an I(1) process, current account deficit is the only series that follows I(0). Cointegration test confirms the presence of long-run equilibrium relationships between a few pairs of variables. But the dependence of each I(1) variable on FINV invalidates such cointegration except in two cases: cointegration exists between foreign currency assets and money supply and between nominal effective exchange rate and exports, even after controlling for FINV. The Granger Causality Test shows unidirectional causality from FINV to nominal effective exchange rates- both trade-based and export-based-, which raises concern about the RBI strategy in the foreign exchange market. Finally, instability in the trend of foreign currency assets could be partially explained by the instability in FINV with some lagged effect.
