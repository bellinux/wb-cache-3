5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and <b>parturition</b> take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman <b>parturition</b> occurs year-round with a peak in spring. <b>Parturition</b> also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and <b>parturition</b> can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and <b>parturition</b> lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after <b>parturition.</b> Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{observations}} {{were conducted on}} 20 calves (10 bull calves and 10 heifer calves). The first series of observations {{was made in the}} first 4 days of life, and the second after a month (within 30 to 33 days of calving). Time from birth to first unassisted standing (standing on all extended legs) ranged from 16 minutes (heifers) to 158 minutes (bulls) for normal calving. Calves born from normal <b>parturitions</b> stood up after an average of 81 minutes and those born from difficult <b>parturitions</b> after 302 minutes. Calves that required assistance at calving showed shorter standing and longer lying time.

5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males {{may have a}} black patch {{on the head and}} the neck. Young are precocial - they can stand on their own soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of <b>parturition.</b> Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, <b>parturition</b> is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (<b>parturition)</b> occurs over a six-month period.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common threshers are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and <b>parturition</b> occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small embryos are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues. As the embryos mature, their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape, though they remain depressed and hidden until shortly before birth.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{of females}} in {{southern}} Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by {{two years of}} age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though in a few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after <b>parturition.</b> Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After <b>parturition,</b> the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} measure the {{productive}} and reproductive performance of does managed to have three mating seasons in two consecutive years, under an agro-ecological system in the semi-arid region of Brazil. At each mating season, an average of 57 non-defined genotype does were mated to two bucks. During the rainy season, animals were kept in Caatinga vegetation, while in the dry season they were maintained in buffel grass pastures. Average kidding interval (period between two <b>parturitions)</b> was 8. 4 months, kidding rate (does that delivered kids/exposed does) was 55. 4 %, prolificacy (kids born/kidding does) was 1. 82, weaning rate (kids weaned/kids born) was 81. 8 %, and average liveweight production at 240 days was 11. 60 kg/exposed doe. Kids born in February/March (MS 3) had a greater (p< 0. 05) bodyweight at birth, and {{at the age of}} 30 and 90 days than kids born in July/August (MS 1) or May/June (MS 2). The bodyweight at 240 days (16. 3 ± 0. 7 vs. 12. 7 ± 0. 8) and total weight gain (13. 4 ± 0. 7 vs. 10. 1 ± 0. 7) were greater (p< 0. 05) in MS 3 than MS 2, respectively. A kidding interval of 8. 4 months (1. 4 <b>parturitions.</b> doe. year) is technically feasible and has the potential to improve the annual productive performance of goats in the semi-arid region of Brazil...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Data {{on human}} natality, {{stillbirth}} and perinatal mortality from Switzerland (1979 - 1987), available in four birthweight categories, are reexamined to assess any about-weekly (circaseptan) {{and changes in}} about-daily (circadian) patterns in central Europe over {{a century and a}} halfDESIGN.

Exogenous variations, prominent in early extrauterine life, such as changes of scheduling in obstetrics, may contribute to circadian and cireaseptan natality patterns. Information on these patterns serves in the optimization of neonatal care. Partly endogenous, partly physical environmental aspects, at least of about-weekly patterns, remain to be elucidated in series consisting exclusively of spontaneous <b>parturitions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Retrospective {{analysis}} of third degree perineal lacerations in 7 female camels (6 - 17 yrs of age) that were surgically corrected by one stage repair (Goetz technique) is presented.

Dehiscence of perineal structure occurred in only one camel due to infection and healed by second intention. Subsequent matings resulted in pregnancy in four camels and one camel died due to unrelated causes. We conclude that perineal lacerations can occur in primiparous camels with difficult assisted deliveries and that one stage repair of perineal lacerations in camels improves the perineal conformation and such camels may easily regain normal fertility...|$|R
5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. <b>Parturition</b> occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During <b>parturition,</b> the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of <b>parturition</b> and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the dynamics of infection by gastrointestinal nematodes during the periparturition period in cows. One hundred and six beef cows {{were divided into two}} groups: G I was formed by 42 cows of one and two <b>parturitions,</b> and G 2 by 76 cows of three or more <b>parturitions.</b> From the 120 days pre partum until the 90 days post partum, feces were collected for faecal egg counts (EPG) while blood was collected to determine the packed cell volume and hemoglobin levels of each animal, with monthly intervals. In the same intervals the body condition scores (BCS) were evaluated. The mean values standard deviation of the EPG for Cl were equal to 19. 4 +/- 42. 9, and for G 2 31. 1 +/- 68. 0. No significant differences were observed between Cl and G 2 in relation to EPC; and hematological parameters, which remained within normal patterns for both groups. The two groups had higher counts of EPG in the post partum period than in the pre partum period, with averages of 32. 5 +/- 55. 5 and 51. 5 +/- 84. 8 for groups Cl and G 2, respectively. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) in the parameters was observed when comparing the pre and post partum within each group studied resulting in declining values of blood and body score and an increase in EPG in the post partum. The results suggest that the cows may be more susceptible to infection by nematodes from giving birth up to 90 days post partum. However, adult cows, when well-managed, are not an important factor in the epidemiology of gastrointestinal nematodes, even in the post partum period...|$|R
