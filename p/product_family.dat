5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series <b>product</b> <b>family</b> (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series <b>product</b> <b>family</b> after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The <b>product</b> <b>family</b> was discontinued later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{main focus}} of product brand {{management}} lies on the single product or <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> Product design management is linked to research and development, marketing, and brand management, and {{is present in the}} fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. It is responsible for the visual expressions of the individual product brand, with its diverse customer–brand touch points and the execution of the brand through design.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became {{chairman}} and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO. Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division {{headed by a}} former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia. Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives {{to focus on the}} company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system. Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts. The SSL/VPN Pulse <b>product</b> <b>family</b> was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, {{three new}} {{products}} were introduced for {{small and medium-sized}} businesses (SMBs) with 50, 100 or 250 users in bundles with Websense and Secure Computing. This was followed by a second generation of the ProxySG <b>product</b> <b>family,</b> which added security features for instant messaging. A review in eWeek said the new ProxySG line was effective and easy to deploy, but the ongoing maintenance fees were expensive. In 2005 Blue Coat announced an anti-spyware appliance called Spyware Interceptor and the following year it announced upcoming WAN optimization products. This was followed by SSL-VPN security appliances to secure remote connections.|$|E

25|$|On {{the more}} {{traditional}} business side, Cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise-focused routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product lines, prompting the company to morph the successful Catalyst 6500 Ethernet switch into all-purpose Cisco 7600 routing platform. However, limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR9000 <b>product</b> <b>family</b> intended to consolidate company's carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip-based hardware and IOS-XR. Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition—one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks that resulted in ASR5000 product line.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the company}} started adding IT {{security}} features. By early 2002, CacheFlow {{was on the}} fifth version of its operating system. The Security Gateway 600/6000 Series was the company's newest <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> It had a range of security features, such as authentication, internet use policies, virus scanning, content filtering, and bandwidth restrictions for streaming video applications. Network Computing tested a beta appliance {{and gave it a}} positive review. Later that year, the company was renamed to Blue Coat Systems to focus on security appliances and simultaneously released the SG800. The appliance sat behind corporate firewalls to filter website traffic for viruses, malware, worms and other harmful software. It had a custom operating system called Security Gateway and provided many of its security features through partners, like Symantec and Trend Micro. An InfoWorld review gave it an 8.4 out of 10.|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} {{face the}} challenge of outsourcing to low-cost countries. Still, many managers seem to be uncertain about (1) which inputs should be selected for this exercise; (2) which countries are preferred; and (3) whether to deal directly with suppliers or through a local distributor or agent. This paper deals with these three aspects in offering a practical and tested method, derived from theory. In each of four steps, inputs are filtered out that are less suitable for sourcing from low-cost countries. Step 1 clusters all of the hundreds of inputs into 50 - 90 <b>product</b> <b>families.</b> A portfolio analysis of the resulting <b>product</b> <b>families</b> in Step 2 enables differentiation in the nature of goods and services acquired and their supplier relationship characteristics. In this step, unique products and low volume, low-value inputs are filtered out. In Step 3, managers score the remaining <b>product</b> <b>families</b> on operationalized process- and product characteristics. Based on these scores, <b>product</b> <b>families</b> are assigned to four categories: (1) "Global Sourcing" or direct offshoring; (2) "Source Global, Buy Local" or indirect offshoring - for example produced in China but bought through a local agent/distributor; (3) "Buy Regional" or nearshoring; and (4) "Vicinity Buying. " Step 4 compares the present total costs of <b>product</b> <b>families</b> with the potential total costs after a switch toward the proposed areas. A case study revealed a significant potential for reduction in total costs for selected <b>product</b> <b>families.</b> In practice, the method serves three ends: (1) it clarifies the various product- and process characteristics that are perceived as important by stakeholders involved; (2) it guides the selection process of potential <b>product</b> <b>families</b> and potential areas in a structured way; and (3) it makes visible the financial results of alternatives to the present way of sourcing...|$|R

500|$|In September 2004, Juniper {{entered the}} market for {{enterprise}} access routers with three routers that were {{the first of the}} J-series <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market. Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was [...] "the first serious threat" [...] to competing products from Cisco. Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.|$|E

Apple {{introduced}} an emulator {{during the transition}} from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), {{much as it did}} during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. [...] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.|$|E
