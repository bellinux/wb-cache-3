5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{agriculture}} records the domestication of <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively.

5|$|The <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> which live on Solsbury Hill {{reflect the}} habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals,</b> {{some of which}} are rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along {{the length of the}} eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} of <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle {{aids in the}} dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E

5|$|Well before Linnaeus, <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> were {{considered}} separate Kingdoms.

5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir.

Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
