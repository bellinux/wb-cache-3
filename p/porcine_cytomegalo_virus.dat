40|$|Decreased {{responses}} to antigens and lectins are a characteristic feature of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from {{patients with the}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The in vitro addition of recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) to cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from patients with AIDS resulted in an augmented proliferative response [(3 H]thymidine uptake) to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and an enrichment in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. In AIDS cultures stimulated with PHA, IFN-gamma increased the release of T-cell growth factors and enhanced the expression of interleukin- 2 receptors on activated lymphocytes.

Anti-coxsackie B 1 - 5 IgM responses were detected in 14 of 44 (32 %) of the islet cell antibody-positive subjects and in 7 of 44 (16 %) control subjects. This difference did not reach the level of statistical significance. None of the islet cell antibody-positive subjects had specific IgM antibodies to mumps, rubella, or cytomegalovirus. There was also no increase in the prevalence or the mean titres of anti-mumps-IgG or IgA and anti-cytomegalovirus-IgG in islet cell antibody-positive subjects compared to control subjects.

40|$|Introduction Microarray (or DNA chip) -based {{hybridisation}} analyses using {{high density}} DNA probe arrays {{is a powerful}} tool for a broad and diverse set of genetic applications, including gene expression monitoring, sequence information, and genotype analysis (see, for example, Chipping Forecast, 1999).

A good starting point for finding out more about this rapidly developing field is the web site: www. gene-chips. com To study the difference in gene expression between two samples, each gene is placed as a spot on a glass slide, and the slide is then hybridized with the two samples, each labelled with a fluorescent marker.

40|$|Background: In inmunocompetent hosts, {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) {{infection is}} generally asymptomatic. It may however present as infectious mononucleosis.

Other probable causes of acute hepatitis were ruled out and none had any clinical stigmata of cirrhosis. All the three patients underwent uneventful recovery.

40|$|The {{process of}} viral {{infection}} {{has been shown}} to be a tightly structured process that exerts precise control over the nucleus. By quantitatively documenting the dynamic nuclear changes in response to nuclear infection of cells suspended in a three-dimensional collagen matrix, an understanding of nuclear reorganization can be elucidated from the tissue. Tissues were cultured in vitro in three dimensional collagen matrices which act as scaffolding that mimics the native environment. The cells were then infected with <b>cytomegalo</b> <b>virus</b> (CMV) which was labeled with green fluorescent protein to allow identification of the virus. During viral infection, nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) was employed to nondestructively image the nuclear volume over time. Comparing changes in the nuclear volume with control values, we expected to identify several stages of nuclear reorganization that have previously been identified during infection of 2 D tissue cultures. Once it has been demonstrated that NLOM can be successfully used to track dynamics of infection, multiple mutant fluorescent proteins can be used to track host, virus and immune response to viral infection...|$|R

This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of human herpes viruses (CMV, HSV 2, EBV- 1, VZV) antibodies and to evaluate their association with age, sex as well as other demographic and behavioral factors. Results A study of 200 HIV positive patients from Eastern India attending the Calcutta Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, West Bengal, Apex Clinic, Calcutta Medical College Hospital and ART Center, School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, West Bengal was done.

This study was to evaluate the prevalence of CMV in pregnant women attending Antenatal Clinics at Maryam Abacha Women and Children Hospital (MAWCH) and Sokoto Specialist Hospital (SSH). The study enrolled 90 pregnant women (age range: 16 - 45 years old) and data on demographic and life styles obtained using structured questionnaire. Serum samples were assayed using CMV Ig-G EIA kit.

Materials & Methods: This study included 68 children and adolescents who were classified into two groups. GroupI comprised 53 patients diagnosed with T 1 D and having regular follow up in the pediatric endocrinology out-patient clinic, Minia University children's hospital. Group II comprised 15 apparently healthy subjects, age and sex matched to the diseased group. According to the onset of diabetes, we divided the diabetic group into two sub-groups.

40|$|A basic {{principle}} of immunology is that prior immunity results in complete protection against a homologous agent. In this study, {{we show that}} memory T cells specific to unrelated viruses may alter the host 2 ̆ 7 s primary immune response to a second virus. Studies with a panel of heterologous viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), Pichinde (PV), vaccinia (VV), and murine <b>cytomegalo</b> (MCMV) <b>viruses</b> showed that prior immunity {{with one of these}} viruses in many cases enhanced clearance of a second unrelated virus early in infection. Such protective immunity was common, but it depended on the virus sequence and was not necessarily reciprocal. Cell transfer studies showed that both CD 4 and CD 8 T cell populations from LCMV-immune mice were required to transfer protective immunity to naive hosts challenged with PV or VV. In the case of LCMV-immune versus naive mice challenged with VV, there was an enhanced early recruitment of memory phenotype interferon (IFN) gamma-secreting CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells into the peritoneal cavity and increased IFN-gamma levels in this initial site of virus replication. Studies with IFN-gamma receptor knockout mice confirmed a role for IFN-gamma in mediating the protective effect by LCMV-immune T cell populations when mice were challenged with VV but not PV. In some virus sequences memory cell populations, although clearing the challenge virus more rapidly, elicited enhanced IFN-gamma-dependent immunopathogenesis in the form of acute fatty necrosis. These results indicate that how a host responds to an infectious agent is a function of its history of previous infections and their influence on the memory T cell pool...|$|R

The incidence of positive sera increased with age from about 30 % in childhood to > 90 % in adults. Fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated human γ-globulins were suitable for direct staining of the same proportion of cells. The stained cells appeared to be in varying stages of degeneration, but cultural conditions leading to an increase in the cellular death rates failed to result in a rise in fluorescent cells. Several observations suggest that the stainable cells might be those which are seen to harbor virus particles under the electron microscope.
