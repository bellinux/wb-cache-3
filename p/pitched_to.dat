5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, Insomniac Games began development of Sunset Overdrive. The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl, I Am Legend, The Young One, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset Overdrive was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later <b>pitched</b> <b>to</b> various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later <b>pitched</b> <b>to</b> Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. Sunset Overdrive was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration.

He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then <b>pitched</b> <b>to</b> the writers for development.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, a left-handed {{specialist}} (also {{known as}} lefty specialist) is a relief pitcher who throws left-handed and specializes in <b>pitching</b> <b>to</b> left-handed batters, weak right-handed batters, and switch-hitters who bat poorly right-handed. Because baseball practices permanent substitution, these pitchers frequently <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> {{a very small}} number of batters in any given game (often only one), and rarely <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> strictly right-handed batters. Most Major League Baseball (MLB) teams have several left-handed pitchers on their rosters, at least one of whom is a left-handed specialist. A left-handed specialist is sometimes called a LOOGY (or Lefty One-Out GuY), a term that can be used pejoratively and which was coined by John Sickels.|$|R
