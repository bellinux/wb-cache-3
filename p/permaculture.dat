5|$|At {{the global}} level the {{environmental}} impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming. At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production, more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including <b>permaculture,</b> urban horticulture, local food, slow food, sustainable gardening, and organic gardening.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (<b>permaculture,</b> green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local <b>permaculture</b> enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
25|$|Principles and Pathways offers twelve key <b>permaculture</b> design principles, each {{explained}} in separate chapters. It {{is regarded as}} a major landmark in <b>permaculture</b> literature, especially as the seminal work, Bill Mollison's Permaculture: A Designer's Manual (1988) was published fifteen years previously and has never been revised.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} in December 2002 {{of a new}} major work on <b>permaculture,</b> saw a deeper and more accessible systematisation {{of the principles of}} <b>permaculture</b> refined by Holmgren over more than 25 years of practice. The book, Permaculture: Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability (2002a), is dedicated to Howard T. Odum, who died two months before its publication, and it owes much to Odum's vision of a world in energy transition.|$|E
25|$|David Holmgren (born 1955) is an Australian {{environmental}} designer, ecological {{educator and}} writer. He {{is best known}} as one of the co-originators of the <b>permaculture</b> concept with Bill Mollison.|$|E
25|$|Antioch College {{also has}} a college farm. The farm {{contains}} a large crop growing area, a hoop house, and pasture for sheep and chickens. The farm {{is used as a}} living laboratory where Antioch students learn about sustainable farming methods such as organic farming and <b>permaculture.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Holmgren {{moved to}} Tasmania {{to study at}} the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education, Dept. of Environmental Design. In the {{alternative}} education environment there he chose to study landscape design, ecology and agriculture and, during a close association with Bill Mollison, developed the <b>Permaculture</b> concept.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of large}} {{industrial}} monoculture that {{is common in}} industrialized agriculture, typically for feed crops such as corn and soy, is more damaging to ecosystems than more sustainable farming practices such as organic farming, <b>permaculture,</b> arable, pastoral, and rain-fed agriculture. Other concerns include the wasting of natural resources, such as food and water.|$|E
25|$|Microgeneration can be {{integrated}} {{as part of a}} self-sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems (<b>permaculture</b> and agroecosystem), rainwater harvesting, composting toilets or even complete greywater treatment systems. Domestic microgeneration technologies include: photovoltaic solar systems, small-scale wind turbines, micro combined heat and power installations, biodiesel and biogas.|$|E
25|$|The One-Straw Revolution {{has been}} {{translated}} into over 20 languages and sold {{more than one million}} copies and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees, such as Akinori Kimura, David Mas Masumoto and Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, and has significantly influenced alternative movements in the West, such as <b>permaculture.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paganism {{generally}} {{emphasizes the}} sanctity of the Earth and Nature. Pagans often feel a duty to protect the Earth through activism, and support causes such as rainforest protection, organic farming, <b>permaculture,</b> animal rights and so on. Some pagans are influenced by Animist traditions of the indigenous Native Americans and Africans and other indigenous or shamanic traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} a large {{greenhouse}} on the west side, {{which serves as a}} living classroom for four-season, organic gardening methods and environmental science. The school's facilities are geared towards sustainability and include a rainwater catchment system, a solar-powered water system for the greenhouse, edible landscaping and recycling and composting programs. In 2004, the greenhouse won the Organic Silver Award from the Rodale Institute for its <b>permaculture</b> style of gardening.|$|E
25|$|The UMass Amherst {{campus is}} known for its sustainability. In 2010 the UMass Climate Action Plan (CAP) was approved, which {{documented}} the campus’ plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2011 UMass Amherst became one of the four colleges to receive a gold star from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. In 2013 UMass Amherst made it onto the Princeton review’s Green Honor Roll and in 2014 received its second National Climate Leadership Award. Furthermore, {{this is one of the}} only public universities to use the fresh fruits and vegetables in the dining commons from its very own <b>permaculture</b> gardens.|$|E
25|$|Eco-tourism aims to be ecologically and {{socially}} conscious; {{it focuses on}} local culture, wilderness, and adventure. Nicaragua's eco-tourism grows every year, as the country boasts a number of eco-tourist tours and perfect places for adventurers. Nicaragua has three eco-regions, the Pacific, Central and Atlantic, which contain volcanoes, tropical rainforest and agricultural land. The majority of ecolodges and other environmentally-focused touristic destinations are found on Ometepe Island, found {{in the middle of}} Lake Nicaragua, an hour's boat ride from Granada. While some are foreign-owned, such as the tropical <b>permaculture</b> lodge at Finca El Zopilote, others are owned by local families, like the small but acclaimed Finca Samaria.|$|E
25|$|While {{originally}} {{developed as a}} tool for range land use and restoring desertified land, the holistic management system can be applied to other areas with multiple complex socioeconomic and environmental factors. One such example is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which promotes sector integration in development and management of water resources to ensure that water is allocated between different users in a fair way, maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. In essence, coordinated holistic water management takes into consideration all water users in nature and society. Another example is mine reclamation. A fourth use of Holistic management is in certain forms of no till crop production, intercropping, and <b>permaculture.</b> Holistic management has been acknowledged by The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS).|$|E
25|$|The City of Eugene has {{an active}} Neighborhood Program. Several {{neighborhood}}s {{are known for}} their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a <b>permaculture</b> hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. A 65-tree filbert grove on public property is being restored by citizen volunteers in cooperation with the city of Eugene. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.|$|E
