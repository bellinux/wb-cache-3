In this method, S-N curve is used to determine crack growth rate under constant amplitude loading and evaluate the effects of different factors on durability and then the structural durability is analyzed.

40|$|Due {{to their}} low {{computational}} requirements, two-dimensional semiempirical wave propagation algorithms are still indispensable tools for terrestrial mobile communications and radio broadcasting coverage predictions {{in the very}} high and ultrahigh frequency bands. In this paper, we discuss various improvements of an algorithm based on digital terrain data. The algorithm combines the basic empirical <b>propagation</b> <b>curves</b> of Okumura et al. (1968) with terrain adaptive <b>propagation</b> <b>curves</b> derived from Fresnel zone clearance analyses of several terrain subsections. Also, a multiple knife-edge diffraction algorithm with approximate evaluation of the Kirchhoff diffraction integrals is applied when the line of sight is obstructed. Prediction quality is further improved by a robust algorithm for determination of effective transmitter antenna heights, and land usage along the terrain profile different from "open terrain" is considered by a multilevel Fresnel zone blockage evaluation. Prediction errors with standard deviations of about 6 to 7 dB were found for {{a great variety of}} measurements in flat and moderately undulating terrain. Transmitter stations with very high antennas (more than 200 m) caused larger standard deviations of the prediction errors. However, improvements of the predictions could be achieved in these cases by evaluating street orientations with respect to the direct path...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of microstructure on fatigue crack growth was analysed in steel with slightly hypereutectoid composition. A material constituted of pearlite colonies and {{a thin layer of}} proeutectoid cementite (pearlitic steel) was studied in its initial condition (as received). In addition, the same material was analyzed after undergoing two spheroidization processes consisting of an isothermal treatment on pearlitic steel at 700 ºC and different times (10 and 50 h). Results indicate that fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> in the Paris region is not modified by the spheroidization process. Fractometallographic analysis showed a change in the micromechanism of fatigue, evolving from transcollonial (trying to break pearlite lamellae) in the pearlitic steel to intergranular in the spheroidized steel, where cracking takes place through the layer of proeutectoid cementite...|$|E

It is shown that the scattering of the initial crack's length {{needs to be taken}} into account in predicting lifetime, and that the stochastic nature of the crack's propagation is not self-sufficient to explain completely the experimental asymmetry of the PDF lifetime.

Fatigue tests were performed on cylindrical samples under load control, using fatigue steps with different stress, and observing the appearance of a transient state in the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> (da/dN-ΔK) when the product KmaxΔK suddenly decreases, a sort of overload retardation effect that allowed the calculation of the plastic zone size. In addition, the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime, da/dN, obeys mainly to the parameter ΔK and it is hardly ever affected by Kmax. The study of the fatigue fracture surface shows: (i) that the micro-roughness of ductile micro-tearing patterns is a function of Kmax; (ii) the existence, in some tests, of a small zone with fatigue initiation fractography (with a tearing topography surface), related to the decrease of crack tip opening displacement, a phenomenon similar to that of crack initiation and growth from a micro-notch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} few years, the growing {{popularity}} of mobile devices has made them attractive to virus and worm writers. One communication channel often exploited by mobile malware is the Bluetooth interface. In this paper, we present a detailed analytical model that characterizes the propagation dynamics of Bluetooth worms. Our model captures not only the behavior of the Bluetooth protocol but also the impact of mobility patterns on the Bluetooth worm propagation. Validation experiments against a detailed discrete-event Bluetooth worm simulator reveal that our model predicts the propagation dynamics of Bluetooth worms with high accuracy. We further use our model to efficiently predict the <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> of Bluetooth worms in big cities such as Los Angeles.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of fracture propagation {{is a significant}} concern for pipelines transporting gases. The need to arrest a running fracture in a pipeline is paramount to the integrity and safety of the pipeline 2 ̆ 7 s operation. The most commonly used method to predict pipe resistance to a ductile fracture is the Battelle Two Curve Method (BTCM). Recent full-scale fracture propagation tests {{have shown that the}} BTCM cannot give accurate predictions for modern high-toughness steels. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to identify the limitations of the BTCM. The predictions of the developed model are in good agreement with the available experimental data. It has been found from the simulation that the pressure drops very fast in the initial stages of fracture propagation, leading to an intersection between the fracture curve and the decompression curve. However, the fracture speed does not remain constant at the speed corresponding to the intersection point, as assumed in the BTCM. It generally decreases, following the decompression curve as the fracture propagates. This observation indicates that the J-type fracture <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> adopted in the BTCM does not accurately represent the fracture propagation behaviour...|$|E

In this paper, acoustic emission monitoring was applied on the carbon/epoxy laminated composites when subjected to mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode I and II loading conditions. The main objective is to investigate delamination behavior and to predict <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> of the delamination in different GII/GT modal ratio values by the acoustic emission. First, a combination of acoustic emission and mechanical data (sentry function) is used to characterize the propagation stage of the delamination. Next, the crack tip location during propagation of the delamination in the specimens is identified using two methods. In the first method, by determining the velocity of the acoustic emission waves in the specimens, the position of the crack tip can be estimated throughout the tests. In the second method, the cumulative energy of the acoustic emission signals is utilized for localization of the crack tip. Agreement between the predicted crack length and the actual crack length verifies the presented procedures. It can be concluded from the results that the acoustic emission method is a powerful approach to investigate the delamination behavior and to estimate the crack tip position in the composites...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of welding residual stresses (RS) on fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in mode I. The objective of this work is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation of a RS field in the studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing FCPR. This {{led to the development of}} a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES, in which RS are introduced by weld bead deposition far from the region in which fatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a consequence, the effect of factors influencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes or plastic deformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding RS introduced in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and the weight functions method was used to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack propagates into the specimen. The evolution of cyclic stress ratio at the crack tip, Rlocal, was then computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the cyclic stress ratio. The results show that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR of the welded geometry with fixed externally low R ratio (R = 0. 1), but constantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry without RS, solicited at high cyclic stress ratio (R = 0. 7). These observations partially validate the BS 7910 standard philosophy in which the remaining life of a flawed structure in presence of tensile RS is calculated from a high cyclic stress ratio (R > 0. 5) crack <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> to eliminate crack closure effects...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{high value}} {{manufacturing}} products by default lack the minimum a priori data needed for forecasting cost variance over of time using regression based techniques. Forecasts which attempt {{to achieve this}} therefore suffer from significant variance which in turn places significant strain on budgetary assumptions and financial planning. The authors argue that for novel high value manufacturing products short interval control through continuous revision is necessary until {{the context of the}} baseline estimate stabilises sufficiently for extending the time intervals for revision. Case study data from the United States Department of Defence Scheduled Annual Summary Reports (1986 - 2013) is used to exemplify the approach. In this respect it must be remembered that the context of a baseline cost estimate is subject to a large number of assumptions regarding future plausible scenarios, the probability of such scenarios, and various requirements related to such. These assumptions change over time and the degree of their change is indicated by the extent that cost variance follows a forecast <b>propagation</b> <b>curve</b> that has been defined in advance. The presented approach determines the stability of this context by calculating the effort required to identify a propagation pattern for cost variance using the principles of Kolmogorov complexity. Only when that effort remains stable over a sufficient period of time can the revision periods for the cost estimate baseline be changed from continuous to discrete time intervals. The practical implication of the presented approach for novel high value manufacturing products is that attention is shifted from the bottom up or parametric estimation activity to the continuous management of the context for that cost estimate itself. This in turn enables a faster and more sustainable stabilisation of the estimating context which then creates the conditions for reducing cost estimate uncertainty in an actionable and timely manner...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the fatigue crack {{propagation}} behavior of an austenitic metastable stainless steel {{in the near}} threshold region. The steel used in this research is investigated in two different microstructural conditions: annealed and cold rolled. The fatigue crack propagation tests were conducted using the procedure of ΔK decreasing constant R, and ΔK decreasing constant Kmax. The assessment of the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>curves</b> using the crack growth trajectory map proposed by Sadananda and Vasudevan [Int. J. Fatigue 26 (2004) 39 - 47] {{points out that the}} mechanism that controls the fatigue crack advance in this material changes {{as a function of the}} level of ΔK applied. On the other side, the analysis of the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>curves</b> shows that the behavior of this material cannot be explained entirely by the concepts of two driving forces. The contribution of the crack closure to the decrease in the fatigue crack growth rate is quantified using two methods, and the measurement of the crack opening load is done using the standard method proposed in the ASTM E 647 - 08 ɛ 1 and the ACRn 2 method. In basis of this last method and in the crack profiles, which are uncharacteristic in materials with austenite/martensite interface, it is established that in this material the crack closure is induced by roughness. At the end of the paper an explanation is suggested for the load ratio effects using the two driving forces and taking into account the contribution of the crack closure...|$|R
