50|$|Pentyl hexanoate (C5H11COO.C5H11) is an ester {{found in}} apple and {{pineapple}} fruits. It {{is closely related}} to <b>pentyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and pentyl pentanoate, both of which are also present in fruits.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydroxyl}} group (OH) is the active site of many reactions. The ester formed from 1-pentanol and butyric acid is <b>pentyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> which smells like apricot. The ester formed from 1-pentanol and acetic acid is amyl acetate (also called pentyl acetate), which smells like banana.|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of ethyl oleate because of its insufficient purity. The following compounds {{are considered to be}} safe for all animal species at the use level proposed for feed flavourings: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, oleic acid, decanol, dodecanol, decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. The remaining substances are considered safe for all animal species at 5 mg/kg complete feed (with a margin of safety between 1 and 120) and at 25 mg/kg complete feed (ethyl acetate and hexyl acetate, with a margin of safety between 2 and 6); and at 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species (ethylacrylate, ethyl hex- 3 -enoate, ethyl trans- 2 -butenoate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, methyl isovalerate, hexyl isobutyrate, methyl 2 -methyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>pentyl</b> isovalerate, butyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl isovalerate, ethyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl 2 -methyl butyrate and methyl 2 -methylvalerate). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 1 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat all compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitizers. No risk for the safety for the environment is foreseen. Since all 85 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pentyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> {{also known}} as pentyl {{butanoate}} or amyl butyrate, is an ester that is formed when pentanol is reacted with butyric acid, usually {{in the presence of}} sulfuric acid as a catalyst. This ester has a smell reminiscent of pear or apricot. This chemical is used as an additive in cigarettes.|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of volatiles by 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits {{are highly}} diminshed {{after a long}} term controlled atmosphere (CA) or ultra low oxygen (ULO) storage. To study the mechanisms of volatile production at both harvest time and after long term storage and to explain {{the reasons for the}} inability of fruits to produce adequate amounts of volatiles, aroma precursors were supplied to the fruits at different times during storage. Fruits were supplied with the following aroma precursors: Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol and isopentanol), acids (acetic-, propionic-, butyric-, pentanoic- and hexanoic acid) and esters (methyl heptanoate and methyl linolenate). Each aroma precursor was applied separately both at harvest time (October) and in March, after the apples were stored in ultra low oxygen conditions (1 % O 2 : 3 % CO 2) for 5 months. Alcohols, except ethanol, induced in both application times a strong increase in the biosynthesis of its volatiles. Butanol enhanced the production of butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, butanol and <b>pentyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> Hexanol enhanced the synthesis of butyl butyrate, hexyl acetate, hexyl propionate, hexanol and hexyl hexanoate. The biosynthesis of butyl butirate or propyl acetate by fruits stored for 5 months in ULO-storage after the treatments with hexanol or pentanol is evidence for an active beta-oxiodation process. The influence of acids was negligible at harvest time but they, except acetic and hexanioc acids, induced at the second date the biosynthesis of their esters. It is proposed that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids (linol- and linolenic acids) are the ultimate precursors for aroma (Bartley et al., 1985). The content of both fatty acids were found to be highly and positively correlated with volatile production. They decreased strongly after 6 months in ULO-storage in about the same manner as aroma production...|$|E
