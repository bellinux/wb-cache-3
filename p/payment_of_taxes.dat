Polo is clearly mentioned again after 1305 in Maffeo's testament from 1309–1310, in a 1319 document according to which he became owner of some estates of his deceased father, and in 1321, when he bought {{part of the family}} property of his wife Donata.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were {{about the size of}} a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; the federal government would not redeem them or take them in <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1720s, Zahir {{and his brother}} Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, {{captured}} Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Köprülü Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This {{was the first time}} a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issue}} of the papal bull Clericis laicos in 1296, forbidding the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse {{payments}} to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward's tax demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{currencies}} were circulating in the province, {{as was the}} custom in China, and the paper notes issued by the provincial government had experienced a steady depreciation in value.

Much to the surprise of the Chinese the new currency even gained in value against the gold yen, although Japanese businessmen claimed that it was not backed up by sufficient silver reserves. Wang then used the newly gained credibility to introduce another note, the Fengtian dollar, which was not convertible into silver anymore. However, it was accepted by the government for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes,</b> a sign of faith in its own currency.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{few things}} that both the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree on about the druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes,</b> and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.|$|E

25|$|Al-Jazzar {{continued}} {{to lobby for}} appointment as wali of Sidon Eyalet and was approaching open rebellion against the Ottomans in protest at not receiving the post. However, in May 1777, al-Jazzar was officially appointed wali. That year, al-Jazzar requested assistance against Emir Yusuf from Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, the wali of Damascus, and his son Yusuf Pasha al-Azm, the wali of Tripoli. Both refused, citing Emir Yusuf's loyalty and regular <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> They also feared al-Jazzar's growing power more than Emir Yusuf. Al-Jazzar dispatched the commander of his Maghrebi troops in Sidon, Mustafa ibn Qara Mulla, to collect payments from the Druze clans and kill Emir Yusuf. In his first foray into Mount Lebanon, the Druze forced him to retreat to Sidon. Mustafa was also unsuccessful in his second offensive, this time through the Beqaa Valley. In the latter offensive, the harvest of the valley was confiscated and the two sides entered into indecisive clashes.|$|E

When the revolt was launched and tax revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide valuables and protect themselves during raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians. The government agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> for a year, even scaling back the rate.
