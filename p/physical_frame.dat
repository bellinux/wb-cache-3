5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the <b>physical</b> <b>frame</b> of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

The study used a qualitative method in form of interviews with PE teachers who teach physical education and health in elementary school (7 - 9).

The result showed from the study that constitutional, organizational and <b>physical</b> <b>frames</b> can limit the PE teachers in their teaching, which affects the capability of migrant students to reach approved goals. Furthermore, it also emerged that the PE teacher can adapt their teaching to give migrant students the opportunity to manage the knowledge requirements in physical education.

40|$|To improve system performance, modern {{operating}} systems (OSes) often undertake activities that require modification of virtual-to-physical page translation mappings. For example, the OS may migrate data between <b>physical</b> <b>frames</b> to defragment memory and enable superpages. The OS may migrate pages of data between heterogeneous memory devices. We refer to all such activities as page remappings. Unfortunately, page remappings are expensive.

In response, we propose hardware translation invalidation and coherence or HATRIC, a readily implementable hardware mechanism to piggyback translation coherence atop existing cache coherence protocols. We perform detailed studies using KVM-based virtualization, showing that HATRIC achieves up to 30 % performance and 10 % energy benefits, for per-CPU area overheads of 2 %.

50|$|In {{relativistic}} cosmology {{there is a}} freedom associated with the choice of threading frame, this frame choice is distinct from choice associated with coordinates. Picking this frame is equivalent to fixing the choice of timelike world lines mapped into each other, this reduces the gauge freedom it does not fix the gauge but the theory remains gauge invariant under the remaining gauge freedoms. In order to fix the gauge a specification of correspondences between the time surfaces in the real universe (perturbed) and the background universe are required along with the correspondences between points on the initial spacelike surfaces {{in the background and}} in the real universe. This is the link between the gauge-invariant perturbation theory and the gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is only guaranteed if the choice of frame coincides exactly with that of the background; usually this is trivial to ensure because <b>physical</b> <b>frames</b> have this property.|$|R

40|$|International audience—This work {{demonstrates}} that {{a set of}} commercial and scale-out applications exhibit significant use of superpages and thus suffer from the fixed and small superpage TLB structures of some modern core designs. Other processors better cope with superpages {{at the expense of}} using power-hungry and slow fully-associative TLBs. We consider alternate designs that allow all pages to freely share a single, power-efficient and fast set-associative TLB. We propose a prediction-guided multi-grain TLB design that uses a superpage prediction mechanism to avoid multiple lookups in the common case. In addition, we evaluate the previously proposed skewed TLB [1] which builds on principles similar to those used in skewed associative caches [2]. We enhance the original skewed TLB design by using page size prediction to increase its effective associativity. Our prediction-based multi-grain TLB design delivers more hits and is more power efficient than existing alternatives. The predictor uses a 32 -byte prediction table indexed by base register values. I. INTRODUCTION Over the last 50 years virtual memory has been an intrinsic facility of computer systems, providing each process the illusion of an equally large and contiguous address space while enforcing isolation and access control. Page tables act as gate-keepers; they maintain the mappings of virtual pages to <b>physical</b> <b>frames</b> (i. e., translations) along with additional information (e. g., access privileges). Except for a reserved part of memory, any code or data structure which currently resides in the computer's physical memory has such a translation. Page tables are usually organized as multi-level, hierarchical tables with four levels being common for 64 -bit systems. Therefore multiple sequential memory references are necessary to retrieve the translation of the smallest supported page size. Hardware Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) cache translations which are the result of accessing the page table (page-walk). A TLB access is in the critical path of each instruction fetch and memory reference; the translation is needed to complete the tag comparison in physically-tagged L 1 caches. Thus, a short TLB latency is crucial. There are technology trends that compound making TLB performance and energy critical in today's systems. Physical memory sizes and application footprints have been increasing without a commensurate increase in TLB size and thus coverage. As a result, while TLBs still reap the benefits of spatial and temporal locality due to their entries' coarse tracking granularity, they now fall short of growing workload footprints. The use of superpages (i. e., large contiguous virtual memory regions which map to contiguous <b>physical</b> <b>frames)</b> can exten...|$|R

In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fall to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind.

They looked for the root of this trouble in his shattered schemes of domestic bliss,--wilfully shattered by himself,--but could not be satisfied of its existence there.
