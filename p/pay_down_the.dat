25|$|During Guthrie's tenure, the {{treasury}} had large budget surpluses {{due to the}} discovery of gold in California. He used much of these surpluses to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> national debt, which shrank from $63 million in 1853 to $25 million in 1857. He also purchased silver bullion for coinage which aided struggling banks by returning money to circulation and increasing their depleted reserves. He encouraged more efficient processes in the Treasury Department as a whole, and required monthly, rather than quarterly, reports from customs agents. In 1853, he employed Captain Alexander Bowman of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of an extension to the Treasury Building's south wing. Many considered Guthrie to be the ablest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} were obligated {{to repay the}} loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day {{in the guise of}} the state owned KfW bank, (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.|$|E
500|$|On January 8, 2008, Governor Jon Corzine {{proposed}} a 50 {{percent increase in}} tolls on New Jersey's three toll roads in 2010, with increases of a similar percentage every four years after that, {{in order to help}} <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> state debt. [...] Each time tolls increased, there would be an additional increase for inflation since the last toll increase (for the first, since 2006). The roads would be maintained by a nonprofit public-benefit corporation, which would pay back bonds to the state. Under this plan, without considering inflation, tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway would have risen from $2.50 to $16.59 in 2022. It was possible that commuters would receive discounts from the higher toll rates. However, the proposal was not enacted due to opposition from leaders of the New Jersey Legislature. On September 5, 2008, a proposal by the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created to raise tolls by 50 percent, from $2.50 to $3.75, in order to fund improvements to the road {{as well as to the}} Atlantic City International Airport. This toll increase took place effective November 18, 2008. In 2009, the South Jersey Transportation Authority considered making the tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway completely electronic, in which E-ZPass would be used. [...] Vehicles without E-ZPass will be billed using license plate technology, with a 10% surcharge applied to their tolls. The Atlantic City Expressway was expected to become an all-electronic toll road by Memorial Day weekend 2011. However, the tolls on the road were later not expected to become cashless until between 2013 and 2015.|$|E

In June 2011, Gingrich was the first Republican presidential candidate to sign the Lean Six Sigma [...] "Strong America Now" [...] pledge. The pledge commits to reducing federal government spending and starting to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> national debt by 2017. In a speech to the Heritage Foundation in August 2011, he stated that the waste cutting methods should be used to address the deficit, and estimated that through their application the government could identify a $3 trillion saving over 10 years by December 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Clinton {{voted against}} the two major tax cuts {{packages}} introduced by President Bush, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, saying it was fiscally irresponsible to reopen the budget deficit.

At a fundraiser in 2004, she told a crowd of financial donors that [...] "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you" [...] but that [...] "We're saying that for America {{to get back on}} track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you.

[...] The first major contract came in late October 1907 to supply $500,000 worth of marble for the Cuyahoga County Court House, in Cleveland, Ohio and set off a quarrying boom. [...] In spite of the increased quarrying, by 1913 the company was in financial trouble due to the huge start-up debt and high operating costs not generating enough revenue to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> debt. [...] A loan of $1,868,000 was obtained in early February 1913 and used to refinance to debt.

2500|$|During {{his first}} term (2001–2004), President Bush sought and {{obtained}} Congressional approval for the Bush tax cuts, which mainly comprised the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). These acts decreased many income tax rates, reduced the capital gains tax, increased the child tax credit and eliminated the so-called [...] "marriage penalty", and were set to expire in 2010, while increasing federal deficits by an estimated 1.5% to 2.0% GDP each year. Among the many stated rationales for the large income tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was the 2001 recession, which followed the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in late 2000 and early 2001. Further, some influential conservatives such as Alan Greenspan believed that the nearly $5 trillion in budget surpluses forecast by the CBO for the 2002-2011 period should be given back to taxpayers rather than used to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> national debt.|$|E
2500|$|However, many of {{the aspects}} of the social-democratic welfare state {{continued}} to function at a high level, due {{in no small part}} to the high rate of unionization in Sweden, the independence of unions in wage-setting, and the exemplary competency of the feminized public sector workforce, as well as widespread public support. The Social Democrats initiated studies on the effects of the neoliberal changes, and the picture that emerged from those findings allowed the party to reduce many tax expenditures, slightly increase taxes on high income-earners, and significantly reduce taxes on food. The Social Democratic Finance Minister increased spending on child support and continued to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> public debt. By 1998 the Swedish macro-economy recovered from the 1980s industrial restructuring and the currency policy excesses. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Sweden has a well-regarded, generally robust economy, and the average quality of life, after government transfers, is very high, inequality is low (the Gini coefficient is [...]28), and social mobility is high (compared to the affluent Anglo-American and Central European countries).|$|E
2500|$|The {{budget was}} met with dissent by the Liberal and New Democratic parties and mostly {{positive}} reception from the Bloc. [...] The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberals child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion [...] "made in Canada" [...] plan of their design. [...] The budget {{was met with}} widespread support amongst {{the business community and}} polling indicated that a clear majority of Canadians approved of the budget. While it initially appeared that the only way the Conservatives' budget would pass would be {{with the support of the}} Bloc Québécois, the budget passed third reading without dissent on June 6, 2006 when the members of the Opposition accidentally failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate. [...] Because there were no speakers for the Opposition, the budget was declared passed with unanimous support and no recorded vote and thus forwarded to the Senate for approval. [...] This marked the first time in Canadian Parliamentary history where a government's budget passed unanimously on the third and final reading. On September 25, 2006, the Conservative government announced that within the fiscal year, there was a $13.2 billion surplus that will be used to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> country's debt.|$|E
2500|$|As Director, Lawton {{worked to}} cut {{departmental}} expenses {{in the federal}} budget. However, as assistant director, he argued strongly against calls from Congress for large-scale budget cuts, claiming that such a thing {{would not be possible}} because of [...] "fixed" [...] expenses like <b>paying</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> public debt and giving promised veteran's benefits. In the end, Lawton, under order of Congress, cut more than $500 million in operating costs within the government.|$|R
50|$|While {{a portion}} of every payment is applied towards both the {{interest}} and the principal balance of the loan, the exact amount applied to principal each time varies (with the remainder going to interest).

2500|$|Act II {{takes place}} {{outdoors}} in mid-summer {{on the family}} estate, near the cherry orchard. The act opens with Yepikhodov and Yasha trying for the affection of Dunyasha, by singing and playing guitar, while Charlotta soliloquizes about her life as she cleans a rifle. In Act I {{it was revealed that}} Yepikhodov proposed to Dunyasha around Easter; however, she has since become infatuated with the more [...] "cultured" [...] Yasha. Charlotta leaves so that Dunyasha and Yasha might have some time alone, but that is interrupted when they hear their employer coming. Yasha shoos Dunyasha away to avoid being caught, and Ranevskaya, Gayev, and Lopakhin appear, once more discussing the uncertain fate of the cherry orchard. Shortly Anya, Varya, and Trofimov arrive as well. Lopakhin teases Trofimov for being a perpetual student, and Trofimov espouses his philosophy of work and useful purpose, to the delight and humour of everyone around. During their conversations, a drunken and disheveled vagrant passes by and begs for money; Ranevskaya thoughtlessly gives him all of her money, despite the protestations of Varya. Shaken by the disturbance, the family departs for dinner, with Lopakhin futilely insisting that the cherry orchard be sold to <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> debt. Anya stays behind to talk with Trofimov, who disapproves of Varya's constant hawk-like eyes, reassuring Anya that they are [...] "above love". To impress Trofimov and win his affection, Anya vows to leave the past behind her and start a new life. The two depart for the river as Varya calls scoldingly in the background.|$|E
