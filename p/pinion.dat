40|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the <b>pinions</b> {{do not meet the}} specification. The <b>pinions</b> were supplied in as-machined and soft-annealed condition. No post machining heat treatment and/or surface hardening were carried out on the <b>pinions.</b> As a result, the <b>pinions</b> did not have enough strength and surface wear resistance for the present application. Though the material of construction was found to conform to 20 NiCrMo steel, it is the inadequacy in strength and wear resistance that led to the premature failure of the <b>pinions.</b> The failure, therefore, is attributed to manufacturing errors...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pinioning</b> {{is legally}} {{restricted}} in many countries. In England, if {{the bird is}} more than 10 days old its <b>pinioning</b> may only be performed using anaesthetic and, regardless of the bird's age, the procedure is illegal unless performed by a veterinarian. It is also illegal to perform on farmed birds. In Austria <b>pinioning</b> is prohibited based on §5 (Prohibition of cruelty to animals) and §7 (Prohibited interventions performed on animals) of the Animal Protection Act.|$|R

5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and <b>pinion</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The rack and <b>pinion</b> steering had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E

5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the Comet 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4, which was based on the Comet 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the <b>pinion</b> (outboard wing) fuel tanks of the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the <b>pinion</b> axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and <b>pinion</b> traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{prevention}} of flight, there is commonly thought to be little long term negative effect from <b>pinioning</b> if performed correctly and at a young age. However, the animal welfare impact of <b>pinioning</b> is subject to increasing debate. For example, it is now known that the operation, which is often performed without pain relief, is just as painful in young birds as in mature birds, if not more so. Evidence also suggests that <b>pinioning</b> may cause a phantom limb syndrome similar to what is observed in human amputees. For these reasons this practice has been prohibited in certain regions and is subject to increasing scrutiny.|$|R
40|$|The lateral Casimir {{force is}} {{employed}} {{to propose a}} nanoscale mechanical device composed of one rack and N <b>pinions.</b> A coupling between the <b>pinions</b> via torsional springs is shown to coordinate their motion through a synchronization transition. The system can work against loads that are greater than the lateral Casimir force for each device. The existence of a stable synchronized state ensures that the system could operate in full coordination without the need of delicate fine tuning of all the characteristics such as the spring constants, the corrugation amplitudes, and the distances between the rack and the <b>pinions.</b> © 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and <b>pinion</b> type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|All braking is done {{using the}} rack and <b>pinion</b> system. Every {{locomotive}} and carriage has a <b>pinion,</b> allowing each vehicle to brake itself.|$|E
25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each <b>pinion</b> pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the <b>pinion</b> pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given <b>pinion</b> meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each <b>pinion</b> couples that spur gear to the other <b>pinion,</b> and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|E

25|$|The line {{uses the}} Abt rack system devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. The system comprises {{a length of}} toothed rail (the rack) between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the <b>pinion)</b> mounted on each rail vehicle's driving axle. The traditional logo for the railway is a <b>pinion</b> ring engaged on a rack bar. At the stations and passing loops, the real items are mounted on steel frames.|$|E
25|$|It is vitally {{important}} that all braking is done in a controlled manner, as any sudden shocks impose very high loads on the rack rail and <b>pinion</b> wheels, and can cause damage.|$|E
