5000|$|... 2013 German Grand Prix: Mark Webber was {{released}} from the pit box before his right-rear wheel was properly fitted on. The tyre came loose as he drove down the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> and hit a cameraman. This led to increased <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> safety measures being implemented, including mandatory head protection for all team members working on a car during a pit stop, a reduced <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> speed limit, and restricted access for the media into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|R
50|$|The race {{features}} {{a variation of}} the traditional Le Mans start. The car is parked in traditional Le Mans formation, while co-drivers are positioned about 250 meters from the circuit, and must run to their car parked on <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> Once there, the co-driver pulls the flag from the car, and the primary driver is allowed to leave. The cars are parked on <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> and the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> speed limit will be in effect until the car leaves <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{area was}} later {{used for a}} new circuit, known as the Biscayne Bay Street Circuit. Promoted by Michael Andretti, a 1.3 mile, eight-turn circuit in the area debuted for the 2014-15 Formula E season. In Formula E, the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> is used to store cars for the car change that takes place during each race, and the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> is away from the start-finish line, close to the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> [...] From Turn 4 to Turn 5 on this circuit the cars will take it out to Biscayne Boulevard, and Turns 5 to 8 (and <b>pit</b> <b>lane)</b> are located {{very close to the}} {{original}} Bicentennial Park circuit layout. The <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> is in the same vicinity as the original circuit.|$|R
50|$|Speed Dreams has {{inherited}} from TORCS a per-driver penalty system. Penalties are triggered by violations to <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> rules: breaking {{the speed limit}} in the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> (90 kph) results in a drive-through penalty, while crossing the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> border produces a stop-and-go penalty.Penalties have to be cleared within five laps since the notification; disobeying drivers are automatically excluded from the race.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992 : Yet more {{exhaustive}} {{testing of}} survival cell including rear impact testing, height of kerbing lowered, minimum width of <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> increased to 12 m, <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> entry chicane mandatory, safety car introduced.|$|R
5000|$|... 1993 European Grand Prix: On lap 57, Ayrton Senna {{came into}} the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> for a tyre change but aborted the stop and drove {{straight}} through instead. In the process, he ended up setting the fastest lap of the race, due to both the unique configuration of Donington Park's <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> {{and the lack of}} <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> speed limits in F1 at the time (which would be introduced the following year after Senna's death).|$|R
2500|$|From 2007, new {{procedures}} were {{applied for the}} first time during the Bahrain Grand Prix. The <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was closed immediately upon the deployment of the safety car. No car could enter the pits until all cars on the track had formed up in a line behind the safety car, they passed the pit entrance, and the message [...] "pit lane open" [...] was given. A ten-second stop/go penalty (which must be taken when the race is resumed) was imposed on any driver who entered the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> before the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> open message is given. However, any car which was in the pit entry or <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> when the safety car was deployed would not incur a penalty.|$|R
50|$|The safety car was {{deployed}} on {{the first}} lap as Jarno Trulli, Mika Häkkinen, Nick Heidfeld and Heinz-Harald Frentzen cars which stalled could not {{be removed from the}} grid before the race completed the first lap. Jarno Trulli, one of the drivers that stalled their car but who had been recovered to the <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> was disqualified for leaving the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> while the red light was on as the safety car and the cars behind it passed the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> exit.|$|R
5000|$|Coole Pilate Chapel on Coole Lane at [...] {{was built}} in 1850 by the Wesleyan Methodist Association. Other {{landmarks}} include the large farms of Old Hall at the junction of Coole <b>Lane</b> and Brine <b>Pits</b> <b>Lane</b> (...) , and Brinepits {{at the end of}} Brine <b>Pits</b> <b>Lane</b> (...) [...]|$|R
5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{complaints}} from MotoGP riders in 2010, the {{entry to the}} new Abbey has been re-surfaced to remove a large bump situated on the racing line. The reconfiguration was not without controversy, as the lowered <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> meant that the pit garages were obscured from {{the view of the}} spectators by a retaining wall. Formula One Management reversed the intended <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> order, placing the Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari pit garages behind the retaining wall, and moving the Team Lotus, Hispania and Virgin and back to the visible end of the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> The change in the allocation of garages was believed to be for the benefit of corporate guests in the Formula One [...] "Paddock Club", a corporate suite housed above {{the far end of the}} <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> obscured from view.|$|R
50|$|The No. 120 Rossa Corsa Ferrari and No. 11 Full Speed Racing Saleen were {{required}} to start from <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> after they both changed engines following qualifying. The two PMB Motorsports Porsches {{did not participate in}} any of the three qualifying sessions and also had to start from <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were seven}} main grandstands located along the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{rough and}} bumpy {{concrete}} <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was also paved over in asphalt and a guardrail was installed {{to protect the}} crew members in the sign board area. The newly paved pit area made egress and ingress to the pits smoother and safer, but also sharply increased entrance and exit speeds, potentially putting crew members at risk. Within a few years, {{after a series of}} incidents on the Indy car circuit, as well as in NASCAR, pit road speed limits would be implemented to curtail speeding through the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> In addition the pneumatic jacks on the cars were embedding themselves into the soft asphalt of the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> This necessitated crews to affix steel plates on the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> to accommodate the jacks (a practice that was also later deemed unsafe). In 1994, this would be finally be solved when the individual pit boxes were resurfaced in concrete.|$|R
