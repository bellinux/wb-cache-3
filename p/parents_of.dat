40|$|The {{transition}} to parenthood {{is a substantial}} challenge for many couples, {{and the extent to}} which the partners can support each other and their relationship is strongly related to the sensitivity and responsiveness <b>of</b> their <b>parenting</b> <b>of</b> their infant. This paper critically analyses the links between the couple relationship and <b>parenting</b> <b>of</b> infants and reviews the research evaluating couple psychoeducation (CP) to assist couples' <b>parenting</b> <b>of</b> their infant. It is concluded that CP has considerable potential to enhance couples' adaptation to parenthood and enhance the sensitivity and responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>of</b> new infants.

40|$|There are {{conflicting}} reports {{suggesting that the}} parental origin of transmitted risk alleles {{may play a role}} in the etiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A recent report by Hawi and colleagues observed a generalized paternal over-transmission of alleles associated with ADHD. This was not replicated in more recent studies. Using data from a large multicenter study we examined the overall and gene-specific <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin effect in 554 independent SNPs across 47 genes. Transmission disequilibrium and explicit <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin test were performed using PLINK. Overall <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin effect was tested by Chi-square. There was no overall <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin effect in the IMAGE sample (, P = 0. 117). Five markers in three genes, DDC, TPH 2, and SLC 6 A 2 showed nominal association (P < 0. 01) with ADHD combined subtype when restricted to maternal or paternal transmission only. Following the initial report by Hawi and co-workers three studies, including this one, found no evidence to support an overall <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin effect for markers associated with ADHD. We cannot however, exclude gene-specific <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> origin effect in the etiology ADHD. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> his wife's friend, Peter Quennell.
