5000|$|Anthony Cleland Welch OBE (born September 1945 in Hamilton, New Zealand) is a UK-based former soldier, UN official, {{politician}} and academic who {{has contributed to}} the debate on security sector reform (SSR) and post-conflict development and regeneration. Welch adheres to the view that {{it is not enough to}} merely reform the armed forces, police and justice sector. If reform of the security sector is to be effective for the creation of sustainable peace and development, with the interaction between the security sector and political and economic reform and regeneration being significant, then it cannot be confined to matters of civilian control of the armed forces. Much more must be done to introduce security, human rights and good governance to a <b>post-conflict</b> <b>situation.</b> A decision has to be made as to just how far the reform process should involve itself in areas that do not deal with the relationship of a civilian government to its agencies of enforcement. A wider, more holistic, approach to SSR is apt to use a broad comprehension of security and will be faced with making decisions on which areas of governance and the wider social needs of the population should fall within its orbit. In 2006 he led the Internal Security Sector review of Kosovo (ISSR) which established the grounds for the creation of a democratically administered, civilian-led security sector in the unilaterally declared independent Republic of Kosovo. The ISSR took the unusual step of asking the population of Kosovo to have their say on what made them feel insecure and was called by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), [...] "…one of the most ambitious and holistic efforts at SSR undertaken in recent years, both in scope and methodology.". The UNOSEK recommendations for the disbandment of the Kosovo Protection Corps and the formation of a Kosovo Security Force, Ministry of the KSF and Kosovo Security Council was influenced by the work undertaken by the ISSR.|$|E

40|$|Democratization in <b>post-conflict</b> <b>situations</b> {{is a major}} challenge, {{now and in the}} {{foreseeable}} future. Yet, the puzzle of why some of these attempts fail and others succeed is still unresolved. This thesis argues that post-conflict democratization by third parties is, at its core, a norm diffusion process. Successful democratization depends foremost on the acceptance and internalization of democratic norms by the target society. Knowledge of the norm diffusion concept, especially the influence of the two variables, cultural match and norm empowerment on the process might lead to the development and the application of better democratization strategies. This thesis argues that <b>post-conflict</b> <b>situations</b> with their specific features-primarily characterized by value disorientation-offer a unique opportunity for a democratic transition. It examines the cases of the Weimar Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia) in order to demonstrate the explanatory power of the norm diffusion theory, specifically its added value in studying success and failure of past and present democratization in <b>post-conflict</b> <b>situations.</b> German Air Force author...|$|R
