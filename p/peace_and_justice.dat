40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} Quaker service work for <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> social <b>justice</b> in the Canadian context, drawing from life history interviews gathered during attendance at Canadian Yearly Meeting and Canadian Friends Service Committee meetings. Interviews explored each individual's involvement in <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> social <b>justice</b> {{within the context of}} their Quaker spirituality. The analysis of the interviews emphasizes that religion is woven into each person's life over time and through experiences. Further, because Quaker spirituality emphasizes that each person has the capacity to commune with the Divine on an individual basis, the nature of religious experience will differ. This problematizes the notion that religiously-based service for <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> social <b>justice</b> derives from one type of religious experience. Instead, this research shows how, for Quakers, involvement in <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> social <b>justice</b> is intimately connected to personal experiences of the Divine, which are both fostered and tempered by their spiritual community...|$|R
