40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} an alternative 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast {{neutral red uptake}} assay and investigate the feasibility of utilizing an alternative in vitro method to replace the animal testing, in particular, in phototoxicity assessment of cosmetics. Method: Fifteen phototoxic and nine non-phototoxic chemicals were tested and 20 functional cosmetic products were assessed. The mean photo effect (MPE) and the <b>photo-irritation</b> <b>factor</b> (PIF) of Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were analyzed after exposure to specific chemicals and ultraviolet radiation, and then compared {{with the results of}} whole-animal phototoxicity testing. Result: A negative result was obtained with all the non-phototoxic chemicals in the in vitro test, while fourteen out of the fifteen phototoxic chemicals gave a positive result. The Pearson's chi-square test indicated no statistically significant difference from the historic phototoxicity data. For the assessed 20 cosmetic products, a high correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo data. Conclusion: The alternative 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity assay was established successfully as a substitute for the guinea pig-based photoxicity test in assessing the phototoxic effects of cosmetics...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, human {{keratinocyte}} cell line {{was used as}} in vitro cell culture model to elucidate {{the effects of the}} fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate (amino acid-based surfactant) namely, sodium cocoyl glutamate, sodium lauroyl glutamate, and sodium myristoyl glutamate on their cytotoxicity and the ultraviolet B induced phototoxicity. The endpoint used to assess toxicity was a tetrazolium-based assay whereas, the phototoxic potential of acylglutamate surfactants was predicted using two models namely, the <b>Photo-Irritation</b> <b>Factor</b> and Mean Photo Effect. The results of this study showed that the fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate greatly influences toxic effects on human keratinocyte cells. In addition, all the acylglutamate surfactants tested on human keratinocyte cells demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity (when irradiated and non-irradiated with ultraviolet B light; p < 0. 05) and no phototoxic potential was observed in any of the acylglutamate surfactants, when compared with the positive control chlorpromazine. In conclusion, the in vitro studies confirm the suitability of sodium lauroyl glutamate destined for the synthesis and stabilization of lipid nanoparticles...|$|E
