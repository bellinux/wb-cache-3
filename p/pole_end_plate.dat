40|$|Background: Prior {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> morphometrics and lesions {{may play a role in}} disc degeneration. However, most prior <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> studies have been based on radiographic images, and findings of associations between <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> morphometrics (measurements of size and shape) and disc degeneration remain controversial. The present study investigated the prevalence of vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> lesions and determined <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> morphometrics through direct measurements of cadaveric spines, and it examined the association of these factors with disc degeneration. Methods: We studied 600 vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> and 313 intervertebral discs from the cadaveric lumbosacral spines of seventy-six men (mean age, fifty-one years). Discography was performed to evaluate disc degeneration as indicated by disruption of the anulus fibrosus. The shape of the vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and the presence of any lesionswere visually evaluated. Lesions were rated as absent, small to moderate, or large. In addition, each <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> was digitized to quantify its area, circularity, and concavity. The association of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> morphometrics and lesions with disc degeneration was examined. Results: Vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> lesions were found in 72 % (fifty-five) of the seventy-six lumbar spines and in 32. 8 % (197) of the 600 <b>end</b> <b>plates.</b> The presence of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> lesions was associated with disc degeneration, with larger lesions being associated with more severe disc degeneration (odds ratio, 2. 31 for small to moderate lesions [p < 0. 01] and 3. 54 for large lesions [p < 0. 001]). Greater <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> area was also associated with more severe disc degeneration (odds ratio, 1. 2 per cm 2 [p < 0. 05]). Conclusions: Vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> lesions were common and were associated with adjacent disc degeneration, with greater lesion size being associated with more severe disc degeneration. <b>End</b> <b>plate</b> morphometrics, particularly greater <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> size, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of disc degeneration. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that the integrity of the vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> is essential to maintaining disc health. The prevalence of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> lesions may be underestimated on standard clinical images...|$|R

A prestressing device is provided for impacting with the preload force. The preloaded means of the prestressing device is variable. The prestressing device has a cylindrical preload element. The flat sealing element interacts in a sealing with a sealing ramp. The transverse seal of the sealing device of an active sealing surface is developed for contact with the flat sealing element. The longitudinal seal of the sealing device projects in the area of overlapping through the flat sealing element. The <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> has a material reduced region adjacent to the flat sealing element, in which the flat sealing element is immersible during pressing against the active sealing surface. The transverse seal for the formation of the active sealing surface has running ramp surfaces or a curved surface to each other. The active sealing surface is formed by means of a sealing edge. The flat sealing element is applied over its total transverse extending on the active sealing surface. The flat sealing element extends over its total transverse extending of the <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> The material reduced region enables immersion of the sealing element over its total transverse and is formed as a recess and/or stamp, which is formed {{in the direction of the}} first to second face of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> adjacent to the first face facing in the <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> The material reduced region is formed between the end faces of the <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> The active flat surface is formed by means of ceramic material.

40|$|The {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{is frequently}} employed {{to predict the}} transmission loss (TL) of an expansion chamber silencer with a rigid walled boundary, while {{the effect of the}} vibration of the <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> of the expansion chamber silencer is usually ignored. However, when the airflow or acoustic pressure in a duct is large and the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> of the expansion chamber silencer is not thick enough, the effect of the vibration of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> should not be ignored. In this paper, based on a coupling of the BEM and the finite element method (FEM), the numerical results illustrate the existence of the effect on the TL of the vibrating <b>end</b> <b>plates.</b> Furthermore, numerical experiments also show that for an expansion chamber of constant size, the thicker the <b>end</b> <b>plate,</b> the less influence the vibration of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> has on the TL.

40|$|The {{activity}} and properties of cholinesterase {{of the motor}} <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> in human intercostal muscle were studied in the isolated muscle membrane. This preparation was used because cholinesterase activity of the membrane preparation was localized in the motor <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> without contamination of cholinesterase of other muscle components. Under the experimental conditions, cholinesterase in a human <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> hydrolyzed 1. 21 × 108 molecules of acetylcholine per msec, which is smaller than hydrolysis of 2. 69 × 108 by a motor <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> of rat intercostal muscle. Studies with cholinesterase inhibitors and specific substrates indicated that about 90 % of cholinesterase of human motor endplates is acetylcholinesterase, and about 10 % is pseudocholinesterase.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the frequency and}} distribution of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> marrow signal intensity changes in an asymptomatic population and to correlate these findings with patient age and degenerative findings in the spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging studies of the lumbosacral (LS) spine in 59 asymptomatic subjects were retrospectively reviewed by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists to determine the presence and location of fat-like and edema-like marrow signal changes about the <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> of the L 1 - 2 through L 5 -S 1 levels. The presence of degenerative changes in the spine was recorded as was patient age. Descriptive statistics were utilized to determine the frequency and associations of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> findings and degenerative changes in the spine. Interobserver variability was determined by a kappa score. Binomial probability was used to predict the prevalence of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> changes in a similar subject population. The Fisher exact test was performed to determine statistical significance {{of the relationship of}} <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> changes with degenerative changes in the spine, superior versus inferior location about the disc and age of the patient population. RESULTS: Focal fat-like signal intensity adjacent to the vertebral end-plate was noted in 15 out of 59 subjects by both readers, and involved 38 and 36 out of 590 <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> by readers 1 and 2, respectively. Focal edema-like signal intensity adjacent to the vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> was noted in 8 out of 59 subjects by both readers and involved 11 and 10 out of 590 <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> by readers 1 and 2, respectively.

50|$|Miniature <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> {{potentials}} are {{the small}} (~0.4mV) depolarizations of the postsynaptic terminal {{caused by the}} release of a single vesicle into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter vesicles containing acetylcholine collide spontaneously with the nerve terminal and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction even without a signal from the axon. These small depolarizations are not enough to reach threshold and so an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane does not occur.During experimentation with MEPPs, it was noticed that often spontaneous action potentials would occur, called <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes in normal striated muscle without any stimulus. It was believed that these <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes occurred as a result of injury or irritation of the muscles fibers due to the electrodes. Recent experiments have shown that these <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes are actually caused by muscle spindles and have two distinct patterns: small and large. Small <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes have a negative onset without signal propagation and large <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes resemble motor unit potentials (MUPs).
