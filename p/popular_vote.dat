5|$|Final {{results of}} the <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> tally showed that Golkar, the former ruling party of the New Order era, {{received}} {{the largest number of}} votes. It had lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle in the 1999 legislative election. The Democratic Party and the Prosperous Justice Party, two of the newest parties to participate in the elections, received a combined 14.8 percent of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5|$|Goldwater {{lost the}} <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> {{in both the}} male and female {{electorate}} with 40% and 38%, respectively. Goldwater's most narrow regional loss was in the South, with 48% of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote,</b> but he lost by greater margins in the East, Midwest and West with 32%, 39% and 40% of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote,</b> respectively. Johnson was heavily favored over Goldwater among Catholics (76% to 24%), and by a smaller margin among Protestants (55% to 45%). Goldwater lost the Independent vote to Johnson (56% to 44%). Johnson won the white vote over Goldwater (59% to 41%) and was heavily favored by the nonwhite electorate (94% to 6%). Goldwater lost the college-educated, high school-educated and grade school-educated population to Johnson (52% to 48%, 62% to 38% and 66% to 34%, respectively).|$|E
40|$|In the US 2008 {{president}}ial election, Barack Obama {{was elected}} as the 44 th president of United States, winning the 53 % of <b>popular</b> <b>votes</b> and 68 % of electoral votes; {{in the election}} of 2000, Al Gore lost the election receiving 49 % of electoral votes, although he had more <b>popular</b> <b>votes.</b> It is generally believed that the electoral <b>votes</b> and the <b>popular</b> <b>votes</b> are correlated; however the detailed quantitative relationship for these two quantities is unclear. Here, we found an interesting relationship between fractions of electoral votes and fractions of <b>popular</b> <b>votes</b> in the presidential elections of the United States by examining the election results from 1932 to 2004. Moreover, this curve could provide an interesting explanation {{for the results of}} other elections that have taken place in Taiwan...|$|R

5|$|Hoosiers {{voted in}} favor of the Republicans in 1860, and in January 1861, Indiana's newly elected {{lieutenant}} governor, Oliver P. Morton, became governor after Henry Smith Lane resigned from the office to take a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate. Hoosiers also helped Abraham Lincoln win the presidency in the 1860 election and {{voted in favor}} of his re-election in 1864. Although Lincoln won only 40 percent of the country's <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> in the U.S. presidential election in 1860, he earned Indiana's 13 electoral votes with 51.09 percent of its <b>popular</b> <b>vote,</b> compared to Stephen Douglas's 42.44 percent, John Breckenridge's 4.52 percent, and John Bell's 1.95 percent. In the 1864 presidential election, Lincoln once again carried the state, this time by a wider margin, earning Indiana's electoral votes with 53.6 percent of the state's <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> compared to George McClellan's 46.4 percent.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Northwestern University law {{professor}} Robert Bennett suggested {{a plan in}} an academic publication to implement a National <b>Popular</b> <b>Vote</b> through a mechanism that would embrace state legislatures' power to appoint electors, rather than resist that power. By coordinating, states constituting {{a majority of the}} Electoral College could effectively implement a <b>popular</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, {{receiving}} 49.2percent of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> over Republican Bob Dole (40.7percent of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote)</b> and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4percent of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote),</b> {{becoming the}} first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once. The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the vote}} count, the Progressive Conservatives emerged with nine more seats than they {{held at the}} {{dissolution}} of the previous legislature. The party had won 69.5 percent of the <b>popular</b> <b>vote,</b> the highest <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> share ever attained by the PC party in the province. Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district. The next month Williams' Progressive Conservatives increased their seat count to 44 out of 48, after winning a deferred election in Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans following the death of Liberal candidate Gerry Tobin on October 1.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, John Koza, a {{computer}} {{science professor at}} Stanford, was the lead author of Every Vote Equal, a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National <b>Popular</b> <b>Vote.</b> (Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National <b>Popular</b> <b>Vote,</b> a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E

5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan.

These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> winner would also win the electoral college.|$|E
