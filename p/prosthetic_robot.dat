40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a brain-computer interface (BCI) {{system that was}} developed to allow direct cortical control of 7 active degrees of freedom in a robotic arm. Two monkeys with chronic microelectrode implants in their motor cortices {{were able to use}} the arm to complete an oriented grasping task under brain control. This BCI system was created as a clinical prototype to exhibit (1) simultaneous decoding of cortical signals for control of the 3 -D translation, 3 -D rotation, and 1 -D finger aperture of a robotic arm and hand, (2) methods for constructing cortical signal decoding models based on only observation of a moving robot, (3) a generalized method for training subjects to use complex BCI prosthetic robots using a novel form of operator-machine shared control, and (4) integrated kinematic and force control of a brain-controlled <b>prosthetic</b> <b>robot</b> through a novel impedance-based robot controller. This dissertation describes each of these features individually, how their integration enriched BCI control, and results from the monkeys operating the resulting system. Acknowledgment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Understanding the neuromuscular control under-lying human {{locomotion}} has {{the potential}} to deliver practical controllers for humanoid and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>robots.</b> However, neu-rocontrollers developed in forward dynamic simulations are seldom applied as practical controllers due to their lack of robustness and adaptability. A key element for robust and adaptive locomotion is swing leg placement. Here we integrate a previously identified robust swing leg controller into a full neuromuscular human walking model and demonstrate that the integrated model has largely improved behaviors including walking on very rough terrain (± 10 cm) and stair climbing (15 cm stairs). These initial results highlight the potential of the identified robust swing control. We plan to generalize it to a range of human locomotion behaviors critical in rehabilitation robotics. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cable-conduit {{mechanism}} (CCM) or tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM) {{is widely}} used in many flexible robotic systems such as <b>prosthetic</b> hand <b>robots,</b> rehabilitation robots, and surgical robots because it offers efficient transmission of forces/torques from the external actuator to the end effector with light weight and high flexibility. However, the accurate position control is challenging in such mechanism due to friction and backlash-like hysteresis between the cable and the conduit. In this paper, a new control approach is proposed to enhance the trajectory tracking performances of the CCM using in flexible robotic systems. Unlike current approaches for the CCM in the literature, the proposed scheme considers the position transmission of the CCM as an approximation of backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities without requiring the exact values of model parameters and their bounds. Online estimation of unknown system parameters are also established. In addition, the designed controller can adapt to any changes of the cable-conduit configuration and it is stable. The results of the proposed control techniques have been experimentally validated on a real flexible robotic system using a flexible endoscope. Experimental validations show substantial improvements on the performances of position tracking {{for the use of}} CCM regardless of the arbitrary changes of the cable-conduit configurations.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{interaction}} learning method for collaborative and assistive robots based on movement primitives. The method allows for both action recognition and human–robot movement coordination. It uses imitation learning {{to construct a}} mixture model of human–robot interaction primitives. This probabilistic model allows the assistive trajectory of the robot to be inferred from human observations. The method is scalable {{in relation to the}} number of tasks and can learn nonlinear correlations between the trajectories that describe the human–robot interaction. We evaluated the method experimentally with a lightweight robot arm in a variety of assistive scenarios, including the coordinated handover of a bottle to a human, and the collaborative assembly of a toolbox. Potential applications of the method are personal caregiver robots, control of intelligent <b>prosthetic</b> devices, and <b>robot</b> coworkers in factories...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Transfemoral amputees {{modify their}} gait {{in order to}} {{compensate}} for their prosthetic leg. This compensation causes harmful secondary physical conditions due to an over-dependence on the intact limb and deficiencies of the prosthesis. Even with more advanced prostheses, amputees still have to alter their gait {{to compensate for the}} prosthesis. We present a novel way to quantify how much an amputee has to compensate for a prosthetic leg. We train a newly-developed <b>prosthetic</b> leg testing <b>robot</b> to walk with a prosthesis using an evolutionary algorithm called biogeography-based optimization (BBO). The robot is initially commanded to follow able-bodied hip and thigh trajectories, and BBO then modifies these reference inputs. We adjust the reference inputs to minimize the error between the ground reaction force (GRF) of able-bodied gait data, and that of the robot while walking with the prosthesis. Experimental results show a 62 % decrease in the GRF error, effectively demonstrating the robot’s compensation for the prosthesis. I...|$|R
30|$|Generally, BCI systems must support three functions: data acquisition, data processing, and {{prosthetic}} control. In this way, {{system requirements}} {{of this study}} are similar to previous work in this area. In our case, the design must support the following generic functionality: (1) collection of empirical neurophysiological data from a live subject - person, monkey, or mouse - facilitated by data acquisition hardware; (2) delivery of collected data from the sources to the appropriate processing modules via network environments such as a local area network (LAN); (3) extraction of relevant information from the raw empirical data; (4) feeding of data into a BMM spiking neural network simulator, here NEURON [12]; and (5) support for both online and offline processing modes. These two processing modes are discussed further below as they are critical requirements of the system. This prototype does not deal with; (6) feeding of the BMM output into a physical <b>prosthetic</b> device (e.g., <b>robot</b> arm), which we have previously dealt with in a study of a real-time interface between a BMM and a robotic arm [10].|$|R
40|$|Knob turning is {{a common}} task that should {{influence}} the design of human-machine interfaces such as <b>prosthetic</b> arms, teleoperated <b>robots,</b> and virtual environments. This study examines the following metrics for a specified knob rotation: turning strategy, including arm motions used and number of grasps made, time used to complete the motion, and maximum applied forces and torques. The subjects’ task was to rotate a one-degree-of freedom haptic knob at least 270 degrees for two angles of attack (hand parallel versus perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} knob), three knob sizes, and three motor gains. Results on the initial 260 de-grees of rotation show that a more distal arm motion is used for a parallel angle of attack, decreased knob size, and in-creased gain. Further, a change in the angle of attack af-fects each metric, {{with the exception of the}} maximum z-axis force and the maximum lateral torque. A variation in the knob size modulates each metric, with the exception of the maximum z-axis torque and the maximum lateral force. A modification of the motor gain influences the outcomes of all of the metrics. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an effective}} feature extraction technique for sEMG signals. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is {{the recording of}} a muscle’s electrical activity {{from the surface of}} the skin. The signal contains information that is related to the anatomy and physiology of the muscle. In clinical applications, the signal is used for the diagnosis of neuro-muscular diseases and disorders. Another application of sEMG is for device control application where the signal is used for controlling devices such as <b>prosthetic</b> devices, <b>robots,</b> and human – machine interfaces. Signal classification is used to extract relevant information that represent a particular state (or class) of the sEMG signal. This stater (or class) of the sEMG depicts the information about the underlying pathology or is used as control input for other devices. Therefore it is important that the sEMG is classified in to the relevant class with high accuracy to ensure reliable application in a given field. Many researchers have attempted to improve the classification accuracy of the sEMG signal. Generally the number of electrodes attached to the surface of the skin also needs to be increased in order to increase the classification accuracy. In some cases this number becomes prohibitively high. On the other hand, with a decrease in the number of electrodes the classification accuracy has been reported to decrease. In order to overcome these challenges, in this thesis a new feature extraction technique has been developed. As opposed to the established global time or frequency domain analysis of the sEMG signal, the technique developed in this thesis relies on the well established volume conduction model of sEMG generation. Developed feature extraction technique is then applied to sEMG recorded from low level digital contraction with low signal to noise ratio. A high classification rate of approximately 93 % in four classes of low level contraction was achieved by using single channel of sEMG recording. It was further established that the placement of electrode did not have significant effect on the accuracy and reliability of the classification. Further developments that may improve on the methods established in this thesis are presented in the end...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of the research on}} linkage-based fingertips for prosthetic hands. These fingertips {{consists of}} small polycentric mechanisms attached to what would be the pulp in normal anatomical fingers. These mechanisms allow the prosthetic hand to conform to the shape of objects during grasp. The goal of these prosthetic fingertips is to maximize the functionality of the hand while minimizing the number of inputs that the user has to control. The stability of the fingertip mechanisms is analyzed using the principle of virtual work. From this analysis we are able to show that the fingertip mechanism is stable for a large range of rotation of the link and for a large range of directions on which the force is applied, and that the mechanism is indifferent to the magnitude of the force applied to it (assuming that the force does not damage/deform the mechanism). To assess if the four-bar mechanisms (fingertips) improve the grasping capabilities in robotics and prosthetics, tests were performed on <b>prosthetic</b> hands and <b>robot</b> grippers with and without the fingertips. Comparisons were made using the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) protocol, which tests the differences and measures the functionality of particular types of grasp, such as power, spherical, lateral, tripod, tip and extension. In the human testing, the overall Index of Functionality (IOF) of the Hosmer hook is 66. 65 and 66. 21 for the hook with the fingertips. The hook with the fingertips had a better IOF in the spherical and power prehensile pattern. When the IOF is calculated for the tasks that the fingertips were used, in 10 of 11 of the tasks, the IOF is higher than using the Hosmer hook. In the robotic gripper testing, the Index of Functionality was not be calculated because the time to perform the tasks depended more on the robotic control system than on the physical characteristics of the gripper...|$|R
