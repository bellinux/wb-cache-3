25|$|As the {{practice}} of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have more confidence in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the Hôtel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted that the medical treatment be scientific, not just spiritual. As medical schools became more connected to hospitals, the bodies of patients were seen as objects of medical observation used to study and teach <b>pathological</b> <b>anatomy,</b> rather than just bodies in need of hospital care.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The Odontogenic Primary Intraosseous Carcinoma (PIOC) are a rare {{group of}} {{malignant}} tumours with strict clinic and <b>anatomy</b> <b>pathological</b> diagnosis criteria. The different classification suggested for these tumours {{and the small}} amount of cases described in literature makes it hard to know exactly how many of the cases published until now are real. Material and methods: We present three new cases of PIOC originated from a previous cystic lesion that where treated in our Hospital. Two of them in the posterior jaw region where is more frequent, and the third in the upper jaw. We explain the procedure we used in each case and the aesthetic-functional reconstruction used witches are two fibula osseomiocutaneous free flaps and a bone graft of iliac crest and further placing of implants. The classification, the clinical and radiological diagnosis, the treatment and its survival are discussed. Results: in all three cases we were able to see in the <b>anatomy</b> <b>pathological</b> study an epithelial, exclusively without surrounding oral mucosa affectation or tissues near the lesion as well as the lack of tumorous pathology {{in other parts of the}} body. One of the patients died because of premature massive cervical recidiva while the other two patients are currently free form illness, for ten years one of them and fifteen months the other. Conclusions: the <b>anatomy</b> <b>pathological</b> study of all of the lesions of cystic characteristics at jaw level is very important because of the risk of coexisting with carcinomatous cells. The treatment of these tumours consists in practising aggressive surgery and, in some cases, radio and/or chemotherapy post intervention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Diffusion-Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging is {{a popular}} imaging {{modality}} for reconstructing the nerve fiber structure in the brain. In recent years many fiber tracking algorithms have been proposed, but {{little research has been}} done comparing them and evaluating their suitability for pathological neuroanatomy. We present a modeling tool for designing normal and abnormal neuroanatomical features and for synthesizing diffusion tensor imaging data from it in order to compare fiber tractography algorithms. Initial results indicate that our modeling techniques make it easy to simulate DTI data sets for healthy and <b>pathological</b> brain <b>anatomy.</b> We compared three simple fiber tractography algorithms using our synthesized data and we obtained similar results as reported in the literature for more basic artificial DTI data sets...|$|R
40|$|SummaryConventional, static {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is able to provide {{a vast amount of}} information regarding the anatomy and pathology of the musculoskeletal system. However, patients, especially those whose pain is position dependent or elucidated by movement, may benefit from more advanced imaging techniques that allow for the acquisition of functional information. This manuscript reviews a variety of advancements in MRI techniques that are used to image the musculoskeletal system dynamically, while in motion or under load. The methodologies, advantages and drawbacks of stress MRI, cine-phase contrast MRI and real-time MRI are discussed as each has helped to advance the field by providing a scientific basis for understanding normal and <b>pathological</b> musculoskeletal <b>anatomy</b> and function. Advancements in dynamic MR imaging will certainly lead to improvements in the understanding, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. It is difficult to anticipate that dynamic MRI will replace conventional MRI, however, dynamic MRI may provide additional valuable information to findings of conventional MRI...|$|R

The heart of an infant who [...] "died after taking a few breaths" [...] had several tumours. He called these tumours [...] "myomata", one of which was the [...] "size of a pigeon's egg". He also noted the brain had [...] "a great number of scleroses". These were almost certainly the cardiac rhabdomyomas and cortical tubers of tuberous sclerosis. He failed to recognise a distinct disease, regarding it as a pathological-anatomical curiosity. Von Recklinghausen's name would instead become associated with neurofibromatosis after a classic paper in 1881.|$|E

40|$|Hemodynamics {{has long}} been {{identified}} as {{a major factor in the}} determination and localization of atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerosis is focal and often forms in specific locations in the arterial tree such as bifurcations. Many different aspects of fluid mechanics have been suggested as the trigger for atherogenesis- non-laminar and/or unstable flow, flow separation, regions of higher/lower and/or oscillatory shear stress etc. While the precise mechanism by which these hemodynamic factors act is not yet clear, the fact that they correlate highly with atherogenesis suggests that local disturbances in flow through blood vessels can promote arterial disease. These issues have become increasingly acute as physicians seek to alter the <b>pathological</b> arterial <b>anatomy</b> with bypass grafting or endovascular manipulations such as angioplasty or stenting.

40|$|Abstract Background MRI {{has proven}} to be an {{extremely}} valuable tool in the assessment of normal and <b>pathological</b> spinal <b>anatomy.</b> Accordingly, it is commonly used to assess containment of discal material by the outer fibers of the anulus fibrosus and posterior longitudinal ligaments. Determination of such containment is important to determine candidacy for intradiscal techniques and has prognostic significance. The accuracy of MRI in detecting containment has been insufficiently documented. Methods The MRI's of fifty consecutive patients undergoing open lumbar microdiscectomy were prospectively evaluated for disc containment by a neuroradiologist and senior spinal surgeon using criteria available in the literature and the classification of Macnab/McCulloch. An independent surgeon then performed the surgery and documented the actual containment status using the same methods. Statistical evaluation of accuracy was undertaken. Results MRI was found to be 72 % sensitive, 68 % specific, and 70 % accurate in detecting containment status of lumbar herniated discs. Conclusion MRI may be inaccurate in assessing containment status of lumbar disc herniations in 30 % of cases. Given the importance of containment for patient selection for indirect discectomy techniques and intradiscal therapies, coupled with prognostic significance; other methods to assess containment should be employed to assess containment when such alternative interventions are being considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|Laminitis is {{the most}} serious disease of the equine hoof and will be used here to {{illustrate}} how <b>pathological</b> changes in <b>anatomy</b> lead to devastating changes in function. The simplest definition of laminitis is: failure of the attachment between the distal phalanx (coffin bone) and the inner hoof wall. A horse has laminitis when the lamellae of the inner hoof wall, which normally suspend the distal phalanx from the inner surface of the hoof capsule, fail. Without the distal phalanx properly attached {{to the inside of the}} hoof, the weight of the horse and the forces of locomotion drive the bone down into the hoof capsule, shearing and damaging arteries and veins, crushing the corium of the sole and coronet, causing unrelenting pain and a characteristic lameness (Fig 1).

6000|$|It may be added, {{that it is}} {{not easy}} to see in what way it could have benefited a {{physician}} of Alexander's time to know all that Aristotle knew on these subjects. His human anatomy was too rough to avail much in diagnosis; his physiology was too erroneous to supply data for pathological reasoning. But when the Alexandrian school, with Erasistratus and Herophilus at their head, turned to account the opportunities of studying human structure, afforded to them by the Ptolemies, the value of the large amount of accurate knowledge thus obtained to the surgeon for his operations, and to the physician for his diagnosis of internal disorders, became obvious, and a connection was established between anatomy and medicine, which has ever become closer and closer. Since the revival of learning, surgery, medical diagnosis, and anatomy have gone hand in hand. Morgagni called his great work, [...] "De sedibus et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis," [...] and not only showed the way to search out the localities and the causes of disease by anatomy, but himself travelled wonderfully far upon the road. Bichat, discriminating the grosser constituents of the organs and parts of the body, one from another, pointed out the direction which modern research must take; until, at length, histology, a science of yesterday, as it seems to many of us, has carried the work of Morgagni as far as the microscope can take us, and has extended the realm of <b>pathological</b> <b>anatomy</b> to the limits of the invisible world.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of middle-ear disease on hearing in mice {{is not well}} understood. We investigated middle-ear function and structure in {{a small group of}} dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) - knockout mice, which are known to be susceptible to middle-ear disease. We measured auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) thresholds, as well as sound-induced umbo velocity, and used standard histological techniques to study normal and <b>pathological</b> middle-ear <b>anatomy.</b> Anatomical analyses included observation of tympanic membrane and ossicular structures, reconstruction of middle ear volume, and estimation of the volume of lightly or darkly stained middle-ear fluid. Lightly stained fluid in diseased ears was located throughout the middle ear, whereas darkly stained fluid, when present, was usually seen near the round window. The ABR and DPOAE thresholds and the umbo velocity produced by lower- and middle-frequency sound stimuli were strongly correlated with middle-ear air volume. The volume of darkly stained fluid was correlated with the DPOAE and ABR thresholds for lower- and middle-frequency sounds. The volume of lightly stained fluid was correlated with the umbo velocity in the middle and upper frequencies. Regression analyses between the thresholds and velocity show the DPOAE threshold about twice the ABR threshold in the middle frequencies, while the ABR threshold was roughly inversely proportional to the umbo velocity at lower stimulus frequencies. The correlations between histological and functional results are consistent with a decrease in middle-ear air volume and the presence of lightly stained fluid affecting the motion of the TM, while the darkly stained fluid near the round window acts to reduce the middle ear vibrations that reach the cochlea. The inverse relationship between the ABR threshold and the umbo velocity is consistent with a conductive hearing loss produced by reduced middle-ear air volume. by Suh-Kyung Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

This property allows for the simulation not only of the healthy or diseased states, but also of the entire range in between. Moreover, these models permit simulation of different strategies of clinical intervention. Flow through the models was investigated using both qualitative (flow visualization) and quantitative (flow and pressure readings) tools. Flow separation and vascular resistance in one location of the arterial tree varied with geometrical alterations in another.

Boundary layer separation and vascular resistance in one location of the arterial tree varied with geometrical alterations in another. In-vivo models were developed that allowed investigation of the effect of side branch occlusion or dilation on the acute and chronic outcome of main branch stenting in a bifurcation. Chronic side branch occlusions were protective of main branch stenting as reflected by a reduction in in-stent neo-intimal hyperplasia. (cont.) This protective influence was mediated by an acute modulation of monocyte adhesion and accumulation on the lateral wall of the main branch, correlating with the location of flow disturbance demonstrated by the flow models. Chronic main branch vascular remodeling plays a major role in achieving this beneficial effect. The results of this study could have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term follow-up of the large number of patients who suffer from complex arterial diseases and undergo vascular interventions.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a major}} cause of mortality, {{resulting}} in an estimated 7. 6 million deaths every year all over the world. 1 Conventional coronary angiography (CCA) is the only undisputed means of visualizing the coronary arterial system in vivo and is regarded the gold standard for the assess-ment of modality of coronary arteries since CCA was first dis-covered by Werner Forssmann in 1929. 2 However, CCA has its limitations. It gives only information of the site and degree of luminal narrowing, providing no data on the extent of atheroscle-rotic change within the vessel wall. Images are obtained in only 2 dimensions, although the use of multiple projections enables a more comprehensive assessment of an individual lesion. In addi-tion, the coronary arteries move in a complex pattern during each cardiac cycle. Each coronary artery moves at a different velocity and in a different pattern from the others, and even the individual segments of each coronary arteries do not move uniformly. 3 All these reasons may mislead the disease assessment. 4, 5 As the gold standard, the diagnostic accuracy of CCA is not clear. As we know, the real gold standard to diagnose the coronary artery disease is the <b>pathological</b> coronary artery <b>anatomy</b> (PCA), which is almost impossible to perform because the heart samples were hard to obtain. The application of heart transplantation gave us a chance to collect these heart samples after transplantation for postoperative PCA examination.
