5|$|The name Level Mountain is a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level Mountain Range on August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report <b>Physiography</b> of the Canadian Cordillera, With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level Mountain is a small prominent mountain range on the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this misinterpretation, Level Mountain is still the local name for the entire massif and the Level Mountain Range for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{environmental}} uncertainty due to anthropogenic climate change, islands are at {{the front lines of}} global change, threatened by sea level rise, habitat alteration, extinctions and declining biodiversity. Islands also stand at the forefront of scientiﬁc study for understanding the deep history of human ecodynamics and to build sustainable future systems. We summarize the long history of human interactions with Polynesian, Mediterranean, Californian and Caribbean island ecosystems, documenting the effects of various waves of human settlement and socioeconomic systems, from hunter–gatherer–ﬁshers,to agriculturalists, to globalized colonial interests. We identify degradation of island environments resulting from human activities, as well as cases of human management of resources to enhance productivity and create more sustainable systems.

40|$|Abstract: Japan {{and south}} eastern Australia {{have a large}} exotic flora in common, in spite of {{contrasting}} histories, <b>physiographies</b> and land-use patterns. There are some 187 common invading species and at least 71 of these are widespread in both locations. Some 15 widespread exotic invaders in Japan have not been recorded in Australia {{and a number of}} native Japanese plants that could be introduced as ornamentals and escape cultivation are noted. The incursion of most exotic species to Japan has been historically recent. The lack of quarantine for plants (apart from parasitic plants and plants infected with disease) coupled with large importations of wheat and soybeans from north America and contaminated grain and fodder for farm animals has led to an exponential rate of plant invasion in Japan. The apparent lack of impact of woody invading species in Japanese forests and forests margins may be due simply to the relatively short time invading species (some with long juvenile periods) have been naturalised.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{forests of}} the Pacific Coasts of Chocó are timber {{suppliers}} for Colombia. The floodable plant associations have been poorly investigated. To contribute with ecological basis for their management, {{the aim of this}} study was to learn about the differences between the forests of three <b>physiographies</b> and how the flood level explains them, comparing these forests with other of the neotropic. Three parcels of 0. 5 ha were stablished y and individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm were measured. The most common species is Oenocarpus bataua in well drained zones and Campnosperma panamensis in permanently flooded or swamp. The principal components analysis separated the three communities; the first and the second components explained 48 % and 26 % of the total variation, respectively. There is a high species richness and density of small and medium tall trees in the terrace and hill, in contrast with the low richness in the swamp zone with hyperdominance of one species and a bigger basal area. The dominance of species well adapted to stress caused by hydric excess in the swamp evidenced an environmental filter, that determines a composition and structure particular in the swamp. The studied forests have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other forests of low tropical lands, in particular, a high tree density, less species richness and lower mean wood density compared with Amazonia forests...|$|R

25|$|The {{varieties}} {{of the forests}} that exist in Sundarbans include mangrove scrub, littoral forest, saltwater mixed forest, brackish water mixed forest and swamp forest. Besides the forest, there are extensive areas of brackish water and freshwater marshes, intertidal mudflats, sandflats, sand dunes with typical dune vegetation, open grassland on sandy soils and raised areas supporting a variety of terrestrial shrubs and trees. Since Prain's report there have been considerable changes in the status of various mangrove species and taxonomic revision of the man-grove flora. However, very little exploration of the botanical nature of the Sundarbans {{has been made to}} keep up with these changes. Differences in vegetation have been explained in terms of freshwater and low salinity influences in the Northeast and variations in drainage and siltation. The Sundarbans has been classified as a moist tropical forest demonstrating a whole mosaic of seres, comprising primary colonisation on new accretions to more mature beach forests. Historically vegetation types have been recognised in broad correlation with varying degrees of water salinity, freshwater flushing and <b>physiography.</b>|$|E
500|$|The <b>physiography</b> is characterised by hill ranges, {{valleys and}} plains.

40|$|The {{calcification}} of {{soils and}} the effects of topography on this process were studied in semi-arid regions of Kermanshah. From a toposequence, based on the previous soil surveys of the region, five profiles were selected, and field studies and laboratory analyses were carried out on soils. Alluvial - colluvial fans, piedmont alluvial plains, and old plateaux were three main <b>physiographies</b> on the selected toposequence. Soil moisture and temperature regimes were Xeric and Thermic, respectively. The results indicate that redistribution of carbonates and soil formation processes may be categorized in four specific stages to be described in the text. Accumulation of calcium carbonates in soil profiles showed two basic forms: one in sandy layers of fine - textured soil profiles under the influence of abrupt textural changes and lower permeability, and the second in subsurface horizons of soils with calcareous parent material. The morphological evidences showed that in addition to translocation from upper horizons of carbonates by solution and suspension, physical movements to subsurface layers of fine calcareous materials have also affected the formation of calcic horizons. In other words, CaCO 3 may have moved as fine particles through soil cracks and subsequently accumulated in the lower horizons. Soil mineralogy showed considerable amounts of illite, Chlorite, smectite and palygorskite clay minerals. Some pedogenic transformations of illite and chlorite may have caused formation of smectite and palygorskite...|$|R
40|$|The Maldive Ridge is a {{volcanic}} lineament overlain by locally 3. 3 km of mostly shallow-water carbonate sediments. The Maldive basement appears on seismic profiles as {{a volcanic}} plateau generated during two distinct eruptive phases separated by {{an episode of}} tectonic deformation. This deformation created a series of en-echelon pull-apart structures along the ridge acoustic basement and {{can be related to}} intraplate compression following the initial stages of the India-Asia collision. The deformation possibly triggered the extrusion of the basaltic flows overlying the acoustic basement and constituting the lithologic basement of the Maldive carbonate system. Widespread neritic carbonate sedimentation was initiated during the Eocene when the broad and relatively flat volcanic substrate started sinking below sea level. In spite of the lava flow extrusion, the initial depressions corresponding to the structural pull-apart basins remained as deep internal seaways surrounded by reefal margins until the late Oligocene. The Eocene-Early Oligocene depositional signature remained essentially aggradational and corresponds to a first transgressive cycle associated with a second-order sea-level rise. In the mid-Oligocene, a pronounced sea-level fall matching the development of a major ice sheet in Antarctica restricted the sedimentation to the internal basins. During the following transgression, the neritic carbonate system temporarily kept up with the sea-level rise, but was finally drowned near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. In the early Miocene, pelagic ooze deposition covered the Paleogene neritic system and transformed the central troughs into one single deep basin, the paleo-Inner Sea. During the Neogene, following the establishment of a reef framework near the present location of the platform edge, systematic progradations of carbonate bank margins toward the central Inner Sea basin correspond to a long-term sea-level fall associated with a second-order regressive cycle. Segmentation of the prograding complex into individual carbonate banks occurred through local channeling and drowning events. Finally, the late Pliocene-Pleistocene depositional signature is mainly aggradational and corresponds to a regional modification from flat-topped carbonate banks to atoll <b>physiographies.</b> The onset of high-frequency eustatic and climatic changes following the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation explains this evolution...|$|R
40|$|Black shales, perhaps {{owing to}} their {{seemingly}} homogeneous nature, are mainly interpreted {{on the basis}} of their unusual geochemical characteristics. Their physical record is mostly neglected as a source of information. It has now been amply demonstrated, experimentally and analytically, that many black shales were deposited by physical processes comparable to those that shape coarser grained sediments, i. e. transport and deposition by currents may play a role as well. Black shales are not necessarily the product of sedimentation in quiet, stagnant water and, therefore, the a priori interpretation of such conditions is not valid. These lithologies are more varied than their generic name implies and, in addition to geochemical data, their physical record is an important source of independent information. Black shales are common sedimentary products during periods associated with supercontinent breakup, large-scale volcanic activity and high sea levels. Such periods are associated with greenhouse climates, enhanced nutrient supply to seawater, both a result of volcanism and its byproducts, and extensive shelves. Thus, the overall tendency of marine sediments, in particular in relatively shallow water settings, to become enriched in organic matter during specific periods in Earth’s history, may be ascribed to global forcing mechanisms. These periods are referred to as oceanic anoxic events—not implying, however, global ocean anoxia. It is often asserted that the deposition of black shales during oceanic anoxic events was global and synchronous. The geographical distribution of black shales shows this not to be the case. Storage of organic carbon in geographically definite areas of the seafloor has, nevertheless, led to perturbations in the global carbon cycle, which, in turn, have been recorded in sediments globally as excursions in the carbon isotope record irrespective of lithology. Black shale deposition was regionally favoured in basins with <b>physiographies</b> and hydrological regimes that promoted organic productivity and organic matter preservation, i. e. vigorous overturning circulation, estuarine circulation patterns and enhanced Ekman-induced upwelling. Whether marine sediments are enriched in organic matter or not, regardless of global and regional forcing mechanisms, ultimately depends on local sedimentary processes. These control the type and proportion of sedimentary components in the final sediment and, therefore, its organic richness and its petrological characteristics. Different combinations of these processes may lead to very different sedimentary products. Cretaceous oceanic red beds, although a different sedimentary product, are similarly largely dependent on local processes. The global mechanisms that promoted their deposition in specific time intervals remain enigmatic, but the laterally and vertically diachronous rubefaction of different lithologies in marine sedimentary sequences shows that—if synchronous global mechanisms exist that can force the system towards the full oxidation of marine sediments—the local response can nonetheless be diachronous. Thus, palaeoceanographical interpretations and correlations based on the appearance of such rubefaction in a sedimentary sequence do not allow inferences regarding the exact timing of the global mechanisms behind their formation. The products of marine sedimentation at any given location are the result of a complex interplay of global, regional and local factors and processes. Even though global and regional forcing mechanisms may explain the temporal distribution of black shales and red beds, their geographical distribution and physical characteristics underline the importance of local processe...|$|R

This is conformable with some regional tectonic interpretations that put a major terrane boundary between the Olympics and the Puget Lowland, and imply a connection (either via the Discovery Bay Fault, or closer to Port Townsend) to the various faults in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

2500|$|Trenches are centerpieces of the {{distinctive}} <b>physiography</b> of a convergent plate margin. Transects across trenches yield asymmetric profiles, with relatively gentle (~5°) outer (seaward) slopes and a steeper (~10–16°) inner (landward) slopes. [...] This asymmetry {{is due to}} the fact that the outer slope is defined by the top of the downgoing plate, which must bend as it starts its descent. [...] The great thickness of the lithosphere requires that this bending be gentle. As the subducting plate approaches the trench, it first bends upwards to form the outer trench swell, then descends to form the outer trench slope. The outer trench slope is typically disrupted by a set of sub-parallel normal faults that 'staircase' the seafloor down to the trench. The plate boundary is defined by the trench axis itself. Beneath the inner trench wall, the two plates slide past each other along the subduction decollement, the seafloor intersection of which defines the trench location. The overriding plate typically contains a volcanic arc and forearc region. The volcanic arc is caused by physical and chemical interactions between the subducted plate at depth and asthenospheric mantle associated with the overriding plate. The forearc lies between the trench and the volcanic arc. Globally, forearcs have the lowest heatflow from the interior Earth because there is no asthenosphere (convecting mantle) between the forearc lithosphere and the cold subducting plate.|$|E
