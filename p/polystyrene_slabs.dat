When material is bent it is necessary to determine its bending modulus. Bending modulus is determined according to the force-deflection curve, by fixing loads and deflections. Results of expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> bending modulus of elasticity are presented in this article. Bending modulus of elasticity was fixed experimentally by 3 and 4 point bending methods.

40|$|Imaging through {{scattering}} media is encountered in many disciplines or sciences, ranging from biology, mesescopic physics and astronomy. But {{it is still}} a big challenge because light suffers from multiple scattering is such media and can be totally decorrelated. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based method that can retrieve the image of a target behind a thick scattering medium. The method uses a trained deep neural network to fit the way of mapping of objects at one side of a thick scattering medium to the corresponding speckle patterns observed at the other side. For demonstration, we retrieve the images of a set of objects hidden behind a 3 mm thick white <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slab,</b> the optical depth of which is 13. 4 times of the scattering mean free path.

40|$|Portal {{dosimetry}} using electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) {{is often}} applied to verify high-energy photon beam treatments. Due {{to the change}} in photon energy spectrum, the resulting dose values are, however, not very accurate {{in the case of}} wedged beams if the pixel-to-dose conversion for the situation without wedge is used. A possible solution would be to consider a wedged beam as another photon beam quality requiring separate beam modeling of the dose calculation algorithm. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a more practical solution: to make aSi EPID-based dosimetry models also applicable for wedged beams without an extra commissioning effort of the parameters of the model. For this purpose two energy-dependent wedge multiplication factors have been introduced to be applied for portal images taken with and without a patient/phantom in the beam. These wedge multiplication factors were derived from EPID and ionization chamber measurements at the EPID level for wedged and nonwedged beams, both with and without a <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slab</b> phantom in the beam. This method was verified for an EPID dosimetry model used for wedged beams at three photon beam energies (6, 10, and 18 MV) by comparing dose values reconstructed in a phantom with data provided by a treatment planning system (TPS), as a function of field size, depth, and off-axis distance. Generally good agreement, within 2 %, was observed for depths between dose maximum and 15 cm. Applying the new model to EPID dose measurements performed during ten breast cancer patient treatments with wedged 6 MV photon beams showed that the average isocenter underdosage of 5. 3 % was reduced to 0. 4 %. Gamma-evaluation (global 3 %/ 3 mm) of these in vivo data showed an increase in percentage of points with gamma </= 1 from 60. 2 % to 87. 4 %, while gammamean reduced from 1. 01 to 0. 55. It can be concluded that, for wedged beams, the multiplication of EPID pixel values with an energy-dependent correction factor provides good agreement between dose values determined by an EPID and a TPS, indicating the usefulness of such a practical solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{expanded}} <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> bending strength and bending stress analysis {{are presented in}} this article. The influence neither of short- nor of long-term loads was estimated, therefore, the characteristic of bending strength is not circumstantial. Under the influence of short-term load the material slightly deforms {{but as soon as}} the load is eliminated, the deformation vanishes. However, permanent deformations causing collapse of macrostructures elements are also possible. It is proposed to use the characteristics of critical bending stress and critical deflection. These characteristics are estimated in the following way: specimens are periodically strained until certain deformations are achieved; if straining continues after having achieved these deformations, the bending stress diminishes and the specimen collapses...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{sandwich}} {{panels are}} commonly made of flat or lightly profiled steel faces and expanded polystyrene foam cores, and are increasingly used as roof and wall claddings in industrial and commercial buildings. Flexural wrinkling {{is often the}} governing criterion {{in the design of}} these panels. The use of lightly profiled faces is expected to increase the flexural wrinkling stress considerably whereas the presence of joints between the <b>polystyrene</b> foam <b>slabs</b> in the transverse direction introduces a reduction to the flexural wrinkling stress. Therefore a series of full scale experiments and finite element analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of lightly profiled faces and transverse joints on the flexural wrinkling stress of panels subjected to a lateral pressure loading. The results showed that properly designed lightly profiled panels provided considerable improvement to flexural wrinkling strength over flat panels whereas the presence of transverse joints caused a significant reduction to wrinkling strength.

50|$|There are {{two main}} thermal considerations. The first is the {{question}} of insulating a floor slab. In older buildings, concrete slabs cast directly on the ground can drain heat from a room. In modern construction, concrete slabs are usually cast above a layer of insulation such as expanded <b>polystyrene,</b> and the <b>slab</b> may contain underfloor heating pipes. However, there are still uses for a slab that is not insulated , typically in outbuildings which are not heated or cooled to room temperature. In those cases, casting the slab directly onto a rocky substrate will maintain the slab at or near the temperature of the substrate throughout the year, and can prevent both freezing and overheating.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of sample width and {{sidewalls}} on downward flame spread over extruded <b>polystyrene</b> (XPS) <b>slabs,</b> a series of laboratory-scale experiments were conducted. Flame shape, flame spread rate, mass loss rate and temperature were recorded. For XPS without sidewalls, the average maximum flame height (H) and average flame area per unit of width (A/w) rise linearly with an increase in sample width (w) and mass loss rate per unit of width. When sidewalls are absent, flame spread rate first drops and then rises with an increase in width. This trend is determined by gas-phase heat transfer. When sidewalls are present, flame spread rate increases with a rise in width, and solid-phase heat conduction determines the trend. Sidewall effects are comprised of four aspects: oxygen concentration near the sidewalls and gypsum board is low, which leads to reduced flame heat flux; upward and front air flow is intensified; the flame is stretched, and the surface flame is weakened; and molten XPS mass decreases. For narrow samples, H and A/w with sidewalls are higher than those without sidewalls, while the reverse was observed in wider samples. The mass loss rate, preheating length and average flame spread rate with sidewalls are smaller than those obtained without sidewalls. Flame spread acceleration with sidewalls occurs at a broader width than that without sidewalls. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 82 - 85). The current international standards and governmental regulations stipulate maximum {{impact sound insulation}} on construction slabs of buildings to increase acoustical comfort of interiors of dwellings as mentioned by Cost Action TU 0901 : 2014 study. In Turkey, the most common slab construction is one way hollow core slab with EPS filler. However, according to the feedback given by users who live in multi storey dwellings impact sound insulation of expanded <b>polystyrene</b> used construction <b>slabs</b> of dwellings is more than acceptable values. In the literature, there is not any information about impact sound insulation performance of one way hollow core slab with EPS filler {{and the effects of}} EPS density differences on impact sound so a comparative study on impact sound insulation of the one-way hollow core slab with EPS filler was conducted. The study aimed to determine what is impact sound insulation performance of expanded polystyrene fillers in one way hollow core slab system and the effect of density difference of EPS fillers in one way hollow core systems used in dwellings. The study has also highlighted the importance of missing impact sound isolation standards and regulations in Turkey. The research was based on TS EN ISO 10140 - 3 : 2011 laboratory measurement of impact sound insulation of building elements and the data collected was analyzed according to TS EN ISO 717 - 2 : 2013. A sample one way hollow core slab system which is used in real life constructions was designed and built with 16 kg/m 3 and 10 kg/ m 3 EPS fillers. The results showed that one way hollow core slab with EPS fillers demonstrate very low impact sound insulation performance when compared with recommended values, standards and regulations accepted by many European countries. In addition, it was observed that the impact sound insulation performance of 10 kg/m 3 expanded polystyrene filler in one way hollow core slab was better than the performance of 16 kg/ m 3 EPS filler. by Eray Erdemli.

40|$|The creep {{compliance}} of expanded polystyrene (EPS) slabs was studied {{with the aim}} of developing a simple way for prediction of long-term creep strain.

40|$|Article gives {{analysis}} of experimental results of water absorption by expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs.</b> The investigation {{was carried out}} applying different test methods. It was established that the most precise results of water absorption by expanded polystyrene are obtained when method of increased pressure is applied. Results obtained applying this method show that the water absorption of expanded polystyrene considerably increases when its density decreases. When the specimen is immersed, the largest amount of water is accumulated between the pores. Due to an even pressure distribution around {{the walls of the}} specimen, water does not push out the air, which is between the pores, and, therefore, a part of the specimen does not soak through. Moreover, spaces between expanded polystyrene pores usually interact, and, depending on the density of a product, the diameter of them may be up to few millimetres. When the specimen is withdrawn from water, {{all of a sudden the}} greatest amount of water retires from the spaces between the pores...|$|E
40|$|Construction of ISS {{will require}} more than 1000 hours of EVA. Outside of ISS during EVA, astronauts and cosmonauts {{are likely to be}} exposed to a large fluence of {{electrons}} and protons. Development of radiation protection guidelines requires the determination of the minimum energy of electrons and protons that penetrate the suits at various locations. Measurements of the water-equivalent thickness of both US. and Russian EVA suits were obtained by performing CT scans. Specific regions of interest of the suits were further evaluated using a differential range shift technique. This technique involved measuring thickness ionization curves for 6 -MeV electron and 155 -MeV proton beams with ionization chambers using a constant source-to-detector distance. The thicknesses were obtained by stacking <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> immediately upstream of the detector. The thicknesses of the 50 % ionizations relative to the maximum ionizations were determined. The detectors were then placed within the suit and the stack thickness adjusted until the 50 % ionization was reestablished.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{sustainability}} {{achievement in the}} building sector led {{to the use of}} crop-based insulation materials. Among these, raw products like plant straws bales can present elementary representative volumes (REVs) in the size order of several square centimeters. Fibers orientation may play an important role on material thermal behavior. Measuring their thermal conductivities with standard steady-state equipment can thus lead to some inaccuracies due to the necessity of resetting lower thickness samples. This paper presents a Guarded Hot Plate (GHP) apparatus designed to test high thickness samples, up to 40 cm, with an accuracy of 2 %. The different parts of the machine are described in details along with design process and challenges encountered. Temperature and heat flux measurements in the device represent critical design stages where optimal accuracy is needed in order to optimize the resulting global error. Regarding this, necessary numerical and experimental analyzes were conducted emphasizing on intrinsic systematic error assessment. To complete the study, some validations tests are performed on a reference material and other widely-spread <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs.</b> These tests take into account the optimal computation parameters resulting from the numerical analysis and the apparatus proved to be in accordance with accuracy requirements.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of this thesis, is that nanofeatures {{on the surface}} of an implant enhance bio-functionality. This work introduces several approaches to micro- and nano-patterning which are well-known in the MEMS and NEMS fields. Micro- and nano-engineering of materials like ceramics, polymers, silicon and titanium are presented. The work was part of the STW project NanoSurf. In the first part, micro structuring of ceramic materials, utilizing tape casting and micromoulding, techniques was found to be a useful method delivering micro-patterned bioceramics. Further, a novel nanofabrication method for ridges and grooves on biomaterials delivered highly ordered nanoscale patterns. To obtain nanofeatures on biomaterial surfaces, first Laser Interference Lithography was employed to define patterns in resist on silicon. Next the structures were transferred into silicon with multiple reactive ion etching (RIE) steps. Finally the surface features were reproduced into polymers and used for in vitro studies or copied by means of Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) onto biomedical grade titanium and etched with an optimized chlorinated plasma reactive ion etching (RIE) process. In the biological research the nanofabricated surfaces were explored in interaction with ECM proteins.

30|$|Carbon dioxide is {{the main}} {{contributor}} to GWP, with 27.61 Â kg CO 2 for MHM and 78.93 Â kg CO 2 for the brick wall. The main sources of non-biotic carbon are fossil fuel combustion in industrial processes and in electricity production. Compared to fossil carbon, biogenic carbon is emitted in minor quantity. Biogenic carbon dioxide emitted from brick wall production is lower (1.85 Â kg CO 2) than that of MHM wall since no wood biomass is involved in its production, while MHM biogenic CO 2 (4.95 Â kg CO 2) is mainly related to the fibreboards production. The method of evaluation of the biogenic emissions is still object of discussion at international level. Based on international standards and guidelines, the biogenic carbon dioxide is not accounted in LCA studies (carbon neutrality assumption) or is reported separately [45]. In this work the second option has been chosen. Methane has a GWP of 28 for a time horizon of 100 Â years [46] and is indeed the third highest greenhouse gas that is produced from both MHM (1.99 Â kg) and brick wall building systems (4.64 Â kg). Methane emissions for the brick wall are mainly caused by brick and <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> production, while for MHM the main methane emitting processes are electricity from non-renewable sources and aluminium manufacturing. The amount of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) emissions contributing to GWP derive from industrial activities and combustion and are comparable between the two processes. On the other hand, halogenated gases [chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs)] emissions are higher for MHM because of the aluminium manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Proton {{computed}} tomography (pCT) will enable accurate prediction of proton and ion range {{in a patient}} while providing the benefit of lower radiation exposure than in x-ray CT. The accuracy of the range prediction is essential for treatment planning in proton or ion therapy and depends upon the detector {{used to evaluate the}} water-equivalent path length (WEPL) of a proton passing through the object. A novel approach is presented for an inexpensive WEPL detector for pCT and proton radiography. Methods: A novel multistage detector with an aperture of 10 x 37. 5 cm was designed to optimize the accuracy of the WEPL measurements while simplifying detector construction and the performance requirements of its components. The design of the five-stage detector was optimized through simulations based on the GEANT 4 detector simulation toolkit, and the fabricated prototype was calibrated in water-equivalent millimeters with 200 MeV protons in the research beam line of the clinical proton synchrotron at Loma Linda University Medical Center. A special polystyrene step phantom was designed and built to speed up and simplify the calibration procedure. The calibrated five-stage detector was tested in the 200 MeV proton beam as part of the pCT head scanner, using a water phantom and <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> to verify the WEPL reconstruction accuracy. Results: The beam-test results demonstrated excellent performance of the new detector, in good agreement with the simulation results. The WEPL measurement accuracy is about 3. 0 mm per proton in the 0 - 260 mm WEPL range required for a pCT head scan with a 200 MeV proton beam. Conclusions: The new multistage design approach to WEPL measurements for proton CT and radiography has been prototyped and tested. The test results show that the design is competitive with much more expensive calorimeter and range-counter designs...|$|E
40|$|The {{percentage}} {{depth dose}} distributions in inhomogeneous phantoms with lung and bone equivalent media are studied. For lung equivalent media a Balsa wood is used, and for a soft bone equivalent media a compound material with epoxy resin, hardener and calcium carbonate is used. <b>Polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> put together with these materials are used as an inhomogeneous phantom. Dose measurements are performed with Gafchromic EBT film by using photon beams from 6 MV CyberKnife at the Seoul Uridul Hospital. The cone sizes of the photon beams are varied from 5, 10 to 30 mm. As a simulation tool GEANT 4 Monte Carlo code v 9. 4. p 02 is used. When the Balsa wood is inserted in the phantom, the dose measured with EBT film {{is found to be}} significantly different from the dose without the EBT film in and beyond the Balsa wood region, particularly for small field sizes. On the other hand, when the soft bone equivalent material is inserted in the phantom, discrepancy between the dose measured with EBT film and the dose without EBT film can be seen only in the region of bone equivalent material. GEANT 4 simulations are done with and without the EBT film to compare the simulation results with measurements. We find that the simulations including EBT film agree with the measurements for all the cases within an error of 2. 2 %. Also, we find the "doses to phantom" without the EBT film differ from the "doses to film" up to 29 %, which shows that for accurate dose estimations for inhomogeneous phantoms with EBT film the presence of the EBT film needs {{to be taken into account}} properly in particular for small fields...|$|E
40|$|Cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{has been widely}} adopted in clinical practice for image-guided radiotherapy. Soft tissue contrast and Hounsfield units are impaired {{to the presence of}} scattered radiation. In our previous work, we proposed a high selectivity anti-scatter grid (ASG) as a possible solution to the problem. An alternative approach is the application of iterative scatter correction using deconvolution with scatter point spread function (PSF). The purpose of this work was to compare the performance of ASGs with different selectivity with and without the iterative and uniform scatter corrections in terms of CBCT image quality. A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} develop a novel measurement approach to measure the scatter point spread functions. The scatter PSF was modeled as a sum of two bivariate Gaussian functions. The PSF parameters were estimated from a series of transmission measurements through <b>polystyrene</b> <b>slabs</b> of varying thickness with lead partial beam-blocker for three different ASG designs ranging from low (5. 6), medium (9), and high (11) selectivity. The scatter correction scheme is based on iterative convolution of the current estimate of the primary with the scatter PSF until the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the measured projection and the sum of the estimate of primary and scatter falls below a predefined threshold. The image quality was evaluated with the CIRS CBCT Image Quality and Electron Density phantom in a head and neck and pelvis configuration and the CIRS Virtual Male Human Patient. The image quality was quantified by the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) relative to the uncorrected scans and the root mean square deviation of the average gray values for different regions with respect to the nominal Hounsfield units and the mean difference of the reconstructed HU between the planning CT and CBCTs of the virtual human phantom. For the head and neck phantom, the CNR increased with more advanced scatter correction algorithm and the ASG selectivity, reaching 3. 9, 3. 7, 3. 5, and 3. 1 for the high, medium, light, and with no grid configuration, respectively, combined with the iterative software correction. The same is true for the pelvis phantom with CNR improvement reaching 1. 5 for the heavy and medium grid, 1. 3 for the light grid, and 1. 1 on its own. The HU RMSD for the head and neck phantom was 22 HU, 13 HU, 12 HU, and 6 HU for iterative correction without the grid, with the light grid, medium grid and the heavy grid, respectively. For same correction strategies, the values for the pelvis phantom where 170, 120, 34, and 27 HU. The average difference with the PCT of the virtual human phantom was 59 Â± 48 HU and 63 Â± 59 HU with scans reconstructed with the iterative correction and two higher selectivity grids. Visual inspection revealed similar trends for a head-and-neck and prostate cancer patient. The best scatter mitigation strategy was found to be a combination of a grid with selectivity larger than 9, combined with iterative scatter estimation. None of the investigated grids required increasing the imaging dose. The PSF determined using proposed method leads to image quality improvements results for all but one of the investigated scenario...|$|E
