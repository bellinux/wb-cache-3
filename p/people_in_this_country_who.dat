After William Hague announced his support for an [...] "election compact" [...] promoted by the Commission for Racial Equality in 2001, Forth {{was quoted as saying}} at a private dinner: [...] "All this sucking up to minorities is ridiculous; there are millions of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are white, Anglo-Saxon and bigoted {{and they need to be}} represented." [...] He opposed the BBC's spending money on a Nelson Mandela concert in 1988, saying [...] "those who want the arts and who support them should pay for them themselves". He also opposed the government spending on AIDS treatment, saying that the disease was [...] "largely self-inflicted". He was a fan of Elvis Presley and treasurer of the all-party Music Appreciation Group, and a couple of Presley's songs were played at Forth's memorial service in October 2006.|$|E

60|$|But her {{genius for}} expedients saved her from this humiliation. She had to {{purchase}} some sewing-cotton, {{and some other}} little things, and when she had bought them, she handed her bundle to {{the woman behind the}} counter, and asked her if she would not be so good as to have that wrapped up with the other things. It was a good deal to ask, she knew, and the woman smiled, for the articles she had bought would not make a package as large as her hand. However, her request was complied with, and she took away a very decent package, with the card of the store stamped on the outside. I suppose that there are not more than half a dozen <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would refuse Euphemia anything that she would be willing to ask for.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{remarkable}} how dominant is this disposition {{to get a}} phrase, a word, a simple recipe, for an undertaking so vast in reality that for {{all the rest of}} our lives a large part of the activities of us, forty million people, will be devoted to its partial accomplishment. In the presence of very great issues people become impatient and irritated, as they would not allow themselves to be irritated by far more limited problems. Nobody in his senses expects a panacea for the comparatively simple and trivial business of playing chess. Nobody wants to be told to [...] "rely wholly upon your pawns," [...] or [...] "never, never move your rook"; nobody clamours [...] "give me a third knight and all will be well"; but that is exactly what everybody seems to be doing in our present discussion And as another aspect of the same impatience, I note the disposition to clamour against all sorts of necessary processes in the development of a civilisation. For example, I read over and over again of the failure of representative government, and in nine cases out of ten I find that this amounts to a cry against any sort of representative government. It is perfectly true that our representative institutions do not work well and need a vigorous overhauling, but while I find scarcely any support for such a revision, the air is full of vague dangerous demands for aristocracy, for oligarchy, for autocracy. It is like a man who jumps out of his automobile because he has burst a tyre, refuses a proffered Stepney, and bawls passionately for anything--for a four-wheeler, or a donkey, as long as he can be free from that exploded mechanism. There are evidently quite a considerable number of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would welcome a tyrant at the present time, a strong, silent, cruel, imprisoning, executing, melodramatic sort of person, who would somehow manage everything while they went on--being silly. I find that form of impatience cropping up everywhere. I hear echoes of Mr. Blatchford's [...] "Wanted, a Man," [...] and we may yet see a General Boulanger prancing in our streets. There never was a more foolish cry. It is not a man we want, but just exactly as many million men as there are in Great Britain at the present time, and it is you, the reader, and I, and the rest of us who must together go on with the perennial task of saving the country by firstly, doing our own jobs just as well as ever we can, and secondly--and this is really just as important as firstly--doing our utmost to grasp our national purpose, doing our utmost, that is, to develop and carry out our National Plan. It is Everyman who must be the saviour of the State in a modern community; we cannot shift our share in the burthen; and here again, I think, is something that may well be underlined and emphasised. At present our [...] "secondly" [...] is unduly subordinated to our [...] "firstly"; our game is better individually than collectively; we are like a football team that passes badly, and our need is not nearly so much to change the players as to broaden their style. And this brings me, in a spirit entirely antagonistic, up against Mr. Galsworthy's suggestion of an autocratic revolution in the methods of our public schools.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I have made you angry with me," [...] he said, smiling. [...] "The {{blame for this}} little {{disturbance}} really rests with the public speakers who are afraid of you and who flatter you--especially if you belong to the working classes. You are not accustomed to have the truth told you to your faces. Why, my good friends, the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>who</b> are unworthy of the great trust which the wise and generous English constitution places in their hands, are so numerous {{that they can be}} divided into distinct classes! There is the highly-educated class which despairs, and holds aloof. There is the class beneath--without self-respect, and therefore without public spirit--which can be bribed indirectly, by the gift of a place, by the concession of a lease, even by an invitation to a party at a great house which includes the wives and the daughters. And there is the lower class still--mercenary, corrupt, shameless to the marrow of its bones--which sells itself and its liberties for money and drink. When I began this discourse, and adverted to great changes that are to come, I spoke of them as revolutionary changes. Am I an alarmist? Do I unjustly ignore the capacity for peaceable reformation which has preserved modern England from revolutions, thus far? God forbid that I should deny the truth, or that I should alarm you without need! But history tells me, if I look no farther back than to the first French Revolution, that there are social and political corruptions, which strike their roots in a nation so widely and so deeply, that no force short of the force of a revolutionary convulsion can tear them up and cast them away. And I do personally fear (and older and wiser men than I agree with me), that the corruptions at which I have only been able to hint, in this brief address, are fast extending themselves--in England, as well as in Europe generally--beyond the reach of that lawful and bloodless reform which has served us so well in past years. Whether I am mistaken in this view (and I hope with all my heart it may be so), or whether events yet in the future will prove that I am right, the remedy in either case, the one sure foundation on which a permanent, complete, and worthy reformation can be built--whether it prevents a convulsion or whether it follows a convulsion--is only to be found within the covers of this book. Do not, I entreat you, suffer yourselves to be persuaded by those purblind philosophers who assert that the divine virtue of Christianity is a virtue which is wearing out with the lapse of time. It is the abuse and corruption of Christianity that is wearing out--as all falsities and all impostures must and do wear out. Never, since Christ and his apostles first showed men the way to be better and happier, have the nations stood in sorer need of a return to that teaching, in its pristine purity and simplicity, than now! Never, more certainly than at this critical time, was it the interest as well as the duty of mankind to turn a deaf ear to the turmoil of false teachers, and to trust in that all-wise and all-merciful Voice which only ceased to exalt, console, and purify humanity, when it expired in darkness under the torture of the cross! Are these the wild words of an enthusiast? Is this the dream of an earthly Paradise in which it is sheer folly to believe? I can tell you of one existing community (one among others) which numbers some hundreds of persons; and which has found prosperity and happiness, by reducing the whole art and mystery of government to the simple solution set forth in the New Testament--fear God, and love thy neighbour as thyself." ...|$|E

[...] In a 2010 New York Times Book Review essay about the work, writer Jonathan Franzen calls it, [...] "the kind of book that, if it is for you, is really for you. I’m convinced that {{there are tens of}} thousands of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would bless the day the book was published, if only they could be exposed to it." [...] Franzen says of the novel's internal style, [...] "Its prose ranges from good to fabulously good — is lyrical in the true sense, every observation and description bursting with feeling, meaning, subjectivity — and although its plotting is unobtrusively masterly, the book operates at a pitch of psychological violence that makes Revolutionary Road look like Everybody Loves Raymond. And, worse yet, can never stop laughing at that violence![...] [...]The book intrudes on our better-regulated world like a bad dream from the grandparental past.

5000|$|In April 2012, Juan Carlos faced {{criticism}} for making an elephant-hunting trip in Botswana. Spaniards {{found out about}} the trip only after the King injured himself and a special aircraft was sent to bring him home. Spanish officials stated that the expenses of the trip were not paid by taxpayers or by the palace, but by Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a businessman of Syrian origin. Cayo Lara Moya of the United Left party said the king's trip [...] "demonstrated a lack of ethics and respect toward many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are suffering a lot" [...] while Tomas Gomez of the Socialist party said Juan Carlos should choose between [...] "public responsibilities or an abdication". In April 2012, Spain's unemployment was at 23 percent and nearly 50 percent for young workers. El País estimated the total cost of a hunting trip at 44,000 euros, about twice the average annual salary in Spain. A petition called for the king to resign from his position as honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF itself responded by asking for an interview with the King to resolve the situation. In July 2012, WWF-Spain held a meeting in Madrid and decided with 226 votes to 13 to remove the king from the honorary presidency. He later apologised for the hunting trip.|$|E

However, the points which are developed are relevant to the treatment accorded to any racial, or ethnic minority or economically powerless group. There are too many examples of black growth, often in the face of overwhelming odds, for us, to be satisfied any longer with a situation where national educational policy is overly influenced by excuse makers whose research is detached from significant reality and whose understanding of what it takes to help minority children grow is nil.

40|$|Dr Garrett McGovern tells Catherine Reilly {{setting up}} a {{treatment}} and rehabilitative programme to tackle Ireland’s drink problem is not rocket science. Plentiful treatment services and education outreach that do not “patronise” young people are the key ingredients in tackling Ireland’s alcohol problem, over and above measures surrounding alcohol pricing and advertising, a leading addiction specialist has told IMT. Dr Garrett McGovern was speaking following the Budget 2014 measures of a 10 cent increase on a packet of cigarettes, a 10 cent increase {{on the price of}} a pint or standard measure of spirits and 50 cent extra on a bottle of wine, and in advance of the Government announcement of well-signposted proposals on minimum pricing and advertising, as well as a commitment to review sponsorship of sporting events by alcohol companies. On press briefing documents, at the announcement on measures to address alcohol misuse, the Department of Health stated an aim to develop a national treatment and rehabilitative service that promoted early intervention, but did not state a timeline for this. Dr McGovern suggested that the Government was attaching too little weight to some measures, and too much to others. “There is a large group of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> drink perfectly sensibly,” the Dublin-based GP said. “The vast majority {{of people in this country}} either drink sensibly or from time to time drink too much, and there is a group who drink really heavily.

40|$|It is sadly true {{that there}} are <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are sentenced to prison, and even death, for crimes they did not commit. Some have been exonerated and released, largely {{as the result of}} innocence {{projects}} that have helped prisoners assemble DNA evidence that shows they were not the perpetrators. Some have been exonerated years after they died in prison. Many others are no doubt never exonerated. For a wrongfully convicted person, exoneration is the end of one road but only the beginning of another. Unbelievably, exonerees starting out on the road back to society find that they get little to no help from the justice system. Offenders on parole and convicts who complete their sentences may receive more services than released persons who committed no crime at all. This Article is {{based on the premise that}} states must pay compensation to innocent persons who have suffered wrongful imprisonment. The Article explains why exoneration is not enough. It then discusses theoretical justifications that support the payment of compensation and refutes objections to making such payments. Finally, it lays out concrete ways in which states may budget for wrongful-conviction compensation statutes. Although monetary compensation can hardly make up for years of wrongful imprisonment, providing compensation is the least a state can do after an innocent person is exonerated. Part I of this Article explains wrongful conviction terminology. Part II explains how the very same reasons that make it easy for innocent people to be convicted also make it difficult for them to be exonerated. Part III explains why governments must compensate the wrongfully incarcerated when they win their freedom. It discusses the reasons for and against government compensation, rejecting the argument that imprisoning and even executing innocent persons is a harsh but necessary cost of doing business. Part IV deals with the hard question of how to pay for wrongful-conviction compensation statutes. To ensure that wrongfully imprisoned persons actually obtain compensation, the Article makes concrete suggestions for funding compensation statutes. Wrongfully convicted persons who win their freedom deserve compensation statutes, and states can afford them...|$|E
