However, the current fragmentation of <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> across manydatabases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves thisproblem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions andgene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from agrowing number of sources, are available.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are several}} {{techniques}} for fitting risk prediction models to high-dimensional data, arising from microarrays. However, the biological knowledge about relations between genes is only rarely taken into account. One recent approach incorporates <b>pathway</b> <b>information,</b> available, e. g., from the KEGG database, by augmenting the penalty term in Lasso estimation for continuous response models. Results As an alternative, we extend componentwise likelihood-based boosting techniques for incorporating <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> {{into a larger}} number of model classes, such as generalized linear models and the Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-event data. In contrast to Lasso-like approaches, no further assumptions for explicitly specifying the penalty structure are needed, as <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> is incorporated by adapting the penalties for single microarray features {{in the course of the}} boosting steps. This is shown to result in improved prediction performance when the coefficients of connected genes have opposite sign. The properties of the fitted models resulting from this approach are then investigated in two application examples with microarray survival data. Conclusion The proposed approach results not only in improved prediction performance but also in structurally different model fits. Incorporating <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> in the suggested way is therefore seen to be beneficial in several ways. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Combining {{microarray}} {{results and}} biological <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> will add insight into biological processes. <b>Pathway</b> <b>information</b> is {{widely available in}} databases through the internet. Mammalian muscle formation has been previously studied using microarray technology in pigs because these animals are an interesting animal model for muscle formation due to selection for increased muscle mass. Results indicated regulation of the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, and energy metabolism. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse microarrays studying myogenesis in pigs. It was necessary to develop methods to search biochemical pathways databases. Results PERL scripts were developed that used the names of the genes on the microarray to search databases. Synonyms of gene names were added to the list by searching the Gene Ontology database. The KEGG database was searched for <b>pathway</b> <b>information</b> using this updated gene list. The KEGG database returned 88 pathways. Most genes were found in a single pathway, but others were found in up to seven pathways. Combining the pathways and the microarray information 21 pathways showed sufficient information content for further analysis. These pathways were related to regulation of several steps in myogenesis and energy metabolism. Pathways regulating myoblast proliferation and muscle fibre formation were described. Furthermore, two networks of pathways describing the formation of the myoblast cytoskeleton and regulation of the energy metabolism during myogenesis were presented. Conclusion Combining microarray results and pathways information available through the internet provide biological insight in how the process of porcine myogenesis is regulated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{perturbation}} of signal-transduction molecules elicits genomic-expression {{effects that}} are typically neither restricted {{to a small}} set of genes nor uniform. Instead there are broad, varied, and complex changes in expression across the genome. These observations suggest that signal transduction is not mediated by isolated <b>pathways</b> of <b>information</b> flow to distinct groups of genes in the genome. Rather, multiple entangled paths of information flow influence overlapping sets of genes. Using the Ras-cAMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we perturbed key pathway elements and collected genomic-expression data. Singular value decomposition was applied to separate the genome-wide transcriptional response into weighted expression components exhibited by overlapping groups of genes. Molecular interaction data were integrated to connect gene groups to perturbed signaling elements. The resulting series of linked subnetworks maps multiple putative <b>pathways</b> of <b>information</b> flow through a dense signaling network, and provides a set of testable hypotheses for complex gene-expression effects across the genome...|$|R
