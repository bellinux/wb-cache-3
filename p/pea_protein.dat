Two strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus BGT 10 and Lactobacillus zeae LMG 17315, exhibited strong proteolytic activity against <b>pea</b> <b>proteins.</b> The AO activity of the pea hydrolysate fraction, MW < 10 kDa, obtained by the fermentation of purified <b>pea</b> <b>proteins</b> with Lactobacillus rhamnosus BGT 10, was tested by standard spectrophotometric assays (DPPH, ABTS, Fe 3 +-reducing capacity) and the recently developed direct current (DC) polarographic assay. The low molecular weight fraction of the obtained hydrolysate was separated using ion exchange chromatography, while the AO activity of eluted fractions was determined by means of a sensitive DC polarographic assay without previous concentration of samples. Results revealed that the fraction present in low abundance that contained basic peptides possessed the highest antioxidant activity. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that Lactobacillus rhamnosus BGT 10 should be further investigated as a candidate strain for large-scale production of bioactive peptides from legume proteins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Legume seed {{proteins}} {{have to be}} chemically characterized {{in order}} to properly link their nutritional effects with their chemical structure. RESULTS: Vicilin and albumin fractions devoid of cross-contamination, as assessed by mass peptide fingerprinting analysis, were obtained from defatted pea (Pisum sativum cv. Bilbo) meal. The extracted protein fractions contained 56. 7 - 67. 7 g of non-starch polysaccharides kg- 1. The vicilin fraction was higher than legumin in arginine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and lysine. The most abundant amino acids in the albumin fraction were aspartic and glutamic acids, lysine and arginine, and the amounts of methionine were more than double than those in legumins and vicilins. The pea albumin fraction showed a clear enrichment of protease inhibitory activity {{when compared to the}} seed meal. In vitro digestibility values for <b>pea</b> <b>proteins</b> were 0. 63 ± 0. 04, 0. 88 ± 0. 04 and 0. 41 ± 0. 23 for legumins, vicilins and albumins, respectively.

40|$|Proteins {{are known}} to {{interact}} with relatively small molecules such as flavour compounds and saponins, and may thus influence the taste perception of food. In this study, the interactions of flavour volatiles with <b>pea</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{and the effects of}} heat on these interactions were investigated. The presence of saponins, which are non-volatile flavour compounds, was also explored. Saponins {{are known to}} contribute to the bitterness in pea and were found to interact with <b>proteins.</b> <b>Pea</b> <b>proteins,</b> legumin (11 S) and vicilin (7 S), were used for interaction studies with aldehydes and ketones using static headspace-gas chromatography (SH-GC). The binding of various flavour compounds as a function of concentration was studied at pH 7. 6 and pH 3. 8. Vicilin binds both aldehydes and ketones at pH 7. 6 and pH 3. 8. Legumin only showed binding to aldehydes at pH 7. 6 and no binding to aldehydes or ketones at pH 3. 8. The effect of heat on vicilin-flavour interactions was studied at pH 7. 6. Heating of vicilin seemed to lead to a decrease in the binding of aldehydes and ketones to the protein. In addition, the presence of saponins in hulled pea flour was identified by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and three groups of saponins, A, B and DDMP saponins were found to be present, with group B saponins dominating.

Therefore, this work focuses on {{the potential of the}} water soluble part of pea, chickpea and lentil protein isolates under acidic emulsions (pH 3. 0) using a novel mild technique: premix membrane emulsification. <b>Pea</b> <b>proteins</b> (PP) and chickpea proteins (CP) lower the interfacial tension {{in the same way as}} whey protein isolate (WPI), which suggests that they could facilitate emulsion droplet formation similarly as WPI, while lentil proteins (LP) are slightly less effective.

40|$|Background. Proteomic {{analysis}} {{is emerging as}} a highly useful tool in food research, including studies of food allergies. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis involving isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis {{is the most effective}} method of separating hundreds or even thousands of proteins. In this study, albumin and globulin tractions of pea seeds cv. Ramrod were subjected to proteomic analysis. Selected potentially alergenic proteins were identified based on their molecular weights and isoelectric points. Material and methods. Pea seeds (Pisum sativum L.) cv. Ramrod harvested over a period of two years (Plant Breeding Station in Piaski-Szelejewo) were used in the experiment. The isolated albumins, globulins and legumin and vicilin fractions of globulins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteomic images were analysed in the ImageMaster 2 D Platinum program with the use of algorithms from the Melanie application. The relative content, isoelectric points and molecular weights were computed for all identified proteins. Electrophoregrams were analysed by matching spot positions from three independent replications. Results. The proteomes of albumins, globulins and legumin and vicilin fractions of globulins produced up to several hundred spots (proteins). Spots most characteristic of a given fraction were identified by computer analysis and spot matching. The albumin proteome accumulated spots of relatively high intensity over a broad range of pi values of - 4. 2 - 8. 1 in 3 molecular weight (MW) ranges: I - high molecular-weight albumins with MW of - 50 - 110 kDa, II - average molecular-weight albumins with MW of - 20 - 35 kDa, and III - low molecular-weight albumins with MW of - 13 - 17 kDa. 2 D gel electrophoregrams revealed the presence of 81 characteristic spots, including 24 characteristic of legumin and 14 - of vicilin. Conclusions. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis proved to be a useful tool for identifying <b>pea</b> <b>proteins.</b> Patterns of spots with similar isoelectric points and different molecular weights or spots with different isoelectric points and similar molecular weights {{play an important role in}} proteome analysis.
