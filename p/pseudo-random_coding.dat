However, the statistical properties of digital chaotic maps are rather {{different from the}} continuous ones, which impedes the theoretical analyses of the digital chaotic ciphers and <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>coding.</b> This paper detailedly investigates the statistical properties of a class of digital piecewise linear chaotic map (PLCM), and rigorously proves some useful results. Based on the proved results, we further discuss some notable problems in chaotic cryptography and <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>coding</b> employing digital PLCM-s. Since the analytic methods proposed in this paper can essentially extended to {{a large number of}} PLCM-s, they will be valuable for the research on the performance of such maps in chaotic cryptography and <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>coding.</b> ...|$|E

The L 1 signal is processed by a preamplifier stage including a {{band pass filter}} and a low noise amplifier and output as a radio frequency (RF) signal. A mixer receives and de-spreads the RF signal {{in response to a}} <b>pseudo-random</b> noise <b>code,</b> i,e., Gold code, generated by an internal <b>pseudo-random</b> noise <b>code</b> generator. A microprocessor enters a code tracking loop, such that during the code tracking loop, it addresses the pseudorandom code generator to cause the <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>code</b> generator to sequentially output <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>codes</b> corresponding to satellite codes used to spread the L 1 signal, until correlation occurs. When an output of the mixer is indicative of the occurrence of correlation between the RF signal and the generated <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>codes,</b> the microprocessor caters an operational state which slows the receiver code sequence to stay locked with the satellite cede sequence. The output of the mixer is provided to a detector which, in turn, controls certain routines of the microprocessor.

The proposed system accomplishes 3 D reconstruction of objects using a combination of spatial-neighboring and time-multiplexing structured light patterns encoded with <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>codes.</b> This combination builds upon the concept of marching patterns that can adaptively increase the reconstruction resolution on demand.

Transmitting end of the system processes spread spectrum twice using channel <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>code</b> and sub-channel <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>code.</b> Each bit of digital baseband signal was transmitted, through time-division manner, with 16 spread spectrum sub-channel signals. Pseudorandom codes of each spreading sub-channel are orthogonal to each other, so is the center frequency. Meanwhile, receiving end processes every bit of information in manner of parallel accumulation and adaptive threshold decision, to achieve receiving and processing of relevant multi-sub-channel spread spectrum signals, thereby improving noise immunity of communication system. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that anti-interference capacity of the system is superior to traditional hybrid spread spectrum communication system. In detail, at the same information rate and the same bandwidth, its interference tolerance is higher than that of the hybrid DS/FH spread spectrum system by 5 dB.
