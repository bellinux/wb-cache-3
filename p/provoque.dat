40|$|First, {{we present}} a simple {{confining}} abelian pure gauge theory. Classically, its kinetic term is not positive definite, and it contains a simple UV regularized F 4 interaction. This <b>provoques</b> {{the formation of a}} condensate φ ∼ F 2 such that, at the saddle point ̂ φ of the effective potential, the wave function normalization constant of the abelian gauge fields Zeff (̂ φ) vanishes exactly. Then we study SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory in an abelian gauge and introduce an auxiliary field ρ for a BRST invariant condensate of dimension 2, which renders the charged sector massive. Consequently its effective low energy theory reduces to the confining abelian model discussed before, and the vev of ρ is seen to scale correctly with the renormalization point. The confinement condition Zeff = 0 is also shown to hold for the massive charged sector, which suppresses the couplings of the charged fields to the abelian gauge bosons in the infrared regime.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyse how the {{exercise}} of buyer power can raise {{the price of the}} wholesale good of the rival firms (the so-called waterbed effect). In particular, I consider an economy with two markets: in the first one, the wholesale market, an upstream firm sells an intermediate good to two downstream firms. These firms use the input to produce a final good that they sell to the consumers in the second market, the final consumption market. The price of the intermediate good is the outcome of simultaneous and independent negotiations between the upstream and each downstream firm. I consider a setting with asymmetric negotiations where a change of the bargaining power of one of the two downstream firms <b>provoques</b> the waterbed effect. The main contribution of the paper is the fact that I allow for any possible distribution of bargaining power between the two parties and that the value of the outside option of each part is endogenous. Furthermore, I analyze the welfare consequences and I show how the intensity of the downstream competition affects the existence of such effect. 1...|$|R

40|$|Pollakisuria {{in adult}} goats {{can be caused}} by {{diseases}} of the urinary tract and by distension of parts of the genital tract leading to irritation of the bladder. Hydrometra is {{the most common cause of}} uterine distension in goats and usually can be resolved by prostaglandin injections. But other pathologies of the uterus can generate a similar syndrome. A dwarf goat was presented at the clinic with a history of chronic pollakisuria and tenesm. An initial ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen led to the suspicion of hydrometra, but treatment with injections of prostaglandin were not successful. Blood samples revealed low progesterone and high oestrogen values. A laparotomy was performed and an enlarged uterus with 1. 5 L of mucous content and cystic ovaries were found and partially removed. A single solid leiomyoma was diagnosed histologically in the uterine wall. Two months later the goat's condition had deteriorated and therefore she was euthanized. Necropsy and pathohistological examination revealed the presence of a metastasized adenocarcinoma of the uterus. In this case, the pollakisuria <b>provoqued</b> by distension of the uterus was not caused by hydrometra, but by neoplasia.

A metáfora do cavalo de Tróia busca retratar a influência sutil e intensa do trabalho desse autor sobre as perspectivas consagradas, de modo que, enquanto fascina e causa admiração, traz em si um potencial elevado de reflexão crítica e incisiva sobre essas mesmas perspectivas.

40|$|The blizzards {{from the}} end of January 2014 stand out by the short period of time in which they {{occurred}} and by the duration of the phenomenon. As a consequence, the effects have accumulated, resulting special socio-economic consequences. In January 2014, in five days time, in the South-East of Romania there have been two blizzards. The maximum thickness of the snow layer has reached 99 cm, and the gusts of wind have exceeded speeds of 90 km/h. Therefore, in the South-East of Romania, the snowdrifts measured at the weather stations from Câmpia Bărăganului have reached heights of 280 cm. The first blizzard was unusual through its unusually long duration in which it occurred, 72 hours between 24 and 27 th of January, and the second one, although short, it was very intense and it only occurred 48 hours {{after the end of the}} first episode. The cyclogenesis initiated in the Genova Bay was classic, but the main cause of both situations’ aggravation was represented by the penetration and regeneration of the two cyclones of Mediterranean origin over warmer waters than usual in the Black Sea.

5000|$|The {{champagne}} {{model is}} {{perhaps one of}} the first numerical calculations of the propagation of ionisation fronts and of the expansion of HII regions that did not assumed a constant density medium around the massive exciting star. The model assumes that star formation takes place in a dense cloud, surrounded and in pressure equilibrium with a low density inter-cloud gas.The ample supply of UV photons generated by the star rapidly establishes an HII region and the expansion of this, sooner or later allows also for the ionisation of the inter cloud gas. Ionisation disrupts then the former pressure balance between the cloud and the inter-cloud gas as under the stellar radiation field all photo-ionised gas acquires a temperature of the order of 10000 K.In this way, the ionised cloud material acquires an excess pressure, a pressure larger than the ionised low density inter cloud gas and this <b>provoques</b> the supersonic expansion of the ionised cloud matter into the surrounding gas (the champagne flow). The streaming of matter out of the cloud allows for the ionisation of a larger portion of the original cloud susteining in this way the pressure imbalance which eventually leads to the complete disruptionof the parent cloud. The terms champagne model and champagne flow were coined by Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle in a paper in 1979 (Astronomy and Astrophysics 1979A&A....71...59T).The model focus on the size, velocity field and the large density variations observed in HII regions.

(Melastomataceae) (D. thollonii). Methods: The aqueous and methanolic extracts were evaluated for their antibacterial {{activities on the}} in vitro growth of 2 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri), and 5 reference bacteria strains [Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 (E. coli), E. coli ATCC 10536, Salmonella typhi ATCC 6539, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 and E. coli ATCC 11775] by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and bactericidal concentrations using broth microdilution method {{as well as on}} the infectious, secretory and osmotic induced diarrhoea models in rats. Results: The aqueous extract inhibited the in vitro growth of all bacteria tested (the 05 reference bacteria strains and the 02 clinical isolates), with MICs values comprised between 32 and 512 μg/mL, whereas the methanolic extract has done the same with the MICs values located between 128 and 512 μg/mL. In vivo, the methanolic and aqueous extracts <b>provoqued</b> at all doses, a significant decrease (P< 0. 001) in the bacterial load in the faeces of rats, 6 and 7 d of treatment respectively. Infected animals relatively lost weight when treated with the aqueous extract but it remained constant for those treated with the methanolic extract. The results also showed that, the aqueous and methanolic leaves extracts of D. thollonii had, after 6 h of observation, significantly (P< 0. 001) inhibited in vivo, diarrhoea induced experimentally by castor oil and magnesium sulphate, particularly by prolonging the latency time, reducing the water content of faeces, the frequency of defecation and the number of wet defecation as compared to the negative control which received distilled water and the animals having received 2. 5 mg/kg of loperamide used as reference substance. The phytochemical assay revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols and polyphenols in the leaves extracts of D. thollonii, which are compounds with antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activities. Conclusions: The leaves of D. thollonii thus have antibacterial and antidiarrhoeal effects, which could result from their activities on blocking the inhibiting effects of the bacterial enzymes, inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis, allowing the rupture of the lipopolysaccharidic membrane, as well as on inhibiting prostaglandins-E 2 synthesis or increasing the hydroelectrolytic reabsorption.

40|$|PosterLandscape {{evolution}} {{results of}} antagonistic processes. In the Paris basin (France) : tectonic uplift {{seems to be}} globally balanced by river incision. But the dynamic equilibrium of the relief can be disturbed by other processes and singularities may appear. A remarkable example is observed in the Meuse basin (NE of France), where the river is actually perched at more than + 50 m above the surrounding valleys: the Marne valley {{to the west and}} the Moselle valley to the east. This special morphology is the result of several stream piracies (at the expense of the Meuse) which has interested numerous scientifics since a long time (Davis 1895, Blache 1943, Lesson-Quinif 2001 & Le Roux Harmand 1997 - 2009...). The most important ones of these piracies are: 1) the well-known capture of the Haute-Moselle by a tributary of the Meurthe near Toul; 2) at the north-west, the capture of the river Aire by the Aisne. On-going evolution suggests that such events can be expected in the long-term future. Where and when next streams piracies could occur, what consequences may be expected? Our approach is to simulate the dynamic evolution of the landscape with an improved version of GOLEM (Geomorphic / Orogenic Landscape Evolution Model - LEM), this software was developed by Tucker & Slingerland in 1994 ([URL] The LEM characterizes erosion by incorporating diffusion and advection equations whose parameters must be fixed, according to local conditions. First simulations for next millions years with " detachment-limited " mode, let us locate several potential captures of the Meuse river by tributaries of the Moselle, therefore inducing a complete reorganization of the hydrographic network. The results of the localizations agree with local topography/geometry analysis. The first capture <b>provoques</b> a knickpoint propagation and a significant lowering of the upstream part of the Meuse's basin. Downstream, the orientation of the abandoned valley "slowly" inverts and a new Meuse's tributary appears (like the Agron's river after the Aire's capture). The asymmetry of these processes shows the importance of the localization and the order of the piracies on post-capture landscape evolution. In these simulations, unlike piracy-order, timing depends widely on the physical parameters of the model: in first approximation, durations are proportional to the bedrock erodibility. More complex simulations are in process, taking into account lithological differences of outcropping layers, Meuse deposition tendency [...] ...|$|R

Findings. A review of works {{of a variety of}} scientists showed that pesticides with different chemical origins have disastrous effects on everyone without the exception of freshwater biota organisms. The article highlights the peculiarities of the toxic effects of pesticides of major chemical groups, which are used or stored in Ukraine. Their toxic and lethal concentrations for the major species of phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos and ichthyofauna reservoirs are considered. The data on basic features of behavioral reactions of aquatic organisms on poisoning by pesticides are provided. The basic structural and systemic diosrders of homeostasis of the organisms of aquatic biota are described. The effect of pesticides on phytoplankton needs further research, however, is was found that they have common feature as the disturbace of photosynthesis process and accumulation. In turn, this <b>provoques</b> kills in water bodies and poisoning of phytoplanctivorous fish. Zooplanktonic organisms are highly sensitive to pesticides; hence they can be used as an indicator of the state of fresh water. It was found that, pesticides depending on their concentration have different toxic effects on zooplankton organisms. The effect of pesticides on benthic organisms was little investigated. It is known that benthic communities respond to the presence of pesticide by changes in species composition, number of species, abundance and biomass of benthos in general and individual taxonomic groups of benthic invertebrates. The toxicity of pesticides for fish depends on their chemical nature, the form of the preparation, dose, fish species and age, water temperature and the content of oxygen and salts. In particular, juvenile fish are much more sensitive to the chemicals, and an increase in water temperature and a decrease in oxygen content results in an increase in pesticide toxicity. Practical value. The array of the generalized information on the toxic and lethal effects of pesticides will be important for scientists who investigate the biological risk of pesticides and their impact on basic categories of freshwater biota and, in general, for ichthyological and environmental research. The information on the peculiarities of the toxic effects of pesticides on fish is important in the conditions of increasing demand for fish products as a source of valuable proteins for humans...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the phytochemical test and selected pharmacological activities (antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activity) of the aqueous and methanolic leaves extracts of Dissotis thollonii Cogn. (Melastomataceae) (D. thollonii). MethodsThe aqueous and methanolic extracts were evaluated for their antibacterial {{activities on the}} in vitro growth of 2 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri), and 5 reference bacteria strains [Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 (E. coli), E. coli ATCC 10536, Salmonella typhi ATCC 6539, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 and E. coli ATCC 11775] by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and bactericidal concentrations using broth microdilution method {{as well as on}} the infectious, secretory and osmotic induced diarrhoea models in rats. ResultsThe aqueous extract inhibited the in vitro growth of all bacteria tested (the 05 reference bacteria strains and the 02 clinical isolates), with MICs values comprised between 32 and 512 μg/mL, whereas the methanolic extract has done the same with the MICs values located between 128 and 512 μg/mL. In vivo, the methanolic and aqueous extracts <b>provoqued</b> at all doses, a significant decrease (P< 0. 001) in the bacterial load in the faeces of rats, 6 and 7 d of treatment respectively. Infected animals relatively lost weight when treated with the aqueous extract but it remained constant for those treated with the methanolic extract. The results also showed that, the aqueous and methanolic leaves extracts of D. thollonii had, after 6 h of observation, significantly (P< 0. 001) inhibited in vivo, diarrhoea induced experimentally by castor oil and magnesium sulphate, particularly by prolonging the latency time, reducing the water content of faeces, the frequency of defecation and the number of wet defecation as compared to the negative control which received distilled water and the animals having received 2. 5 mg/kg of loperamide used as reference substance. The phytochemical assay revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols and polyphenols in the leaves extracts of D. thollonii, which are compounds with antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activities. ConclusionsThe leaves of D. thollonii thus have antibacterial and antidiarrhoeal effects, which could result from their activities on blocking the inhibiting effects of the bacterial enzymes, inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis, allowing the rupture of the lipopolysaccharidic membrane, as well as on inhibiting prostaglandins-E 2 synthesis or increasing the hydroelectrolytic reabsorption. These results attestted the ethnopharmacological use of D. thollonii leaves in the treatment of diarrhoea and gastro-intestinal infections...|$|R

Folhas com estes sintomas caem após a saída dos insetos, reduzindo a produtividade dos ervais. Para estudar as interferências dos fatores ambientais sobre a flutuação populacional desta praga, foram {{realizadas}} amostragens quinzenais, em dois ervais situados em Chapecó-SC, no período de 1997 a 2000. A triagem das amostras foi realizada na Epagri/CPPP e totalizou 21. 044 espécimes, com razão sexual de 0, 42. A análise de correlação entre os insetos capturados no período 1998 / 2000 e a média mensal de temperatura mínima (Tmi) acusou r = 0, 63 e a análise de regressão linear expressou a equação = - 1. 621, 47 + 156, 37 Tmi, com r² = 0, 40. A temperatura base (Tb) de 10, 36 ºC foi estimada ao atribuir valor zero para esta equação. A constante térmica (K) de 399, 52 graus-dia (GD) foi calculada por K = D (T – Tb), onde D = 27, 29 dias do ciclo de vida da "ampola" a 25 ºC (T). Os 3. 219, 30 GD anuais foram obtidos pela média dos somatórios anuais das médias mensais das temperaturas médias, diminuídas da Tb e multiplicadas pelo número de dias de cada mês, nos meses que a Tmi > Tb. A divisão do GD anual pela K resultou em 8, 05 possíveis gerações anuais desta praga. Gyropsylla spegazziniana (Lizer, 1917) (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) or "ampul" is a pest of paraguay-tea (Ilex paraguariensis) that <b>provoques</b> {{the growth}} in the structure of new leaves for ninfal protection. Leaves with these symptoms fall after insects left causing produtivity reduction. To study the environmental factors interference in the population flutuation of this pest, two orchards were biweekly sampled from 1997 to 2000 in Chapecó, SC. The samples were evaluated in the Agricultural Research Enterprise - Epagri/CPPP, and totaled 21, 044 insects with 0. 42 % of sexual ratio. Correlation analyses between insects captured from 1998 / 2000 and monthly mean minimum temperature (Tmi) accused r = 0. 63 and the linear regression analyses showed the equation = - 1, 621. 47 + 156. 37 Tmi, with r² = 0. 40. The basic temperature (Tb) of 10. 36 ºC was obtained by giving value zero to this equation. The thermal constant (K) of 399. 52 day-degrees (GD) was calculated using K = D (T - Tb), in which "D" was 27. 29 the days of biological cicle of "ampul", with 25 ºC (T). The 3, 219. 30 annual GD was calculated with the mean of the total sum of monthly mean medium temperature, lessenig from Tb and multiplicating number of days, in the months in which Tmi > Tb. The annual GD divided to CT resulted in 8. 05 possible annual generations of this insect...|$|R
