For this reason, a makeshift platform was constructed at the north-westerly track 1a, and the excavation pit was split lengthwise into two lateral pieces. Construction was done utilizing the cut-and-cover top-down method, where the outer shell was made up of a 28-metre-deep bored <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> on top of which the roof structure of the tunnel was built. The tracks and platforms where then reconstructed on this tunnel roof by May 1974, which meant the complete resumption of main line traffic. Underneath the roof structure, space was then excavated from the top down, and the inner shell was constructed, consisting of a floor and inner walls, which carried the roofs of up to three internal levels. On the topmost internal level, an underground parking garage with 120 spaces was built, which doubled as a civilian shelter, secure against airborne agents, such as poison gas, and nuclear attack, with a capacity for 4,500 persons. The inner shell was completed at the end of 1975.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} finite element (FE) study {{to assess the}} {{behavior}} of a flexible sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall.</b> The effect of excavation and backfilling process on the behavior of the sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> have been thoroughly investigated and the results are presented in terms of the wall deformations and bending moments, developed anchor forces, and the earth pressures developed on both active and passive side of the wall. Development of failure mechanism in terms of soil displacements and incremental deviatoric strains, slip lines and plastic points formations have been illustrated. Such structures in the field are often associated with high water table, which renders significant hindrance in the construction of sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> and hence, dewatering is adopted in such cases. The dewatering scheme substantially alters the stress conditions on the sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> and if not accommodated in the design, might render the behavior as unrealistic. This aspect has been addressed in the present article. It has been observed that the sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> systems in the dewatered excavation cases are failing before the desired excavation depth, and hence, forms a crucial part of the analysis...|$|E

(II) Lateral Earth Pressures Consult with Geotechnical Services for suitable lateral earth pressure distribution for the project. For earth retaining systems constructed from the top down and restrained by ground anchors (tiebacks), the lateral earth pressure acting on the wall height, H, may be determined as described below. The lateral earth pressure distribution for the design of temporary or permanent anchored walls constructed in cohesionless soils may be determined using equations provided in AASHTO LRFD BDS (2007). In those special situations where there exists external loading in addition to lateral earth pressure, such as a slip plane or adjacent structures, etc, the following equations based on P may be used to determine p.

40|$|In this study, the {{stability}} of anchored cantilever sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> in sandy soils is investigated using reliability analysis. Targeted stability is formulated as an optimization problem {{in the framework of}} an inverse first order reliability method.

The sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> system is modeled as a series of failure mode combination. Penetration depth, anchor pull, and section modulus are calculated for various target component and system reliability indices based on three limit states.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} for obtaining depth and section modulus of the cantilever sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> using inverse reliability method is described.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel sheet pile walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel sheet pile walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall.</b> This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> have been studied: 1) Cantilever sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel sheet pile with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever sheet <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Presentation of the landslide remediation which had already been carried out and which presented the grounds for the remedial practices used for the analyses presented in the thesis is also included in the introductory part. In continuation, basic characteristics of the area and its soil, gained through the use of boreholes and standard penetration testing, are presented. On the basis of gained data, back analysis, the aim of which is to gather detailed characteristics of the soil in the area prior to the slide, is carried out. The analysis is carried out {{with the use of the}} Slide 5. 0 programme and examines three possible cases affecting the original slope stability and therefore causing a slide: low water level and weak soil characteristics, high water level and good soil characteristics and artesian water and good soil characteristics.

40|$|The {{construction}} of the shallow tunnel at Brezno started using the Pre-Vault Method. The tunnel excavation, in complicated geological conditions, led to many difficulties which finally resulted in a collapse, when {{a significant part of}} the temporary tunnel lining collapsed. Various options for re-excavating the tunnel were evaluated prior to further construction. Finally a decision was made to separate the collapsed area into sections 9 m in length using 16 m-wide, transversally oriented <b>pile</b> <b>walls,</b> to improve the stability of the collapsed ground. The walls were constructed from the surface prior to excavation. It was also decided to re-excavate a collapsed area using the Sprayed Concrete Lining (SCL) method. Due to problematic soft ground conditions, which had been made even worse by the collapse, some additional support measures had to be considered prior to re-excavation (ground improvement, micropile umbrellas embedded into the <b>pile</b> <b>walls,</b> etc.) This paper describes numerical modelling of the tunnel re-excavation through the collapsed area. Initial calculations of the tunnel re-excavation were made using a 2 D finite element method.
