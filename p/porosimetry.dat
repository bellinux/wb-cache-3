50|$|This {{measured}} pressure permits {{obtaining the}} pore diameter, which is calculated {{by using the}} Young-Laplace formula P= 4*Î³*cos Î¸*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, Î³ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid and Î¸ is the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample. The surface tension Î³ is a measurable physical property and depends on the wetting liquid used. The contact angle Î¸ depends on {{the interaction between the}} material and the wetting liquid. In capillary flow porometry, in opposition to mercury intrusion <b>porosimetry,</b> the wetting liquid enters spontaneously the pores of the sample ensuring a total wetting of the material, and therefore the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample is 0 and the previous formula can be simplied as: P= 4*Î³/D.|$|E
50|$|Pores {{that are}} not {{of the same size}} will fill at {{different}} values of pressure, with the smaller ones filling first. This difference in filling rate can be a beneficial application of capillary condensation. Many materials have different pore sizes with ceramics being one of the most commonly encountered. In materials with different pore sizes, curves can be constructed similar to Figure 7. A detailed analysis of the shape of these isotherms is done using the Kelvin equation. This enables the pore size distribution to be determined. While this is a relatively simple method of analyzing the isotherms, a more in depth analysis of the isotherms is done using the BET method. Another method of determining the pore size distribution is by using a procedure known as Mercury Injection <b>Porosimetry.</b> This uses the volume of mercury taken up by the solid as the pressure increases to create the same isotherms mentioned above. An application where pore size is beneficial is in regards to oil recovery. When recovering oil from tiny pores, it is useful to inject gas and water into the pore. The gas will then occupy the space where the oil once was, mobilizing the oil, and then the water will displace some of the oil forcing it to leave the pore.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe typical {{approach}} to analysing raw data, from common pore characterization {{methods such as}} gas sorption and mercury <b>porosimetry,</b> to obtain pore size distributions for disordered porous solids generally makes several critical assumptions that impact {{the accuracy of the}} void space descriptors thereby obtained. These assumptions can lead to errors in pore size of as much as 500 %. In this work, we eliminated these assumptions by employing novel experiments involving fully integrated gas sorption, mercury <b>porosimetry</b> and mercury thermoporometry techniques. The entrapment of mercury following <b>porosimetry</b> allowed the isolation (for study) of a particular subset of pores within a much larger interconnected network. Hence, a degree of specificity of findings to particular pores, more commonly associated with use of templated, model porous solids, can also be achieved for disordered materials. Gas sorption experiments were conducted in series, both before and after mercury <b>porosimetry,</b> on the same sample, and the mercury entrapped following <b>porosimetry</b> was used as the probe fluid for theromporometry. Hence, even if one technique, on its own, is indirect, requiring unsubstantiated assumptions, the fully integrated combination of techniques described here permits the validation of assumptions used in one technique by another. Using controlled-pore glasses as model materials, mercury <b>porosimetry</b> scanning curves were used to establish the correct correspondence between the appropriate GibbsâThomson parameter, {{and the nature of the}} meniscus geometry in melting, for thermoporometry measurements on entrapped mercury. Mercury thermoporometry has been used to validate the pore sizes, for a series of solâgel silica materials, obtained from mercury <b>porosimetry</b> data using the independently-calibrated Kloubek correlations. The pore sizes obtained for solâgel silicas from <b>porosimetry</b> and thermoporometry have been shown to differ substantially from those obtained via gas sorption and NLDFT analysis.
