25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the <b>proportional</b> <b>limit.</b> Physically, it {{represents}} the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

40|$|We {{study by}} a fully nonlinear, {{three-dimensional}} pseudospectral, time-splitting simu-lation the feedback {{control of a}} layer of fluid heated from below. The initial condition corresponds to a steady, large-amplitude, preferred convection state obtained at Prandtl number of 7. 0 and Rayleigh number of 104, which is about six times the Rayleigh criti-cal value. A robust controller based on the LQG (Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian) synthesis method is used. Both sensors and actuator are thermal-based, planar, and assumed to be continuously distributed. The simulated results show that large-amplitude steady-state convection rolls can be suppressed by the linear LQG controller action. The Green’s function of the controller gives {{the shape of the}} control action corresponding to a point measurement. In addition, for Rayleigh numbers below the proportional feedback con-trol stability limit, this controller appeared to be effective in damping out steady-state convection rolls as well. However, in a region very near the <b>proportional</b> control stability <b>limit,</b> <b>proportional</b> control action induces subcritical g-type hexagonal convection, which is obtained here through direct simulations.

30|$|A single-tooth osseointegrated implant is {{composed}} of an implant body, an abutment, an abutment screw, and an artificial crown. The implant and abutment are typically connected by an abutment screw. The degree of mechanical integrity at the implant-abutment interface depends on screw preload, abutment connection design, the fitness of all components, and dynamic loading conditions. Fractures of the internal or external connection between implants and implant abutments or abutment screws are encountered in the clinical setting [1 – 3]. Fractures may occur {{as a result of}} excessive axial forces (bending moments), horizontal loading, or rotational torque during functional activities such as chewing or parafunctional activities such as grinding and clenching. Several studies [4, 5] have evaluated implant-abutment assemblies in dynamic cyclic fatigue testing according to ISO 14801 [6]. However, evaluation of the strength of the implant-abutment assembly has not been reported when subjected to torsion testing. Test methods and standard vales have not yet been established for such torsion testing of implant-abutment assemblies. Abutment connections are principally classified as either internal or external types and are available in a variety of designs, including hexagonal, octagonal, cone screw, cone hex, cylinder hex, spline, cam, cam tube, and pin/slot. Implants incorporate features for rotation-prevention at the implant-abutment interface. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of implant-abutment connections have been discussed in several studies [7 – 11]. Norton reported that internal implant-abutment interface connections have higher bending moment resistance than external connections [10]. Presently, although more than 200 kinds of implant systems are available on the market, most manufacturers do not provide specific data regarding system-specific implant-abutment connection design complications [12, 13]. In the oral cavity, implant restorations are exposed to vertical, horizontal, and rotational forces during chewing. The maximum torsional strength and <b>proportional</b> <b>limited</b> strength on crown and tooth restoration materials were measured, and the values were compared with a mechanical bending and pull test value [14].|$|R

For a typical paper grade, such as newsprint, the stress-strain curve {{is characterized by}} an initial linear region which {{is followed by a}} non-linear region. The transition from the linear to the non-linear region takes place smoothly. In engineering literature, the transition point is known as the <b>proportional</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>proportional</b> <b>limit</b> is commonly associated with the yield limit which is the point in the stress-strain curve after which plastic or permanent strains are developed. In the non-linear region gradient of the curve decreases but is still positive. The degree of non-linearity depends on humidity conditions. In dry conditions, the curve is rather linear even after the <b>proportional</b> <b>limit.</b> However, in humid conditions clear strain hardening is observed. In this sense, paper is brittle in dry conditions and ductile in humid conditions. The stress-strain curve depends also on the rate of loading. Both the elastic modulus and tensile strength increase with the strain rate. The viscous nature of paper can also be observed from a relaxation or creep test.|$|E
