40|$|The {{phytohormone}} cytokinin {{represents an}} essential class of developmental cues controlling plant morphogenesis. Extensive physiological, mutational and transgenic {{studies have shown}} that change in plant cytokinin <b>homeostasis</b> <b>causes</b> drastic <b>alteration</b> in growth and development, including cell division, shoot meristem activity, apical dominance, chloroplast development, leaf morphogenesis, leaf senescence, and stress tolerance (Mok 1994; Chaudhury et al. 1993; Beinsbergeret al. 1991; Medford et al. 1989; Werner et al. 2003). Among these developmental effects, cell cycle control {{is believed to be the}} primary target for cytokinin action (Werner et al. 2001). Cytokinin exerts its effect on cell division at the two checkpoints of cell cycle. First, cytokinin signals th...|$|R
