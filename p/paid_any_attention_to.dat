[...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics...

500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> how to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and was rated {{as one of the greatest}} videogame characters of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

500|$|Tracer {{has been}} cited as being the [...] "poster girl" [...] for the game; the gaming {{magazine}} Hardcore Gamer concurred, describing her as [...] "Overwatch's single most iconic character". Many publications have referred to her as the game's mascot, or note that she essentially fills the role of one. Even prior to the game's official release, VentureBeat noted, [...] "if you've <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the early fan culture for Overwatch, you've likely noticed that Tracer seems especially popular". Kotakus Nathan Grayson described her as [...] "peppy and fun, but also courageous and badass," [...] adding that: [...] "In creating their own works involving Tracer, fans have turned those characteristics up to 11. Some depict her as childlike, naive and carefree. She can even {{be kind of a}} doof, a punchline." [...] Kotakus Kirk Hamilton asserted that she is [...] "easily the most iconic Overwatch hero," [...] in addition to calling her his favorite character. Tracer's popularity compared to the other characters has had unintended effects for Blizzard; Overwatch-related searches boosted by 817% on Pornhub after the game's open beta went live, with [...] "Overwatch Tracer" [...] being the top search term related to the game. Discontent with this fan-generated porn, Blizzard made efforts to have it removed. Kotaku noted that Japanese gamers received Overwatch positively, finding the characters of Tracer and Mei especially cute.s Japanese Fan Art Begin!|work=Kotaku|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2016}} ...|$|E
500|$|Although ensconced with Chávez and his entourage, Bartley and ÓBriain felt a {{disconnect}} from {{the events of}} the outside world. During a [...] "chaotic" [...] road-trip with Chávez, they [...] "knew something was coming", and divined that Chávez's trip was intended to bolster his support and [...] "get people used to being on the streets". Chávez had recently [...] "upped the ante" [...] with the introduction of the Land Law. Increasing tensions further, in February 2002, Chávez took control of PDVSA; the private media stepped up its criticism of Chávez, which for Bartley and ÓBriain [...] "marked the beginning of an exciting phase". By April 2002, Bartley and ÓBriain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at the presidential palace, following Chávez and his staff. As the 11April crisis unfolded, Bartley and ÓBriain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence, then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and ÓBriain were able to continue filming without interference: [...] "no one <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> us—we just blended in." [...] Later that day, Bartley and ÓBriain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the country—the international airport was closed—the filmmakers instead took to the streets, [...] "to document the repression [...] were witnessing". At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, [...] "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government". He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and ÓBriain returned to the palace on 13April, the cameraman let them have his footage. They remained filming in Venezuela until July 2002, interviewing residents and recording [...] "witness" [...] accounts from those who had been present during the coup—ministers, security guards and journalists.|$|E

But a chance encounter with the popular Yoh Komiyama provides her with the opportunity she needs. If he coaches her in how to become attractive, surely she can find herself a boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely. FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had <b>paid</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Fala. He had been dozing {{in a corner of}} the room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran {{directly}} for the front screen door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E

The sheets on which Gifford's corrections are scrawled are not proof-sheets, but pages torn out of the first edition; and it is probable that they were made after the poem was published, and with a view to the inclusion of an emended edition in the collected works.
