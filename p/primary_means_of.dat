5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E

5000|$|A warp, {{also known}} as a portal or teleporter, is an element in video game design that allows a player {{character}} instant travel between two locations or levels. Specific areas that allow such travel are referred to as warp zones. A warp zone might be a secret passage, accessible only to players capable of finding it, but they are also commonly used as a <b>primary</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> travel in certain games. Warps might be deliberately installed within puzzles, be used to avoid danger in sections of a game that have been previously accomplished, be something a player can abuse for cheating or be used as a punishment to a player straying from the [...] "correct" [...] path.|$|R
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E

Flight is the <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> locomotion for most bird species {{and is used}} for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} Puerto Rico was {{transformed}} drastically upon the arrivals of Spaniards in 1493 until their departure in 1898. The economy {{during that period}} was driven by slavery of the native population, the Taíno, and by slaves brought from Africa. Slaves were minimally remunerated for or forced to work in farms, mines, households, and other aspects. Agriculture was the <b>primary</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> production, as well as livestock which was originally imported from Europe. Sugar cane, tobacco, coffee, and minor fruits were the primary cultivations which were exported to Europe and, by so, constituted the main economy for the island. Mining of gold, silver, and copper occurred as well, although {{not as much as}} in other territories during the Spanish colonization of the Americas.|$|R
30|$|The {{immediate}} {{environment of}} dumpsites is usually considered as unsuitable for settlement {{by those who}} can choose where they live. On the other hand, for the most marginalized and poorest people, the cheap and often illegal nature of settlements near dumpsite is another resource as these people cannot afford more expensive rents in safe places (Blight and Mbande [1998]). Settling far away from their <b>primary</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> livelihood, i.e. the dumpsite, would also imply time and financial costs they cannot support. Interviews conducted after the Leuwigajah disaster showed that hundreds of families used to live within 500  m from the foot slopes of the Leuwigajah dumpsite. Most of these people further lived in houses made of scrap materials scavenged from the dumpsite. Such housing proved to be very vulnerable to urban fire and waste slide.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLifestyle has a {{great impact}} on {{consumer}} behaviour and brand preferences. Very often, consumers tend to choose brands that are considered “appropriate” for their self-image. Accordingly, companies will try to position their brands in order to fit into consumers’ lifestyle. In addition to expressing their identity through the everyday choices they make, consumers will often seek new ways in which they can express their personal identity. As a result, consumers can use brands as a relevant <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> self- expression and also as a lifestyle “beacon”. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine the role of brands in this circumstances and to highlight the possible implications. Using two different experiments, the authors provide strong evidence that customers rely on brands with a desirable brand identity to express their own identity and they tend to prefer brands that are convergent with their identity as the <b>primary</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> expressing an unique image about their personal lifestyle. This article also provides solid evidence that brands can be used as valid tools for status signalling in everyday circumstances...|$|R
5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E
5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three <b>primary</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay.

40|$|The paper aims to {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} knowledge creation in a context not researched extensively so far, the virtual context. Claiming that knowledge is connected to the context in which is created, the paper argues that knowledge creation could be differentiated by the specific characteristics of virtuality. The process of knowledge creation is conceptualised using a theoretical framework. The notion of virtuality is discussed and juxtaposed with physicality. The central role of mediated interaction is identified as the <b>primary</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> communicating and collaborating, which replaces face-to-face interaction. A systematic comparison between direct and mediated communication is offered to highlight the key issues that affect knowledge creation. The paper focuses on the organizational context of virtual teams to describe the specific characteristics of virtual teams in comparison with face-to-face teams with regards to knowledge creation. The basic contribution of the paper is that it addresses a key issue that organizations are facing today, knowledge creation in a virtual context...|$|R
