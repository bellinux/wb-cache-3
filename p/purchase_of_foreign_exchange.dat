50|$|Sterilized {{intervention}} {{is a policy}} that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure {{is a combination of}} two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a nonsterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign-currency bonds with no change in the money supply. With sterilization, any <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> is accompanied by an equal-valued sale of domestic bonds, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Especially {{emigration}} was difficult, {{not only}} because after the Great Depression many countries restricted immigration, but because in 1931 the German government had introduced the Reichsfluchtsteuer, a tax at prohibitive tariffs against capital outflow. This tax made many German and foreign investors very hesitant to withdraw their capital from Germany. But in 1932 the Reichsfluchtsteuer did not really shy away German and foreign investors from withdrawing their capital from the country any more, so that the German government banned free marketing in foreign exchange in late 1932. From then on every sale and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> was subject to government approval. A great release was then the Ha'avarah Agreement initiated by Arlosoroff, which enabled about 50,000 Jewish German investors to withdraw capital at all, if they emigrated to Palestine, even though under the very costly prerogatives of the Reichsfluchtsteuer. The Familienblatt informed its readers about this little loophole in the German entrenchment against capital flight. Until 1935 the Familienblatt could increase its circulation to 36,500.|$|E

40|$|Sterilized <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market {{interventions}} are commonly dismissed by economists as an ineffective policy instrument. Nevertheless many central banks operating under independently floating exchange rates regimes are often engaged {{in sales and}} <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> in order to manipulate the current value of their currencies. In this paper we argue that the skepticism of many economists can be ascribed to their orientation on fundamental-based, efficient-market exchange rate models.

We found that China’s monetary policy regarding required reserves has not had a significant effect on dealing with excess liquidity, preventing inflation or controlling increases in the loan scale.

40|$|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are {{emerging}} as developing Asia's main policy tool for handling the region's excess <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves.

This percentage, however, is no better than random. U.

Other potential characteristics of intervention—notably, coordination and secrecy—did not seem to influence our success rates. ...|$|R
