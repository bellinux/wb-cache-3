5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that his speech was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 2006, another suspect, Guido Wever (the son of {{a former}} Aruban politician) was {{detained}} in the Netherlands on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, battering, and killing of Holloway. Wever was questioned for six days in Utrecht. Aruban prosecutors initially sought his transfer to the island, but he was instead released by agreement between the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> Wever's attorney.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> judges, however, {{discourage}} multiple charges, {{believing that}} they “clog” the system. The difficulty of proving each charge also accounts for this discouragement. [...] In {{order to bring}} one charge of cruelty for each animal, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> animal agencies must provide proof of cruelty to each animal, matching each animal with its count number. [...] Charging the hoarder with only one count reduces the burdens on the system, the <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>and</b> the animal agencies, but undermines {{the severity of the}} charges.|$|R

5|$|Diefenbaker {{continued}} practising law. In 1951, {{he gained}} national attention by accepting the Atherton case, {{in which a}} young telegraph operator {{had been accused of}} negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, {{the section}} of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This {{designation}} included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all {{named in honor of}} Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the Barry County <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.|$|E
5|$|Still another, Walter Kwiatkowski, {{testified that}} he paid Horton $600 (in {{addition}} to the $200 bond) to have the case against him dropped where Glasser was acting as <b>prosecutor.</b> <b>And</b> another, Victor Raubunas, {{testified that he}} twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling (Raubunas was convicted a third time, after refusing to pay Kretske, in a case prosecuted by Ward himself). Mae and Anthony Jurkas, two small-time bootleggers, testified that Glasser declined to prosecute them {{in exchange for the}} name of their bootlegging boss.|$|E

5|$|Thorne-Begland went on {{to serve}} 12 years as a <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> became chief deputy commonwealth's {{attorney}} for Richmond. In 2012, he was nominated to fill a vacancy on the state's 13th General District Court, which serves Richmond, Virginia. Before the vote, the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his homosexuality and past activism. He had served for a time {{on the board of}} Equality Virginia, a gay rights advocacy organization. If his nomination had succeeded, he would have become the first openly gay judge in the state.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2008, the RCMP {{ruled out}} laying {{criminal}} charges {{in relation to}} the accident. It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a Crown <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> that no wrongdoing was found. The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision and indicated that they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial inquest was possible, though it would take some time to come to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.|$|E

5|$|Robert Baer (a former North Jersey <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal}} judge) lost {{a breach}} of contract lawsuit he filed against Chase {{in federal court in}} Trenton, New Jersey, alleging he helped create the show, but Baer won a ruling that a jury should decide if and how much Baer should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and consultant. The gist of Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
