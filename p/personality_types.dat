The purpose of the research has been to determine whether <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> has predictive ability in student success in a high-technology classroom.

The review of the literature indicated that engineering types tend to be thinking types and judging types. Little study on engineering academics has been done, so the study was designed to determine if the engineering profile would be maintained, or if the call to academics resulted in a different <b>personality</b> <b>type.</b> There has been little research done to define preferred leadership style of particular groups of professionals, so this study sought to determine if there were such a preferred leadership style among engineering department chairpersons. Finally, the review of the literature suggested little research in determining prevailing methods of department chairperson selection; thus, this study sought to augment existent, sketchy details concerning academic chairperson selection and to determine if differences in selection process yielded different types of department chairpersons. <b>Personality</b> <b>type</b> was determined by the Myers/Briggs Type Indicator; preferred leadership style was determined by the Hersey-Blanchard LEAD-Self Instrument; and demographic information on method of selection, term, length of service, age, gender, degree, registration, and experience was requested. Chi-Square tests of independence were performed with the Yates 2 ̆ 7 Correction for Continuity where needed. Results indicated that there was no statistically significant relationship between engineering departments studied and selection method, <b>personality</b> <b>type,</b> or leadership style.

25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive <b>personality</b> <b>types.</b> Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E

Data were collected from each gender group and analyzed by gender group. Dropouts registering to take the general equivalency test through one of three cooperating programs in Clark County, Ohio, were contacted to participate in the study. Individuals were determined to have dropped out of school because of perceived school dissatisfaction by means of their responses on a checksheet of reasons for dropping out of school. The list was culled from the review of literature. Dropouts Identified as "dissatisfied" were then given the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Form G. A total of 262 dropouts were contacted before the sample size of fifty males and fifty females was reached. Four null hypotheses were generated for the study. Analysis of data using a binomial distribution resulted in a refection of the four hypotheses at a. 01 level of significance. Results of the analysis demonstrated the Introvert-Sensing-Thinking-Perceiving (ISTP) <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> for males and the Introvert-Sensing-Feeling-Perceiving (ISFP) <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> for females from the sample were statistically different from the general population. The Sensing (S) <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> characteristic for both gender groups in the sample was statistically different from the general population. Major conclusions were: 1) Males with an ISTP <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> and who are dissatisfied with school have a greater possibility of dropping out of school than males with other personality types; 2) Females with an ISFP <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> and who are dissatisfied with school have a greater possibility of dropping out of school than females with other personality types; and 3) Males and females determined to have the Sensing (S) <b>personality</b> <b>type</b> characteristic and who are dissatisfied with school are at a greater risk of dropping out of school than others displaying the Intuition CI) characteristic.
