500|$|Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a [...] "B" [...] rating {{and called it}} a [...] "mixed bag". He {{described}} performances by Vanessa Carlton and Bright Eyes as [...] "painful" [...] but also complimented the Barenaked Ladies and McLachlan for their collaboration. Willman considered Wilson's [...] "What a Year for a New Year" [...] the stand-out track of the album. Annie Zaleski of The Phoenix rated the album 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling some of the collection [...] "gorgeous and alluring" [...] {{but most of it}} [...] "subdued". Zaleski complimented the title track but criticized performances by Coldplay and Bright Eyes, the latter for its [...] "unsteady, wobbly twang". Zaleski and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times also praised [...] "12/23/95". Zaleski concluded: [...] "Not exactly your traditional take on traditional holiday fare, but a pleasant alternative to all the muzak you have to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> time of year." ...|$|E
500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, {{do you agree that}} AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it when they all walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've had to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

Lloyd Stinson, who became {{leader of the}} Manitoba CCF in 1952, claimed Bachynsky was [...] "such a volatile, vociferous orator that he was temperamentally unsuited to be an impartial moderator". Stinson also claims that Bachynsky consistently ruled against the CCF on procedural matters after becoming speaker.|$|R

2500|$|During 2008, Aeon {{started to}} work on the next studio album. In January 2009, the band toured in Europe with Hate Eternal, Misery Index and See You Next Tuesday. In September, Carlberg {{departed}} and was replaced by Victor Brandt of Satyricon. The members commented Carlberg's departure: [...] "Being on tour in a not-so-known death metal band like Aeon often means really tough conditions and bad economy. We totally understand that not everyone can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> way of life." [...] The band subsequently recorded its third studio album, Path of Fire, at Empire Studio in Östersund, Sweden. Nilsson and Dlimi recorded also the bass, because Brandt did not have enough time to learn the songs. The album was mixed the following month at Mana Recording Studios in St, Petersburg, Florida by Erik Rutan. In January 2010, Brandt departed and was replaced by Marcus Edvardsson of Souldrainer and Sanctification.|$|E

It was a great mistake. The khanate of Iravan was the Azeri territory, the Armenians were guests here". On the other hand, in 2009, {{the president of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Bako Sahakyan declared that [...] "Artsakh will never be a part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh security should never be an article of commerce either. As to other issues, we are ready to discuss them with Azerbaijan.". In 2010 president of Republic of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan in his speech in the Chatham House of the British Royal Institute of International Affairs declared that [...] "Karabakh was never a part of independent Azerbaijan: it was annexed to Azerbaijan by a decision of the Soviet Union party body. The people of Karabakh never <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> decision, and upon the first opportunity, seceded from the Soviet Union fully in line with the laws of the Soviet Union and the applicable international law".|$|E

The Pharisee in his {{approach}} to God, wipes his fingers of the Publican's enormities, will not come nigh him, lest he should defile himself with his beastly rags: [...] "I am not as other men are, nor yet as this Publican." [...] But the poor Publican, alas for him! his fingers are not clean, nor can he tell {{how to make them}} so; besides, he meekly and quietly <b>puts</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> reflection of the Pharisee upon him, and by silent behaviour justifies the severe sentence of that self-righteous man, concluding with him, that for his part he is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and not worthy to come nigh, or to stand by, so good, so virtuous, so holy, and so deserving a man as our sparkling Pharisee is.|$|R

She had given him up as a man abandons his attempts to make his favorite dog take the water. He would fain that the dog he loves should dash into the stream as other dogs will do. It is, to his thinking, a noble instinct in a dog. But his dog dreads the water.

I should also thank the faculty for giving me the opportunity of teaching some of the contents of this thesis in my last year at M. I. T.
