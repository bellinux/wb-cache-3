25|$|A study made by Takaki {{and colleagues}} (2006), {{focused on the}} gender {{differences}} with relationship to {{internal locus of control}} and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advices compared to the men that <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.|$|E
25|$|The European Y {{chromosome}} {{was more}} prevalent {{in the north and}} west (66.7-95%) and Native American ancestry increased in the center and southeast (37-50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0-8.8%). The states that <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> where Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatán. The largest amount of chromosomes found were identified as belonging to the haplogroups from Western Europe, East Europe and Eurasia, Siberia and the Americas and Northern Europe with relatively smaller traces of haplogroups from Central Asia, South-east Asia, South-central Asia, Western Asia, The Caucasus, North Africa, Near East, East Asia, North-east Asia, South-west Asia and the Middle East. Also a study published in 2011 on Mexican Mitochondrial DNA found that maternal ancestry was predominately Native American (85-90%), with a minority having European (5-7%) or African (3-5%) mtDNA.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{this can}} also occur when {{minorities}} living {{in rural areas}} undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life. Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food. [...] Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet; [...] this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from Cyprus, a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence. It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} stages of his career, Caudill's {{research}} interests focused on culture and personality and psychological studies. Later on, when Caudill became more involved with medical anthropology, his interests shifted towards mental illness, and the experiences of patients in psychiatric hospitals. Caudill's earliest research, funded by the University of Chicago, was conducted in July and August 1946 and consisted of psychological study of the Chippewa Indians of Lac du Flambeau. Caudill investigated whether personality change could be visible under conditions of acculturation. Caudill <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{as a member of a}} field party led by Dr. Irving Hallowell.|$|E
50|$|When Bishop {{began her}} studies of {{cognitive}} disorders, research to language development was relatively limited. Though more {{research has been}} conducted, {{there is not a}} cohesive framework of research for specialists to rely on when assessing and diagnosing children with language disorders. In 2016, Bishop began a multiple part Delphi project. In this particular project, Bishop is attempting to define a set criteria for identifying children who may need intervention through a multinational and multidiscipline study. In the first phase of this study, 59 experts of various fields such as education, speech-language therapy, and pediatrics from different countries such New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and United States of America <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> to provide a range of expertise and experience.

50|$|A {{study was}} done on the stress levels in general {{practitioners}} and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming {{the large number of}} medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a direct}} {{investigation}} of Kohlberg’s necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested {{the hypothesis that}} only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg’s moral stage 3. 146 grade 4-7 children <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> and the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3. Further support came from the study’s demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest. Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg’s necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5-14, {{for the first three}} stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development. [...] Results generally supported Kohlberg’s view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development. Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg’s theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed.|$|E

50|$|Social Media Use during Disasters is a {{research}} project that was conducted from July 2012 to October 2013, {{and it is one}} of the major contributions by the START research center to the risk communication field. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter are used to collect and distribute information quickly and easily. Because of this function of social media, it is being used as a tool to communicate about disasters. “Given the growing importance of social media as a disaster communication tool, it is vital to understand how individuals use, behave, and interpret information on social media sites to better inform policy, guidance, and operations and to ensure that emergency managers, first responders, and policy makers can best optimize how they use these tools.”. A random sample of 2,015 U.S. residents <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> The participants were asked to imagine that a disaster involving multiple terrorist attacks was unfolding. The participants were then presented with information from both local and national sources about the disaster through Facebook posts and tweets. Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their responses to the information. The study found that the source of the information impacted its perceived credibility. However, the source alone did not influence participants’ likelihood of taking recommended action. The study also showed that after participants were exposed to the information they were more likely to communicate that information through interpersonal channels rather than through organizational media channels. Finally, the study also showed that demographics such as gender and age affected how participants responded to the information.|$|E
