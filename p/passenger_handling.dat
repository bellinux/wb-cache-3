25|$|The PCT Steering Committee also {{highlighted}} {{that between}} 2002-2008, cruise ship berthing had grown {{at an annual}} rate of 18%, culminating in an estimated 250,000 passengers entering from the OPT.

The opening of the White Bay Cruise Terminal in Balmain East in August 2013, has helped to alleviate some of the congestion experienced by the Overseas Passenger Terminal.
