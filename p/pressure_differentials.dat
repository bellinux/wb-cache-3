5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} to withstand the <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally {{was built in the}} Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{chambers}} in the fuel regulator {{portion of the}} carburetor. They are referred to by letters A, B, C, and D, with the A chamber closest to the throttle body. The fuel metering servo valve responds to <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> across the diaphragms separating the chambers. The resulting diaphragm movement controls fuel flow into the engine under all flight conditions.|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve controller that uses an existing <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> as {{some or all}} of the power source for valve operation. In a high pressure environment, such as downhole in an oil or gas well, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> between the inside of a pipe and the outside of the pipe may be adequately large to drive a linear slide valve. The valve is operated hydraulically by a piston in a bore. When a higher pressure is applied to one end of the bore and a lower pressure to the other end, the piston moves in response to the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> and drives a valve attached to it. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> is too small to drive the piston at a sufficiently high speed, a pump is provided to generate a larger <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> to be applied. The apparatus is conveniently constructed using multiport valves, which can be rotary valves...|$|R
40|$|When {{a tornado}} travels very fast, an {{unsteady}} <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> between {{the inside and}} outside of a building is generated by suddenly-dropped atmospheric pressure due to the tornado. However, there is little information about the characteristics of a force caused by the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential.</b> The authors developed an experimental system which generated a suddenly-dropping pressure around a building model in a calm condition using a gusty wind tunnel. The effects of an opening area of a building wall on the force generated by the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> were studied using the system. We also performed some numerical simulations and compared with the experimental results. It was found that the bigger force of <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> was generated in a case of the smaller opening area...|$|R

25|$|Some squamate species (e.g., pythons {{and monitor}} lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become {{functionally}} four-chambered hearts during contraction. This {{is made possible}} by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.|$|E
25|$|A {{revolving}} door has {{three or four}} doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials.</b> In order to address this problem, the {{revolving door}} was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7, 1888.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by {{people such as}} Robert Workman suggested that the criterion was not the ratio of pressures, but the actual <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials.</b> Applied to Haldane's work, this {{would suggest that the}} limit is not determined by the 1.58:1 ratio but rather by the critical difference of 0.58 atmospheres between tissue pressure and ambient pressure. Most tables today, including the Bühlmann tables, are based on the critical difference model.|$|E
50|$|Cuttings are rock {{fragments}} chipped, scraped or crushed {{away from}} a formation {{by the action of}} the bit. The size, shape and amount of cuttings depend largely on formation type, weight on the bit, bit dullness and the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> (formation versus fluid hydrostatic pressures).The size of the cuttings usually decreases as the bit dulls during drilling if weight on bit, formation type and the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential,</b> remain constant. However, if the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> changes (formation <b>pressure</b> increase),even a dull bit could cut more effectively, and the size, shape and amount of cuttings could increase.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a system}} and a method for controlling water discharge. The method for controlling water discharge comprises the following steps of: starting a water discharge control system; collecting a water discharge value inside a by-pass pipe in a secondary pump chilled water system of a central air conditioner, and a near-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> value and a far-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> value of a use side in the secondary pump chilled water system of the central air conditioner; determining the maximal near-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> set value of the user side; determining the near-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> set value of the user side; comparing the collected near-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> value with the determined near-end <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> set value, and adjusting operating parameters of the secondary pump {{on the basis of}} a comparison result, and finishing the adjusting process of the secondary pump. The operating parameters of the secondary pump can be adjusted by virtue of the system and the method for controlling water discharge, so that the water discharge in a water supply pipe of the user side in the chilled water system of the central air conditioner is adjusted; and the condition that the water discharge inside a water return pipe of the user side is not greater than that in the water supply pipe of a host side is ensured, and reverse backflow in the by-pass pipe is prevented finally. 本发明公开了一种水流量控制系统及方法，所述水流量控制方法包括执行以下步骤：启动所述水流量控制系统；采集中央空调二次泵冷冻水系统中旁通管内的水流量值以及中央空调二次泵冷冻水系统中用户侧的近端压差值和远端压差值；确定用户侧的最大近端压差设定值；确定用户侧的近端压差设定值；比较采集的近端压差值与确定的近端压差设定值，并基于比较结果调整二次泵的运行参数；二次泵的调整过程结束。通过该水流量控制系统及方法可以调整二次泵的运行参数，从而调节中央空调冷冻水系统中用户侧供水管中的水流量，确保用户侧回水管中的水流量不大于主机侧供水管中的水流量，最终防止旁通管中逆向回流的发生。Department of Building Services EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 王盛卫Title in Traditional Chinese: 水流量控制系統及方法Chin...|$|R

25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials.</b> The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E
2500|$|During the climb, {{the crew}} made {{preparations}} to detour around thunderstorms along the aircraft's track; the Captain anticipated turbulence {{and kept the}} passenger seatbelt sign lit. At 02:09, 17 minutes into the flight, as the plane was passing from [...] to , the flight crew heard a loud [...] "thump" [...] which shook the aircraft. A second and a half later, the forward cargo door blew off. The door swung out {{with such force that}} it passed its normal stop and slammed {{into the side of the}} fuselage, bursting the fuselage open. [...] <b>Pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> and aerodynamic forces caused the cabin floor to cave in, and 10 seats (G and H of rows 8 through 12) were ejected from the cabin. All 8 passengers seated in these locations were killed (seats 8G and 12G were unoccupied), as was the passenger in seat 9F. [...] A gaping hole was left in the aircraft, through which a flight attendant in the business-class cabin was almost blown out of the aircraft. Passengers and crew members saw her clinging to a seat leg and were able to pull her back inside the cabin, although she was severely injured. Senior flight attendant Laura Brentlinger hung on to the steps leading to the upper deck, and was dangling from them when the decompression occurred.|$|E

The corresponding distribution law and maximum wind pressure point were found. At the same time, the indoor pressure among the laboratory rooms was studied and simulated {{when the door}} opened, to learn what <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> can prevent air flow from a low pressure region to a high pressure region.
