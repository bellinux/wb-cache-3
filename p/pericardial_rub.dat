50|$|Pericardial {{friction}} rub {{is one of}} several, similar sounds. A {{differential diagnosis}} may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible. Pericardial friction rub may have one, two, or three audible components, whereas the similar pleural friction rub ordinarily has two audible components. One- and two-component rubs are ambiguous. A three-component rub distinguishes a <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural rub can only be heard during inspiration and expiration, whereas, the <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural rub creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> is always central in location. The intensity of pleural rub is increased on pressing the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the affected area, whereas {{there is no such}} change in case of a <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis may be {{suspected}} {{based on}} low blood pressure, jugular venous distension, <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub,</b> or quiet heart sounds. The diagnosis may be further supported by specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, chest X-ray, or an ultrasound of the heart. If fluid increases slowly the pericardial sac can expand to contain more than 2 liters; however, if {{the increase is}} rapid as little as 200 mL can result in tamponade.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{pericarditis}} {{is believed to}} be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub,</b> specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include a heart attack.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical incidence and outcomes {{of patients with}} pericarditis after thrombolytic therapy, 810 patients were prospectively studied during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis {{was defined as the}} presence of a <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub</b> during the hospital course. Only 5 % of patients developed a rub during AMI, a low percent compared with that in the prethrombolytic era. A <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub</b> more often occurred in the setting of an anterior wall AMI. Patients with, compared to those without, a <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub</b> had lower ejection fractions (45 vs 51 %, P = 0. 002); worse regional left ventricular function (- 3. 2 vs 2. 7, standard deviation per chord); higher in-hospital mortality (15 vs 6 %, P = 0. 056); a higher frequency of power failure (83 vs 57 %); a higher frequency of anterior wall location of the AMI (53 % of cases, P = 0. 002); and a higher frequency of 3 -vessel disease. Therefore, although the frequency of a <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub</b> was low (5 %) compared with that in the prethrombolytic era, its occurrence denotes more extensive myocardial damage with a worse clinical outcome. Perhaps with successful reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel, transmural myocardial necrosis is prevented and with it the development of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Means-Lerman scratch is an {{uncommon}} type of heart murmur which occurs {{in patients with}} hyperthyroidism. It is a mid-systolic scratching sound best heard over {{the upper part of}} the sternum or second left intercostal space at the end of expiration.

5000|$|A pericardial {{friction}} rub, also <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub,</b> is {{an audible}} medical sign {{used in the}} diagnosis of pericarditis. [...] Upon auscultation, this sign is an extra heart sound of to-and-fro character, typically with three components, ONE systolic and TWO diastolic. It resembles the sound of squeaky leather and often is described as grating, scratching, or rasping. The sound seems {{very close to the}} ear and may seem louder than or may even mask the other heart sounds. The sound usually is best heard between the apex and sternum but may be widespread.|$|E
5000|$|A pericardial {{friction}} rub is a {{very specific}} sign of acute pericarditis, meaning {{the presence of this}} sign invariably indicates presence of disease. However, absence of this sign does not rule out disease. This rub can be best heard by the diaphragm of the stethoscope at the left sternal border arising as a squeaky or scratching sound, resembling the sound of leather rubbing against each other. This sound should be distinguished from the sound of a murmur, which is similar but sounds more like a [...] "swish" [...] sound than a scratching sound. The <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> is said to be generated from the friction generated by the two inflamed layers of the pericardium; however, even a large pericardial effusion does not necessarily present a rub. The rub is best heard during the maximal movement of the heart within the pericardial sac, namely, during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the filling phase of early ventricular diastole.|$|E
50|$|During {{medical doctor}} examination, a <b>pericardial</b> {{friction}} <b>rub</b> can be auscultated indicating pericarditis. Auscultation {{of the lungs}} can show crackles indicating pulmonary infiltration, and there can be retrosternal/pleuritic chest pain worse on inspiration (breathing in). Patient can also depict sweating (diaphoresis) and agitation or anxiety.|$|R
50|$|For acute {{pericarditis}} {{to formally}} be diagnosed, {{two or more}} of the following criteria must be present: chest pain consistent with a diagnosis of acute pericarditis (sharp chest pain worsened by breathing in or a cough), a <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub,</b> a <b>pericardial</b> effusion, and changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with acute pericarditis.|$|R
50|$|The {{pericardium}} is a double-walled sac {{around the}} heart. The {{inner and outer}} (visceral and parietal, respectively) layers are normally lubricated by {{a small amount of}} pericardial fluid, but the inflammation of pericardium causes the walls to rub against each other with audible friction. In children, rheumatic fever is often the cause of <b>pericardial</b> friction <b>rub.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} disigned to {{evaluate}} the clinical significance of PQ segment depression and to examine the frequency of PQ segment depression in infarction-associated pericarditis. Background. PQ segment deviation is almost as characteristic as the classic ST segment deviation and is detected in most patients with pericarditis. However, the incidence and clinical characteristics of PQ segment depression in acute myocardial infarction are not defined. Methods. Three hundred four consecutive patients with acute Q wave anterior wall myocardial infarction were examined carefully by auscultation, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest roentgenogram. The diagnosis of pericarditis was {{made on the basis}} of <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> detected by more than two observers during the 1 st 3 days after hospital admission. At least 0. 5 mm of PQ segment depression from the TP segment observed for > 24 h in both limb and precordial loads was considered diagnostic of PQ segment depression. Results. A <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> was present in 65 patients (21 %) and absent in 239 patients. PQ segment depression was detected in both limb and precordial loads in 30 patients (10 %) : 18 patients with <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> and 12 patients without <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub.</b> On the basis of five clinical variables, multivariate analysis was performed to determine the important variables related to the occurrence of PQ segment depression. <b>Pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> was selected with left ventricular segments with advanced asynergy as a significant factor related to PQ segment depression. There were 31 in-hospital deaths, and a significantly higher hospital mortality rate was observed in patients with PQ segment depression (23 % vs. 9 %). Conclusions. Although PQ segment depression was observed in a minority of patients with infarction-associated pericarditis, it was one of the clinical signs of larger infarct size and increased hospital deaths...|$|E
30|$|Carditis is {{the single}} most {{important}} prognostic factor in rheumatic fever [1, 3, 11]; only valvulitis leads to permanent damage and its presence determines the prophylactic strategy [31]. The clinical diagnosis of carditis in an index attack of rheumatic fever is based on the presence of significant murmurs (suggestive of mitral and aortic regurgitation), <b>pericardial</b> <b>rub</b> or unexplained cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure. Even careful clinical auscultation can miss mild valvular regurgitation [15, 32]. Two dimensional echo-Doppler and colour flow Doppler echocardiography are most sensitive for detecting structural abnormality, abnormal blood flow and valvular regurgitation [13, 33 â€“ 35]. This method can detect all valvular regurgitations; where as some of them can be not audible or difficult to hear.|$|E
40|$|Clinical examination, {{electrocardiogram}} and skiagram ofchest {{have very}} low sensitivity in evaluation of pericardial diseases.

Merits and limitations of echocardiography and itâ€™s status as compared to other non-invasive investigations are discussed.

40|$|SUMMARY Pulmonary {{hypertension}} in systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) {{in the absence of}} chronic parenchymal lung disease or pulmonary emboli is rare. We report such a case with an acute and rapidly progressive onset of symptoms in a patient who had started taking the contraceptive pill eight months previously. A 22 -year-old woman presented with a three-week history of increasing dyspnoea, pleuritic pain, and a skin rash. Three years previously she had an isolated episode of acute arthritis affecting some of the small joints of the hands and feet, which terminated spontaneously after one week. She remained well and had a normal first pregnancy, after which she started taking the contraceptive pill Eugynon 30 (ethinyloestradiol 30 gg, levonorgestrel 250 Rg) for the first time. Nine months later she was admitted to hospital looking extremely ill, dyspnoeic, centrally cyanosed, pyrexic, and she had a widespread vasculitic rash.

We aimed to analyse the clinical laboratory data of PMY at diagnosis and during follow-up, {{in order to assess}} the natural history and prognostic stratification of the disease (including different aetiology). METHODS: We enrolled 62 consecutive patients (men 79 %, aged 38 â€ŠÂ±â€Š 18 years) with PMY (84 % idiopathic, 8 % autoimmune, 8 % infective) from August 2002 to July 2010. The diagnosis has been made according to clinical and laboratory data (significant increase of troponin I in all patients). After at least 1 year (mean follow-up: 1635 â€ŠÂ±â€Š 298 days), 59 patients (95 %) had available data. RESULTS: Chest pain was present in 59 patients (95 %), flu-like syndrome in 36 (58 %) and <b>pericardial</b> <b>rubs</b> in 15 (24 %). None of the patients showed heart failure at presentation. At admission, eight patients (13 %) presented mild-moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 13 (22 %) showed wall motion abnormalities, and 10 (17 %) showed mild pericardial effusion. At 1 year no patients died, developed heart failure or showed abnormal echocardiogram. NSAIDs were the first choice therapy in 61 (98 %) patients with clinical resolution in 58 (95 %) of them. Seven patients (12 %) experienced intermittent recurrences without development of constrictive pericarditis or heart failure.
