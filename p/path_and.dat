40|$|AbstractSince Cohen {{introduced}} the competition graph in 1968, the competition graph {{has been studied}} widely and many variations of it have been discussed. In 2000, Cho, Kim and Nam defined and studied the m-step competition graph and computed the 2 -step competition numbers of <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> cycles. Recently, Ho gave bounds for the m-step competition numbers of <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> cycles. In this paper we continue to study the m-step competition numbers of <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> cycles, partially improve the results of Ho on the upper bounds of the m-step competition numbers of <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> cycles, and show that a conjecture posed by Ho is not true...|$|R

Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September13.
