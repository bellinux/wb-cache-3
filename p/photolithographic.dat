25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} gratings were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction gratings, succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, <b>photolithographic</b> techniques allowed gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} as efficient as ruled gratings, but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less stray light. A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master gratings of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>photolithographic</b> {{technology}} is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, the English {{language}} {{rough draft}} of the Treaty was published along with <b>photolithographic</b> facsimiles, and the originals were returned to storage. In 1911, historian and bibliographer Dr Thomas Hocken, searching for historical documents, found the Treaty papers in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents. The papers were restored by the Dominion Museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the Treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the Treaty House during the Centenary celebrations. It was possibly {{the first time the}} Treaty document had been on public display since it was signed. After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with the Public Trustee at Palmerston North by the local MP, who did not tell staff what was in the case. However, as the case was too large to fit in the safe, the Treaty document spent the war at the side of a back corridor in the Public Trust office.|$|E
500|$|Staunton {{continued}} {{writing the}} chess column in The Illustrated London News {{until his death}} in 1874, greeting new developments with enthusiasm. In 1860 he published Chess Praxis, a supplement to his 1847 work The Chess Player's Handbook. The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy's games and praised the American's play. Five years later Staunton published Great Schools of England (1865), whose main subject was the history of major English public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas: learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged; corporal punishment is to be avoided and fagging should be abolished.Also summarised at [...] But most of his later life was occupied in writing about Shakespeare, including: a <b>photolithographic</b> reproduction of the 1600 Quarto of Much Ado about Nothing in 1864 and of the First Folio of Shakespeare in 1866; and papers on Unsuspected Corruptions of Shakespeare's Text, published from 1872 to his death. All these works were highly regarded at the time. When he died suddenly of heart disease, on 22 June 1874, he was at his desk writing one of these papers. At the same time he was also working on his last chess book, Chess: Theory and Practice, which was published posthumously in 1876.|$|E

After many repetitions, the sequences of every probe become fully constructed. More recently, Maskless Array Synthesis from NimbleGen Systems has combined flexibility with large numbers of probes.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} with measuring on single molecules is to establish reproducible electrical contact with only one molecule and doing so without shortcutting the electrodes.

50|$|The {{development}} of halftone printing methods for lithography {{appears to have}} followed a largely independent path. In the 1860s, A.

By the 1880s, Hoen was working on halftone methods {{that could be used}} in conjunction with either hand-worked or <b>photolithographic</b> stones.|$|E
50|$|The {{mercury probe}} is an {{electrical}} probing device to make rapid, non-destructive contact {{to a sample}} for electrical characterization. Its primary application is semiconductor measurements where otherwise time-consuming metallizations or <b>photolithographic</b> processing are required to make contact to a sample. These processing steps usually take hours {{and have to be}} avoided where possible to reduce device processing times.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{principle}} {{is the same}} as in interferometry or holography. An interference pattern between two or more coherent light waves is set up and recorded in a recording layer (photoresist). This interference pattern consists of a periodic series of fringes representing intensity minima and maxima. Upon post-exposure <b>photolithographic</b> processing, a photoresist pattern corresponding to the periodic intensity pattern emerges.|$|E

50|$|A Ronchi ruling or Ronchi grating, {{named after}} the Italian {{physicist}} Vasco Ronchi, is a constant-interval bar and space square wave optical target that has a high edge definition and contrast ratio. Ronchi rulings are commonly manufactured through <b>photolithographic</b> deposition of chrome on glass or optical substrates. Ronchi rulings are used for optical testing purposes, e.g., the Ronchi test and as scales for a linear encoder.|$|E

50|$|Circuits can be {{constructed}} of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today {{it is much more}} common to create interconnections by <b>photolithographic</b> techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an integrated circuit or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as silicon or (less commonly) gallium arsenide.|$|E
50|$|Particles in UPW are {{the bane}} of the {{semiconductor}} industry, causing defects in sensitive <b>photolithographic</b> processes that define nanometer sized features. In other industries their effects can range from a nuisance to life-threatening defects. Particles can be controlled by use of filtration and ultrafiltration. Sources can include bacterial fragments, the sloughing of the component walls within the conduit’s wetted stream and also the cleanliness of the jointing processes used to build the piping system.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{board-level}} designs {{composed of}} discrete parts, {{it is not}} practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture. Further, {{the high costs of}} <b>photolithographic</b> masks and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built. Simulating the circuit with SPICE is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit.|$|E
