40|$|<b>Patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a {{major part}} of many {{healthcare}} services. It can reduce the number of un-necessary hospitalizations, while increasing the access to healthcare to those who really need these services. Wireless and mobile technologies are finding a role in <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> in several different environments: homes, hospitals, and nursing homes. However, due to several limitations including unpredictable and spotty coverage of users by wireless networks, the quality and reliability of <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> have not been highly satisfactory.

50|$|Some digital patient monitors, {{especially}} those used EMS services, often incorporate a defibrillator into the <b>patient</b> <b>monitor</b> itself. These monitor/defibrillators usually have the normal capabilities of an ICU monitor, but have manual (and usually semi-automatic AED)defibrillation capability. This is particular good for EMS services, {{who need a}} compact, easy to use monitor and defibrillator, {{as well as for}} inter- or intrafacility patient transport. Most monitor defibrillators also have transcutaneous pacing capability via large AED like adhesive pads (which often can be used for monitoring, defibrillation and pacing)that are applied to the patient in an anterior-posterior configuration. The monitor defibrillator units often have specialized monitoring parameters such as waveform capnography, invasive BP, and in some monitors, Masimo Rainbow SET pulse oximetry.Examples of monitor defibrillators are the Lifepak 12, 15 and 20 made by Physio Control, the Philips Heartstart MRx, and the E, R, and X Series by ZOLL Medical.|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Patients with {{life-threatening}} conditions require constant {{monitoring of}} their vital signs, such as {{heart rate and}} respiration rate. This task is usually performed by a nurse using a bedside monitor for each patient. These devices require a nurse to remain physically close to the patient at all times and each device allows for the monitoring of only one patient at a time. Although nurses can remotely monitor patients from the nursing station, they must remain near the nursing station or bedside. In addition, there are functions that are only available at the bedside monitor, such as silencing an alarm. This project presents an alternative to a bedside <b>patient</b> <b>monitor</b> by utilizing a tablet as a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitor,</b> giving the nurse more flexibility. The goal {{of this study was}} to establish a set of design guidelines for a mobile patient monitoring application with a user-friendly and efficient interface.

40|$|Background: Patient {{monitoring}} displays {{are designed}} to improve patient safety, and yet {{little is known about}} how anesthesiologists interact with these displays. Previous studies of clinician behavior used an observer in the operating room, which may have altered behavior. We describe a covert observation technique to determine how often and for how long anesthesiologists actually look at the monitoring display during different segments of the maintenance phase of anesthesia, and to determine whether this changed with more than 1 anesthesia provider or during concomitant activities such as reading. Methods: Five staff anesthesiologists, 2 anesthesia fellows, 3 anesthesia residents, and 2 medical students were covertly videotaped across 10 dual anesthesia provider cases and 10 solo cases. Videotapes were later segmented (5 minutes postinduction [early maintenance], mid-maintenance, and immediately before the drapes came down [late maintenance]) and coded for looking behavior at the <b>patient</b> <b>monitor,</b> anesthesia chart, and other reading material. Results: Anesthesiologists looked at the monitor in 1 - to 2 -second glances, performed frequently throughout the 3 segments of maintenance anesthesia.

40|$|Mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{refers to}} {{continuous}} or frequent measurement {{and analysis of}} biosignals of a patient by employing mobile computing and wireless communication technologies ‐ irrespective of patient’s location. Some of the common biosignals are ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), MagnetoEncephaloGram (MEG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Common problems observed during the trials of mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems are as follows: 1) Due to patient mobility and wireless networks availability changes, continuity of <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> is affected; 2) The QoS offered by currently deployed wireless networks is variable ‐ and hence {{it may not be}} sufficient to transmit higher amount of biosignals data; and 3) The duration of a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> session is affected due to limited battery capacity of a mobile device. This thesis researches solution to these problems using context‐aware computing paradigm and vertical handover technique. Herewith, we propose two context‐aware vertical handover mechanisms which address wireless network connectivity problems resulting from patient mobility and select the wireless network that best satisfies QoS requirements of continuous biosignals delivery. Following the context‐aware computing paradigm, we also adapted proposed handover mechanism to use a wireless network interface the use of which reduces power consumption of certain types of handheld mobile devices used in a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system...|$|R
