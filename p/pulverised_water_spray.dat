40|$|In a gas {{processing}} plant and in offshore platforms a gas explosion could have serious consequences, {{and it is}} therefore essential to have mitigation systems that can prevent and/or reduce unwanted scenarios. One such mitigating technique that {{has proved to be}} effective is <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> and deluge systems. Since such systems often already are installed in most industries to use in a fire-situation, this has become an attractive method in fighting gas explosions. Experimental work has been done with the use of <b>water</b> <b>spray,</b> and the main results are that activation of <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> before an ignition can reduce rapid flame acceleration that otherwise could result in high-pressure build-up. Because the consequences of a gas explosion depends on many different parameters, a numerical model was developed that could handle different scenarios and give good results. The model was named FLACS (FLame ACceleration Simulator), and is a tree-dimensional gas explosion and gas-dispersing tool. FLACS is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CDF) code. FLACS 2. 2. 5 (2001) is the current version, where the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> is defined by a simplified box-model that assumes uniform parameters inside each box area. This model doesn’t include transport of droplets with the flow, reduction in burning velocity due to a temperature drop caused by the <b>water</b> <b>spray,</b> and turbulence and temperature changes due to break-up and evaporation of droplets. A new model, FLACS 2. 2. 6 (2004), is developed that takes into account the transport and break-up of droplets. An equation connecting the reduction in burning velocity to the amount of <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> over the amount of gas was therefore developed, and a setup file determining evaporation of droplets of different sizes was included to the model. This model is called FLACS 2. 2. 6 *. Results from the simulations show that <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> will have the best mitigating effect: * In scenarios with sufficient ventilation openings and obstructions * When it is activated at the accelerating phase of the explosion * When the ignition occurs {{at the end of the}} cloud * When not activated only near ignition FLACS 2. 2. 5 does in most cases give a good representation of a real situation, but one weakness is that in scenarios where the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> normally would be transported with the flow FLACS 2. 2. 5 has a tendency to under predicate the results. FLACS 2. 2. 6 * without the setup-file gives a good representation of the explosion pressure with the explosion box, but does in most cases over predicate the time of arrival. The tendencies are although the same as in the experiments. FLACS 2. 2. 6 * with the setup-file over predicates both the explosion pressure and the time of arrival. The deviations are probably because the flow doesn’t reach high enough values to fulfil the critical droplet velocity, and the evaporation and extraction of energy is thereby not effective. With the M 24 - 25 module the results with the setup-file gives much better results. In this geometry the flow propagates over a larger distance, and thereby the break-up and evaporation of droplets will influence the results. A general source to deviation in the results is that the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> is also exiting the nozzle as a narrow jet instead of a broad cone, as it would do in real life, and the lack of initial <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> turbulence gives a over predication in the time of arrival. A report written by DNV concerning a detailed probabilistic explosion analysis at Kårstø states that due to the high explosion loads that is calculated, it is recommended to consider mitigating measures [1]. Explosion simulations performed with the Kårstø geometry show that the explosion pressure is significantly reduced when <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> is activated at gas detection, if the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> is located far from ignition or over a large area. The formation of a large flammable gas cloud and the spreading of gas to other areas would result in a stronger explosion and more serious consequences. Simulations were performed to investigate the effect of <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> on gas dispersion at the Kårstø facility. The <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> will have a negative effect on the gas dispersion because the activation of <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> will cause turbulence and then increased mixing of gas and air. The <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> will have a positive effect by limiting the spreading of the gas to other areas...|$|R

40|$|The <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> {{systems in}} high {{efficiency}} particulate air (HEPA) filter plenums {{that are used}} in nearly all Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for protection against fire was designed under the assumption that the HEPA filters would not be damaged by the <b>water</b> <b>sprays.</b> The most likely scenario for filter damage involves filter plugging by the <b>water</b> <b>spray,</b> followed by the fan blowing out the filter medium. A number of controlled laboratory tests that were previously conducted in the late 1980 s are reviewed in this paper to provide a technical basis for the potential HEPA filter damage by the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> system in HEPA filter plenums. In addition to the laboratory tests, the scenario for HEPA filter damage during fires has also occurred in the field. Afire in a four-stage, HEPA filter plenum at Rocky Flats in 1980 caused the first three stages of HEPA filters to blow out of their housing and the fourth stage to severely bow. Details of this recently declassified fire are presented in this paper. Although these previous findings suggest serious potential problems exist with the current <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> system in filter plenum, additional studies are required to confirm unequivocally that DOE`s critical facilities are at risk...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> and crosswind {{on the effectiveness of}} the natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT), a three-dimensional model has been developed. Efficiency of NDDCT is improved by <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> system at the cooling tower entrance for high ambient temperature condition with and without crosswind. The natural and forced heat convection flow inside and around the NDDCT is simulated numerically by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations in both air and water droplet phases. Comparison of the numerical results with one-dimensional analytical model and the experimental data illustrates a well-predicted heat transfer rate in the cooling tower. Applying <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> system on the cooling tower radiators enhances the cooling tower efficiency at both no wind and windy conditions. For all values of <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> rate, NDDCTs operate most effectively at the crosswind velocity of 3 m/s and as the wind speed continues to rise to more than 3 m/s up to 12 m/s, the tower efficiency will decrease by approximately 18 %, based on no-wind condition.

40|$|Wood-plasticlumber is {{promoted}} as a low-maintenance high-durability product. After weathering, however, wood-plasticcomposites (WPCs) often fide and lose mechanical properties. In {{the first part}} ofthis study, 50 % wood-flour-filled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite samples were injection molded or extruded. Composites were exposed to two accelerated weathering cycles in a xenon-arc type weathering apparatus; either ultraviolet (UV) light only or UV light and <b>water</b> <b>spray.</b> The composites lightened less when they were exposed to only UV light compared with exposure to UV light and <b>water</b> <b>spray.</b> The change in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and strength was also much less when the composites were exposed to UV light only.

Again the amount of lightening and loss in mechanical properties was less when the composites were exposed to UV light only compared with exposure to UV light and <b>water</b> <b>spray.</b> The pigment was more effective than the ultraviolet absorber retaining composite properties. The pigment had a larger impact on property retention when the composites were exposed to UV light and <b>water</b> <b>spray.</b> The results of this study demonstrate that exposing WPCs to <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> in combination with UV light is more severe than exposing WPCs to only UV light. This is likely a result of the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> washing away the degraded layer and wood extractives during weathering, as well as causing the wood-plastic interface to be compromised through dimensional changes in the wood particles...|$|R

A typical spray tower was modified to simulate the confined space for people's enterable routine operation (e. g., pump room), in which the dilution capacity of <b>water</b> <b>sprays</b> can also be evaluated. This work consists of two parts: the first part focuses on the influences of different operating conditions on chemical dilution capacities of <b>water</b> <b>sprays</b> in mechanisms; the second one is comparison between two nozzle configurations for evaluating their feasibilities of practical application. <b>Water</b> <b>sprays</b> express eligible performance for H 2 S release control even though their dilution capacity was weakened at high gaseous concentrations and rates of releases.
