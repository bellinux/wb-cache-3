50|$|Before Hobbs and his revolutionary lock designs, locks {{were opened}} {{by making a}} series of false keys, {{in a process that}} could take {{extremely}} long periods of time; if the series was not properly completed in the lock, and the combination not exactly correct, the lock could not be defeated. This design was accepted as quite unbreakable until Hobbs became the first to be able to pick them, by using very fine and careful manual dexterity; applying a certain level of pressure on the bolt while manipulating each lever, one at time, using a tiny <b>pick</b> <b>inserted</b> through the keyhole.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, several {{investigators}} {{have reported that}} implants <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> autografts in the same operation (ie, simultaneously inserted implants [SIIs]) have achieved excellent results. However, no report regarding SIIs placed in fresh frozen bone (FFB) is available. Thus, the authors planned a retrospective study {{on a series of}} SIIs placed in homologue FFB (but not immediately loaded) to evaluate their clinical outcome. In addition, a comparison with implants <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> FFB in a second stage (ie, delayed inserted implants) was performed. Seventeen patients were grafted with FFB, and 48 implants were <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> the same operation. Implant diameter and length ranged from 3. 25 to 4. 0 mm and from 10. 0 to 15 mm, respectively. Data were compared with 302 implants <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> FFB in a second operation during the same period in 64 patients. Analyzing SIIs, it was noted that only 3 implants were lost (ie, survival rate [SVR] = 93. 7 %), and no differences were detected among the studied variables by using lost implants as a predictor of clinical outcome. On the contrary, by using crestal bone resorption around the implant's neck and specific cutoff values, it was possible to demonstrate that prosthetic restoration (ie, removable overdentures) correlated with a statistically significant lower delta insertion abutment junction (ie, reduced crestal bone loss) and thus with a better clinical outcome. By comparing SIIs with implants <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> a second stage in FFB, a better outcome for delayed implants was demonstrated. Implants inserted simultaneously with FFB grafts had a high survival and success rate. SIIs <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> FFB can be considered reliable devices, although a higher marginal bone loss is to be expected when fixed prosthetic restorations are used. Implants <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> a second surgical stage have a better SVR and success rate than SIIs...|$|R

40|$|The Deinococcus-Thermus {{group of}} species is {{currently}} recognized as a distinct phylum {{solely on the basis}} of their branching in 16 S rRNA trees. No unique biochemical or molecular characteristics that can distinguish this group from all other bacteria are known at present. In this work, we describe eight conserved indels (viz., <b>inserts</b> or deletions) <b>in</b> seven widely distributed proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum but are not found in any other group of bacteria. The identified signatures include a 7 -amino-acid (aa) <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> threonyl-tRNA synthetase, 1 - and 3 -aa <b>inserts</b> <b>in</b> the RNA polymerase β′ subunit, a 5 -aa deletion in signal recognition particle (Ffh/SR 54), a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> major sigma factor 70 (σ 70), a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), a 1 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> ribosomal protein L 1, and a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> UvrA homologs. By using PCR primers for conserved regions, fragments of these genes were amplified from a number of Deinococcus-Thermus species, and all such fragments (except SerRS in Deinococcus proteolyticus) were found to contain the indicated signatures. The presence of these signatures in various species from all three known genera within this phylum, viz., Deinococcus, Thermus, and Meiothermus, provide evidence that they are likely distinctive characteristics of the entire phylum which were introduced in a common ancestor of this group. The signature in SerRS, which is absent in D. proteolyticus, was likely introduced after the branching of this species. Phylogenetic studies as well as the nature of the <b>inserts</b> <b>in</b> some of these proteins (viz., σ 70 and SerRS) also support a sister group relationship between the Thermus and the Meiothermus genera. The identified signatures provide strong evidence for the monophyletic nature of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. These molecular markers should prove very useful in the identification of new species related to this group...|$|R
