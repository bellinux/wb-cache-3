2500|$|Interpreting the {{attributes}} of God in [...] Judah Halevi argued that all characterizations of God, except for the four-letter Name of God, the Tetragrammaton, are predicates and attributive descriptions, derived from the way God's actions affect the world. People call God [...] "merciful" [...] if God improves the condition of someone whom people pity. People attribute to God [...] "mercy" [...] and [...] "compassion," [...] although Halevi saw these attributes as weaknesses of the soul and a quick movement of nature. Halevi argued that this cannot actually be applied to God, who is a just Judge, ordaining poverty for one and wealth to another. God's nature, Halevi argued, remains unaffected, having no sympathy for one, nor anger for another. God decides according to law, making some <b>people</b> <b>happy</b> and others miserable. God appears to people, as we observe God's actions, sometimes (in the words of [...] ) as a [...] "merciful and compassionate God," [...] and sometimes (in the words of [...] ) as [...] "a jealous and revengeful God," [...] while in reality God never changes. Halevi divided all attributes (apart from the Tetragrammaton) into three classes: creative, relative, and negative. And he ideintified as creative attributes those derived from God's effect on the world, such as making poor and rich, lifting up or casting down, [...] "merciful and compassionate," [...] "jealous and revengeful," [...] "strong and almighty," [...] and the like.|$|E

2500|$|In {{creating}} the voice for GLaDOS, voice actress Ellen McLain attempted {{to sound like}} a computer. This was accomplished by her emulating a computer-generated voice that the Valve team played for her and her adding emotion to lines when appropriate. While designing her voice, Swift commented that it was difficult to write some of the lines for GLaDOS, describing McLain as [...] "super likable", and that they should write for that. She also performed the song [...] "Still Alive", which features GLaDOS singing to the effect that she is still alive by the end of Portal. This song was written by Jonathan Coulton, who was approached by the team and asked if he would want to write a song for them. He later decided {{that it would be a}} good idea to do a song featuring one of the voices from the game that would tie up the story at the end. Swift stated that the team wanted the players to leave the game happy, leading to them implementing the song in the first place. Wolpaw and the other writers wrote down a list of things that would make <b>people</b> <b>happy,</b> which resulted in [...] "Still Alive". In discussing the difficulties in singing the song as GLaDOS, McLain listed one of the difficulties as breathing, because computers do not need to breathe. As a result, she had to sing the phrases in one breath, while attempting to keep a clean, even tone. Swift commented in an interview that one of the focuses of developing the game was for players to hear GLaDOS and hear her song. GLaDOS continues to be voiced by McLain in Portal 2, who worked with Valve every two weeks to record the majority of the dialogue for the game. The frequency of her voice sessions allowed Valve to experiment with GLaDOS's lines and how they came out within the final game. After finding that [...] "Still Alive" [...] was a large part of Portal's success, Valve included more music in Portal 2, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, [...] "Want You Gone", which is written from GLaDOS's viewpoint of wanting to rid herself of Chell. It is performed by McLain. The writers found they needed another character to play off of Portal 2's Cave Johnson during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be Caroline who was put into GLaDOS. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself.|$|E
