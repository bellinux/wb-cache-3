5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow <b>partly</b> <b>misses</b> the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|R
40|$|People {{are often}} {{required}} {{to catch up}} on information they have missed in meetings, because of lateness or scheduling conflicts. Catching up is a complex cognitive process where people try to understand the current conversation without access to prior discussion. We develop and evaluate a novel Catchup audio player that allows ‘time-travel’. It automatically identifies the gist of what was missed, allowing people to join the meeting late and still participate effectively. In a lab study, we evaluated people’s understanding of meetings they had <b>partly</b> <b>missed,</b> by asking questions about meeting content. We tested whether providing Catchup gist overcomes the potential disadvantage that people must join even later- because catching up takes time. Catchup users understood meetings 70 % better than controls who simply joined late. They were more confident of their understanding and indicated a positive attitude towards the tool. We are currently exploring more general applications of the time-travel approach...|$|R
30|$|Highest {{mortality}} {{was observed}} in large trees (dbh class > 40 – 50 cm) of the NAF plots on higher terrain. As large trees were hit most, {{we assume that the}} severe ENSO-related 2005 drought in the Amazon {{may have contributed to the}} elevated death rate (Williamson et al. 2000; Condit et al. 2004; van Nieuwstadt and Sheil 2005), as it has been reported by Phillips et al. (2009) from other regions of the Amazon basin. The 2005 drought was also detected in the study region and resulted in strongly reduced soil moisture in the upper 2 m of soil during the dry season (Borma et al. 2009). In the course of climate change, Olivares et al. (2015) documented extended drought periods at the margins of the Amazon basin. While the growth response to climate change may be quite difficult to detect, increased mortality due to more severe droughts can have rapid and conspicuous effects on stand structure through the death of large trees. However, sampling over short observation periods as in our case may <b>partly</b> <b>miss</b> these events (Coomes et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Markerless 3 D human pose {{detection}} from {{a single}} image is a severely underconstrained problem because different 3 D poses can have similar image projections. In order to handle this ambiguity, current approaches rely on prior shape models {{that can only be}} correctly adjusted if 2 D image features are accurately detected. Unfortunately, although current 2 D part detector algorithms have shown promising results, they are not yet accurate enough to guarantee a complete disambiguation of the 3 D inferred shape. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for estimating 3 D human pose even when observations are noisy. We propose a stochastic sampling strategy to propagate the noise from the image plane to the shape space. This provides a set of ambiguous 3 D shapes, which are virtually undistinguishable from their image projections. Disambiguation is then achieved by imposing kinematic constraints that guarantee the resulting pose resembles a 3 D human shape. We validate the method on a variety of situations in which state-of-the-art 2 D detectors yield either inaccurate estimations or <b>partly</b> <b>miss</b> some of the body parts. Preprin...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{taxes are}} categorically {{different}} from the classical taxes which seek to extract a certain revenue at a minimum excess burden. Classical taxes are levied so as {{to interfere with the}} market based allocation of recourses as little as possible. Ecological taxes, on the other hand, are designed to achieve a well defined ecological effect again at a minimum of excess burdens. The revenue of an ecological tax, however, is coincidental and nil when the tax is ecologically optimal. Most ecological taxes currently proposed are not ecologically optimal as defined here. In generating revenues they <b>partly</b> <b>miss</b> the ecological objective. The tax revenue is an indication that the ecologically relevant decisions of some agents in the jurisdic tion have not been affected so as to achieve the desired ecological result. This paper explores the law and economics of ecological taxation from this point of view. The question is: how can an optimal ecological tax be institutionally structured so as to have a maximum impact on ecologically relevant decisions in the desired scope and direction? The paper systematically explores and applies James M. Buchanan's Cost and Choice: An Inquiry in Economic Theory (Chicago: Markham, 1969) to this question and derives an innovative institutional solution. ...|$|R

The fourth pair was equal to the first but the fifth, sixth and seventh pairs were markedly smaller, less than half in size; it is this feature which is recalled by the specific name. Pairs eight, nine and ten again equalled the first. After a narrow hiatus between the second and third snout fragment four tooth sockets are present at each side of the latter, but these are not placed in opposite pairs. The number of teeth in the upper jaw thus seems to have been at least fourteen.|$|E

It is in a fairly complete state, and shows Sir John bare-headed but otherwise in full armour, between his two wives dressed in gowns, mantles, and pedimental head-dresses. Below them are two smaller male figures, one partly perfect in armour, and underneath again, six female children, of whom two remain. The brasses are firmly fixed to the original slab of grey marble by apparently the original fastenings. They were originally in the Arundell chapel (a chantry built by the Arundells {{on the south side}} of the chancel of the parish church), and were early in the 19th century covered with some pews which were then placed in the chapel. On the restoration of the church later that century, the chapel being re-pewed, they were removed to their present position, which is an unfortunate selection, as it subjects them to a large amount of wear from the feet of persons passing over them, they being on the floor of the nave immediately below the chancel steps.

40|$|To {{shorten the}} {{screening}} of wheat varieties tolerant to Fusarium head blight (FHB) and to deoxynivalenol (DON) synthesis {{the development of}} rapid and reliable assays is required. In this work, active but ungerminated seeds of two Triticum aestivum varieties, Blasco and Sagittario, respectively tolerant and susceptible to FHB, were inoculated with two F. graminearum strains (Fg 126 and Fg 8308), having a different toxigenic profile. Wheat seeds reacted to F. graminearum infection by early production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating antioxidant enzymes. Whilst cv. Blasco showed an important antioxidant reaction which apparently lead to a marked decrease in ROS content, cv. Sagittario <b>partly</b> <b>missed</b> this counteraction. Compared to cv. Blasco, cv. Sagittario also produced more 9 -hydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9 - HODE), considered a susceptibility factor toward mycotoxigenic fungi. Moreover, some genes related to fungal aggressiveness were up-regulated in Fg 126 when grown on susceptible wheat seeds and some plant defence genes advanced their expression into cv. Blasco as compared with cv. Sagittario. Finally, {{it turned out that}} DON production may trigger apoptosis, occurring very quickly after fungal inoculation and with the typical formation of pre-apoptotic vesicles into aleuronic cells. As a matter of fact, wheat seeds, irrespective of the variety, are able to partly (5 - 10 %) convert DON in its less toxic glucosylated form (3 -Glu-DON). Each of these parameters might be considered as a wheat tolerance marker and used for diagnostic purposes or, through a forward genetic approach, for selecting wheat varieties hampering DON biosynthesis...|$|R
