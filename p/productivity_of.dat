All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E

30|$|How to {{calculate}} effectively the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods to set wage growth nationally in each year {{gives rise to}} some questions. In a country not experiencing technological change, productivity growth will be more static until reaching the technological frontier. Thus, reversion to its mean as a new wage policy is favorable. The future prediction <b>of</b> the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods is relatively difficult. As seen in the stock market, the change of any variables inclines toward its mean after straying above or below the mean {{in the long run}} in a free market economy. Figure  1 shows the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods and its mean by considering its historical fluctuation between 1973 and 2011. The historical mean <b>of</b> the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods is 3.7 %, calculated by taking into account approximately 38  years of the Turkish economy. Moreover, until the economy reaches the technological frontier, the configuration <b>of</b> the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods is unlikely to show any great long-term shift from its mean. In Fig.  1, although the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods strayed away from its historical average, in the long run, it moved closer to it and continued fluctuating around its mean. Therefore, it is desirable to consider the historical mean value <b>of</b> <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods for wage growth and estimate the flexibility of wage growth, where the two essentials should at least come to balance in the long run to reduce macroeconomic instability. To do this, wage growth, remaining above the mean, must increase at the same pace as the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods and reach its mean. Nevertheless, wage growth in the Turkish economy does not show a reversion to its mean and does not move around the mean. That shows that wage growth is not flexible and is generally influenced by economic policies in the country, running counter to the <b>productivity</b> growth <b>of</b> export goods, which has not been easy to control by government interventions or industrial actions. This new wage policy is important and must be considered by the trade unions, employers’ associations and the government.|$|R
