5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may climb to the tips of <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> leap and catch air current.

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock {{discovered}} transposition {{and used}} it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding. This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Many gardens {{now have}} plant shops selling flowers, herbs, and {{vegetable}} seedlings suitable for transplanting; many, like the UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research and the Chicago Botanic Garden, have plant-breeding programs and introduce new <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> the horticultural trade.|$|E

5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|Presently, grid {{systems with}} large wind {{penetration}} require a small {{increase in the}} frequency of usage of natural gas spinning reserve power <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.|$|E

5|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc {{in excess of}} 500ppm in soil interfere with the ability of <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000ppm to 180,000ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.|$|E
5|$|The {{herbicide}} glyphosate is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, other herbicides, {{such as the}} sulfonylureas {{inhibit the}} enzyme acetolactate synthase. Both these enzymes are needed for <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> make branched-chain amino acids. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E

5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E

5|$|Enemies {{range from}} camouflaged <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> large {{vultures}} to Komodo dragon-like lizards and huge leviathan in water. Many enemies can kill the Slugcat in one hit, and some species have internal variation, {{such as the}} pink lizards that can climb. The enemies spawn at random, such that the player cannot progress {{through trial and error}} experimentation. These creatures possess dynamic AI and exist in the game's world perpetually, even when not on the same screen as the player. The player does, however, need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees. The Slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them. It can also eat power-up plants, which grant status effects, such as slowing time.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> thrive.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Infection of host plants (including Arabis {{and several}} {{other members of the}} mustard family) occurs via wind-borne basidiospores in late summer. Upon {{germination}} of the spores, fungal hyphae penetrate the stem of the mustard plant and siphon off nutrients. However, in order to reproduce sexually, the fungus must facilitate the transfer of spermatia from the spermatogonia on this <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> receptive hyphae borne in the spermatogonia on another infected mustard <b>plant.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish this, the fungus sterilizes the host plant, preventing it from producing true flowers. Instead, it forces the infected <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> grow clusters of leaves into brilliant yellow [...] "pseudoflowers" [...] bearing the fungal spermatogonia. Insects visiting the pseudoflowers transfer spermatia from one host <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> another, {{in the same way that}} pollinators transfer pollen between the true flowers of uninfected plants.|$|R
