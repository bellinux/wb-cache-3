5|$|Patchy {{records from}} around the world {{indicate}} the bignose shark <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from Delaware Bay to Brazil, in the Mediterranean Sea, and off West Africa. In the Indian Ocean, it is known in South Africa and Madagascar, the Red Sea, India, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been recorded from China to Australia, around Hawaii, and from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. It is reportedly common off Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and rare off Brazil and in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E

25|$|After the Korean War, North Korea {{maintained}} a powerful, but smaller military force {{than that of}} South Korea. In 1967 the KPA forces of about 345,000 were {{much smaller than the}} South Korean ground forces of about 585,000. North Korea's relative isolation and economic plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the balance of military power {{into the hands of the}} better-equipped South Korean military. In response to this predicament, North Korea relies on asymmetric warfare techniques and unconventional weaponry to achieve parity against high-tech enemy forces. North Korea is reported to have developed a wide range of technologies towards this end, such as stealth paint to conceal ground targets, midget submarines and human torpedoes, blinding laser weapons, and <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chemical weapons program and is likely to possess a stockpile of chemical weapons. The Korean People's Army operates ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, which are banned under the United Nations Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons.|$|E

500|$|They are {{vulnerable}} to attack while watering but {{with a large number}} of birds milling about, predators find it difficult to select a target bird and are likely to have been spotted before they can get close to the flock. The choice of a watering site is influenced by the topography of the nearby ground. The sandgrouse tend to avoid sites with cover for mammalian predators and their greatest risk is usually from predatory birds. Sandgrouse travel tens of miles to their traditional water holes and tend to disregard temporary water sources which may appear periodically. This <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> survival value because a dried up water source in an arid region could result in dehydration and death. The Burchell's sandgrouse in the Kalahari Desert sometimes travels over [...] daily to reach a water source. Not all species need to drink every day, and the Tibetan sandgrouse does not need to travel to drink because of the abundance of water from melting snowfields in its habitat.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

2500|$|The mass of Sauroposeidon is {{estimated}} at [...] While the vertebrae of Sauroposeidon are 2533%longer than Giraffatitan, they are only 1015%larger in diameter. This means that while Sauroposeidon <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> larger body than Giraffatitan its body is smaller {{in comparison to the}} size of its neck, so it did not weigh as much as a scaled-up Giraffatitan. By comparison, Giraffatitan might have weighed [...] This estimate of the Giraffatitan is an average of several different methodologies.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, The Wonders of the East is also {{preserved}} in the Cotton Tiberius B.v, in both Latin and Old English, which was written down around AD 1050. In addition, it appears in the Oxford Bodleian Library, Bodleian 614 manuscript in Latin, which is from the “early twelfth century.” [...] The three manuscripts each differ in text and focus, but “all the Anglo-Saxon versions derive ultimately from a continental group of Latin texts, almost all of which share a basic epistolary framework entirely lacking in the Anglo-Saxon versions, and in which a variously-named traveler reports back to his emperor.” [...] More specifically, The Wonders of the East is initially from Greek origin. It was then “taken from a Latin collection of Mirabilia” (Wrenn 253). Furthermore, Alexander’s Letter to Aristotle, also in the Nowell Codex, shares similar subject matter with The Wonders of the East and <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> similar origin. The Anglo-Saxon Wonders of the East exists in many manuscripts with a similar epistolary structure, “in which either a character variously named Feramen, Feramus, or Fermes writes to the Emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-38), or a figure called Premo, Premonis, Perimenis, or Parmoenis writes to Hadrian’s predecessor, the Emperor Trajan (A.D 98-116), {{to report on the}} many marvels he has witnessed on his travels.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Super Bowl {{controversy}} {{was also}} a subject of humor {{on all of the}} late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he [...] "was happy to see this thing happen... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS". The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a [...] "Department of Wardrobe Security" [...] to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions. On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction. Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener. Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting [...] "I wore them once, they were cute." [...] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation [...] "silly", commenting [...] "In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this." [...] Dean added [...] "I don't find it terribly shocking relative to {{some of the things you}} can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lot of other things they should be pursuing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 523. The theory which I have {{ventured to}} put forth (almost) {{requires}} an admission, that in a compound body capable of electro-chemical decomposition the elementary particles have a mutual relation to, and influence upon each other, extending beyond those {{with which they are}} immediately combined. Thus in water, a particle of hydrogen in combination with oxygen is considered as not altogether indifferent to other particles of oxygen, although they are combined with other particles of hydrogen; but to have an affinity or attraction towards them, which, though it does not at all approach in force, under ordinary circumstances, to that by which it is combined with its own particle, can, under the electric influence, exerted in a definite direction, be made even to surpass it. This general relation of particles already in combination to other particles with which they are not combined, is sufficiently distinct in numerous results of a purely chemical character; especially in those where partial decompositions only take place, and in Berthollet's experiments on the effects of quantity upon affinity: and it <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> direct relation to, and connexion with, attraction of aggregation, both in solids and fluids. It is a remarkable circumstance, that in gases and vapours, where the attraction of aggregation ceases, there likewise the decomposing powers of electricity apparently cease, and there also the chemical action of quantity is no longer evident. It seems not unlikely, that the inability to suffer decomposition in these cases may be dependent upon the absence of that mutual attractive relation of the particles which is the cause of aggregation.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who belong}} to this {{shareholding}} class only partially, who partially depend upon dividends and partially upon activities, occur in every rank and order of the whole social body. The waiter one tips <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hundred or so in some remote company, {{the will of the}} eminent labour reformer reveals an admirably distributed series of investments, the bishop sells tea and digs coal, or at any rate gets a profit from some unknown persons tea-selling or coal-digging, to eke out the direct recompense of his own modest corn-treading. Indeed, above the labouring class, the number of individuals in the social body whose gross income is entirely the result of their social activities is very small. Previously in the world's history, saving a few quite exceptional aspects, the possession and retention of property was conditional upon activities of some sort, honest or dishonest, work, force, or fraud. But the shareholding ingredient of our new society, so far as its shareholding goes, has no need of strength or wisdom; the countless untraceable Owner of the modern world presents in a multitudinous form the image of a Merovingian king. The shareholder owns the world de jure, by the common recognition of the rights of property; and the incumbency of knowledge, management, and toil fall entirely to others. He toils not, neither does he spin; he is mechanically released from the penalty of the Fall, he reaps in a still sinful world all the practical benefits of a millennium--without any of its moral limitations.|$|E
