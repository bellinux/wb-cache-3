The board is attached to the leather buckle with a swivel joint. This means that the user can twist <b>the</b> whole board <b>on</b> their arm to ensure that the compass alignment is clear. The board incorporates a compass for this purpose. The user can then use the supplied ruler. In earlier versions this was attached with rubber bands but later versions had the ruler permanently attached. The paper was about two or three feet long and was rolled around one of the side rollers.

5000|$|The group's name {{derives from}} an old French saying, [...] "les poissons d'avril", roughly {{equivalent}} to the English term [...] "April Fools".

60|$|What {{to do next}} I {{could not}} tell. The hold was so {{intensely}} dark that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it--that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light--such expedients precisely as {{a man in the}} perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I placed <b>the</b> slip of <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it. Not a syllable was there, however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the IASPM Journal special edition entitled Twenty-First Century Popular Music Studies (PMS), {{in which a}} number of papers respond to Philip Tagg’s <b>paper</b> “Caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> Foot: Epistemic Inertia and Visible Music” (2011). Respondents discuss a lack of ethnographic methodology in three prominent journals, Popular Music, Popular Music and Society and Journal of Popular Music Studies; the success of PMS in Australasia and the role of ethnomusicology there; the potential of ecomusicology for PMS; the proliferation of PMS courses in new universities in the UK; gender and sexuality within PMS; differences between the concepts of invisible and of ubiquitous music; and the need for addressing corporeality within PMS. The common threads of these discussions are brought out, and a number of key issues emerge. Interdisciplinarity is emphasized and the interactions of classical and popular music, ethnomusicology as well as recording and production are examined. It is suggested that PMS might consider tactical alignments with other relevant bodies in order to overcome epistemic inertia, including ethnomusicology organisations, the Association for the Study of the Art of Record Production, and academics and practitioners involved in teaching and making popular music...|$|R

It achieves scalability by using both parallel processing and parallel disks. Interactive browsing of extracted isosurfaces is made possible by using parallel isosurface extraction and rendering {{in conjunction with a}} new specialized piece of image compositing hardware called the Metabuffer.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism, widely known as RNAi (RNA interference),has contributed towards the elucidation of the cellular machinery involved in the response against viral infections based on gene silencing, and in developmental regulation of translational suppression. The application of RNAi in insect pest management (IPM),and gene functional analysis, has been of enormous importance. Unfortunately, as RNAi has many times proven {{to be difficult to}} examine in Lepidoptera, focus has shifted to other potential post-genomic options in IPM. Special attention has afforded to novel DNA insecticides based on preparations of short single-stranded fragments of baculovirus anti-apoptosis genes, which represent a safe and relatively rapid alternative approach for IPM.

40|$|It can {{be stated}} that {{management}} control {{is needed to}} try {{to ensure that the}} organisation achieves its objectives. Once the objectives have been agreed, plans should be drawn up so that the progress of the firm can be directed towards the ends specified in the objectives. Now it must not be thought that plans can be expressed only in accounting terms, for example quality of the product might be best shown in engineering terms, or social objectives shown in a plan concerned with employee welfare. But some of the objectives, such as the attainment of a desired profit, or of the attainment of a desired growth in assets, can be expressed in accounting terms. When a plan is expressed quantitatively it is known as a budget and the process of converting plans into budgets is known as budgeting. In this study we are concerned primarily with budgets shown in monetary terms, i. e. financial budgets. The budgeting process may be quite formal in a large organisation with committees set up to perform <b>the</b> task. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand in a very small firm the owner may jot down his budget on a piece of scrap <b>paper</b> or even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a used envelope.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the LPU are: 1. To heighten the awareness in African governments and Inother organisations {{of the importance of}} livestock policy issues. 2. To collate in an easily assimilable form what is already known about policy issues and to present It to policy makers. 3. To carry out research of its own (includingthat commiss;oned from consultants) on priority livestock policy issues and to present the results to policy makers. 4. To encourage others to carry out similar research and to assist In presenting their results to policy makers. LPU Working Papers Staff members and consultants of the LPU write working papers at several stages during their research ona topic. Publication of the final results of research may not occur until several years after the research started. The LPU, therefore, makes itsworking documents availableto anyone requesting them in order to provide access to data and ideas on African livestock policy issues as early a 3 possible to those with a need for them.

40|$|While {{magnesium}} alloys {{are routinely}} used in engineering {{applications in the}} form of net shape castings, applications for sheet product have been limited due to the poor cold formability of magnesium combined with the perceived expense of sheet. The issues associated with poor cold formability could largely be overcome if magnesium alloys were to be superplastically formed. Superplasticity in magnesium is well established with research <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject dating <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> late 1960 s. In recent years, interest in this area has grown to the point where a number of companies have successfully superplastically formed prototype automotive panels from magnesium alloy sheet. Concurrent to this the scientific community have demonstrated superplasticity {{in a wide range of}} magnesium alloys using processing techniques ranging from the exotic (severe plastic deformation) to the mundane (traditional warm rolling). Work by the current authors has shown, rather surprisingly, that superplasticity can be achieved in magnesium alloys in the as-cast condition. This has led to some initial exploratory work involving twin roll casting. The concept being that affordable superplastic magnesium sheet could be produced via twin roll casting with only limited rolling reduction to final gauge. This paper describes the superplastic behaviour (in uniaxial tension) and microstructure of sheet processed from strip cast AZ 31 and AZ 91. The experimental material has included strip cast AZ 91 subjected to large shear strains immediately prior to casting. The material was tested in the as-cast condition and after warm rolling to a number of gauges. Industrially useful superplastic capability was demonstrated in the strip cast alloys. Furthermore, good superplastic capability was also demonstrated in sheet subsequently rolled from the cast metal and rolling strain did not significantly influence the ductilities obtained. The mechanism for achieving superplasticity in as-cast magnesium alloys will be considered and the contrasting deformation characteristics of AZ 31 and AZ 91 will be discussed in terms of m value analysis and microstructural characterisation...|$|R
