Copolymers of different molecular weight based on poly(lactic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) were prepared by polycondensation, catalysed by hydrochloric acid. A chain-extension reaction with l-lysine ethyl ester diisocyanate was employed afterwards to obtain <b>polyester</b> <b>urethanes</b> with enhanced properties.

Additionally, elemental analysis of the buffer medium proved that hydrolytic degradation was more rapid in the first stage. Tensile-strength testing revealed that ductility increased alongside reduced molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol), also suggesting that polymer branching occurred due to side reactions of isocyanate. Based on the envisaged biomedical applications for these polymers, cytotoxicity tests were carried out and the cytotoxic effect was only moderate in the case of 100 % polymer extract prepared according to ISO standard 10993 - 12.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the synthesis and properties of new polymer systems of biodegradable shape memory thermosets. The combination of only four different monomer units and three network architectures allows {{the design of}} polymeric materials with {{a broad spectrum of}} properties. By variation of the molecular network parameters it is possible to adjust the shape memory transition temperature and the mechanical properties of the thermosets below and above the transition temperature. The networks are synthesized by crosslinking polymerization of oligo(Epsilon -hydroxycaproate-ran-glycolate) dimethacrylates. By variation of the glycalate content the shape memory transition temperature can be adjusted between 27 °C and 49 °C. By polymerization of the macromonomers in the presence of butyl acrylate, AB-crosslinked materials are obtained. The elastic modulus E of the AB-networks in tensile tests at 22 °C decreases with increasing content of butyl acrylate and can be adjusted between 64 MPa and 6. 4 MPa. If the macromonomers are crosslinked in the presence of phase-segregated <b>poly(ester</b> <b>urethanes),</b> mix-interpenetrated polymer networks (mix-IPN) are formed consisting of a covalently and a physically crosslinked partial network that interpenetrate each other. The used <b>poly(ester</b> <b>urethanes)</b> are synthesized by copolyaddition of oligo(Epsilon-hydroxycaproate) diol and oligo(Omega-hydroxypentadecanoate) diol with trimethylhexanediisocyanate. This way, mix-IPN are made with a oligo(Omega-hydroxypentadecanoate) content up to 22 mass-%. With increasing content of oligo(Omega-hydroxypentadecanoate) the elastic modulus as well as the tensile strength of the mix-IPN in tensile tests at 70 °C are increased. The polymer networks show good to excellent shape memory properties in cyclic thermomechanical tensile tests between 0 °C and 70 °C, combining a good fixability of the temporary shape, fast attainment of a stable themomechanical behavior and only little loss of the permanent shape in the first cycles. Networks containing exclusively covalent crosslinking show an almost ideal-elastic behavior and reach back their original permanent shape completely under the experimental conditions. In hydrolytic degradation experiments at pH 7. 0 and 37 °C or 70 °C it is shown that the materials show a slow degradation. The presence of the new comonomer accelerates the course of hydrolytic chain scission and mass loss, and in contrast to this, the presence of butyl acrylate decreases the degradation rate. The course of the mechanical properties at 37 °C with hydrolysis is determined by the crystallinity of the materials at this temperature. It can be shown, that materials that show a low crystallinity at 37 °C get softer with degradation time. One of the networks is investigated for its cytotoxicity. Agarose diffusion tests are performed on samples that are sterilized by ethylene oxide or low temperature plasma sterilization. The samples have been partially degraded in cell culture medium for a period between 0 and 28 days prior to testing.

This peptide was used to tune biodegradability properties, since the Alanine-Alanine sequence is a target for the elastase enzyme. Enzymatic degradation tests demonstrated the feasibility of tuning biodegradability properties due to the introduction of AAK peptide in polyurethane backbone.

This study compared rate of restenosis, neurologic events, and perioperative death in patients undergoing CEA with primary closure versus <b>polyester</b> <b>urethane</b> patch closure. Patients and methodsIn a prospective randomized study, we compared patch angioplasty with <b>polyester</b> <b>urethane</b> (Vascular-patch, B. Braun Medical AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) to primary closure between February 1999 and March 2002 in 404 operations. Early (30 -day) stroke and mortality rate, long-term restenosis, and neurologic events were compared {{in the two groups}} during 2. 5 to 5 years of follow-up (median follow-up, 2 years). ResultsPrimary closure was used in 216 operations, and patch angioplasty was used in 206. Clamping time was significantly shorter in the primary closure group (P <. 001). Perioperative mortality and neurologic events were similar in both groups (1. 9 % vs 3. 9 %, P =. 21, odds ratio [OR], 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 56 to 9. 85). The rate of residual stenosis (≥ 50 %) at 0 or 3 -month follow-up was significantly lower in the patch group (2 operations, 1. 1 %) compared with the primary closure group (17 operations, 8. 9 %) (P =. 001, OR, 0. 114; 95 % CI, 0. 026 to 0. 5). Multivariable logistic regression showed that only primacy closure was found to influence residual stenosis. Restenosis of 70 % was significantly less in the patch angioplasty group (2. 2 % vs 8. 6 %) (P =. 01, hazard ratio, 0. 246; 95 % CI, 0. 08 to 0. 75).

Although proven beneficial as long term implants, these materials degrade very slowly {{and are therefore}} not suitable in applications in which scaffold support is needed for a shorter time. A recently developed class of polyacylurethanes (PAUs) is expected to fulfill such requirements. Our aim was to assess in vitro the degradation of PAUs and evaluate their suitability as temporary scaffold materials to support soft tissue repair. With both a mass loss of 2. 5 – 3. 0 % {{and a decrease in}} molar mass of approx. 35 % over a period of 80 days, PAUs were shown to degrade via both bulk and surface erosion mechanisms. Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy was successfully applied to study the extent of PAUs microphase separation during in vitro degradation. The microphase separated morphology of PAU 1000 (molar mass of the oligocaprolactone soft segment = 1000 g/mol) provided this polymer with mechano-physical characteristics that would render it a suitable material for constructs and devices. PAU 1000 exhibited excellent haemocompatibility in vitro. In addition, PAU 1000 supported both adhesion and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and this could be further enhanced by pre-coating of PAU 1000 with fibronectin (Fn). The contact angle of PAU 1000 decreased both with in vitro degradation and by incubation in biological fluids. In endothelial cell culture medium the contact angle reached 60 °, which is optimal for cell adhesion.

In most approaches, a temporary porous scaffold is required to support tissue regeneration. The scaffold should be designed such that the turnover synchronizes with tissue remodeling and regeneration at the implant site. Segmented <b>polyester</b> <b>urethanes</b> (PUs) {{used in this study}} were based on epsilon-caprolactone (CL) and co-monomers D,L-lactide (D,L-L) and gamma-butyrolactone (BL), and 1, 4 -butanediisocyanate (BDI). In vitro, the PUs were nontoxic and haemocompatible. To test in vivo biocompatibility, the PUs were further processed into porous structures and subcutaneously implanted in rats for a period up to 21 days. Tissue remodeling and scaffold turnover was associated with a mild tissue response. The tissue response was characterized by extensive vascularization through the interconnected pores, with low numbers of macrophages on the edges and stroma formation inside the pores of the implants. The tissue ingrowth appeared {{to be related to the}} extent of microphase separation of the PUs and foam morphology.

Studies of the subsonic combustion (i. e., Flame) process were conducted {{in order to determine}} the quality and economics of <b>polyester</b> and <b>urethane</b> coatings. Thermally sprayed polymer coatings are of interest to several industries for anticorrosion applications, including the chemical, automotive, and aircraft industries. In this study, the coating design has been optimized for a site-specific application using Taguchi-type fractional-factorial experiments. Optimized coating designs are presented for the two powder systems. A substantial range of thermal processing conditions and their effect on the resultant polymer coatings is presented. The coatings were characterized by optical metallography, hardness testing, tensile testing, and compositional analysis. Characterization of the coatings yielded the thickness, bond strength, Knoop microhardness, roughness, deposition efficiency, and porosity. Confirmation testing was accomplished to verify the coating designs...|$|R
40|$|Approximately forty {{adhesives}} {{were subjected}} to laboratory screening. Seven candidate adhesives were selected from the screening tests and evaluated in a thermal vacuum test on radiator panels similar to the anticipated flight hardware configuration. Several classes of adhesives based on epoxide, <b>polyester,</b> silicone, and <b>urethane</b> resin systems were tested. These included contact adhesives, heat cured adhesives, heat and pressure cured adhesives, pressure sensitive adhesives, and two part paint-on or spray-on adhesives. The panels were tested in a space environmental simulation laboratory chamber during the July 9 - 20, 1973 time span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Viscometric data in non-theta solvent were {{utilized}} for {{determination of the}} poly(ester-urethane) s and poly(ether urethane) s conformational transitions and of the unperturbed dimensions. The influence of soft and hard segments was observed for poly(ester-urethane) s. The samples with 2, 4 -tolylene diiso-cyanate in hard segments have smaller unperturbed dimensions compared with the samples containing 4, 4 -methylene diphenylene diisocyanate, which are believed to possess significant chain rigidity. The crosslinking tendency in synthesis of polyurethanes with ether groups – by reaction of chain end –NCO in prepolymer with the hydrogen from –NHCOO – groups – and in solutions explains the anomalies observed in solution properties.

40|$|By the {{combination}} of prepolymers with very different physical/chemical properties, better performance materials can be obtained. In the present study, three hydroxyl-terminated fully aliphatic polyesters have been chain extended to prepare new multiblock <b>poly(ester</b> <b>urethane)</b> s (PEU) displaying thermoplastic elastomeric characteristics. Poly(butylene succinate), poly(1, 4 -cyclohexylenedimethylene- 1, 4 -cyclohexanedicarboxylate), and poly(neopentyl glycol adipate) have been respectively used as soft-hard, hard and soft segment. The evaluation of molecular, thermal, and mechanical properties and hydrolytic degradation profile permitted to correlate {{the behavior of the}} so-obtained materials with their molecular structure, and highlighted {{that it is possible to}} nicely tune the final characteristics of this class of PEUs by just varying the mutual amount of the three segments...|$|E
40|$|Hydrolytic {{degradation}} {{has been}} shown to be a significant problem for <b>poly(ester</b> <b>urethane)</b> elastomers exposed to high humidity environments. The ester group in the soft segment is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis. One of the products of this reaction is a carboxylic acid group that catalyses further hydrolysis. The resulting reduction in molecular weight leads to deterioration of the elastomer's mechanical properties. In this paper we have measured the extent of the hydrolysis reaction by {sup 13 }C NMR spectroscopy. In addition we have measured the spin-spin relaxation time of the soft phase and followed the increase in mobility of these segments. Both measurements were performed on the solid polymer. These measurements provide an excellent monitoring tool of the chemical and physical state of polymer during the aging process...|$|E
40|$|Biostable polyurethane/hydroxyapatite (PU/ HA) {{composites}} {{with potential}} application as bone replacement materials were synthesized in bulk and processed in a screw extruder. The polyurethanes (PU) were prepared by reacting an aliphatic diisocyanate, 4 -methylene- bis-diisocyanate (MDI), with poly-(e-caprolactone) (PCL) diols and polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO) of different molecular weights, extended with 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO). Glass-transition temperatures were measured by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The specific PU groups were assessed by total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The effects of polymer chemistry and filler content on the rheological behaviour were studied by oscillatory rheometry. Polymers with larger chain lengths showed higher viscosity and, for identical chain lengths, polyether urethanes seem to have higher viscosities than <b>polyester</b> based <b>urethanes.</b> A lubricating effect was found for composites containing 50 % weight of filler, whereas at higher filler contents a solid-like behaviour was measured. Polymer chemistry seems {{to be affected by}} ageing but not so by the presence of filler. Ageing is characterized by a decrease in the concentration of hydrogen bonds involving between urethane linkages.

40|$|This study {{present the}} {{synthesis}} of eco-friendly poly(ester amide-urethane) coating from Thevetia peruviana seed oil (TPSO). FT-IR, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectral analyses were used in confirming the structure of compounds. Physico-chemical properties of desaturated N,N'-bis (2 - hydroxyethyl) Thevetia peruviana seed oil fatty amide (DHETA), poly(ester amide) (PESA) and <b>poly(ester</b> amide <b>urethanes)</b> (PESAU), as well as chemical resistance, antibacterial studies and thermal analysis of PESAU were also examined. Aims: To evaluate the thermal stability and antibacterial activities of PESAU. Study Design: Extraction of seed oil from the air-dried seedlings of Thevetia peruviana seeds and preparation of polyol through urea fractionation. Followed by urethane synthesis using 4, 4 '- diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane (H 12 MDI). Result: The 46. 4 g ICI/ 100 g Iodine value (I. V.) of the amide (DHETA) base polyol was reduced to 10. 5 g ICI/ 100 g value for the urethane (PESAU). The zero percent value for PESAU hydroxyl value (H.

40|$|<b>Polyester</b> and {{polyether}} <b>urethane</b> elastomers {{have been}} prepared as composites with fumed silica. Silicas of different particles size and titanium dioxide were used. The polyurethane elastomers were thermoplastic and consist of rubbery domains of a polyester or polyether supported by hard urethane domains. The fillers provide increased stiffness of the rubbery domains and reinforce the hard domains, which act as physical crosslinks. The composites were initially characterised using thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Dynamic mechanical {{analysis was used to}} measure the properties with change in frequency and temperature. Activation energy for the elastomer phase glass transition was obtained from multiple frequency results and related to the interaction of polymer with filler. Creep recovery measurements showed that the filled polyurethanes provided improved elastomeric response...|$|R
