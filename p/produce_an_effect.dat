5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} action of progesterone {{was discovered in}} 1929. Pure crystalline progesterone was isolated in 1934 and its chemical structure was determined. Later that year, chemical synthesis of progesterone was accomplished. Shortly following its chemical synthesis, progesterone began being tested clinically in women. In 1934, Schering introduced progesterone as a pharmaceutical drug under the brand name Proluton. It was administered by intramuscular injection because it progesterone rapidly inactivated after being taken by mouth and when used by mouth required very high doses to <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|E

25|$|Rev. Dr. Judson Smith (born 28 June 1837 in Middlefield, Massachusetts; died 29 June 1906 in Roxbury, Massachusetts), who {{had been}} one of Ament's professors at Oberlin College, the {{corresponding}} secretary of Ament's sponsoring mission (1884-1906), The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), in letters to both the New York Herald and Tribune in February 1901 denied the accuracy of the Sun clipping of 24 December 1900, indicating that the cable report had “grossly exaggerated” the amount of Mr. Ament’s collections. Instead of thirteen times the indemnity it should have read “one and a third times” the indemnity. Further, Smith defended Ament, declaring that Ament had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and that Twain's “brilliant article would <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> quite beyond the reach of plain argument,” and that it would do an innocent man an injustice. Smith demanded an apology from Twain. Replying {{in a letter to the}} New York Tribune, Twain insisted that Ament had arraigned himself.|$|E

Unluckily, Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee-room, and walked back into the House unconscious of his loss.

500|$|Among Kubrick's notable {{innovations}} in cinematography are {{his use of}} special effects, as in 2001, where he used both slit-scan photography and front-screen projection, which won Kubrick his only Oscar for special effects. Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips, Kubrick's use of [...] "one-point perspective", which leads the viewer's eye towards a central vanishing point. The technique relies on creating a complex visual symmetry using parallel lines in a scene which all converge on that single point, leading away from the viewer. Combined with camera motion it could <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> that one writer describes as [...] "hypnotic and thrilling". The Shining {{was among the first}} half-dozen features to use the then-revolutionary Steadicam (after the 1976 films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man and Rocky). Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a [...] "magic carpet", allowing [...] "fast, flowing, camera movements" [...] in the maze in The Shining which otherwise would have been impossible.|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} a choral movement, [...] "" [...] (God the Lord is sun and shield). The {{instrumental}} ritornello introduces two themes: [...] "a festive, march-like theme for the horns and timpani, and a more lively counter-theme that develops from a note that is heard seven times." [...] The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the ritornello, structured in three parts, is among the longest among Bach's opening choruses. The horns are silent in the middle section, but the voices enter [...] "an imitative discussion of a simplified version of the string theme from the ritornello. Complex contrapuntal texture is used as the vehicle to convey the important and ultimately optimistic message ... The driving rhythms infusing the intricate swirling counterpoint <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> that is totally infectious", as Mincham writes. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted during his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 the cantatas for Reformation at the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg where the Reformation began, describes the opening chorus as a ceremonial procession, and hears the [...] "insistent drum beat" [...] going along with the [...] "fanfares of the high horns" [...] as [...] "the hammering of Luther’s theses to the oak door {{at the back of}} the church".|$|E
2500|$|One study {{published}} in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol concluded that high doses (0.28mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028mg/kg) did not <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average [...] man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%.|$|E
2500|$|She {{also had}} her critics, {{particularly}} in her later years {{among the new}} generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. George Bernard Shaw wrote of the [...] "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her widely when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you." [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote: [...] "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!" [...] Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that [...] "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect,</b> who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience." [...] He wrote that in her roles, [...] "enchantment is smothered in artifice." ...|$|E
