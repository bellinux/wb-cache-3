5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{said that}} they could not fault ABC for the creative freedom and support they gave them during production, as there were probably few networks that would have even <b>put</b> <b>My</b> So-Called Life on the air in the first place.|$|E

25|$|There was {{no reason}} to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> life on the line, and the lives of {{everyone}} who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control..... I vowed to never allow myself to be {{in a situation like that}} again.|$|E
25|$|I'll always regret what I've <b>put</b> <b>my</b> family through. There's a lot {{of shame}} and regret. People wonder why I haven't broken down or shed a tear (in public). My tears are {{something}} that I hold close to me; they're {{for me and my}} family.|$|E
25|$|I've got a {{disposition}} {{and a way}} of my own,When my man {{starts to}} kicking I let him find a new home,I get full of good liquor, walk the street all nightGo home and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> man out if he don’t act rightWild women don't worry,Wild women don't have the blues.|$|E

6000|$|... "Biddy," [...] I cried, getting up, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> arm {{round her}} neck, and {{giving her a}} kiss, [...] "I shall always tell you everything." ...|$|R
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
500|$|... "I scooped {{it out of}} {{the sink}} and threw it into the bin. I was so lucky I didn't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> fingers into my mouth, or scratch my eye as I could have got this poison inside me." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{she looks}} at me so pitiful that I goes up to her and <b>puts</b> <b>my</b> arm round her and pats her on the back.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had gone}} I shut the door carefully. Then I turned to Jeeves. The man was <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> evening things out on a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "No dangers," [...] I replied. [...] "Some little difficulty, perhaps. I am {{thinking}} of the safest way of <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> two letters into Fanny's hands." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1998, on {{learning}} of {{his interest in}} pursuing a political career, the National Party president John Slater began working actively to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes {{him as one of}} the people she [...] "deliberately sought out and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> head on the line–either privately or publicly–to get them in there".|$|E
500|$|... "And then Mary J. Blige sang it. And then he {{took her}} vocal off it, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> vocal back on, my demo vocal, without asking and {{released}} it. And I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I {{was trying to be}} a pop songwriter, not an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|I've seen {{first-hand}} how the Amazon Rainforest {{is being}} destroyed. It is so rampant {{that we may}} be the last generation with the opportunity to save it. People need to wake up to what is going on. What better way is there to shock people than to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> life on the line with the largest snake on the planet, the Green Anaconda? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what's she to {{do while}} we're away?' said I, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> small {{elbows on the table}} to argue the point. 'She can't live by herself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not in a}} {{hurry to}} arrive; I'm very happy here," [...] she said. [...] "I'm afraid I shall have such a time <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> people through." ...|$|R

500|$|In April 1928 {{she told}} her editor that her new book would require {{complete}} commitment from its publisher {{and that she would}} not allow even one word to be altered.

500|$|Haley {{writes that}} during {{the last months of}} MalcolmX's life [...] "uncertainty and confusion" [...] about his views were {{widespread}} in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm man enough to tell you that I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible." [...] MalcolmX had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology {{at the time of his}} assassination and, Dyson writes, was [...] "experiencing a radical shift" [...] in his core [...] "personal and political understandings".|$|E
500|$|Her splits with party {{leadership}} contributed to her re-election defeat in 1955. As the Democrats swept {{to victory in}} the mayoral race {{and in the other}} nine councilmanic districts, Dallas lost to Republican Wilbur H. Hamilton (the brother of her 1951 opponent) by 457 votes, with 520 votes going to a third-party candidate, J. Warren Keel. Speaking later of her electoral defeat, Dallas said [...] "I said I couldn't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> organization above my constituents. Now that makes me sound pious and goody-goody, but I couldn't—so I got defeated." [...] She did not run for elected office again.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Brain. Could I do it, ungrateful as you are, {{with more}} {{obligation}} to you, or more hazard to myself, than by <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> note into your glove? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} out with me," [...] I answered, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> arm through hers, and felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on the balcony.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get your tea," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Kybird, [...] "and don't {{make that}} scraping noise {{on the bottom}} of the jar with your knife. It <b>puts</b> <b>my</b> teeth on edge." ...|$|R
500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, {{out of the corner}} of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot <b>put</b> <b>my</b> finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
500|$|Parliament {{repealed}} the Townshend Acts in 1770. Washington {{regarded the}} passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as [...] "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges". He told friend Bryan Fairfax, [...] "I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than I have to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hands into yours for money." [...] He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{telling her}} love {{interest}} to [...] "sit back and watch", Beyoncé sings the chorus, where she states {{the things she}} will do to show her appreciation to her love interest, [...] "Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna <b>put</b> <b>my</b> body on your body / Boy, I like it when you watch me / Tonight it's going down." [...] In the second verse, she sings: [...] "You'll never need two, because I will be your number one / Them other chicks are superficial / But I know you know I'm the one / That's why I'm all into you / ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right--that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said {{anything}} about it. She might think I was <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> oar in and I promised not to do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'We've got to skip,' I {{whispered to}} him, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> mouth {{close to the}} crack of the door and before I could get away he cried, oh! so mournfully: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Catherine, {{why are you}} crying, love?' I asked, {{approaching}} and <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> {{arm over}} her shoulder. 'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.' ...|$|R
