However, the effects of <b>potassium</b> <b>ions</b> on the tumor or normal cells have seldom been studied. To address this problem, we studied the biological effects of L 02 and HepG 2 cells with ectogenous <b>potassium</b> <b>ions.</b> Cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis rate were analyzed. Our results indicated that <b>potassium</b> <b>ions</b> inhibited proliferation of L 02 and HepG 2 cells and promoted their apoptosis. <b>Potassium</b> <b>ions</b> induced apoptosis through regulating Bcl- 2 family members and depolarized the mitochondrial membrane, especially for HepG 2 cell.

25|$|In a {{heart with}} AF, the {{increased}} calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased calcium sensitivity {{can lead to}} accumulation of intra-cellular calcium and causes down regulation of L-type calcium channels.

Increased expression of inward-rectifier <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of gap junction proteins such as GJA1 (also known as Connexin 43), and GJA5 (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing arrhythmia.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{potassium}} binders are artificial resins {{that exchange}} bound cations (Ca2+ or Na+) for <b>potassium</b> <b>ions</b> {{in the large}} intestine. After exchange, the released cation and potassium adhering to the resin are excreted with the faeces. This mechanism prevents intestinal absorption of alimentary <b>potassium</b> <b>ions</b> and thereby reduces serum potassium levels. There are two major classes of binders, differentiated by the cation attached to the resin in the original condition. Calcium resins release calcium ions in exchange for <b>potassium</b> <b>ions,</b> whereas sodium resins release sodium.|$|R
25|$|Baclofen is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E
25|$|Gustducin is made {{of three}} subunits. When it is {{activated}} by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate phosphodiesterase, a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels. Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.|$|E
25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>ion</b> {{channels}} {{remove the}} hydration shell from the ion when {{it enters the}} selectivity filter. The selectivity filter is formed by a five residue sequence, TVGYG, termed the signature sequence, {{within each of the}} four subunits. This signature sequence is within a loop between the pore helix and TM2/6, historically termed the P-loop. This signature sequence is highly conserved, with the exception that a valine residue in prokaryotic potassium channels is often substituted with an isoleucine residue in eukaryotic channels. This sequence adopts a unique main chain structure, structurally analogous to a nest protein structural motif. The four sets of electronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms are aligned {{toward the center of the}} filter pore and form a square anti-prism similar to a water-solvating shell around each potassium binding site. The distance between the carbonyl oxygens and potassium ions in the binding sites of the selectivity filter is the same as between water oxygens in the first hydration shell and a <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> in water solution, providing an energetically-favorable route for de-solvation of the ions. This width appears to be maintained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces within a sheet of aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter opens towards the extracellular solution, exposing four carbonyl oxygens in a glycine residue (Gly79 in KcsA). The next residue toward the extracellular side of the protein is the negatively charged Asp80 (KcsA). This residue together with the five filter residues form the pore that connects the water-filled cavity in the center of the protein with the extracellular solution.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol binds to and {{affects the}} gating {{of a number}} of ion {{channels}} such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channel. Cholesterol also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor. The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be {{explained by the fact that}} cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body. Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and toward {{the surface of the}} membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells are found in the islet of Langerhans and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate proinsulin folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{semipermeable}} membrane, {{a barrier}} that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed {{at about the same}} time. The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized, {{but it was not until}} 1877 when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the plasma membrane, and cell water and solutes such as a <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution. In 1889, Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.|$|E

25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} originates {{from the}} cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches {{to both the}} SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with {{one foot on the}} brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.|$|E
25|$|As the {{membrane}} potential is increased, sodium ion channels open, allowing {{the entry of}} sodium ions into the cell. This {{is followed by the}} opening of <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's resting potential. The sodium channels close {{at the peak of the}} action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases {{the membrane}} potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70mV. However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell fires, producing an action potential. The frequency at which cellular action potentials are produced is known as its firing rate.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin and not very dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically <b>potassium</b> <b>ion</b> channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cell’s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in autophagy and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, lipofuscin granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the axon hillock and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single cilium that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The cilium, however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E

500|$|The ion {{transport}} system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms. One is active and pumps sodium out of, and potassium into, the cell.

The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump.
