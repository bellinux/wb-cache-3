Average market impact costs equal 20 basis points for buys and 30 basis points for sells; average execution costs equal 27 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively. Furthermore, we show that relative trade size and market capitalization, commonly found to play an important role, have only limited influence on the market impact of a trade.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} market impact {{costs of}} equity trading {{by one of}} the world's largest pension funds. We find that, on average, these costs are small in terms of market disruption, but substantial in terms of costs for the pension fund. Average market impact costs equal 20 basis points for buys and 30 basis points for sells. Furthermore, we show that momentum and volatility have considerable influence on market impact costs. Other important determinants of these costs are trade type (agency, single, or <b>principal),</b> <b>trade</b> size, <b>trading</b> strategy, <b>trading</b> <b>venue,</b> and industry sector. Additionally, we find that the timing of trades plays a substantial role in explaining trading costs. Moreover, we also establish a cost-risk trade-off: the longer it takes to execute a trade, the lower the expected market impact costs but the higher the volatility of these costs.

In general these options can be classified into two broad categories: (1) hidden orders on otherwise lit <b>trading</b> <b>venues,</b> and (2) completely dark <b>trading</b> <b>venues.</b> Our paper investigates the relation between both types of opaque trading. Using a detailed high-frequency dataset, we first show that hidden and dark trading are substitutes: an increase in hidden order trading implies reduced dark trading and vice versa. Second, we show that volatility and imbalanced trading drive the segmentation of trading activity into a visible and an opaque part. Third, we identify market quality variables (spread and visible depth) that drive opaque trading activity either to hidden orders on lit venues or to dark <b>trading</b> <b>venues.</b> Finally, we document a strong positive relation between the fraction of hidden order trading on several alternative lit <b>trading</b> <b>venues...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays. The first essay examines whether an international <b>trade</b> <b>venue</b> clientele effect exists for Canadian shares cross-listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ). The main hypothesis states that for trades of Canadian cross-listed shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) and U. S. stock markets, assets with increasing (decreasing) trade costs {{as measured by the}} relative effective half-spreads across <b>trade</b> <b>venues</b> are held in portfolios with the same or expected increasing (decreasing) relative investors' holding periods. The results support this hypothesis for the Canadian cross-listed shares whose trades are executed on the TSE and each U. S. <b>trade</b> <b>venue.</b> The findings suggests that the TSE has consistently lost its share of executed order flow relative to the U. S. primary <b>trade</b> <b>venues,</b> and that this loss is associated with increased relative trade costs on the TSE. The second essay analyzes the determinants of the price impact at the announcement and issue dates for domestic and international seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) for Canadian shares cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX or NASDAQ. In addition, it analyzes whether the determinants for domestic and international SEOs are the same for shares cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX and NASDAQ, respectively. The findings indicate that the determinants of the market reaction at the announcement and issue dates for the SEOs of the Canadian cross-listed shares differ for all the studied samples and are unambiguously dependent on the SEO geographic placement and cross-listing U. S. <b>trade</b> <b>venue.</b> Finally, the third essay investigates whether the determinants of underwriter fees are the same for domestic and non-domestic SEOs by Canadian firms cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX or NASDAQ. The results clearly indicate that the determinants of underwriting fees differ for the domestic and non-domestic SEOs. After controlling for differences in other relevant fee determinants, the underwriter fees for non-domestic SEOs are significantly higher for the Canadian shares cross-listed on the NASDAQ compared to those cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX...|$|R
