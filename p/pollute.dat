5|$|Haphazard {{industrial}} planning, increased urbanisation, {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can <b>pollute</b> waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk.

In 2012, it produced about 70% of Estonia's ordinary waste, 82% of its hazardous waste, and more than 70% of its greenhouse gas emissions. Its activities lower groundwater levels, alter water circulation, and spoil water quality. Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale-fired power stations exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia. Leachates from waste heaps <b>pollute</b> surface and groundwater.

5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to <b>pollute</b> the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't <b>pollute</b> the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would <b>pollute</b> the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

Olive plants were collected from <b>polluted</b> and non-polluted areas in Jeddah - Saudi Arabia, traffic area as an air <b>polluted</b> area, sewage treatment station as water <b>polluted</b> area, industrial area as solid waste <b>polluted,</b> costal area as marine <b>polluted</b> area and an area without a direct source of pollution far away from the city center, which was used as control. These changes conducted with nucleic acid content, minerals content, pigments and some growth parameters. Results showed significant reductions in DNA and RNA contents under all <b>polluted</b> sites. Mineral contents were varied widely depending on the different pollutants and locations of olive plant. Generally, micro-elements varied (increase/decrease) significantly within collected samples and the source of pollution. All growth parameters were decreased significantly within the studied samples of all pollutant areas except the relative water content was increased. The content of chlorophyll a has decreased highly significantly in all <b>polluted</b> leaves. While the content of chlorophyll b has increased significantly in all <b>polluted</b> leaves especially in air <b>polluted</b> leaves. The total content of carotenoid pigments has decreased highly significantly in all <b>polluted</b> leaves.

5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could <b>pollute</b> the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E

40|$|To gain an {{understanding}} of the characteristics of nitrate, sulfate and ammonium in the urban atmosphere of Beijing, an experiment was conducted in October 2004, using a method involving the rapid collection of particles and analysis using an ion chromatography system. The study shows that the mean concentration of water soluble ions (WSI) increased during heavily <b>polluted</b> weather, and this change in the concentration of pollutants was related to the meteorological background. The concentration of nitrate, sulfate and ammonium increased 7. 9, 4. 1 and 5. 4 times, respectively, during heavily <b>polluted</b> periods. The concentration of nitrate increased most among the WSI in PM 10. The diurnal variations of nitrate, sulfate and ammonium in more <b>polluted</b> periods were different from those in less <b>polluted</b> periods. The highest concentration of nitrate (NO 3 -), sulfate (SO 4 2 -), and ammonium (NH 4 +) appeared at 19 : 00 during more <b>polluted</b> periods. In contrast, the highest concentrations of these compounds occurred at noon during less <b>polluted</b> periods. A correlation analysis showed that NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, NH 4 +, nitrogen oxides (NO x) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) had significant positive correlations in more <b>polluted</b> periods.
