40|$|Abstract- During routine {{dissection}} {{for first}} MBBS students on 65 years donated embalmed male cadaver in the Department of Anatomy, K. J. Somaiya Medical College, we observed the high origin of {{anterior tibial artery}} from the popliteal artery proximal to the popliteus muscle. The anterior tibial artery ran downward on the posterior surface of the popliteus muscle. The posterior peroneotibial trunk distal to the tendinous arch of soleus muscle divides into the posterior tibial and the <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The further course of anterior, posterior tibial and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries</b> was normal. The photographs of the variations were taken for proper documentation and ready reference. There were no associated neuromuscular variations found in same specimen. The right lower limb of the same cadaver was normal. Conclusion- The arthroscopic knee surgery is a convenient and preferred surgical procedure. The knowledge of branching pattern of popliteal artery is important for surgical interventions in the popliteal region {{in order to minimize}} the surgical complications due to anatomical variations. Therefore the origin of anterior tibial artery from the popliteal artery proximal to the popliteus muscle is an important anatomical variation which should be kept in mind by the orthopaedicians doing knee joint surgery and total knee arthroplasty, by the surgeons operating on aneurysms of popliteal artery and by the radiologist performing angiographic study...|$|R
40|$|The sciatic artery is {{the major}} {{arterial}} supply to the lower limb bud at an early embryological stage. It primarily originates from the dorsal root of the umbilical artery. After the 22 mm embryological stage, the sciatic artery involutes and the femoral artery system develops as the major inflow source to the lower limb. In the adult, remnants of the sciatic artery persist as the proximal portion of the inferior gluteal artery, the popliteal and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries</b> (Williams et al. 1989). It is suggested that either failure in development of the femoral system or failure in regression of the sciatic artery results in persistence of this artery (Arey, 1965). We report a rare example of persistent sciatic artery (PSA) accompanied by arterio-arterial and arteriovenous anastomoses...|$|R
50|$|At {{one point}} in its history, both the Greek term perone and the Latin term fibula were {{competing}} to describe the smaller bone of the leg. Many of the arteries, veins, nerves, and muscles in the leg are named according to what bone they are near (e.g. tibialis anterior and the tibial nerve are near the tibia). So the artery that runs near the smaller leg bone had two names: the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> and the fibular artery. The term fibula eventually became the standard name for the bone, {{but many of the}} related arteries, muscles, and nerves are still called by the Greek derived name peroneal.

40|$|BackgroundThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the anatomy of the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> and its perforators, and to report the clinical results of reconstruction with <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flaps. MethodsThe authors dissected 4 cadaver legs and investigated the distribution, course, origin, number, type, and length of the perforators. <b>Peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flap surgery was performed on 29 patients. ResultsWe identified 19 perforators in 4 legs. The mean number of perforators was 4. 8 per leg, and the mean length was 4. 8 cm. Five perforators were found proximally, 9 medially, and 5 distally. We found 12 true septocutaneous perforators and 7 musculocutaneous perforators. Four emerged from the posterior tibia artery, and 15 were from the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery.</b> The <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flap was used in 29 patients. Retrograde island peroneal flaps were used in 8 cases, anterograde island peroneal flaps in 5 cases, and free peroneal flaps in 16 cases. The mean age was 59. 9 years, and the defect size ranged from 2. 0 cm× 4. 5 cm to 8. 0 cm× 8. 0 cm. All the flaps survived. Five flaps developed partial skin necrosis. In 2 cases, a split-thickness skin graft was performed, and the other 3 cases were treated without any additional procedures.

40|$|ObjectiveBalloon angioplasties of {{stenotic}} or occluded infrapopliteal arteries may {{be helpful}} in selected high-risk patients threatened with limb loss. Thus far, these procedures have demanded fluoroscopy and the injection of potentially nephrotoxic contrast material. Herein, we proposed a new alternative to avoid {{the harmful effects of}} radiation exposure and the risk of acute renal failure. MethodsOver the last 16 months, 30 patients (57 % male) aged 74 ± 9 years (mean ± SD) had a total of 52 attempted balloon angioplasties of the infrapopliteal arteries in 32 limbs under duplex guidance. Indications for the procedure were critical ischemia in 20 limbs (63 %), including rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and gangrene in 4 (13 %), 10 (31 %), and 6 (19 %) limbs, respectively. Severe disabling claudication was an indication in the remaining 12 limbs (37 %). All patients had concomitantly performed balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries (28 cases) or the popliteal artery alone (4 cases). Balloon angioplasty of the infrapopliteal arteries was performed as an adjunct to improve runoff. Hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, smoking, and coronary artery disease were present in 77 %, 73 %, 50 %, 47 %, and 37 % of cases, respectively. There were 42 cases (81 %) with infrapopliteal arterial stenoses (25 tibioperoneal trunks, 9 <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries,</b> 4 anterior tibial arteries, and 4 posterior tibial arteries) in 26 limbs. The remaining 10 cases (19 %) had infrapopliteal arterial occlusions (4 tibioperoneal trunks, 5 <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries,</b> and 1 anterior tibial artery) in 6 limbs. All these cases were combined with more proximal endovascular procedures (21 femoropopliteal stenoses and 11 femoropopliteal occlusions). All patients had preprocedure duplex arterial mapping and ankle/brachial index (ABI) measurement. Local anesthesia with light sedation was used in all cases. The common femoral artery was cannulated under direct duplex visualization. Still under duplex guidance, a guidewire was directed into the proximal superficial femoral artery and distally, beyond the infrapopliteal diseased segment. The diseased segment was then balloon-dilated. Balloon diameter and length were chosen according to the arterial measurements obtained by duplex guidance. Completion duplex examinations were performed and postprocedure ABIs were obtained in all cases. ResultsAlthough the overall technical success was 94 % (49 / 52 cases), it was 95 % for those with stenoses (40 / 42 cases) and 90 % for those with occlusions (9 / 10 cases; P 0. 15) postoperative ABI increase. Overall 30 -day survival and limb salvage rates were 100 %. ConclusionsThe proposed technique eliminates the need for radiation exposure and the use of contrast material, {{and it seems to be}} an effective alternative approach for the treatment of infrapopliteal occlusive disease. Additional advantages include accurate selection of the proper size of balloon and confirmation of the adequacy of the technique by hemodynamic and imaging parameters...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of PAD is two- to fourfold {{more common among}} diabetic patients [81]. The incidence and extent of PAD correlate with the duration and severity of DM [82]. The coexistence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and central obesity, which is common in diabetic patients, contributes to the {{development of}} PAD [83]. There is a strong association with cardiovascular morbidity [84]. PAD results in disability with serious social consequences and may require surgery. The clinical presentation of PAD typically includes intermittent claudication, which can progress to resting pain, ulceration and gangrene. The stage of intermittent claudication is characterised by pain in the legs after walking a certain distance. The characteristic symptom in critical ischaemia stage is resting pain, which leads to severe disability. Gangrene is the end stage of PAD and amputation is inevitable. Among patients with PAD, diabetic patients have worse arterial disease and poorer outcome than non-diabetic patients. The impairment of circulation frequently combined with impaired sensation due to diabetic neuropathy, commonly results in foot ulcerations. The subsequent development of infections is a major cause of morbidity in diabetics. Evaluation of diabetic foot infections often requires clinical, laboratory, microbiological and radiological assessment with bone imaging and MRI exhibiting the best sensitivity [85]. Osteomyelitis has a profound impact on the prognosis and management of these infections and the “gold standard” for its diagnosis remains the bone biopsy. Diabetic patients are five-times more likely than non-diabetic patients to undergo an amputation [82] and, moreover, diabetes {{is the leading cause of}} non-traumatic lower extremity amputations in the United States [48]. Atheromatous disease tends to affect more distal vessels such as the tibial and the <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries,</b> producing multiple, diffuse lesions that are less straightforward to bypass or to dilate by angioplasty [83, 86, 87].|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} systemically administered urokinase (UK) after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stent (PTA ± stent) on {{the reduction in the}} rate and level of amputation in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) with tissue loss. MethodsThis was an observational, nonrandomized, retrospective study of 183 Taiwanese patients with Rutherford stage 5 or 6, and Fontaine stage 4 lower extremity CLI. Patients received either PTA ± stent or PTA ± stent + UK infusion (250, 000  IU, daily for 5 days). PTA of the iliac, femoral, anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial <b>artery,</b> and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries</b> was included. Amputation was classified as minor, with direct wound healing, and minor amputation or surgical debridement of toes and major, with below- (BKA) and above-knee amputation (AKA). ResultsIn groups of patients with comparable baseline characteristics, 85 and 90 patients received PTA ± stent and PTA ± stent + UK, respectively. There were 24 major limb amputations performed. A significant majority (20 / 24 (83. 3 %) were performed in patients who did not receive adjuvant urokinase, compared with 4 / 24 (16. 7 %) of patients who did receive urokinase (p = 0. 000287). There was {{a significant increase in the}} limb salvage rate for infrapopliteal lesions in patients treated with PTA + UK (12 / 72 with UK; 60 / 72 without UK; p ≤ . 0001). Intracranial hemorrhage (n =  1) and bleeding at the inguinal puncture site (n =  2) were reported in the PTA ± stent + UK group. Eight deaths (one in the PTA ± stent + UK group; seven in the PTA ± stent) occurred during the study. ConclusionSystemic administration of UK with the PTA ± stent procedure may reduce the requirement for major amputation in patients with CLI with tissue loss (Rutherford 5 or 6). The difference is more pronounced in patients undergoing infrapopliteal interventions. However, these findings need to be confirmed in a randomized prospective study...|$|R

Multi-detector row computed tomographic angiography (CTA or angio CT), has emerged as a significant improvement, providing non-invasive operator-independent details of the vascular anatomy. We utilised this tool to perform an in vivo, anatomical study of the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> perforators, and demonstrating the usefulness of CTA in planning the osteocutaneous free fibula flap. Methods Forty-one consecutive patients (82 limbs) underwent CTA of the lower limb vasculature, with the anatomical details of the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> cutaneous perforators assessed.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{distribution}} of atherosclerotic arterial disease in diabetes mellitus characteristically involves the infragenicular arterial tree including the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) {{is essential in}} the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. It has long been held that insulin plays a causative role in the formation of the atherosclerotic lesion in diabetes. We studied the role played by insulin in the proliferation of these cells in culture and the interaction of insulin with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ 1), a factor known for its possible inhibitory effects. Methods: We have grown and characterized a line of VSMC harvested from atherosclerotic infragenicular arteries of human subjects undergoing below-knee amputation. The cultures were defined as being of VSMC origin by immunohistochemical staining with α-smooth muscle actin. Confluent cultures of passages 4 through 7 were seeded into six well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well. After serum deprivation the cells were exposed to insulin (100 ng/ml) alone or in combination with TGFβ 1 (6 ng/ml). Results: Our findings indicate that a 48 -hour incubation with insulin augments the proliferation of human infragenicular VSMC, producing a 207 % increase in cell number when compared with control cells (11, 328 ± 686, n = 56 vs 3682 ± 182, n = 87; p < 0. 0001). The addition of TGFβ 1 in combination with insulin abolished the accelerated growth rate seen in test groups treated with insulin alone (3614 ± 247, n = 32 vs 11, 328 ± 686, n = 56; p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: These results strongly suggest that insulin is a potent stimulant of human infragenicular VSMC proliferation. The mitogenic effect of insulin is inhibited by TGFβ 1, producing proliferation rates comparable to those observed in control cells incubated with serum-free media.

40|$|Vascular {{surgeons}} are {{in agreement}} that autogenous saphenous veins are best suited for bypasses from the common femoral artery to the distal popliteal artery {{in the management of}} femoropopliteal occlusive disease associated with the severely ischemic foot. Such a graft should be of adequate size (more than 3 mm in diameter) throughout its length for a successful outcome. In some patients the vein is of good size for 15 or 20 cm then branches into several small veins. Reports by most surgeons are unfavorable concerning the use of prostheses and bovine heterografts for anastomosis to the distal popliteal artery or to one of its branches. Our experience with composite dacron vein graft bypasses employing a fluted end-to-end anastomosis had been unfavorable and was similar to the experience of Dale (1962). In July 1973 we were forced to improvise the technique of end-to-side anastomosis joining the end of a dacron prosthesis {{to the side of the}} vein graft for a femorodistal popliteal bypass. During the ensuing 15 months we have carried out this composite graft only when the greater saphenous vein was not of adequate size throughout. In 17 limbs the composite graft was placed between the common femoral artery and the distal popliteal artery and on 6 occasions to the posterior tibial and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Nineteen limbs exhibited either gangrene, impending gangrene, ischemic ulceration or severe rest pain. In four extremities intermittent claudication of a progressive and disabling degree was the indication for operation. Eleven of the 22 patients were diabetic. Run-off beyond the popliteal artery was poor in 16 of the 23 limbs and inflow was subnormal in three patients. During the followup period, 10 grafts have occluded, one day to 6 1 / 2 months postoperatively, two due to inflow deficiency, 5 due to poor outflow, one to an error in technique, and two occluded without known cause.

40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{examined}} whether preoperative duplex {{ultrasound scanning}} (DU) could replace contrast material–enhanced arteriography (CA) in selecting the recipient artery of tibial or <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafts. MethodsIn patients who underwent tibial or <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting because of critical ischemia, images were obtained {{of the lower}} extremity arterial circulation with both DU and CA. Vascular surgeons, blinded to the operation performed, reviewed either DU or CA images for arterial visualization and patency. The tibial or <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> best suited to receive the bypass graft was selected by surgeons using only data from either DU or CA images. This selection was compared with the artery actually used at bypass surgery. ResultsPreoperative DU and CA data for 40 lower extremities in 38 patients undergoing bypass grafting {{at the level of}} the tibia provided 110 arteries: 38 anterior tibial arteries, 32 peroneal arteries, and 40 posterior tibial arteries. Ten arteries (8 peroneal, 2 anterior tibial) were not identified with DU, and 1 artery (anterior tibial) was not identified with CA. DU enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 88 % of patients (35 of 40), whereas CA enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 93 % of patients (37 of 40; P =. 59). Duplicate findings at DU and CA enabled selection of 85 % of arteries actually used (95 % confidence interval, 71 %- 93 %). Arteries used for bypass grafting had significantly higher peak systolic velocity (35 cm/s vs 25 cm/s; P =. 04), higher end-diastolic velocity (15 cm/s vs 9 cm/s; P =. 005), and greater diameter (2. 4 mm vs 1. 7 mm; P =. 003) compared with arteries not selected for bypass grafting. ConclusionFindings at DU and CA typically agree when used to select tibial or peroneal arteries for bypass grafting. With DU there is occasional difficulty in identification of the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery,</b> but selection of the actual artery used is accurate. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and diameter characteristics correlate with arteriographic criteria for tibial bypass target artery selection. If DU enables adequate identification of a target artery for bypass grafting, and especially if the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> is seen, findings at CA are not likely to alter bypass execution...|$|E
40|$|Precise, {{comprehensive}} imaging of the arterial circulation is {{the cornerstone}} of successful revascularization of the ischemic extremity in patients with diabetes mellitus. Arterial imaging is challenging in these patients because the disease is often multisegmental with a predilection for the distal tibial and <b>peroneal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Occlusive lesions and the arterial wall itself are often calcified and patients presenting with ischemic complications frequently have underlying renal insufficiency. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA), contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and more recently, computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) have been used as imaging modalities in lower extremity ischemia. Each has specific advantages and shortcomings in this patient population, which will be summarized and contrasted in this review. DSA is an invasive technique most often performed from a femoral arterial puncture and requires the injection of arterial contrast, which can occasionally cause allergic reactions. In patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency, contrast infusion can result in worsening renal failure; although usually self-limited, it may occasionally require hemodialysis, especially in patients with diabetes. However, DSA provides the highest degree of spatial resolution and image quality. It is also the only modality in which the diagnosis and treatment of arterial disease can be performed simultaneously. MRA is noninvasive, and when enhanced with gadolinium contrast injection provides arterial images of comparable quality to DSA and in some circumstances may uncover distal arterial targets not visualized on DSA. However, spatial resolution is inferior to DSA and erroneous interpretations due to acquisition artifacts are common. Specialized equipment and imaging techniques are necessary to minimize their occurrence in the distal lower extremity. In addition, due to the risk of inducing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium-enhanced MRA cannot be used in patients with renal insufficiency. CTA is noninvasive and rapidly performed, with better spatial resolution than MRA, but requires the largest volume of contrast infusion, exposes patients to high-doses of radiation, and is subject to interpretive error due to reconstruction artifacts especially in heavily calcified arteries, limiting its usefulness in many patients with diabetes. For patients in whom the planned intervention is a surgical bypass, DSA and MRA will provide high quality images of the lower extremity arterial anatomy. For patients in whom a catheter-based intervention is the likely treatment, a diagnostic DSA immediately followed by a catheter-based treatment in the same procedure is the preferred approach. In patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, in which gadolinium-enhanced MRA is contraindicated, DSA or CTA can be performed. However, patients should have an infusion of intravenous normal saline solution or sodium bicarbonate before the procedure to reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, skin island flaps {{supplied}} by the vascular axis of sensitive superficial nerves, like the sural and saphenous nerves, were introduced. Flaps {{supplied by}} the superficial <b>peroneal</b> nerve accessory <b>artery</b> (SPNAA), however, are still not commonly used. The {{aim of this study}} is to understand the anatomical structure of the SPNAA and its perforators in the anterior intermuscular septum, and to utilize SPNAA perforator flaps in the clinic. We dissected sixteen cadavers and assessed the location and number of the SPNAA, its perforators, and the septocutaneous perforators originating from the anterior tibial artery. A SPNAA perforator flap was applied to twelve patients, the free flap was applied to eleven patients, and the pedicled flap was applied to one patient. SPNAA varied from 7 to 16 cm in length with an average of 4. 5 perforators to supply lateral aspect. An average of 3. 13 septocutaneous perforators originated from th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the incidence, anatomical location, and clinical impact of fractures and/or compression of infrapopliteal balloon-expandable metal stents implanted for critical limb ischemia (CLI) treatment. Methods: This prospective study included 63 CLI patients (45 men; mean age 71. 369. 5 years) {{who had been}} treated with infrapopliteal angioplasty and stent placement for 191 lesions in 84 limbs. In all, 369 stents (296 stainless steel and 73 cobalt-chromium alloy) were implanted; 239 were placed overlapping in tandem lesions. Mean length of the overall stented segment was 4. 466. 3 cm (range 1. 6 – 14. 0). Stents were located in the tibioperoneal (n 534), anterior tibial (n 5195), posterior tibial (n 563), and <b>peroneal</b> (n 577) <b>arteries.</b> Follow-up consisted of digital subtraction angiography and infrapopliteal radiography imaging at 2 different angles. Evaluation of stents {{for the presence of}} fracture and/or compression was done after digital processing at the highest possible magnifica-tion. Stent fractures were defined according to published standards, whereas compression was classified as severe shape alteration and/or collapse of the stent mesh. Angiographic restenosis was based on a 50 % threshold...|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of vascular anomalies {{in the leg}} of patients with clubfoot is well documented. For example, in some cases, the anterior tibial artery and/or the posterior tibial artery can be absent [3]. In such feet, the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> is the dominant artery to supply the feet. Changulani et al. reported on a case study where the posterior artery was lacerated and the tibial nerve was completely transected during a percutaneous TAL. Injury to the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> in these patients may result in an avascular limb and a potential amputation [2]. Burghardt et al. also reported a case study on a child who developed a pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous TAL. Burghardt et al. noted that the patient had a posterior tibial artery-dependent foot. The child later required repeat tenotomy and, during the revision done by open tenotomy, the posterior tibial artery was noted to be closely applied to the Achilles tendon [1]. Dobbs et al. further highlighted this point, reporting on four patients with serious bleeding complications following percutaneous tendoachilles tenotomy due to injury to the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> {{in three of the}} cases and the lesser saphenous vein in one case [3]. In the current study, no case of vessel or nerve occurred when utilizing the mini open technique.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out whether a compensatory increase in blood flow to the foot is observed after sacrifice of one of the tibial arteries. Eleven patients who had one of the tibial arteries as the recipient artery of free tissue transfer to their lower extremities were included. The arterial diameter, cross-sectional area, maximum flow velocity, minimum flow velocity, and flow rate were measured by a Doppler ultrasound in the nonrecipient tibial artery and perforating <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> in the operated limb. The same parameters were measured in the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and the perforating <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> in the contralateral limb. The arterial diameter, cross-sectional area, flow velocity, and flow rate were increased significantly in the nonrecipient tibial artery of the operated limb with respect to the same artery on the contralateral limb. The same changes were not demonstrated in the perforating branch of the <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery.</b> Total blood flow to the foot in the operated extremity was not different from that of the nonoperated foot. The results reveal that if a major feeder to the foot is sacrificed, the other tibial artery compensates for it, and resting blood supply to the foot is not altered...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{enhancement}} {{characteristics and}} image quality of two macrocyclic gadolinium chelates, gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol, in low-dose, time-resolved MRA of the calf station. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 consecutive patients with {{peripheral arterial disease}} (stages II-IV) were retrospectively analysed. Fifty patients were included in each group - 32 men and 18 women for gadobutrol (mean age 67 years) and 34 men, 16 women for gadoterate meglumine (mean age 64 years). 0. 03 mmol/kg bw of either gadobutrol or gadoterate meglumine was injected. Gadobutrol was diluted 1 ∶ 1 with normal saline (0. 9 % NaCl) to provide similar injection volume and bolus geometry compared to the undiluted 0. 5 M dose of gadoterate meglumine. Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) and image quality were analysed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Mean SNR ranged from 83. 0 ± 46. 7 (<b>peroneal</b> <b>artery)</b> to 96. 4 ± 64. 5 (anterior tibial artery) for gadobutrol, and from 37. 6 ± 13. 8 (<b>peroneal</b> <b>artery)</b> to 45. 3 ± 16. 4 (anterior tibial artery) for the gadoterate meglumine group (p< 0. 0001). CNR values ranged from 30. 1 ± 20. 1 (<b>peroneal</b> <b>artery)</b> to 37. 6 ± 26. 0 (anterior tibial artery) for gadobutrol and from 14. 9 ± 8. 0 (<b>peroneal</b> <b>artery)</b> to 18. 6 ± 16. 4 (anterior tibial artery) for gadoterate meglumine (p< 0. 0001). No significant difference in image quality was found except for the peroneal arteries (p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 04). Interreader agreement was excellent (kappa 0. 87 - 0. 93). CONCLUSION: The significantly better enhancement as assessed by SNR and CNR provided by gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine does not translate into substantial differences in image quality in an equimolar, low-dose, time-resolved MRA protocol of the calves...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The role of infrainguinal {{arterial}} {{reconstructive surgery}} for claudication is controversial. We reviewed {{the results of}} femorotibial bypass procedures performed in {{a select group of}} patients with disabling claudication in an attempt to define a role for this aggressive approach. Methods: Data were retrieved from the vascular registry, and hospital records were obtained for all patients undergoing femorotibial reconstruction for disabling claudication during the past 16 years at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Follow-up interviews were obtained to assess overall health, walking impairment, functional status, and patient satisfaction. Results: During a 16 -year period a total of 57 tibial reconstructions were performed in 53 patients for claudication (5 % of all infrainguinal vein reconstructions). Autogenous vein conduit was used in all cases, most of which (70 %) involved the greater saphenous vein in situ. Distal anastamoses were to the tibioperoneal trunk (12 %), anterior tibial (18 %), posterior tibial (47 %), and <b>peroneal</b> (23 %) <b>arteries.</b> Major complications occurred in 9 %, and no perioperative deaths occurred. Overall 5 -year survival was 54 % ± 15 %, and no major amputations were performed. Cumulative primary and secondary graft patency at 5 years were 81 % ± 6 % and 86 % ± 5 %, respectively. Patency rates were significantly better than those achieved in a concurrent series of tibial bypasses for limb salvage and were equivalent to those achieved with femoropopliteal bypass for claudication. Interviewed patients reported improved walking distance, reduced claudication, and a high degree of overall satisfaction with their operation. Conclusion: Results obtained with femorotibial bypass performed for claudication were superior to those obtained for limb salvage and were equivalent to those obtained with femoropopliteal bypass for claudication. The results obtained in this highly selected cohort suggest that patients at low risk with significant functional impairment from claudication, available autogenous vein, and suitable tibial outflow to the ischemic muscular bed can be offered revascularization with the expectation of durable long-term results.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> {{gives off}} plenty of {{perforators}} that pass through fascial septum to supply skin and tenosynovium of peroneal muscles. Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to study the anatomical basis of perforators from terminal part of <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> axiality and to make use of this knowledge in reconstructing defects of posterior heel with the advantage of reducing the morbidity of conventional flaps. Materials and Methods: Our study was conducted at Department of Plastic surgery, Madras Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, India. We have carried out eleven cadaver dissections (from six cadavers-four fresh cadavers and two preserved cadavers) and delineated all septocutaneous and septosynovial perforators of distal peroneal axis and studied their relation with short saphenous vein (SSV) and sural nerve. Using this anatomical knowledge we have fashioned perforator based flaps in 13 patients (three propeller, four V-Y advancement, six tenosynovial flaps) for reconstruction of defects over tendo achilles and pericalcaneal region. Results: In all cases, SSV and sural nerve were preserved and donor site was closed primarily. No total flap loss was noted. Conclusion: Perforator based flaps from distal most part of <b>peroneal</b> <b>artery</b> provide a good and reliable method for reconstruction of pericalcaneal and tendo achilles region defects with preservation of SSV and sural nerve. It also avoids contour deformity of the grafted donor site of the classical lateral calcaneal artery axial flap...|$|E
