50|$|A <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cyst</b> can {{resemble}} a dermoid cyst, {{a kind of}} teratoma (germ cell tumor). In particular, a <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cyst</b> in the gluteal cleft can {{resemble a}} sacrococcygeal teratoma. Correct diagnosis is important because all teratomas require complete surgical excision, if possible without any spillage, and consultation with an oncologist.|$|E
50|$|A small {{dermoid cyst}} on the coccyx can be {{difficult}} to distinguish from a <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cyst.</b> This is partly because both can be full of hair.

50|$|One {{proposed}} {{cause of}} pilonidal cysts is ingrown hair. Excessive sitting {{is thought to}} predispose people to the condition, as sitting increases pressure on the coccygeal region. Trauma is not believed to cause a pilonidal cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst. However, there are cases where this can occur months after a localized injury to the area. Some researchers have proposed that pilonidal cysts {{may be the result}} of a congenital pilonidal dimple. Excessive sweating can also contribute to the cause of a <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cyst.</b> Moisture can fill a stretched hair follicle, which helps create a low-oxygen environment that promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, often found in pilonidal cysts. The presence of bacteria and low oxygen levels hamper wound healing and exacerbate a forming <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cyst.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction : <b>Pilonidal</b> <b>cysts</b> occur {{predominantly}} in males. The lesion usually {{manifests itself}} clinically {{near the end}} of the second decade of life. The patients are often hirsute and frequently unaware of the presence of the sinus. Clinically, the lesion is asymptomatic until it becomes infected. The diagnosis is made on the basis of one or more small openings in the midline over the sacrococcygeal region approximately 3. 5 to 5 cm posterior to the anal orifice. Infection may occur because of its proximity to the anal region. The symptoms of an abscess are classic. Trauma preceding the onset of symptoms has been reported. As this disease is seen in the young and active population and has a high prevalence, need for a surgical operation with decreased complications& duration of admission leading to faster return of the patient to daily life activities is felt. Methods& materials :In this sinple blind randomized clinical trial study, 60 young patients (mean age of 21. 9 +/- 3. 09 years) who refered to the surgical clinics of Baqiyatallah hospital and diagnosed as having <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cysts</b> requiring treatment were divided into two groups of 30 cases each, wherein Group One patients were operated upon using this new semi-closure technique and Group Two patients were operated upon using the classic open method.

In technical terms, the Fistula in Ano, without any regard to the strict definition of the word, is understood to be an abscess, running upon, or into the Intestinum Rectum; though an abscess in this part, when once ruptured, does generally, if neglected, grow callous in its cavity and edges, and become at last what is properly called a fistula.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{dermatological}} atlas of the morphologic presentations of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). It includes: superficial abscesses (boils, furnucles, carbuncles), abscesses that are subcutaneous and suprafascial, pyogenic granulomas, cysts, painful erythematous papules and plaques, folliculitis, open ulcerations, chronic sinuses, fistulas, sinus tracts, scrotal and genital lyphedema, dermal contractures, keloids (some {{that are still}} pitted with follicular ostia), scarring, skin tags, fibrosis, anal fissures, fistulas (i. e. circinate, linear, arcuate), scarring folliculitis of the buttocks (from mild to cigarette-like scarring), condyloma like lesions in intertrigous areas, fishmouth scars, acne inversa, honey-comb scarring, cribiform scarring, tombstone comedones, and morphia-like plaques. HS can co-exist with other follicular diseases such as <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cysts,</b> dissecting cellulitis, acne conglobata, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acanthosis nigricans. In sum, the variety of presentations of HS as shown by these images supports the supposition that HS is a reaction pattern. HS is a follicular based diseased and its manifestations involve a multitude of follicular pathologies [1, 2]. It {{is also known as}} acne inversa (AI) because of one manifestation that involves the formation of open comedones on areas besides the face. It is as yet unclear why HS is so protean in its manifestations. HS severity is assessed using the Hurley Staging System (Table 1). It also remains unclear why hidradentitis may remain limited to Hurley Stage 1, evolve to the more confluent (Hurley Stage 2), or progress even further to the fully confluent (Hurley Stage 3). In addition, HS can be associated with other follicular based diseases such as <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cysts</b> (PCs) of the sacrum and buttocks, dissecting cellulitis (DC), and acne conglobata (AC), which usually involves the face, chest, When HS occurs with PCs, DC, and/or AC it {{is referred to as the}} follicular occlusion triad or tetrad [2]. HS can more rarely be associated with pyoderma gagrenosum (PG) or Crohn disease (CD), other inflammatory diseases of the skin that are not follicular. The reason for this is unclear [2]. What AC, DC, HS, CD, and PG share is that they occur in bacterially rich environments. HS probably occurs with acanthosis nigricans because many HS patients are obese [2].

5000|$|Surgeons {{can also}} excise the sinus and repair with a {{reconstructive}} flap technique, {{such as a}} [...] "cleft lift" [...] procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under general anesthetic. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring pilonidal disease, leaves little scar tissue and flattens the region between the buttocks, {{reducing the risk of}} recurrence. [...] This approach typically results in a more rapid recovery than the traditional surgery, however there are fewer surgeons trained in the cleft lift procedure and thus, it may not be as accessible to patients, depending on their geographic location. Meta analysis shows recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87) at the expense of time to healing. <b>Pilonidal</b> <b>cysts</b> recur and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress.

Studies on this disease have not clearly revealed its prevalence. We aimed to detect its dispersion characteristics in our country.

A total of 19, 013 candidates, aged between 17  years and 28  years and coming from different regions of the country, who applied to be students or officials of the state's schools and institutions, were enrolled in the study. Examination was performed including the perineal region, the presence of any comorbid diseases was noted, and clinical types of pilonidal sinus disease were detected according to Tezel's classification and recorded.

40|$|Introduction: In our {{institution}} we’ve {{had a lot}} of exerience in proctology. Ten years ago, {{we introduced}} one day surgery in our practice and had really good results in treating practically all patients who needed proctologic surgery. Materials, methods and results: During this period of time 9. 636 out of 73. 235 outpatient cases were chosen for surgery. Among them, 2664 were patients with operations of perianal haematomas. We had some experiences with minor anal surgery (excisions of skin tags in 537 patients, excisions of papillas in 545 patients); patients with haemorrhoids, operated classically on Milligan- Morgan procedure (1116) or by the new PPH - Longo procedure (270) and HAL technique (12). We also treated patients with fistulas - either with fistulotomy or excision of fistulae - and 1007 patients with minor surgery. We made excisions of anorectal polyps in 265 patients, excisions of <b>pilonidal</b> <b>cysts</b> in 421 patients and treated 211 patients with anal abscesses. We had 282 patients with anal warts, 310 patients with anal fisures. In 35 patients we made some other small proctological interventions. In addition to proctology we made tension free operations of groin hernias in 627 patients, corrections of epigastric and umbillical hernias (26 patients) and corrections of stomas in 11 patients. The rest of our peogramm were small aseptic interventions (operations of fibromas, atheromas, verrucas, ganglions, lipomas etc.). Conclusion: We have experienced ambulatory surgery (i. e. day surgery hospital) as an appropriate choice for treating the patients with proctologic pathology. However, it used to be the practice to treat all these patients in hospitals, where they occupied bed facilities that could be intended for other patients.
