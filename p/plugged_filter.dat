50|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cloud point {{refers to the}} temperature below which wax in diesel or biowax in biodiesels forms a cloudy appearance.

To study the influence of long-term storage on different heating oils (biogenic, fossil, and a 10 % blend) and to investigate the changes in their composition, the oils were stored for a period of 12 – 24 months at nearly ambient (40 °C) and analyzed with different techniques every 6 weeks.

Para todos esses biodieseis foram determinados o ponto de entupimento a frio, o ponto de fulgor e o perfil cromatográfico. Estes biodieseis foram misturados com diesel de petróleo para se produzir misturas contendo 5 % do biocombustível (B 5), 10 % (B 10) e 20 % (B 20), e os ensaios citados foram realizados nestas amostras. Visando a diminuição do ponto de entupimento a frio, alguns aditivos naturais foram testados e se mostraram eficientes. Por exemplo, o limoneno reduziu o ponto de entupimento do {{biodiesel}} de óleo soja em mais de 7 °C. No biodiesel de gordura suína a redução foi de 10 °C, o que significa o ponto de entupimento a frio em temperatura inferior a 13 °C. Os aditivos utilizados são solúveis nos biodieseis estudados e, também, nas misturas diesel-biodiesel, pelo menos nas concentrações testadas. Como importante exemplo de abaixamento do ponto de entupimento a frio das misturas diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 10 % de biodiesel (B 10), podese citar o caso da terebentina que provocou uma redução de aproximadamente 8 °C (de 12, 7 ºC para 5, 0 °C). Este mesmo aditivo caus ou uma redução de 13, 6 ºC (de 20, 3 ºC para 6, 7 ºC), na mistura diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 20 % de biodiesel (B 20). Este resultado é muito significativo por implicar na possibilidade de usar este tipo de combustível mesmo em regiões mais ao sul do país durante o inverno.

In order to decrease the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point, some natural additives have been tested and were proved effectively.

Catalytic cracking of these tars to molecular moieties of C{sub 10 } or smaller would prevent the problems commonly attributed to the tars.

We evaluate the potential of selected catalysts to minimize tar accumulation and maximize char conversion to useful liquid and/or gaseous products. Owing to the potential for production of extremely toxic nickel carbonyl gas, care must be exercised in the use of a NISMM catalyst for cracking tars at high temperatures in reducing atmospheres such as those produced by coal gasification.

This innovation showed marked improvement in thermal conductivity of the individual fibers and tubing, as well as components assembled from them. The problem is centered on improving the heat removal of the liquid-cooled ventilation garments (LCVGs) used by astronauts. The current design uses an extensive network of water-cooling tubes that introduces bulkiness and discomfort, and increases fatigue. Range of motion and ease of movement are affected as well. The current technology {{is the same as}} developed during the Apollo program of the 1960 s. Tubing material is hand-threaded through a spandex/nylon mesh layer, in a series of loops throughout the torso and limbs such that there is close, form-fitting contact with the user. Usually, there is a nylon liner layer to improve comfort. Circulating water is chilled by an external heat exchanger (sublimator). The purpose of this innovation is to produce new LCVG components with improved thermal conductivity. This was addressed using nanocomposite engineering incorporating high-thermalconductivity nanoscale fillers in the fabric and tubing components. Specifically, carbon nanotubes were added using normal processing methods such as thermoplastic melt mixing (compounding twin screw extruder) and downstream processing (fiber spinning, tubing extrusion).

A well-known problem at low temperatures is the filter blockage of diesel fuel.

Furthermore, wax crystals can <b>plug</b> screens and <b>filters</b> at temperatures above the pour point; the so-called cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point.

The cold flow properties of biodiesel were investigated {{on the basis}} of the crystallization theory, including {{chemical composition}} and molecular structure. Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, high-melting-point saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The cold flow properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The long-straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters tend to have relatively poor cold flow properties. The cold flow properties worsen with increasing the amount and carbon chain length of straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters.

In this paper biodiesel has been prepared from raw mahua oil by transesterification process and different properties of mahua biodiesel have been studied. It has been found that the physico-chemical properties are within the range of different specification standards like ASTM D- 6751 of USA, EN- 14214 of Europe and IS- 15607 of India. It contains around 41. 2 % saturated and 58. 8 % unsaturated fatty acid. Though viscosity of raw mahua oil reduces after transesterification, still it is higher than mineral diesel. The cold flow properties like cloud point, pour point and cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point (CFPP) are also higher than mineral diesel. In this study mahua biodiesel has been blended with mineral diesel in different volumetric percentage and properties of blended biodiesel have been evaluated against the relevant standards. The different regression equations have been derived to predict the properties at different blending ratio. The developed mathematical models show higher coefficient of regression value (R 2) between biodiesel properties and blending percentage. Blending ratio up to 0. 3 i. e. 30 % blending has been recommended as optimum blending ratio taking Cold <b>Filter</b> <b>Plugging</b> Point (CFPP) into account...|$|R
5000|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light - this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45 micrometre filter is the cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately [...] Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around [...] and [...] respectively. There are a number of commercially available additives that will significantly lower the pour point and cold <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> point of pure biodiesel. Winter operation is also possible by blending biodiesel with other fuel oils including #2 low sulfur diesel fuel and #1 diesel / kerosene.|$|R
30|$|Powdered plant {{materials}} were macerated with 95 % ethanol for fourteen days and periodic shaking {{was carried out}} to ensure optimum maceration. Cotton <b>plug</b> and Whatman <b>filter</b> paper was used as filtering media to obtain a clear solution through the removal of plant debris. The ethanolic crude extract of aerial parts of A. ilicifolius (EEAI), obtained following the evaporation of ethanol in a rotary evaporator at 50 [*]°C, was stored at 4 [*]°C in refrigerator (Yield: 9.6 % of dried plant material). To ensure optimum release profile in experimental animals, the crude extract was brought {{to room temperature before}} further experimental use.|$|R
