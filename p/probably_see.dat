25|$|When Cobden began what {{proved to}} be the final over, the score was still 175/7, with four runs needed to win. From the first ball, F.H. Hill played a shot which seemed sure to reach the {{boundary}} and thus to win the match. However it was brilliantly fielded and the batsmen could only run one. Hill then had to watch the tail-enders try to cope with Cobden in poor light. S.E. Butler was caught off the second ball of the over and T.H. Belcher was bowled by the third. With four ball overs at that time, Cobden had one ball left. If the batsman, W.A. Stewart, could survive it, then Hill would face the next over and would <b>probably</b> <b>see</b> Oxford home. But Cobden made no mistake and Stewart was bowled. Cobden finished with figures of 4/35, and 8/76 in the match.|$|E
500|$|Blair did {{not want}} Livingstone as London Mayor, {{claiming}} the latter {{was one of those}} who [...] "almost knocked [...] over the edge of the cliff into extinction" [...] during the 1980s. He and the Labour spin doctors organised a campaign against Livingstone to ensure that he was not selected, with Campbell and Sally Morgan unsuccessfully attempting to get Oona King to denounce Livingstone. They failed to convince Mo Mowlam to stand for the mayorship, and instead encouraged the reluctant Frank Dobson to stand. Recognising that a 'one member, one vote' election within the London Labour Party would <b>probably</b> <b>see</b> Livingstone selected over Dobson, Blair ensured that a third of the votes would come from the rank-and-file members, a third from the trade unions, and a third from Labour MPs and MEPs, the latter two of which he could pressure into voting for his own preferred candidate, something that Dobson was deeply uncomfortable with. Information on the Blairite campaign against Livingstone became public, costing Dobson much support; nevertheless, due to the impact of the MPs and MEPs, Dobson won the candidacy with 51% to Livingstone's 48%.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and we came across one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different".

2500|$|Hilbert's {{problems}} ranged {{greatly in}} topic and precision. [...] Some {{of them are}} propounded precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer, like the 3rd problem, {{which was the first}} to be solved, or the 8th problem (the Riemann hypothesis). [...] For other problems, such as the 5th, experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation, and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but closely related unsolved problems exist. [...] Sometimes Hilbert's statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to apply, e.g. most modern number theorists would <b>probably</b> <b>see</b> the 9th problem as referring to the conjectural Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. [...] Still other problems, such as the 11th and the 16th, concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of quadratic forms and real algebraic curves.|$|E
