5|$|At one point, {{the prices}} for his <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> {{exceeded}} only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and {{was in danger of}} being sent to debtors' prison.

50|$|If ASO across <b>pictures</b> <b>is</b> {{supported}} in AVC, serious issues arise: slices from different <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> interleaved. One possible {{way to solve}} these issues is to limit ASO within a picture, i.e. slices from different <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> not interleaved.|$|R
50|$|Pictures hold two {{encoding}} {{advantages over}} words. <b>Pictures</b> <b>are</b> perceptually more distinct {{from one another}} than are words, thus increasing their chance for retrieval. In experiments when similarity among <b>pictures</b> <b>was</b> high, no <b>picture</b> superiority effect <b>was</b> present. <b>Pictures</b> <b>are</b> also believed to assess meaning more directly than words. Levels of processing theory apply when words and <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> compared under semantic study instructions (rate the pleasantness of each item), recall is very similar for pictures and words, as both were encoded at deeper levels.|$|R
5|$|From {{an early}} age Bauer had to adapt his {{illustrations}} to contemporary printing technique. Full-color was expensive, so the illustrations were made in one color plus black. As the process developed and his works became in greater demand, his <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> eventually printed in full color.|$|E

5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion picture with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|Comprising {{the nascent}} motion picture genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their putative betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E

5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B.

Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Zagreb {{was one of}} {{the first}} European cities where {{television}} <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the Zagreb Fair featured a Philips television system, operated for short periods each day of the exhibition (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by Eric Klaas de Vries in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London and Berlin. The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} {{attempting}} {{to gain a}} foothold in the acting industry, Merryman worked simultaneously as a model for lingerie, and a waitress, and was featured in Playboy. The show chronicled her audition process for a horror film, and a role in the television soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. She successfully landed a role during Desperately Seeking Stardom, on the television show Baywatch. Merryman subsequently gained a part on the television series Veronica's Closet. In 2000, Merryman was selected for a photo shoot by American photographer Mark Daughn; her <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> used to advertise the Internet company Bomis. Daughn's photographs of Merryman also appeared in Mystique Magazine in January 2003, alongside models including: Aria Giovanni, Sunny Leone, Lisa Marie Scott, Natasha Yi, and Kalin Olson. She was featured in the book Mystique: Models of Mystique in the same year, photographed by Daughn.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E
5|$|Motion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a U.S. {{military}} policeman {{stopped a}} Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were then confiscated by the American authorities. These reels were in turn {{requested by the}} Japanese government, declassified, and saved from oblivion. Some black-and-white motion <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> released and shown {{for the first time}} to Japanese and American audiences in the years from 1968 to 1970. The public release of film footage of the city post-attack, and some research about the human effects of the attack, was restricted during the occupation of Japan, and much of this information was censored until the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, restoring control to the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, Monroe met {{photographer}} David Conover, who {{had been}} sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although none of her <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and {{signed a contract with}} the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. She began to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly brunette hair straightened and dyed blonde to make her more employable. Her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.|$|E
5|$|The first project {{proposed}} {{and worked on}} was a period film to be called Dora-Heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> set aside, with the artist focusing {{on the creation of}} a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.|$|E
