40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of pefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was {{compared with that}} of 5 other quinolone compounds (nalidixic and <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acids,</b> norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) against 416 strains of Proteae spp. isolated from urine specimens of hospitalized patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI). Ciprofloxacin was the most active agent. Norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin were similarly active against Proteus strains (MIC 90 = 0. 39 microgram/ml). Against Providencia spp. pefloxacin and norfloxacin showed similar activity (MIC 90 = 3. 12 micrograms/ml). There is minimal discrepancy between minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations exhibited by the quinolones for all urinary tract pathogens tested. Our in vitro studies indicate that pefloxacin is an active antimicrobial agent and suggest that it will prove useful in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to nalidixic acid-resistant Proteae spp...|$|R
40|$|The direct viable count method first {{described}} by Kogure et al. (Can. J. Microbiol. 25 : 415 - 420, 1979) was improved {{by using an}} antibiotic cocktail instead of nalidixic acid alone. We screened 100 marine isolates from two coastal areas for their sensitivities to five replication-inhibiting antibiotics, including four quinolones (nalidixic, piromidic, and <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acids</b> and ciprofloxacin) and one (beta) -lactam (cephalexin). It was shown that growth inhibition of all isolates cannot be readily achieved by using a single antibiotic. Inhibition was much more efficient when all the antibiotics were combined, {{making it possible to}} use this method with natural communities. In combination, the concentration of each antibiotic could be lowered and the incubation time could be increased without any growth. Under such conditions, it was shown that the fraction of substrate-responsive cells within natural marine communities is much greater (1 to 2 orders of magnitude) than those reported by traditional procedures. Furthermore, the new procedure made substrate-responsive cells more clearly distinguishable. These improvements resulted in an increased incubation time and were related to metabolic expression of slow-growing cells and/or to the recovery of starved cells. The increased fraction of viable cells within marine communities has ecological implications on the metabolic role of nonculturable cells...|$|R

The activity of DL- 8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid</b> and nalidixic acid.

Of the 73 patients with fUTI, those receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis were more likely to harbor fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens (P< 0. 001). E. coli was the most common pathogen in both groups.

40|$|Background: Fluoroquinolones are an {{important}} class of antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} urinary tract infections that have axcellent activity against Escherichia coli, one of the most frequently encountered pathogens. Several European studies have reported an increase of resistance to quinolones among uropathogenic E. coli. We conducted this study to update our knowledge on this evolution. Materials and methods: We evaluated the resistance phenotype of 203 clinical strains of E. coli collected from urine specimens. The following antimicrobial agents were tested: ampicillin, amoxiciclin-clavulanate, piperacillintazobactam, cefamandole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid,</b> norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin. Disk diffusion tests were carried out as suggested by the CLSI (2006); strains were assigned to the susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate and resistant) interpreting results according to the established breakpoints. Results: Resistance to quinolones (<b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid,</b> norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was about of 45 % and resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 57. 1 % and 55. 2 %, respectively. Resistance rates less than 5 % was found for cefepime, amikacin and imipenem. Conclusions: This study confirms the evolution through resistance to quinolones of uropathogenic E. coli isolates. The selective pressure exerted by fluoroquinolones may influence this evolution. Therapeutic alternatives, surveillance, and restriction of fluoroquinolones use are needed to control this spread of resistance...|$|E

AM- 715 had higher antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than did gentamicin. Most nalidixic acid-resistant bacteria were susceptible to AM- 715, and cross-resistance was not observed between AM- 715 and various antibiotics. The minimal concentration of AM- 715 required to inhibit the growth of 75 % {{of the total number of}} clinical isolates was as follows: Escherichia coli, 0. 04 μg/ml; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0. 1 μg/ml; Serratia marcescens, 0. 88 μg/ml; Enterobacter spp., 0. 076 μg/ml; Staphylococcus aureus, 1. 10 μg/ml; P. aeruginosa, 0. 38 μg/ml; and nalidixic acid-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria, 0. 62 μg/ml. AM- 715 at minimal inhibitory concentrations or at slightly higher concentrations had bactericidal activity against various species of bacteria. The effect of inoculum sizes on minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of AM- 715 against gram-negative bacteria was smaller than on those of <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid</b> and nalidixic acid. The dose-response curve of AM- 715 indicated a steep gradient, and the 50 % inhibited doses of AM- 715 were 0. 014 μg/ml against E. coli ML 4707 and 0. 21 μg/ml against P. aeruginosa NC- 5...|$|E
40|$|AT- 2266 (1 -ethyl- 6 -fluoro- 1, 4 -dihydro- 4 -oxo- 7 -(1 -piperazinyl) - 1, 8 -naphthyridine- 3 -carboxylic acid) showed marked {{activity}} in vivo when administered orally to mice bearing systemic, pulmonary, dermal, or urinary tract infections due to variety of organisms. The activity of AT- 2266 was uniformly {{higher than those}} of norfloxacin, <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid,</b> and nalidixic acid against all of the infections. The activity of AT- 2266 administered orally was almost comparable to that of gentamicin administered subcutaneously against urinary tract infections due to gram-negative organisms but was generally lower against other infections. AT- 2266 exhibited significant activity against infections due to gentamicin-resistant and nalidixic acid-resistant organisms...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{cases of}} {{complicated}} urinary tract infections after transurethral procedures {{were treated with}} <b>pipemidic</b> <b>acid</b> (PPA) at a daily dose of 1. 5 g for 14 to 60 days. The results obtained were excellent in 21, good in 8 and poor in 11 cases. Causative organisms disappeared in 28 cases, changed in 11 cases and persisted in 1 case. As for side effects of PPA, nausea was observed in 2 cases and anorexia in 5 cases. General hematologic, hepatic and renal-function tests were performed {{before and after the}} administration, and no abnormalities were found. PPA was thought to be an excellent therapeutic for complicated urinary tract infections...|$|E
