5|$|A Company moved south, shaking {{out into}} an open {{formation}} across a frontage of , with 2 <b>Platoon</b> {{on the right and}} 3 <b>Platoon</b> on the left, while 1 <b>Platoon</b> was in depth. Already in the dense vegetation, 2 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Graham Ackland—had only advanced 150metres when a sniper was spotted in a tree and was subsequently shot by the <b>platoon</b> sergeant. Almost simultaneously, 3 <b>Platoon</b> was engaged with small arms fire, while behind them the company headquarters was engaged by more snipers. 2 <b>Platoon</b> assaulted straight into the main Viet Cong position with grenades and machine-guns. Breaking-in they moved forward, killing a number of Viet Cong in their weapon pits but suffering six casualties in less than a minute, with a third of the lead <b>platoon</b> falling wounded in the initial volleys. Pinned down and in trouble, Ackland realised that he was facing a sizable and well dug-in force and he attempted to move his sections into an all-round defensive perimeter in order to defend against any counter-attack; the Viet Cong did not attack however and instead remained in their pits. In an attempt to relieve 2 <b>Platoon,</b> O'Brien manoeuvred 1 and 3 Platoons, while requesting B Company support his right flank as soon as they arrived at the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 <b>Platoon</b> of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 <b>Platoon,</b> delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the <b>platoon</b> in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the plywood landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank <b>platoon</b> and 10 <b>Platoon</b> the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E

Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell into the water and drowned, becoming the first casualty of the operation.

There are many variations of the details of the concept such as: the goals of <b>platooning,</b> how it is implemented, mix of vehicles, the requirements on infrastructure, what is automated (longitudinal and lateral control) and to what level.

5|$|Concentrating at Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in {{the early}} months of 1943 the 2/33rd was reorganised as part of the 7th Division's {{conversion}} to the jungle divisional establishment. As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier <b>platoon,</b> receiving in its place a machine gun <b>platoon</b> equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft <b>platoon</b> was re-roled as a tank-attack <b>platoon</b> and the transport <b>platoon</b> was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received a batch of around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July it was ready to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua–Lae campaign.|$|E

5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 <b>Platoon</b> was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to come forward to provide assistance, while the <b>platoon</b> sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 <b>Platoon</b> forward to reinforce 5 <b>Platoon,</b> and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his <b>platoon.</b> Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 <b>Platoon</b> headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 <b>Platoon.</b> Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire.

Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st <b>Platoon</b> Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st <b>Platoon</b> sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared.

40|$|Truck <b>platooning</b> {{for which}} {{multiple}} trucks follow at {{a short distance}} is considered a near-Term truck automation opportunity, {{with the potential to}} reduce fuel consumption.

The EcoTwin consortium successfully demonstrated a two truck <b>platooning</b> system with trucks following at 20 meters distance at the public road, in which the driver is the backup. The ambition of the consortium is to increase the truck automation and to reduce the following distance, which requires a new fail-operational truck <b>platooning</b> architecture.

40|$|Abstract — Vehicle <b>platooning</b> is {{important}} for heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers, due to the reduced aerodynamic drag for the follower vehicles, which gives an overall lower fuel consumption. Heavy-duty vehicle drivers are aware this fact and sometimes drive close to other heavy-duty vehicles. However, it is not currently well known how many vehicles are actually driving in such spontaneous <b>platoons</b> today. This paper studies the <b>platooning</b> rate of 1, 800 heavy-duty vehicles by analyzing sparse vehicle position data from a region in Europe during one day. Map-matching and path-inference algorithms are used to determine which paths the vehicles took. The spontaneous <b>platooning</b> rate {{is found to be}} 1. 2 %, which corresponds to a total fuel saving of 0. 07 % compared to if none of the vehicles were <b>platooning.</b> Furthermore, we introduce several virtual coordination schemes. We show that coordinations can increase the <b>platooning</b> rate and fuel saving with a factor of ten with minor adjustments from the current travel schedule. The <b>platooning</b> rate and fuel savings can be significantly greater if higher flexibility is allowed. I...|$|R

Despite suffering many casualties the Chinese continued their attack, closing in and attacking the Australians with hand grenades. The Australians also suffered numerous casualties, with more than half the <b>platoon</b> killed or wounded, including all three Bren gunners.
