5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vanity of a man, {{neglecting}} his family, is {{a critique}} of historic men in feudal Japanese culture.

40|$|We {{report that}} 2 behaviors, {{stepping}} and shortening, are modified by associative {{learning in the}} leech, Hirudo medi-chalk.

5000|$|Morphisms of groupoids come in more kinds {{than those}} of groups: we have, for example, fibrations, {{covering}} morphisms, universal morphisms, and quotient morphisms. Thus a subgroup H of a group G yields an action <b>of</b> G on <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> cosets of H in G and hence a covering morphism p from, say, K to G, where K is a groupoid with vertex groups isomorphic to H. In this way, <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group G can be [...] "lifted" [...] to <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groupoid K, {{and this is a}} useful way of obtaining information about <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subgroup H.
