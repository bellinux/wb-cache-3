5|$|Following the {{shooting}} of two <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> Ferguson {{and in response to}} BLM, the hashtag #BlueLivesMatter was created by supporters of the police. Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police officer movement in the United States. It expanded after the killings of American police officers.|$|E
5|$|No <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. {{went out}} on strike until July 1974, when some Baltimore police, {{estimated}} at 15% to 50% of the force, refused to report for work for several days as a demonstration of support for other striking municipal unions.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{widespread}} power outages along the Florida Panhandle, electrical companies enlisted extra workers to repair downed lines. Officials {{had put a}} curfew in place for Tallahassee due to power outages created by the hurricane, and the curfew was lifted on November24 after power was gradually restored and roads were cleared of debris. <b>Police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> the city arrested 20people for violating curfew or creating unrest.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, an Osijek court convicted Milan Marinković of {{war crimes}} and sentenced him to 3 ½ {{years in prison for}} mistreating two {{captured}} Croatian <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> <b>In</b> 2014, Marinković's sentence was reduced to three years on appeal. Four other men were indicted in relation to the officers' mistreatment, but all four live outside Croatia, and are not subject to prosecution by the Croatian judiciary.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

5|$|Kyle and Sarah are apprehended {{by police}} after another {{encounter}} with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator repairs his body and attacks the police station, killing many <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> his attempt to locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape, steal another car and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move. Kyle admits {{that he has been}} in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her, and they have sex.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{is carried out}} by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The National Police Service (NPS) combats general crime, maintains public order and supports the operations of other law enforcement agencies. NPS fields 27,000 <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> its local and national sections. The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie—a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are {{the responsibility of the}} State Agency for National Security, established in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> accessing {{information about the}} {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E

5|$|Zlín region {{politicians}} {{announced they}} would call {{for the establishment of}} a local tactical team. Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented that the police were already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas. This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> large towns.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E

5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> Black and Blue, Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One That Got Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker {{when he played}} Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923, {{the unit}} was renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler"). The unit was solely {{responsible}} for Hitler's protection. On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, {{took part in the}} Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to seize control of the city in a coup d'état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly crushed by the local police and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Shaoguan {{authorities}} {{moved the}} Uyghur workers to temporary accommodation, {{and the workers}} were transferred on 7 July to another facility belonging to Early Light, 30km away in Baitu town. The Baitu factory is now reported to be an Uyghur enclave, with, sporting facilities, canteen serving Xinjiang food, a round-the-clock staff clinic, and plain-clothed <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> their midst. According to the South China Morning Post, the Kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with colleagues in their previous location because of the language barrier – a local shop worker estimated that less than one in three spoke Mandarin. Two months on, the South China Morning Post found few {{willing to talk about}} the events of the fateful night. The authorities' claims that 50 Uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the violence are contested by Uyghur workers.|$|E
5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with {{the welfare of the}} populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E
5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E
