5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E

5|$|A crash-development {{program began}} after the July 1941 German night bombing of Moscow to field a night fighter with heavy {{armament}} and long endurance. Only an aircraft currently in production {{could be used}} to satisfy the extremely tight deadline and the Pe-2 was selected for modification by the State Commissariat for Defence (—NKO) as the fastest twin-engined aircraft in service. The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft's fuel, armament and radio systems, but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> manufacturer's trials the following day.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a tumultuous}} {{pre-season}} {{in which they}} went {{through a period of}} administration and were saved by late investment, Manor Marussia arrived in Melbourne with a car that had <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> mandatory crash tests, but had completed no testing. Formula Renault 3.5 Series drivers Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi were announced as their drivers, with Merhi signed on a one-race deal. However, the team did not participate in any practice sessions and subsequently failed to set a qualifying time, leaving the field at eighteen cars for the race.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E

5|$|The circuit <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> flag to a partner, who then moved on to the next obstacle. The team continued to alternate in this manner until they had completed the course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} process continued {{throughout the}} production run, {{though they were}} not immediately implemented in the production line, but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype for evaluation. This aircraft first flew on 29 October 1940 and was a significant improvement over the I-200s then in production. It <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in the production line from the 101st I-200. These were designated as the MiG-3 on 9 December, although the first production MiG-3 was not completed until 20 December 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{money raised}} for the Victory Loan {{campaign}} on If Day was $3.2million, {{which was the}} city's largest single-day total. Winnipeg <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> $24million Victory Loan quota on 24 February, {{largely because of the}} effects of If Day. The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60million, well above its target quota of $45million. The campaign raised approximately $2billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day was {{considered one of the most}} successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive. Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February.|$|E
5|$|The {{new regime}} <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> {{own version of}} Legea Rurală, thus {{effectively}} imposing land reform, as well as {{putting an end to}} corvées. This was accomplished through discussions in August 1864 by the newly established Council of State, where the law was advanced by, among others, Kogălniceanu, Bolintineanu, George D. Vernescu, Gheorghe Apostoleanu and Alexandru Papadopol-Callimachi. Kogălniceanu's other measures as minister included: the establishment of Bucharest University, the introduction of identity papers, the establishment of a national police corps (comprising Dorobanți units), the unification of Border Police.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile <b>passed</b> <b>its</b> state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
