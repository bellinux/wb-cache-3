40|$|We {{propose a}} silicon ring-based optical {{modulation}} method to perform chirp-free optical modulations. In this scheme, we locate {{the light to}} be modulated at the resonance of the ring and tune the coupling coefficient between the ring and the straight waveguide by using a <b>push-pull</b> <b>coupling</b> structure. The chirp-free phase modulation {{can be achieved by}} varying the coupling coefficient in a large range, which can modify the coupling condition of the ring such that the input light experiences an abrupt phase shift of pi at the output. If the coupling coefficient is adjusted in a small range such that the coupling condition of the ring is kept unchanged, only the intensity of the light will be modulated. This leads to chirp-free intensity modulation. Our simulations performed at 10 Gbits/s confirm the feasibility of the proposal.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the design, {{construction}} and experimental evaluation of a thermoacoustic electricity generator prototype with a push-pull linear alternator. The <b>push-pull</b> <b>coupling</b> offers a solution to run the looped-tube thermoacoustic engine at high acoustic impedance using one alternator. The novel configuration of the engine consists of two identical half-wavelength stages with an alternator connected between them. A simulation was carried out using the DeltaEC programme. The modelling started by investigating the required acoustic field for the alternator. The engine modelling has been done as half of the engine which is one-stage, because the DeltaEC shooting method showed that it was unable to run two identical stages. The engine is 16. 02 m long and run at 55. 1 Hz. The simulation showed {{that it is possible}} to produce more than 133 W of electricity at a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 23 % while using helium pressurized at 28 bar. In practice, the engine failed to self-start. After exciting it to run by an external pulse, an electric power of 48. 6 W was generated with a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 2. 7 %. The high heat leak detected was reduced by installing an insulating gasket between the ambient heat exchanger and regenerator holder, which encouraged the electricity generation to increase. The engine became self-starting when the regenerator thickness was reduced from 73 mm to 71. 8 mm. The maximum generated electric power was 73. 3 W at 3. 33 % thermal-to-electric efficiency at a heating power of 2200 W, and a maximum efficiency of 3. 6 % was achieved at 71. 9 W electric power at a heating power of 2000 W. The success of the two-stage engine with a push-pull linear alternator encouraged modelling and design of a four-stage engine with two push-pull linear alternators able to generate up to 269 W of electricity, theoretically...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} are energy poor {{and should be}} designed to minimise the power required to propel them throughout their mission. The University of Southampton’s School of Engineering Sciences is {{actively involved in the}} development of improved designs for aerial and maritime autonomous vehicles. The ability to adapt or ‘morph’ their shape in-flight offers an opportunity to extend mission range/duration and improve agility. The practical implementation of such systems at small scale requires detailed consideration of the number, mass and power requirements of the individual actuation elements. Three approaches for minimising actuation requirements are considered. The first uses a combination of <b>push-pull</b> actuators <b>coupled</b> with a snap-through composite lay-up to achieve alterations in shape. It is proposed that such a system could be applied to the trailing edge of an autonomous underwater glider wing instead of the more usual servo operated trailing edge flap. The anisotropy achieved through use of different composite ply orientations and stacking {{can also be used to}} generate bend-twist coupling such that fluid dynamic loads induce ‘passive’ shape adaptation. The third approach uses a detailed understanding of the structural response of buckled elements to applied control moments to deform a complete wing. At this stage of the research no definitive conclusions have been drawn other than that all three approaches show sufficient promise and can now be applied to one of the autonomous vehicles...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the electrical design and first operational {{results of a}} 5 Megawatt feedback controlled amplifier system designed to drive a 300 uH saddle coil set on the ``HBT-EP`` tokamak. It {{will be used to}} develop various plasma feedback techniques to control and inhibit the onset of plasma disruptions that are observed in high ``B`` plasmas. To provide a well characterized system, a high fidelity, high power closed loop amplifier system has been refurbished from the Los Alamos ``ZT-P`` equilibrium feedback system. In it`s configuration developed for the Columbia HBT-EP tokamak, any desired waveform may be generated within a I 100 ampere and 16 kV peak to peak dynamic range. An energy storage capacitor bank presently limits the effective full power pulse width to 10 mS. The full power bandwidth driving the saddle coil set is {approximately} 12 kHz, with bandwidth at reduced powers exceeding 30 kHz. The system is designed similar to a grounded cathode, <b>push-pull,</b> transformer <b>coupled,</b> tube type amplifier system. `Me push pull amplifier consists of 6 each Machlett ML 8618 magnetically beamed triodes, 3 on each end of the (center tapped) coupling transformer. The transformer has. I volt-seconds of core and a 1 : 1 turns ratio. The transformer is specially designed for high power, low leakage inductance, and high bandwidth. Each array of ML 8618 `s is (grid) driven with a fiber optic controlled hotdeck with a 3 CXI 0, 000 A 7 (triode) output. To linearize the ML 8618 grid drive, a minor feedback loop in the hotdeck is utilized. Overall system response is controlled by active feedback of the saddle coil current, derived from a coaxial current viewing resistor. The detailed electrical design of the power amplifier, transformer, and feedback system will be provided in addition to recent HBT-EP operational results...|$|R
