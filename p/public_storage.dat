At first, <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> paid cash to acquire property and build a self-storage facility, then used the property's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit. <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> Inc. also earned revenues from a portion of each deal that was made.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with <b>Public</b> <b>Storage.</b> For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with <b>Public</b> <b>Storage.</b> An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by <b>Public</b> <b>Storage.</b> Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

In 1995, <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> and its subsidiaries were merged with its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., and re-structured as a single REIT called <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> Inc.

With <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services, multiple subscribers can collaboratively work and share outsourced data without the concerns of data consistency, availability and reliability. Since, <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services are provisioned by an untrusted cloud service provider that lies beyond the federated domain of subscribers, there is a great risk of privacy infringement when confidential data is outsourced to such services. Besides this, malicious subscribers can collude with cloud service provider to compromise privacy of the outsourced data along with the personal information of subscribers.

40|$|Part 4 : Privacy and Transparency in the Age of Cloud ComputingInternational audiencePublic {{cloud storage}} {{services}} are gaining in popularity and several commercial actors are offering their services for users, however, not {{always with the}} security and privacy of their users as the primary design goal. This paper investigates side channels in <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services that allow the service provider, {{and in some cases}} users of the same service, to learn who has stored a given file and to profile users’ usage of the service. These side channels are present in several <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services that are marketed as secure and privacy-friendly. Our conclusions are that cross-user deduplication should be disabled by default and that <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services need to be designed to provide unlinkability of users and data, even if the data is encrypted by users before storing it in the cloud...|$|R

By the mid-1980s, <b>Public</b> <b>Storage</b> was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans.

This technology enables ubiquitous information management and thus people can access all their data from any place and at any time.

Nowadays, several free-access <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services make it possible for users to have a free backup of their assets and to manage and share them, representing a low-cost opportunity for Small and Medium Companies (SME). However, the adoption of cloud storage involves data outsourcing, so a user does not have the guarantee about the way her data will be processed and protected. Therefore, it seems necessary to endow <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> with a set of means to protect users' confidentiality and privacy, to assess data integrity and to guarantee a proper backup of information assets.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{commodity}} stocks, {{their role in}} price determination for storable commodities, and past efforts of international stockholding arrangements with economic provisions in stabilising world prices. Low stocks to use ratios of recent years were {{one of a number}} of contributory factors to the grain price spike in 2007 - 08, the paper finds. However, the experience with past international commodity agreements (ICAs) with price band provisions and stockholding obligations suggests that they had only limited success in reducing the volatility of the prices they set out to stabilise, as well as being prone to many other operational problems. The paper also suggests that as a possible response to apparently inadequate private <b>storage,</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>storage</b> would be costly, ineffective in countering price spikes once stocks are fully exhausted, and would crowd out private storage.

Although the TV show Storage Wars created increased interest in the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cloud {{computing}} {{is the use}} of Internet for {{the tasks}} performed on the local computer, with the hardware and software demands maintained elsewhere. It represents a different way to architect and remotely manage various computing resources. Cloud is widely used everywhere owing to its convenience, be it in simple data analytic program or composite web or mobile applications. Cloud computing is being driven by many which includes Amazon, Google and Yahoo as well as traditional vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Intel. The data should be available in the cloud for it to be accessed by many users. There are four main types of cloud storage- Multi Cloud Storage or distributed cloud <b>storage,</b> <b>Public</b> Cloud <b>Storage,</b> Private Cloud Storage, Mobile Cloud Storage. Distributed cloud is a combination of public and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a <b>public</b> cloud <b>storage</b> provider. Provable data possession (PDP) is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data stored in storage outsourcing.
