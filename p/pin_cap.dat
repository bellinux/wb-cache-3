40|$|SummaryTransgenic {{expression}} of activated AKT 1 in the murine prostate induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) {{that does not}} progress to invasive prostate cancer (CaP). In luminal epithelial cells of Akt-driven PIN, we show the concomitant induction of p 27 Kip 1 and senescence. Genetic ablation of p 27 Kip 1 led to downregulation of senescence markers and progression to cancer. In humans, p 27 Kip 1 and senescence markers were elevated in PIN not associated with CaP but were decreased or absent, respectively, in cancer-associated <b>PIN</b> and in <b>CaP.</b> Importantly, p 27 Kip 1 upregulation in mouse and human in situ lesions did not depend upon mTOR or Akt activation but was instead specifically associated with alterations in cell polarity, architecture, and adhesion molecules. These data suggest that a p 27 Kip 1 -driven checkpoint limits progression of <b>PIN</b> to <b>CaP...</b>|$|R
50|$|The bayonet {{light bulb}} mount is the {{standard}} fitting in many {{former members of the}} British Empire including the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa (although not Canada, which primarily uses Edison screw sockets along with the United States and Mexico). The standard size is B22d-2, often referred to in the context of lighting as simply BC. Older installations in some other countries, including France and Greece use this base. First developed by St. George Lane Fox-Pitt in the UK and improved upon by the Brush Electric Company from the late 1870s onward, standard bulbs have two pins {{on opposite sides of the}} cap; however, some specialized bulbs have three <b>pins</b> (<b>cap</b> designation B22d-3) to prevent use in domestic light fittings. Examples of three-pin bulbs are found in mercury street lamps and fireglow bulbs in some older models of electric radiative heater. Older railway carriages in the UK also made use of a 3 pin bulb base to discourage theft. Bayonet cap bulbs are also very common worldwide in applications where vibration may loosen screw-mount bulbs, such as automotive lighting and other small , and in many flashlights. In many other countries the Edison screw (E) base is used for lighting.|$|R

50|$|The safety & arming {{arrangements}} in artillery fuzes are critical features {{to prevent the}} fuze functioning until required, no matter how harsh its transport and handling. These arrangements use the forces created by the gun or howitzer firing - high acceleration (or ‘shock of firing’) and rotation (caused by the rifling in the gun or howitzer barrel) - to release the safety features and arm the fuze. Some older types of fuze also had safety features such as <b>pins</b> or <b>caps</b> removed by the user before loading the shell into the breach. Defective fuzes can function while the shell is in the barrel - a 'bore premature', or further along the trajectory.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, Hitler {{ordered the}} {{formation}} of a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (protection command). It was formed by Julius Schreck and included old Stoßtrupp members, Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The only insignia was the swastika armband, usually homemade, except for the handful of men constituting the Stosstrupp's successor, the Schutzkommando, who continued the use of the Totenkopf <b>pinned</b> to <b>cap</b> or collar. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national level. It was renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (storm squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (protection squadron), abbreviated to SS (on 9 November). In the following year adopted its first recognizable rank insignia system which was used mainly by senior SS personnel at major rallies, with the rank and file of the SS, {{like the rest of the}} SA, still wearing a variety of brown shirts or paramilitary uniforms with no recognizable insignia.|$|R
5000|$|The Welsh leek badge (now {{believed}} to be a [...] "St. Mary's Leek", or Dandelion) goes back to the Middle Ages. In 633 AD the Welsh were sorely pressed by the invading Saxons. They met at the Battle of Heathfield, where there was a field filled with leeks. To distinguish themselves from the enemy, the Welsh wore the leeks in their hats—and subsequently gained a great victory over their enemies. To commemorate the victory they won, the Welsh soldiers were given the right to wear a leek <b>pinned</b> to their <b>caps</b> on March 1, the feast of their national patron saint, St. David.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as {{markers of}} tumor {{progression}} in prostate cancer (CaP) {{is complex and}} poorly understood. Using computerized image analysis, the differential expression of interstitial collagenase (MMP- 1), gelatinase B (MMP- 9), matrilysin- 1 (MMP- 7) and the membrane-type 1 -MMP (MT 1 -MMP) in the epithelium and stroma of human prostate neoplastic tissues were investigated. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques, 38 paraffin-embedded prostatic samples were analyzed and CaP was compared with prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and its normal adjacent prostate (NAP) counterpart. The association of MMP protein and mRNA expression with Gleason histological tumor grade and TNM clinical stage was also determined. In most prostatectomy specimens examined, detectable amounts of MMP- 1, MT 1 -MMP, MMP- 7 and MMP- 9 proteins and MT 1 -MMP and MMP- 9 mRNA {{were found in the}} epithelial and stromal components of <b>CaP,</b> <b>PIN</b> and NAP. MMP expression was significantly stronger in the epithelium than in the stroma (p < 0. 01). In the epithelium of normal and preneoplastic prostate tissue, MMP- 1, MMP- 9 and MT 1 -MMP were preferentially expressed in secretory luminal cells; conversely, MMP- 7 was concentrated in basal cells. Epithelial and stromal expressions of MMPs differed in normal, preneoplastic and CaP tissues. Whereas MMP- 1 was overexpressed in NAP epithelial glands and progressively decreased from <b>PIN</b> to <b>CaP,</b> MMP- 7, MMP- 9 and MT 1 -MMP were more strongly expressed in <b>CaP</b> than in <b>PIN</b> and NAP tissue. The MMPs investigated reached their highest levels in prostate tumors with high Gleason scores. The differential MMP expression in epithelial and stromal prostate tissue supports the previous hypothesis that MMPs may be autocrine and paracrine mediators of the stroma-epithelial interaction, an event that plays a critical role in regulating normal and abnormal prostate growth. MMP gene regulation changes during the early stage of prostate cancer. Differential expression of MMP components in CaP may reflect the malignant phenotype and more aggressive tumor behavior...|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} {{light is}} {{a device that}} produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It {{is the most common}} form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal <b>pins,</b> two metal <b>caps</b> or a bayonet cap.|$|R

50|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time that}} the needle-fire system was developed, a pin-fire method was also developed. This method originally used a paper cartridge with a primer cap within a brass base, which quickly evolved into an all-brass cartridge. From the side, a stout pin was inserted into the cartridge above the cap. The gun’s hammer pushed the <b>pin</b> into the <b>cap</b> and set off the primer. A revolver using this method had a cylinder with chambers that were bored completely through with a slight channel where the pin rested. This type of cylinder was first patented in France in 1854. Loading these revolvers was accomplished by moving a loading gate that was mounted behind the cylinder. To remove the spent cartridges, a push-rod was used to back the cartridges out of the cylinder through the loading gate.|$|R

5000|$|In 1915, {{industries}} of the German Empire designed and began {{production of the}} original Stielhandgranate, appropriately named Model 1915. The Model 15 Stielhandgranate utilized a priming system, unlike many others of the time. Most grenades of the period used the percussion <b>cap</b> <b>pin,</b> a fuse system quite different {{to that of the}} Stielhandgranate. The easily recognizable [...] "potato masher" [...] shape is a result of a number of different styles and choices of the design. The grenade mounted a charge head within a steel sheet cylinder atop a long hollow wooden handle. Internally, the explosive filler - initially ammonal but later approximately 170 g of trinitrotoluene filling) was connected to a detonator, and a pull cord ran from the detonator {{down the length of the}} hollow handle, emerging from the base. To use, a soldier would simply pull the string downwards, dragging a rough steel rod through the igniter within the fuse. The rod's abrasive contact would cause sparks and a flame to light from within, setting the fuse burning. This fuse took approximately four and a half seconds to reach the detonator before exploding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that an {{electric}} current in a negative corona for pin-to-plane configuration {{in a wide range}} of parameters has a form of periodic peaks, which are called Trichel pulses. Recently, authors reported about development of 3 -D axially symmetric model intended for numerical simulations of Trichel pulses. In this paper authors present results of numerical simulations of a long train of pulses for <b>pin</b> with hemi-spherical <b>cap</b> to plane anode configuration in ambient air at atmospheric pressure. These calculations provide information about dynamics of Trichel pulse starting from step-wise voltage applying. Calculations clearly demonstrate that regular current oscillations are established after 4 - 5 pulses. Space-time evolution of electric field and charged species densities within one cycle of regular oscillations is described in detail. In particular, distributions of specific components of current density over the cathode and anode surfaces were found in dependence on time. Comparison is made with experimentally available data. In contrast to simplified 1. 5 -D model predicting two-peak shape of Trichel pulse, the exact 3 -D model predicts single-peaked pulses when ion induced secondary emission processes are included, and photo-emission is neglected. On the anode surface, radial profiles of electric field and ion and electron current components were calculated. Variations of individual current pulse amplitude and shape with discharge voltage growth are studied, too. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the suitability of}} selected substrates for mushroom production. Ten different substrates namely water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), maize cobs (Zea mays), coconut fibre (Cocos nucifera), finger millet straw (Seteria microcheata), banana fibre (Musa sp.), sawdust (Eucalyptus sp.), rice straw (Oryza sativa) bean straw (Phaseolus vulgaris) and wheat straw (Tritichum aestivum) were tested for their suitability in mushroom production. Plastic bags were filled with 250 g of substrate and arranged in a randomized complete block design. The substrates had a significant (p≤ 0. 05) effect on days to <b>pinning,</b> number of <b>caps</b> and biological efficiency. Compared to the control, which pinned at 28 days, maize cobs, sawdust and coconut fiber had short pinning durations of 19, 22 and 23 days, respectively. With the exception of sawdust, water hyacinth and maize cobs, {{the rest of the}} organic substrates significantly increased the marketable caps of the oyster mushroom. The straws, namely, bean, rice, finger millet and wheat had the highest biological efficiency in decreasing order of 106, 92, 85 and 77 %, respectively. Stipe length was longest in oyster mushroom grown on bean straw, followed by finger millet straw, maize cobs, banana fiber and shortest in sawdust. Mushroom yield was, 80, 78, 76, 73 and 68 %, higher in bean straw, rice straw, millet straw, wheat straw and banana fibre treatment compared to the control. Mushroom yields on sawdust were 60 % lower than the control. In descending order of suitability bean, rice, finger millet and wheat straws can be recommended for oyster mushroom production...|$|R
40|$|We have {{employed}} ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) {{to study the}} energy positions in the conduction band of AlxGa 1 – xAs. Epilayers of undoped AlxGa 1 – xAs were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on conductive GaAs substrates. The Al composition x took on values of 0, 0. 11, 0. 19, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 80 and 1 so that the material was examined in both the direct and indirect band gap regime. The AlxGa 1 – xAs layer thickness was varied from 100 to 500 Å to ensure probing of bulk energy levels. Different capping layers and surface treatments were explored to prevent surface oxidation and examine Fermi level <b>pinning</b> at the <b>cap</b> layer/AlxGa 1 – xAs interface. All samples were metallized ex situ with a 100 Å Au layer so that the final BEEM structure is of the form Au/capping layer/AlxGa 1 – xAs/bulk GaAs. Notably we have measured the Schottky barrier height for Au on AlxGa 1 – xAs. We have also probed the higher lying band edges such as the X point at low Al concentrations and the L point at high Al concentrations. Variations of these critical energy positions with Al composition x were mapped out in detail and compared with findings from other studies. Local variations of these energy positions were also examined and found {{to be on the}} order of 30 – 50 meV.

There is, indeed, perhaps, {{no greater}} sign of innate and real vulgarity of mind or {{defective}} education than the want {{of power to}} understand the universality of the ideal truth; the absence of sympathy with the colossal grasp of those intellects, which have in them so much of divine, that nothing is small to them, and nothing large; but with equal and unoffended vision they take in {{the sum of the}} world,--Straw Street and the seventh heavens,--in the same instant. A certain portion of this divine spirit is visible even in the lower examples of all the true men; it is, indeed, perhaps, the clearest test of their belonging to the true and great group, that they are continually touching what to the multitude appear vulgarities. The higher a man stands, the more the word [...] "vulgar" [...] becomes unintelligible to him. Vulgar? what, that poor farmer's girl of William Hunt's, bred in the stable, putting on her Sunday gown, and <b>pinning</b> her best <b>cap</b> out of the green and red pin-cushion!

It is only when the minor painter takes them on his easel, that they become things for the universe to be ashamed of.|$|R
