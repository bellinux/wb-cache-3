40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{presents}} a generic theory for the modelling of complex {{systems such as}} buildings, plants, infrastructures, organizations, knowledge bases or projects. It {{can be used for}} the description of static and dynamic systems, objects and processes. It applies to systems on any level of complexity, including simple parts, for any phase of a system lifecycle. Because of its generic approach, the theory supports the integrated modelling of different kinds of systems. It covers a modular definition and representation of systems and connectivity networks, supports parametric technology, and enables zero-redundant product/process specifications. The presented theory emerged during the 1980 -ies, influenced several standards for Product Data Technology, and has been implemented, used and improved {{for a wide variety of}} <b>product-types,</b> ranging from Buildings t...|$|R
40|$|Inventory {{inaccuracy}} often {{exists in}} manufacturing systems, which has great {{negative impact on}} the performance of production control, e. g. very high work-in-process holding cost or backlog penalty. To hedge against inventory inaccuracy, the robust production control problems will be investigated for a multiple machines and multiple <b>product-types</b> manufacturing system with uncertain production capacity. The objective of our problem is to minimise the average production cost. To solve this problem, a robust production control policy is developed, which is insensitive to the inventory record errors, and whose robustness is better than the traditional hedging point policy for optimal production control. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed robust production control policy against inventory inaccuracy. Based on the experimental results, the conditions of applying the proposed policy are also obtained. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

30|$|Careful {{composition}} of a store’s atmosphere, {{according to a}} stream of literature in consumer research, can tip the balance between success and failure for a business (Turley and Milliman 2000). Experimental investigation of optimal store atmospherics has a long history: 50  years ago Smith and Curnow ran a field experiment manipulating the volume of music in a supermarket (Smith and Curnow 1966). A large menu of controllable atmospheric variables (e.g., music, lighting, wall color, ambient scent) each of which can take on innumerable values (e.g., chocolate scent, citrus scent, sea breeze scent), and a continuously regenerating array of <b>product-types</b> on which to test the effects has allowed {{the development of a}} large experimental literature in store atmospherics. With such a wealth of potential stimuli—Turley and Milliman list 57 different categories of atmospheric variable—there is always a new atmospheric effect to investigate, and replication studies are rare.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{imperative}} {{version of}} the Rewriting-calculus, a calculus based on pattern-matching, pattern-abstraction, and side-effects, which we call iRho. We formulate a static and a big-step call-by-value operational semantics of iRho. The operational semantics is deterministic, and immediately suggests how to build an interpreter for the calculus. The static semantics is given via a first-order type system based on a form of <b>product-types,</b> which can be assigned to terms-like structures (i. e., records). The calculus is a la Church, i. e., pattern-abstractions are decorated with the types of the free variables of the pattern. iRho is {{a good candidate for}} a core of a pattern-matching imperative language, where a (monomorphic) typed store can be safely manipulated and where fixed-points are built-in into the language itself. Properties such as determinism of the interpreter and subject-reduction are completely checked by a machine-assisted approach, using the Coq proof assistant. Progress and decidability of type-checking are proved by pen and paper...|$|R
40|$|Fragranced product {{chemical}} mixtures may {{be relevant}} for environmental health, but {{little is known}} about exposure. We analyzed results from an olfactory challenge with the synthetic musk fragrance 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8 -hexamethyl-cyclopento-γ- 2 -benzopyran (HHCB), and a questionnaire about attitudes toward chemical safety and use of fragranced products, in a sample of 140 white and 17 black twin pairs attending a festival in Ohio. Data for each product were analyzed using robust ordered logistic regressions with random intercepts for “twin pair” and “sharing address with twin”, and fixed effects for sex, age, education, and “ever being bothered by fragrances”. Due to the small number of black participants, models were restricted to white participants except when examining racial differences. Overall patterns of association were summarized across <b>product-types</b> through random-effects meta-analysis. Principal components analysis was used to summarize clustering of product use. The dominant axis of variability in fragranced product use was “more vs. less”, followed by a distinction between household cleaning products and personal care products. Overall, males used fragranced products less frequently than females (adjusted proportionate odds ratio 0. 55, 95 % confidence interval 0. 33, 0. 93). This disparity was driven by personal care products (0. 42, 95 % CI: 0. 19, 0. 96), rather than household cleaning products (0. 79, 95 % CI: 0. 49, 1. 25) and was particularly evident for body lotion (0. 12, 95 % CI: 0. 05, 0. 27). Overall usage differed by age (0. 64, 95 % CI: 0. 43, 0. 95) but only hand soap and shampoo products differed significantly. “Ever being bothered by fragrance” had no overall association (0. 92, 95 % CI: 0. 65, 1. 30) but was associated with laundry detergent use (0. 46, 95 % CI: 0. 23, 0. 93). Similarly, black vs. white differences on average were not significant (1. 34, 95 % CI: 0. 55, 3. 28) but there were apparent differences in use of shampoo (0. 01, 95 % CI: 0. 00, 0. 69), body lotion (4. 67, 95 % CI: 1. 18, 18. 47), and perfume (6. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 08, 35. 89). There was no overall association with thinking about product risks (0. 90, 95 % CI: 0. 79, 1. 02), nor with inability to smell HHCB (0. 84, 95 % CI: 0. 63, 1. 12).

30|$|Numerous recent {{equations}} {{and systems}} {{are closely related}} to <b>product-type</b> ones, which are solvable for the case of positive initial values (see, e.g., the equation in [12], which is a kind of perturbation of some <b>product-type</b> and the system in [18]; see also the related references therein). If the initial values are not positive, then there appear several problems. Thus, it is of some interest to describe the <b>product-type</b> systems with complex initial values which are solvable. A detailed study of the problem has been started recently by Stević et al. in [14, 15, 17, 21, 22] (some subclasses of the class of difference equations studied in [16] are also <b>product-type</b> ones). During the investigation we realized that the solvability of some <b>product-type</b> systems is preserved if some coefficients/multipliers are added. The first system of this type was studied in [14]. Based on this idea, quite recently in [22] {{it has been shown that}} the solvability of the system studied in [17] is preserved if two coefficients/multipliers are added. On the other hand, it can be seen that there are only several classes of <b>product-type</b> systems of difference equations which can be practically solved in closed form, due to the well-known fact that roots of the polynomials of degree d> 5 cannot be solved by radicals. Hence, it is of interest to find all the classes of practically solvable <b>product-type</b> systems of difference equations and present formulas for their solutions in terms of the initial values and parameters.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} fact {{connected to}} the investigation {{is that there are}} only several solvable <b>product-type</b> systems with two dependent variables due to the finite number of combinations of the sums of two delays which cannot exceed four.

30|$|From 1968 to 2005, experts {{more or less}} studied theoretic {{properties}} of only operators (2)–(5) and integral-type ones on spaces of analytic functions {{in terms of their}} symbols. The only <b>product-type</b> operator among (2)–(5) is the weighted composition operator. Since 2005, some experts started studying some other <b>product-type</b> operators. The first <b>product-type</b> operators different from weighted composition ones that attracted some attention were the products of composition and differentiation operators (see, e.g., [7, 11, 13, 26 – 29] and the references therein). Some generalizations of the products of composition and differentiation operators, containing iterated differentiation, have appeared soon after them (see [12, 30 – 33]). Around 2008, Li and Stević have initiated studying products of integral and composition operators, including in some cases the differentiation operator, on spaces of analytic functions on D (see, e.g., [34]), which have been considerably studied recently (see, e.g., [3, 35 – 40]). For some other results and related <b>product-type</b> operators, see, for example, [4 – 6, 35, 41 – 46].|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{equations}} and systems {{that we have}} studied recently, {{such as the ones}} in [17] and [23] (see also [13]), are obtained by adding constants to the right-hand sides of some <b>product-type</b> equations/systems or by taking the maximum of some constants and the right-hand sides of {{the equations}}/systems. This means that they are related to the <b>product-type</b> ones, which are usually some kind of boundary cases. The case of positive initial values and multipliers is simple, since in that case the equations/systems can easily be treated by one of the simplest transformation methods. The case of complex initial values is more complex {{due to the fact that}} complex functions need not be single valued. Hence, our methods in [3, 18, 21] and other related papers cannot be applied. This has motivated us to start investigating <b>product-type</b> systems on the complex domain. In a series of papers, see [19, 20, 22, 26 – 29], we have obtained some results in the area (during the study of the equation in [21] we came across a <b>product-type</b> equation). In our first papers on the topic (see [20, 22, 26]) the systems have not had coefficients different from one. However, not long after that we have introduced two coefficients and also got solvable systems (this was done for the first time in [19], and somewhat later in [27 – 29]). We have also observed the fact that there are only a few solvable <b>product-type</b> systems of difference equations with two dependent variables. Hence, our aim is to describe all such <b>product-type</b> systems and present formulas for the general solutions for each of them.|$|E
