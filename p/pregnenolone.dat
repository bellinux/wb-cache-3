5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms <b>pregnenolone</b> as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of <b>pregnenolone,</b> specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which <b>pregnenolone</b> is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E
5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of <b>pregnenolone,</b> available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to <b>pregnenolone,</b> its {{synthetic}} derivative 3β-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), and progesterone, DHEA {{has been}} found to bind to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), specifically the MAP2C subtype (Kd = 27µM). However, it is unclear whether DHEA increases binding of MAP2 to tubulin like <b>pregnenolone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The enzyme P450c21, {{commonly}} referred to as 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), is embedded in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the cells of the adrenal cortex. It catalyzes hydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol in the glucocorticoid pathway, which starts from <b>pregnenolone</b> and finishes with cortisol. It also catalyzes hydroxylation of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in the mineralocorticoid pathway on its way from <b>pregnenolone</b> to aldosterone.|$|E
25|$|Deficient {{activity}} of this enzyme reduces {{the efficiency of}} cortisol synthesis, with consequent hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and elevation of ACTH levels. ACTH stimulates uptake of cholesterol and synthesis of <b>pregnenolone.</b> Steroid precursors {{up to and including}} progesterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and especially 17α-hydroxyprogesterone accumulate in the adrenal cortex and in circulating blood. Blood levels of 17OHP can reach 10-1000 times the normal concentration.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{ketoconazole}} are sometimes harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to <b>pregnenolone,</b> 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert <b>pregnenolone</b> into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of cortisol in {{the adrenal gland}} is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to <b>pregnenolone</b> and catalyzed by cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} forms of CAH, {{suspicion}} of severe 3β-HSD CAH is usually raised {{by the appearance of}} the genitalia at birth or by development of a salt-wasting crisis in the first month of life. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the distinctive pattern of adrenal steroids: elevated <b>pregnenolone,</b> 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, DHEA, and renin. In clinical circumstances this form of CAH has sometimes been difficult to distinguish from the more common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH because of the 17OHP elevation, or from simple premature adrenarche because of the DHEA elevation.|$|E
25|$|Like other steroid hormones, {{testosterone}} {{is derived}} from cholesterol (see figure). The {{first step in the}} biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give <b>pregnenolone.</b> In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.|$|E
25|$|DHEA is {{produced}} in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex {{under the control of}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is also produced in the brain. DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with <b>pregnenolone</b> and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. It is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex, with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads. Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues. DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% being secreted from the adrenal cortex in women.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{experiments}} which {{have been shown to}} increase the maximum life span of laboratory animals, thereby achieving life extension. A few experimental methods such as replacing hormones to youthful levels have had considerable success in partially rejuvenating laboratory animals and humans. A recent experiment involved breeding genetically manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase, causing the mice to age prematurely and suffer ailments. When the mice were given injections to reactivate the enzyme, it repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of aging. There are at least eight important hormones that decline with age: 1. human growth hormone (HGH); 2. the sexual hormones: testosterone or oestrogen/progesterone; 3. erythropoietin (EPO); 4. insulin; 5. DHEA; 6. melatonin; 7. thyroid; 8. <b>pregnenolone.</b> In theory, if all or some of these hormones are replaced, the body will respond to them as it did when it was younger, thus repairing and restoring many body functions. In line with this, recent experiments show that heterochronic parabiosis, i.e. connecting the circulatory systems of young and old animal, leads to the rejuvenation of the old animal, including restoration of proper stem cell function. Similar experiments show that grafting old muscles into young hosts leads to their complete restoration, whereas grafting young muscles into old hosts does not. These experiments show that aging is mediated by systemic environment, rather than being an intrinsic cell property. Clinical trials based on transfusion of young blood were scheduled to begin in 2014.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 1949, {{rheumatologist}} Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic {{announced the}} dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone {{was produced by}} Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement {{in the process of}} producing cortisone. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, which was a rare and expensive chemical. [...] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available <b>pregnenolone</b> (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; [...] and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not.|$|E

2500|$|Lipoid CAH {{is one of}} the rarer {{forms of}} CAH and results from defects in the steps from {{cholesterol}} to <b>pregnenolone.</b> This results in the catastrophic loss of most or all steroid hormones in the body.

2500|$|Some AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, {{have been}} found to {{modulate}} the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and <b>pregnenolone</b> sulfate.

2500|$|This {{inherited}} {{disease is}} autosomal recessive. Understanding of the molecular basis for {{it has been}} advanced {{in the last decade}} by better understanding of adrenal steroidogenesis as well as genetic studies of affected patients. It used to be assumed that lipoid CAH resulted from a defect of the enzyme that converted cholesterol to <b>pregnenolone.</b> The conversion reactions are mediated by a single enzyme, formerly referred to as 20,22-desmolase, but now identified as cytochrome P450scc (cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme). However, few cases of lipoid CAH due to a mutation and defect of P450scc have been identified. [...] Although the disorder is considered autosomal recessive, a single mutation in P450scc can be sufficient to cause the condition. All other cases of lipoid adrenal hyperplasia that have been studied {{have been found to be}} due to mutations of the gene for the primary protein that transports cholesterol into the mitochondria, StAR, encoded by a gene on chromosome 8p11.2 in the human.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pregnenolone</b> {{has been}} found to bind with high, nanomolar {{affinity}} to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the brain. In contrast to <b>pregnenolone,</b> <b>pregnenolone</b> sulfate did not bind to microtubules. However, progesterone did and with similar affinity to <b>pregnenolone,</b> although unlike <b>pregnenolone,</b> it did not increase binding of MAP2 to tubulin. <b>Pregnenolone</b> was found to induce tubule polymerization in neuronal cultures and to increase neurite growth in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor. As such, <b>pregnenolone</b> may control formation and stabilization of microtubules in neurons and may affect both neural development during prenatal development and neural plasticity during aging. The 3β-methyl ether of <b>pregnenolone,</b> 3β-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), retains similar activity to <b>pregnenolone</b> in regards to interaction with MAP2, and is under development for potential clinical use for indications such as the treatment of brain and spinal cord injury and depressive disorders.|$|E
