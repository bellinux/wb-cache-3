40|$|Application {{features}} and research status of alternative 3 D-printing materials for six typical 3 D-printingtechniques were reviewed. From {{the point of}} view of physical forms, four kinds of materials of liquid photosensitive resin material, thin sheet material (paper or plastic film), low melting point filament material and powder material are included. And from the composition point of view, nearly all kinds of materials in the production and life are included such as polymer materials: plastic, resin, wax; metal and alloy materials; ceramic materials. Liquid photosensitive resin material is used for stereo lithigraphy apparatus(SLA); thin sheet materials such as paper or plastic film are used for laminated object manufacturing(LOM); low melting point polymer filament materials such as wax filament, polyolefin resin filament, <b>polyamide</b> <b>filament</b> and ABS filament are used for fused deposition modeling(FDM); very wide variety powder materials including nylon powder, nylon-coated glass powder, polycarbonate powder, polyamide powder, wax powder, metal powder(Re-sintering and infiltration of copper are needed after sintering), wax-coated ceramic powder, wax-coated metal powder and thermosetting resin-coated fine sand are used for selective laser sintering(SLS). Nearly the same above powder materials are used for selective laser melting(SLM), but the printed parts own much more higher density and better mechanical properties. Powder materials are likewise used for threedimensional printing and gluing(3 DP), however, the powders are stuck together by tricolor binder sprayed through nozzle and cross-section shape of the part is color-printed on it. Finally, the development direction in both quality and the yield of 3 D-printing materials were pointed out to be a bottle-neck issue and a hot topic in the field of 3 D-printing...|$|E
30|$|Duran and Kado lu (2014), {{inserted}} silver coated <b>Polyamide</b> <b>filaments</b> in core via {{a special}} arrangement after the front roll delivery system in Ring spinning. They used this hybrid yarn {{structure in the}} weft with varying weft densities to analyse its impacts on EMSE, moreover, they investigated different proportions of Ag/PA {{and concluded that the}} higher the % age of conductive material in blend the higher will be the EMSE. Several other researchers used somewhat similar techniques to incorporate the conductive filament in core, like, Yu et al. (2014), inserted stainless steel wire of 50  μm in core by using hollow spinning machine, the covering components were Antibacterial Nylon and Bamboo Charcoal Polyester filament. Siro core spinning system with double roving as outer layers and stainless steel core was examined for the effects of orientation of fibres within the structure by Ortlek et al. (2012). Recently, Yu et al. (2015), incorporated stainless steel wire in core using hollow spindle spinning in order to investigate the functional and EMSE of elastic warp knitted fabrics. They concluded that multi-layered fabrics with laminating angles 0 °/ 90 ° produced better results as compared to 0 °/ 0 ° layered fabrics due to the formation of metal grids in the arrangement.|$|R
40|$|A 10 mm gap in a rat {{sciatic nerve}} was bridged by a bioartificial nerve graft {{consisting}} of a silicone tube containing seven longitudinally placed filaments made of non-resorbable material (polyamide [Ethilon]) or resorbable materials (polydioxanon [PDS], polyglactin [Vicryl] or catgut). The purpose was to study the tissue reaction induced by the four different types of materials. At 4 weeks an immunocytochemical technique, using ED 1 and ED 2 monoclonal antibodies, was used to study the presence and location of macrophages. A large number of macrophages were found accumulating {{on the surface of}} catgut and polyglactin, while few were found on the surface of <b>polyamide</b> and polydioxanon <b>filaments.</b> It is concluded that the cell layers on the filament surface mainly consisted of ED 1 positive cells and their thickness depends on the filament materials...|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene {{filament}} yarns, {{when compared}} with polyethyleneterephthalate andpolyamide yarns have lower stretchability after being false twist textured. To over-come this deficiency, other researchers have tried to lower the degree of crys-tallinity of this fibre by either tension annealing or blending it with polyethyleneterephtha-late and polystyrene. These physical or chemical modifications have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of enhancement of the textureability of polypropylene. Considering the importance of BCF polypropylene yarns, in this research, the effect of blending polypropylene with 12. 5 and 25 % of polyamide 6 on {{the bulk of the}} final bulked continu-ous filament (BCF) yarn has been investigated. The results show that although both crimp contraction and crimp modulus increase with the temperature and pressure of hot air during texturing, but blending polypropylene with even 25 % of polyamide 6 does not enhance the textureability of BCF yarns. Also, the reduction in the crystallinity of the yarns does not lead to any improvement in the textureability of the polypropylene BCF yarns. polymer blending; polypropylene; <b>polyamide</b> 6; continuous <b>filament...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{understand}} physical phenomena o ccurring in roving structures under transverse compression. In order to reach this aim, transverse behavior of prototype rovings featuring a small number of <b>polyamide</b> 6. 6 <b>filaments</b> are studied using an experimental device developed in our laboratory. Moreover, the effect of roving characteristics on their transverse compression behavior is examined. The studied characteristics are filament diameter and number, roving twist and tension. It is found that the roving behavior under compression shows plateaus separated by a significant increase of compression force, indicating discontinuous changes in the roving structures. This fact may be attributed to a reorganization of rovings followed by a local slippage between filaments. Transverse properties of rovings are affected by contact-friction inter filaments and the initial filament section fraction. In fact, it is more difficult to compact high-twisted rovings. Rovings with a greater number of filaments require a higher force in order to be compacted. The pre-tension of the rovings has no noticeable effect on their compression behavio...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there has been growing {{interest}} in knitted fabrics due to its simple production technique, low cost, high levels of clothing comfort and wide product range. The customers expect his clothing to be endurable, that is during its existence to remain the same dimension and be resistant to attrition In this paper double layer knitted structures (interlock) have been constructed and knitted, using cotton yarn in face and <b>polyamide</b> or polyester <b>filaments</b> in back layers of the fabrics. Knitted fabrics have different density. The influence of structural characteristics and raw material content of interlock knitted fabrics on the physical-mechanical characteristic (breaking strength, bursting strength, tensile properties, abrasion resistance and dimensional stability) was investigated. The results obtained that due to increase of the density increases also bursting strength. All investigated knitted structures have higher tensile strength, course related to tensile strength, wale. Knitted fabrics with PES have higher specific breaking strength, related to knitted fabrics with PA. Interlock knitted fabrics made from cotton/polyester showed significant difference in weight loss from the cotton layer related to the layer of PES, while in the knitted fabrics made from cotton/polyamide the difference is not as pronounced. Тhis research indicate that the raw content as well as small changes in structural parameters lead to significant changes in physical-mechanical characteristics of the interlock knitted fabrics...|$|R
