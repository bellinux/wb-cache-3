I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> It is the most {{successful}} for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Raissman, Russo {{did not rule}} out a reunion with Francesa. Russo said, [...] "You never want to say never. You know how the radio business is. So, you never say never, but I haven’t thought about it in my crystal ball, let's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way...</b> But I’ll tell you right now, if Mike and I did shows together we would have no trouble picking right up where we left off." ...|$|E
2500|$|... quite relaxed – let’s <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> [...] We’re trying through {{talks and}} also through announcing what we’re going to do, we’re {{trying to win}} the other side over to pursue a course where it is allowed [...] Ukraine to take its own {{sovereign}} political decisions. [...] It is not as if all of these decisions need to be against Russia but that Ukraine is in position to make its own decisions: For example, free and fair elections, elect a president … and to pursue trade and economic links {{with all of those}} partners they wish to have. [...] This is a very simple demand and a very clear demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "It means," [...] {{said the}} captain, biting his words—"it means that unless Joan is married within three months, {{so as to}} be out of Robert Vyner’s way, you will be {{dismissed}} the firm. It saves the old man’s pride a bit <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>it’s</b> safer, too. And if Robert Vyner marries her he will have to earn his own living. With luck he might get thirty shillings a week." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; {{but it must}} {{be quite}} between you and me--I can't {{withdraw}} my attitude." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with Rock N Roll Experience, guitarist Rick Wartell mentioned that Trouble has written [...] "eight or nine songs" [...] {{for their next}} album, and would begin recording it after touring. When asked which direction is the new music going in, Wartell replied, [...] "I know people have said this a million times and I know you've heard this a million times, but it's pretty fucking heavy, let's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way!</b> The music end of it that Bruce [...] and I are writing is getting heavier and heavier...it's getting heavier and then we want Kory to incorporate his style to what we are doing, that's basically all that we really want out of this." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Rafter won the US Open, {{a tournament}} that many {{expected}} Sampras to win, having won in 1995 and 1996. The win catapulted Rafter to the year-end no. 2 rankings behind Sampras. Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed Rafter to be a [...] "one-slam wonder", {{since it was}} only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5-1 against Rafter, and defeated Rafter three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking. [...] "We're not the best of mates," [...] Rafter said of Sampras after 1997 Davis Cup semifinals, [...] "I wouldn't {{go out for a}} beer with him, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I don't know what the story is. There's a bit of feeling." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{that she}} might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wouldn't <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> After all, I'm {{the only}} friend he ever had. It was not unnatural {{that a number}} of acquaintances should drop him when he got into hot water.' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>it</b> this <b>way</b> <b>that</b> his son {{might find}} it easier to confess.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Captain Lee, to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and I {{have no doubt}} that my dear husband did, as you say, lay you under many {{obligations}} because he was always kind to every one, but I cannot I assure you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andalusian AND Oregonian, Antonio! <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and {{you have}} my vote. Being a native up there, I know. You being Andalusian- born--" ...|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [Drily] We will <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> [A pause] At {{the present}} moment you owe, as I {{understand}} it, eleven hundred pounds.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard her}} give a gulp, and I {{saw that her}} eyes had become moistish. Drenched irises, if you care to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> since <b>it</b> pleases you," [...] said Tommy, heavily. [...] "I am too stout." [...] He {{could not}} help adding, [...] "And be thankful, Lady Pippinworth, let us both be thankful, {{that there is some}} reason to prevent my trying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> exactly, Nelly; but I will grant that between your fits of crying {{you used to}} assert {{over and over again}} that you did not believe that they were killed. And now, my dear boy, tell us how this seeming miracle has come about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> sir. My choice is made. I am engaged to this young lady, and shall {{certainly}} marry her. I trust that, when your present anger has subsided, you will recognize that my honour {{was involved in}} the matter; and that even if I wished it, I could not, without showing myself to be a downright cad, draw back." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} that if I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> he wouldn't mind telling me. And everybody was pleased, and composed ourselves {{once more to}} listen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> I {{guess we}} are agreed that she hadn't ought to stay. Not that I've {{anything}} against her personally--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{to please}} you," [...] he explained. [...] "You complained to me last year {{precisely}} {{that this was}} not what seemed generally wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} {{that he was}} grieved that his people had {{found it necessary to}} treat me roughly, for he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> mild <b>way.</b> Everything, he said, short of liberating me, would be done to make my sojourn in El Molino pleasant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You yawned--much {{my company}} is to you!' He <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> {{but he was}} really {{wondering}} whether her yawn could possibly {{have more to do}} with physical weariness from the night before than mental weariness of that present moment. Lizzy apologized, and owned that she was rather tired, which gave him an opening for a direct question on the point; but his modesty would not allow him to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to her; and he uncomfortably resolved to wait.|$|R
60|$|He {{wrote to}} the major as artlessly and briefly as he had written to the major's wife. He {{declared}} his unwillingness to cause a friend and neighbor any disappointment, if he could possibly help it. On this occasion he had no other choice. The questions the major asked him were questions which he could not consent to answer. He was not very clever at explaining himself, and he hoped he might be excused for <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and saying no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> if you wish, Mr. Van Blott. I am here {{simply to}} learn this {{business}} and to see that everything is O. K." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> if you like. Now, in {{the first}} place, there is the window, in the second the door, and lastly the walls and floor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grey flint, then, if you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Why the dickens must I go {{building}} {{towers of}} Babylon just because I have held {{up one of}} your trains-once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} summat like," [...] said Harry Shepherd, who {{saw that his}} {{opportunity}} had come. [...] "I wonder whether t' maister would open a night-school for us; I'd go for one, quick enough. I doan't know as I've rightly thought it over before, but now ye <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Jack, there be no doubt i' my moind <b>that</b> I should; <b>it</b> would be a heap better to get some larning, and to live like a decent kind o' chap." ...|$|R
60|$|Far from minding, Maria was pleased; it pleased her to {{know that}} his niece's conduct had flustered him. The more that girl flustered him the better it would be, and she smiled with {{considerable}} satisfaction. If she could get that girl {{out of the way}} she believed she would find but little difficulty in carrying out her scheme to embitter the remainder of the good captain's life. She did not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to herself; but that was the real character of the scheme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right gladly will I do so. As you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Sir Robert, {{they will}} {{appreciate}} the gift {{as much as}} I do, and, as you say, maybe the chains will be useful to them some day, for they are not of those who battle for spoil, and, like myself, have refused all share in that which the army has taken in Flanders, holding that we had no cause of dispute with your people, and that our assault upon them was unfairly and unjustly made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> And I owe {{nothing to}} a man who couldn't see my hand when I put it out to him as I came aboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am afraid}} of them then. <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> if you like. Anyhow I do not let myself go with them. I have never let myself go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (I had to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because Scandinavian grammar is not {{a strong}} point with me, and my {{knowledge}} of the verbs is as yet limited to the present tense of the infinitive mood. Besides, this {{was no time to}} worry about grace of style.) ...|$|E
60|$|Forgive her! Oh, how it enraged Grizel! How {{like the}} Tommy of old to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> There {{never had been}} a boy so good at {{forgiving}} people for his own crimes, and he always looked so modest when he did it. He was reclining on his chairs at this moment, she was sure he was, forgiving her in every sentence. She could have endured it more easily had she felt {{sure that he was}} seeing himself as he was; but she remembered him too well to have any hope of that.|$|R
6000|$|A {{couple of}} years before the death of Parnell, I had wound up my {{introduction}} to those selections from the Irish novelists with the prophecy of an intellectual movement at the first lull in politics, and now I wished to fulfil my prophecy. I did not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> for I preferred to think that the sudden emotion that now came to me, the sudden certainty that Ireland was to be like soft wax for years to come, was a moment of supernatural insight. How could I tell, how can I tell even now? ...|$|R
60|$|What {{else was}} there to do but be patient? It was all amazing unjust, but to be a married woman she was {{beginning}} to understand is to be outside justice. It is autocracy. She had once imagined otherwise, and most of her life had been the slow unlearning of that initial error. She had imagined that the hostels were hers simply because he had <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> They had never been anything but his, and now it was manifest he would do what he liked with his own. The law takes no cognizance of the unwritten terms of a domestic reconciliation.|$|R
