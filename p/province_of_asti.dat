25|$|Asti is a {{slightly}} sweet wine {{made from the}} Moscato grape in the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asti.</b> The wine is noted for its low alcohol levels around 8% and fresh, grapey flavors.

25|$|The Barbera grape is {{the most}} widely planted variety {{in all of the}} Piedmont and makes a juicy, muscular red wine that is not as tannic as Barolo and Barbaresco. It is grown in nearly every major wine making region of the Piedmont but seems to do best in the {{southern}} part of the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asti</b> in the Nizza DOCG zone. Some producers are experimenting with blending Barbera with Nebbiolo to combine the former's fruitiness with the later's structure. The light fruitiness of wines from the Dolcetto grape has caused some wine writers to describe it as the Italian version of Beaujolais. The wines have a sense of spiciness to them with little acid and tannins. They are able to be drunk relatively young and tend to be the every day drinking wines of the Piedmontese.|$|E

50|$|Brachetto {{is a red}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety grown {{predominantly}} in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy. At one time the grape {{was thought to be}} related to the French wine grape Braquet, but recent thought among ampelographers is that the two are distinct varieties. In Italy’s region of Piedmont the grape is somewhat more widespread: production mostly falling within an area <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asti</b> and Alessandria between the rivers Bormida and Belbo plus various parts <b>of</b> the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Cuneo. At Canelli, on the border between the hills <b>of</b> <b>Asti</b> and the Langhe proper, the grape is known as Borgogna. The most notable wine here is the red Brachetto d'Acqui Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) which is made in both still and spumante (fully sparkling) versions. The Piemonte Brachetto Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC), also a red wine, is made with a minimum of 85% Brachetto; it is usually still, but may be frizzante (lightly sparkling). The grape is also used for up to 10% of the blend for the Ruché-based Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato DOC.|$|R

50|$|Varieties of Robiola are {{produced}} across Piedmont from the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Cuneo, <b>Asti</b> and Alessandria and into Lombardy. It {{is one of}} the specialties of the Aosta Valley. The taste and appearance of Robiola varies depending upon where it was produced. Robiola di Roccaverano DOP / DOC has no rind and a slightly straw-yellow coloring with a sweet, yielding taste. Robiola Lombardia has a thin, milky-white to pink rind and tends to be shaped like small rolls. The cream-colored cheese underneath its bloomy rind has a smooth, full, tangy and mildly sour flavor, likely due to the high (52%) fat content. Its rind can be cut away, but is mild with no ammonia and adds a subtle crunch to the cheese. La Tur has a cake-like rind over a tangy-lactic layer of cream and is representative of Piedmont’s Robiola style of cheese where the fresh curds are ladled into molds, and drain under their own weight before aging rather than by pressing with weights. Robiola from the Piedmont region is a fresh cheese, and is usually eaten on its own, or with a little honey.|$|R
