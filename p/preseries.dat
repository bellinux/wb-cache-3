40|$|Ankara : The Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Bilkent Univ., 2004. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2004. Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigated}} the legal status, identity and civic virtue aspects of citizenship and the interaction between them on the layers of international migration and minority issues with use of a comparative case. A research on the perceptions and experiences of Turkey’s Jewish minority and Turkish-Jewish immigrants in Israel regarding citizenship was conducted. The field research which {{was carried out in}} both countries - Turkey and Israel - consisted of key informant interviews, participant observation in commimity institutions and in- depth interviews with a total of 65 respondents from the sample group. The results were analyzed using qualitative data analysis technique. On the layer of minority, research results illustrated that in a society where the population is overwhelmingly Muslim, being a non-Muslim minority played roles in: a) the appropriation of the monist and universal conceptualization of citizenship in the legal status aspect; b) the endeavor to maintain Jewish identity despite the inevitable consequences of integration and assimilation in the identity aspect; and c) the discrepancy between values and actions in the civic virtue aspect. On the layer of international migration, the research pointed out that despite long years of residence in Israel, first generation of Turkish-Jewish immigrants in Israel <b>preseryed</b> their political culture that they cultivated when they were in Turkey. However, experience of international migration as a process seemed to impact on citizenship and played roles in; a) the appropriation of democratic norms defined by majoritarian terms in the legal status aspect; b) efforts to maintain their Turkish identity in the identity aspect; and c) the preference for complying with the general norms of Jewish-Israeli society and conversely excluding a proactive understanding of virtuous citizenship.

50|$|The armour {{was first}} {{tested in the}} context of the {{development}} of a British prototype vehicle, the FV4211, and first applied on the <b>preseries</b> of the American M1. Only the M1 Abrams, Challenger 1, and Challenger 2 tanks have been disclosed as being thus armoured. The framework holding the ceramics is usually produced in large blocks, giving these tanks, and especially their turrets, a distinctive angled appearance.|$|E
50|$|They {{were built}} by Bombardier (formerly ADtranz) at their Kassel, Germany plant. The first two {{locomotives}} were built as <b>preseries</b> locomotives for testing—4600 was tested on the TTCI test plant in Pueblo, Colorado, 4601 {{was sent to}} Kearny for testing on the NJT network. All locomotives were transported via road to the port of Bremen and shipped on Roro-ships of Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics to Port Elizabeth (NJ).|$|E
50|$|The V-60 was a {{projected}} light (3500 kg) {{armed escort helicopter}} from Kamov based on the civil Kamov Ka-126. Only {{a model of the}} original V-60 exists. The existing model shows four missiles as its sole armament. The project was abandoned in the 1980s and is often confused to be an early concept of the Ka-60. The initial prototype and <b>preseries</b> version of the Ka-60 carried another designation, V-62.|$|E
50|$|The Gepard was {{developed}} from 1963 onwards. In 1969, construction began of four A prototypes testing both 30 and 35 mm guns. On 25 June 1970, {{it was decided}} to use the 35 mm type. In 1971, twelve second phase B prototypes were ordered; the same year the Dutch army ordered a CA <b>preseries</b> of five vehicles based on a parallel development that had used a German 0-series Leopard 1 vehicle made available by the German government in March 1970 as the C-prototype. The Germans made a small <b>preseries</b> of both the B1and B2R. On 5 February 1973, the political decision was made to produce the type; in September 1973 the contract was signed with Krauss-Maffei for 432 B2 turrets and 420 hulls with a total value of DM1,200,000,000. Each vehicle would thus be about three times the price of a normal Leopard 1. The first was delivered in December 1976. Belgium ordered 55 vehicles, which were identical to the German version. The Dutch ordered 95 vehicles, split into three batches (CA1, CA2 and CA3), which were equipped with Philips radar systems.|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} model was the Rectaflex series A 1000 (serial number 1000 to 2150), {{quite similar to}} the <b>preseries</b> model. The Rectaflex series B 2000 (s/n 2230 to 2999) added a split image device in the focusing screen and had no film cutter. Note that Rectaflex series A 1000 and Rectaflex series B 2000 were not official designations, but a way to recognize the variants by way of their serial number.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} of the Rectaflex, presented at the Milano Fiera in April 1947, was a wooden mock-up, with a mirror eye-level finder, giving a left to right inverted image. For vertical pictures, the image was upside down, {{and that was a}} big drawback. This was corrected with a Roof prism before the 1948 Milano show, and the <b>preseries</b> model was called Rectaflex Standard 947, and had a fully working pentaprism as well as a focal plane shutter from 1s to 1/1000, synchronised at 1/25.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1939 Zappata became {{disillusioned with}} CANT and started {{negotiating}} with Breda, which he joined in 1942; in addition, military requirements fluctuated. The Z.1018 started in wood as [...] "flying mockup", {{developed as a}} very different wooden <b>preseries,</b> and metamorphosed into metal for production with bomber, torpedo-bomber, and night-fighter variants. Not surprising, none of these types became operational before the Italian armistice in 1943. The ensuing German occupation and USAAF raids in March-April 1944 stopped all production, and only the shipyard was rebuilt after the war.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} three bogies per side—each formed of two bell cranks arranged as [...] "scissors" [...] with springs at the top. Each bogie carried two rubber-rimmed wheels. The first ten production vehicles, which {{can be considered as}} forming a separate <b>preseries,</b> had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler—which itself was sprung to automatically control tension—at the rear. There were two top rollers.|$|E
5000|$|The Sport {{was built}} by Zagato, and was also a two-seater. It used the same shorter {{wheelbase}} chassis as the GT, and had a very distinctive rounded aluminium body with pop-out handles. The Super Sport replaced the Sport in 1964, {{with the introduction of}} the 2.8 L [...] engine. The first Sports had flush covered headlights, later changed to more classic round ones. The Super Sport also saw some changes - the rear was updated to a Kammback, while the front was made more aerodynamic with distinctive tear-shape headlight casings. Until 1967, 593 Sports and Super Sports were built (99 <b>Preseries,</b> 344 Sports, 150 Supersports).|$|E
50|$|The S35 medium tank entered {{service in}} January 1936 with the 4e Cuirassiers. At {{the end of}} 1937 the SA 35 gun became {{available}} and deliveries of the main production series could begin. By mid 1938 a hundred had been produced, 270 on 1 September 1939 and 246 delivered. On this date 191 served with the troops, 51 were in depot and four had been {{sent back to the}} factory for overhaul. After the outbreak of war a fourth order of 200 was made, bringing the ordered total to 700. Later it was decided that from the 451st vehicle onward the tanks would be of the improved S 40 type. Production in fact totalled 430 by June 1940, including the prototype and the <b>preseries.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of {{acceptance}} in 1934, already fifteen had been decided to be ordered on 25 April 1934 and fifteen more on 20 May at a price of ₣ 275,000 per hull, more expensive than a French light infantry tank of the period. The actual orders were made on 1 January and 29 April 1935 respectively, and the notification sent on 27 May, with a planned delivery between January and March 1936. [...] Due to strikes, the first vehicles of these orders were only delivered from 2 February 1937 onwards; nineteen had been produced by April, the last delivered in November. The two first orders together {{can be seen as}} a separate <b>preseries</b> of thirty, that differed slightly in many details from later produced vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In October 1931 the Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement, under strong {{pressure}} by the Infantry {{to reach a}} quick decision, chose the Renault vehicle for production, even though the trial process hadn't been completed. On 9 December an order of fifty was made for the Chenillette de ravitaillement d'Infanterie Modèle 1931 R. On 26 March 1932 a <b>preseries</b> of fifty tractor-carrying trailers was ordered, the first was delivered in June. Further orders followed, mass-production commencing {{in the second half}} of 1934. The series vehicles differed from the first in having a towing sign plate fitted on the top, new towing hooks and an elongated stowage box on the left side. Orders reached a total of 793 on 1 January 1936 and of about 1,200 by June 1936 — 700 of which had been delivered by June 1936, 920 by October 1936, 976 on 1 January 1937. In December 1936 the military branch of Renault was nationalised as the AMX company which continued production to a total of about 2,200, later joined by Berliet which would build another 100 and Fouga which would produce 300 for a grand total for the Modèle 31 of about 2600.|$|E

50|$|Four {{tanks of}} the AC4 pre-series of the S35 entered service in January 1936 with the 4e Cuirassiers. On 15 April 1937, {{the first two}} hulls of the main series left the factory. These, {{produced}} at a planned rate of twelve per month, still had to be joined with their turrets. At the end of 1937 the SA 35 gun became available and deliveries of finished tanks of the main production series could begin. On 15 January 1938, four of these were operational. By July 1938, 128 hulls had been delivered, but only 96 tanks were completed with turrets. In the Spring of 1939 the number of operational tanks had increased to 192, the two armoured division of the Cavalry having attained their nominal strength. On 1 September 1939, {{the start of the}} war, 270 had been produced and 246 delivered. On this date 191 served with the troops, 51 were in depot and four had been sent back to the factory for overhaul. After the outbreak of war, on 21 September a sixth order of fifty was made, followed by a final order of 324 bringing the ordered total to 824.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the SOMUA S35 comes from the changed {{specifications}} of 26 June 1934 for an Automitrailleuse de Combat (AMC) issued for cavalry use. These called for a much heavier design than had been originally specified in 1931. The new type had to be immune to contemporary antitank gun fire. On 17 May the Army had already contacted a subsidiary of Schneider et Cie — the Société d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (or SOMUA) based at Saint-Ouen — to build a prototype. The company accepted this proposal on 16 July and construction began on 12 October 1934. The prototype, with the name AC3, was ready on 14 April 1935. It was tested from 4 July until 2 August 1935. Then a <b>preseries</b> of four was produced of an improved type, the AC4, to be tested until 27 January 1938. These first vehicles had the standard APX1 turret, fitted with the short 47 mm SA 34 gun. On 25 March 1936, the AC4 was taken on as the standard medium tank of the Cavalry with the official new name Automitrailleuse de Combat modèle 1935 S (or AMC 1935 S), when a first order for fifty was made. The tank was then more commonly known as SOMUA S35 (S again for SOMUA and 35 from 1935, the year of introduction); today the even shorter abbreviation S35 is most often used, in English sources usually with a hyphen: [...] "S-35".|$|E
50|$|A third AMX 50 {{project was}} begun in August 1951. Ten <b>preseries</b> {{vehicles}} {{were to be}} built by DEFA (Direction des Études et Fabrications d'Armement, the state weapon design bureau), the first being delivered in 1953. The type was armed with a 120 mm gun, also with a 1000 m/s muzzle velocity, {{in response to the}} perceived threat posed by the Soviet heavy tanks, such as the IS-3 and the T-10. To accommodate the larger gun, an enormous turret was fitted; originally planned in a conventional form, eventually it was decided to make it of the oscillating type also. Armour was increased to a maximum of ninety millimetres. These changes caused a weight increase to 59.2 metric tonnes. From 1954 to 1955 this type was made even heavier, creating the surblindé version ("AMX 50 Uparmoured") with a lower turret and a higher hull with a pointed glacis like the IS-3, bringing weight to about 64 tonnes and the line-of-sight thickness of the armour at two hundred millimetres. As this caused serious mechanical reliability concerns despite a reinforced suspension, from 1956 to 1958 weight was diminished to 57.8 metric tonnes by building a lower cast hull, creating the surbaissé ("AMX 50 Lowered") with a lighter but again higher turret, the Tourelle D (fourth type turret). As problems with the preferred Maybach persisted, despite limiting the desired output to 1000 hp, from 1955 a special design team (Gruppe M, named after professor Karl Maybach who himself headed the mission of seventy German engineers) brought over from Germany cooperated with the AMX factory to solve them. Optimistically it was at that time projected that maximum speed could eventually be increased to 65 km/h. In the end in total only five complete AMX 50 prototypes would be constructed, including the final hull.|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{will be a}} superconducting {{accelerator}} and collider to {{be installed}} in the existing underground LEP ring tunnel at CERN. It will provide proton-proton collisions with a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. The proton beams coming from the SPS will be injected into the LHC at 450 GeV by vertically deflecting kicker magnets and horizontally deflecting steel septum magnets (MSI). The proton beams will be dumped from the LHC {{with the help of}} two extraction systems comprising horizontally deflecting kicker magnets and vertically deflecting steel septum magnets (MSD). The MSI and MSD septa are laminated iron-dominated magnets using an all welded construction. The yokes are constructed from two different half cores, called coil core and septum core. The septum cores comprise circular holes for the circulating beams. This avoids the need for careful alignment of the usually wedge-shaped septum blades used in classical Lambertson magnets. The MSI and MSD septum magnets were designed and built in a collaboration between IHEP (Protvino) and CERN (Geneva).

40|$|The ATLAS presampler will be {{composed}} of approximately 90000 printed circuit board electrodes. These electrodes need to be tested to verify that they are whithin the tight thickness and size tolerances required by the module production technique.
