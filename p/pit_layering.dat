40|$|Alterations in wall {{ultrastructure}} accompanying resistant sporangium maturation and meiospore liberation in Allomyces arbuscula {{were examined}} by scanning electron microscopy. Three discrete wall layers were identified, {{each of which}} underwent marked changes during processes leading to zoospore release. The outermost wall layer, the hyphal sheath continuous with the hypha, was physically altered during the maturation process preparatory to induction and release of meiospores. The integrity of this wall layer was broken, {{and it was no}} longer closely juxtaposed to the heavy <b>pitted</b> wall <b>layer</b> that lay beneath it. A fibrillar matrix seemed to cement the two layers to one another before this desiccation. A single, raised, longitudinal dehiscence ridge on each meiosporangium appeared to be a structurally differentiated region of the <b>pitted</b> wall <b>layer</b> at which sporangium rupture occurred to permit emergence of the protoplast. By its thickness the <b>pitted</b> wall <b>layer</b> was likely to provide mechanical rigidity to the meiosporangium. Beneath the <b>pitted</b> wall <b>layer,</b> another thin, flexible wall layer surrounded the protoplast. From this structure, a single exit papilla was cleaved at the apical region to effect the release of meiospores from the protruding protoplast. Thus a sequence of structural changes in well-differentiated multiple wall layers is implicated in the sporulation process in this organism...|$|R

40|$|The {{general lack}} of data about the {{technological}} features of the production represents the main problem of the archaeological research on Sicilian prehistoric. In particular, about the Middle Bronze Age, a period corresponding to the Thapsos culture and its three chronological phases (15 th- 13 th century BC), the only studies available are those about Aeolian islands and still nothing exists for Sicily. The present paper aims to bridge this gap discussing the ceramic materials found at Grotte di Marineo, a prehistoric cave site explored in 1988 - 1989. Middle Bronze Age contexts at Grotte di Marineo were represented by the test <b>pit</b> 2 (<b>layers</b> 2 - 4) and test <b>pit</b> 3 (<b>layer</b> 2) of the Cave 1 and the test <b>pit</b> 1 (<b>layers</b> 4 and 5) of the Cave 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche {{researchers}} and practitioners have long measured snowpack temperatures in snow pits with thermometers about 10 cm apart. This {{led to the}} assumptions that temperature gradients are smooth and that temperature changes are regular. For this study, we used a thermal imager in standard snow pits in the Canadian Rocky Mountains during two seasons between 2010 and 2012. We collected the first season of data in a very shallow, below treeline snowpack study plot, and the second season of data in a deeper, treeline study plot. Data included thousands of thermal images, as well as visual macro images of the snow crystals in each <b>pit</b> <b>layer</b> to monitor changes. We observed strong temperature gradients {{on the scale of}} individual snow crystals. We found that these small scale gradients correlated with future snow crystal changes. We also found that these gradients changed quickly with the weather, even at depth. This paper focuses on our most recent findings from the 2011 - 12 season, and describes our overall progress in extracting data from thermal images to use for research and forecasting. We use correlations to present very general relationships between thermal data, crystal size, and layer stability tests. We also present temperature and gradient changes at depth during a period of clearing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble {{organic carbon}} (WSOC), waterinsoluble {{particulate}} organic carbon (WIOC), and particulate elemental carbon (EC) were measured simultaneously {{for the first time}} on the Greenland Ice Sheet in surface snow and in a 3 -meter snow pit. Snow pit concentrations reveal that, on average, WSOC makes up the majority (89 %) of carbonaceous species, followed by WIOC (10 %) and EC (1 %). The enhancement of OC relative to EC (ratio 99 : 1) in Greenland snow suggests that, along with atmospheric particulate matter, gaseous organics contribute to snow-phase OC. Comparison of summer surface snow concentrations in 2006 with past summer snow <b>pit</b> <b>layers</b> (2002 – 2005) found a significant depletion in WSOC (20 – 82 %) and WIOC (46 – 65 %) relative to EC for 3 of the 4 years.

40|$|In recent years, the {{interdisciplinary}} research between neuroscience and computer vision has promoted the development in both fields. Many biologically inspired visual models are proposed, and among them, the Hierarchical Max-pooling model (HMAX) is a feedforward model mimicking the structures {{and functions of}} V 1 to posterior inferotemporal (<b>PIT)</b> <b>layer</b> of the primate visual cortex, which could generate a series of position- and scale- invariant features. However, it could be improved with attention modulation and memory processing, which are two important properties of the primate visual cortex. Thus, in this paper, based on recent biological research on the primate visual cortex, we still mimic the first 100 - 150 milliseconds of visual cognition to enhance the HMAX model, which mainly focuses on the unsupervised feedforward feature learning process. The main modifications are as follows: 1) To mimic the attention modulation mechanism of V 1 layer, a bottom-up saliency map is computed in the S 1 layer of the HMAX model, which can support the initial feature extraction for memory processing; 2) To mimic the learning, clustering and short-term memory to long-term memory conversion abilities of V 2 and IT, an unsupervised iterative clustering method is used to learn clusters with multiscale middle level patches, which are taken as long-term memory; 3) Inspired by the multiple feature encoding mode of the primate visual cortex, information including color, orientation, and spatial position are encoded in different layers of the HMAX model progressively. By adding a softmax layer {{at the top of}} the model, multiclass categorization experiments can be conducted, and the results on Caltech 101 show that the enhanced model with a smaller memory size exhibits higher accuracy than the original HMAX model, and could also achieve better accuracy than other unsupervised feature learning methods in multiclass categorization task...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} density {{functional}} study of Lennard-Jones liquids {{in contact with}} a nano-corrugated wall. The corresponding substrate potential is taken to exhibit a repulsive hard core and a van der Waals attraction. The corrugation is modeled by a periodic array of square nano-pits. We have used the modified Rosenfeld density functional in order to study the interfacial structure of these liquids which {{with respect to their}} thermodynamic bulk state are considered to be deep inside their liquid phase. We find that already considerably below the packing fraction of bulk freezing of these liquids, inside the nanopits a three-dimensional-like density localization sets in. If the sizes of the pits are commensurate with the packing requirements, we observe high density spots separated from each other in all spatial directions by liquid of comparatively very low density. The number, shape, size, and density of these high density spots depend sensitively on the depth and width of the pits. Outside the <b>pits,</b> only <b>layering</b> is observed; above the <b>pit</b> openings these <b>layers</b> are distorted with the distortion reaching up to a few molecular diameters. We discuss quantitatively how this density localization is affected by the geometrical features of the pits and how it evolves upon increasing the bulk packing fraction. Our results are transferable to colloidal systems and pit dimensions corresponding to several diameters of the colloidal particles. For such systems the predicted unfolding of these structural changes can be studied experimentally on much larger length scales and more directly (e. g., optically) than for molecular fluids which typically call for sophisticated X-ray scattering...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{origins of}} the {{patchwork}} of lowland semi-deciduous forests in the Northern Republic of Congo were apprehended. The {{aim of this study}} was to show that dense forests suffered fewer disturbances than the open canopy forest types. Old disturbances associated with fires and human settlements seem to have had and still have today a substantial impact on the physiognomy and the composition of the forest types. Understanding past forest dynamics is a major component to predict the effects of both present climate change and human activities. Method Fifteen locations were studied along a 400 -km-long SW-NE gradient in the NW of the Congo Basin through the ERA-net BiodivERsA CoForChange project. An anthraco-archaeological study was carried out in association with floristic inventories of three strata. Two main geology substrates were considered: the Mesozoic sandstones and Quaternary alluvial deposits. The abundance of charcoal fragments and human artifacts were evaluated by a network of 1 -m-deep boring augers (n = 208) and a 1. 5 -m-deep reference soil pit (n = 15) in each site. A rating system was used to quantify the abundance of charcoal, charred Elaeis guineensis seeds and other artifacts (ceramic and metallurgic slag). Estimations were based on 20 -cm-depth intervals (augers) or on pedological <b>layers</b> (<b>pits).</b> Twelve radiocarbon dating were performed in the major disturbed layers of each vegetation type studied. Results Two main groups of vegetation were highlighted according to the relative openness of the woody stand, the importance of the woody regeneration, and the development of the herbaceous cover. The two dense forests sampled were preferentially found in the northern part: the dense forest with Manilkara mabokeensis and Haumania dankelmaniana, and the Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest on dry land. Most parts of the understorey exhibited the woody regeneration. The southern part presented more openness including the largest areas of open canopy vegetation types. Three forest types were identified: the Macaranga barteri pioneer forest, the open canopy vegetation type with Aframomum and Marantaceae, and the sparse forest with Megaphrinium macrostchyum and/or Haumania liebrestisiana. The understorey was a dense thicket of giant herbs belonging to the families Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae, causing a very scarce woody regeneration. Regardless the auger depth, charcoals were more profuse in the soils of the southern open canopy vegetation types (2 -Way ANOVA, F= 5. 46, p= 0. 02). As in <b>pit</b> <b>layers,</b> charred oil palm nuts were more plentiful in the soils of these vegetation types (Mann-Whitney test, p< 0. 05). Of the five sites containing artifacts, only one recent potsherd dated 466 - 302 BP was located in dense forest but near a main river. The oldest signs of ceramic and metallurgical activities dated 2160 - 1407 BP were found in the current open canopy vegetation types. Within the latter, two expansion phases of the oil palm tree E. guineensis were observed: between 2146 - 1055 BP and 558 - 347 BP. Conversely, the oldest palaeofire was discovered in the M. mabokeensis dense forest and dated at 5467 - 5285 BP. Conclusions The dense forests contained less evidence of ancient fires and human settlements. They currently include evergreen and shade-tolerant tree species such as G. dewevrei and M. mabokeensis. The more sustained and repeated fires in the open canopy vegetation types were often associated with ancient human occupation. Today, the light-demanding giant herbaceous species such as Aframomum sp. and M. macrostchyum proliferate in the understorey below a simplified woody component of pioneer species such as M. barteri. The largest expansion phases of the oil palm tree E. guineensis in the southern part would be linked to ancient human occupation associated with larger canopy openings and fire events. The water availability, more evenly distributed near the heavily-irrigated Congo Basin, would also be a discriminating factor...|$|R

At the University of Toronto {{and several other}} North American universities, background scientific studies are in progress to improve {{our understanding of the}} possible corrosion mechanisms that might affect this class of alloys. We are using less-resistant alloys, beginning with binary Ni- 22 CrY to study the stability of localized corrosion, such as <b>pitting,</b> in thin <b>layers</b> of moist dust. Relative humidity and temperature are controlled. The arrangement of miniature sensor electrodes (NiCr, Pt, Ag/AgCl) to carry out meaningful electrochemistry in thin layers has been optimized. Various possible pitfalls in such measurements have been identified. The effect of nitrate ion on corrosion behavior in thin layers of particulate is compared with its effect in bulk liquid environments, and the differences quantified and explained...|$|R
40|$|Re-excavation of a Neolithic site at Slatina - Turska česma in Drenovac near Paraćin {{started in}} 2004. Trench XV, with {{an area of}} 36 sq. m., was {{explored}} between 2004 and 2006. The cultural layer in this trench ended at the depth of approx. 6 m, where a pit was noted and defined as a dwelling structure. The back-fill of the <b>pit</b> and the <b>layer</b> immediately above were covered with alluvium, so that the archaeological finds below the alluvium {{can be considered a}} closed unit. The results of the preliminary analyses of the stratigraphy and small finds below the alluvium have revealed that the pit had been abandoned before the flooding and that, for a longer period, there was no dwelling structure in that place. The main features of the small finds from the pit itself indicate the earlier Neolithic origin, i. e. the earlier period of the Starčevo culture group...|$|R
