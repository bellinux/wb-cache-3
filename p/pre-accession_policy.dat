40|$|Abstract — The {{impact of}} the {{introduction}} of EU Single Area Payments (SAP) on farm strategy in New Member States is investigated for a sample of Lithuanian farms, utilizing farm accounting and survey data. The application of two investment models demonstrates that the credit market in Lithuania was imperfect prior to accession and that some farms were financially constrained. The introduction of the SAP has a significant, positive influence on farmers ’ intentions to expand their farm area compared to a baseline scenario of the continuation of <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy.</b> The switch in policy has a more pronounced effect on farms that were previously credit constrained. While the SAP has been presented as a policy support that is decoupled from production, its introduction will nevertheless have ex post coupled effects, most notably an income multiplier effect on credit constrained farmers...|$|E

40|$|Our paper explores, on a {{theoretical}} level, {{the reason for}} frequent failures of rural development policies and identifies some potential improvements in rural policy making in Europe. Our approach to des/integration concerns actors, resources, institutions, knowledge, the fundamental logic of development, and the interplay between two distinct levels of rural development: the level of policies, or central intervention; {{and the level of}} local aspirations aimed at improving everyday rural life. Along these lines, two characteristic systems of rural development – the central bureaucratic and the local heuristic – can be clearly identified. Ideally, these should work in co-operation, complementing each other, forming an integrated development system, where rural policy serves to (i) channel resources, establish strategic aims and development models in a top-down mode, and (ii) convey information and mediate social, economic, political interests in a bottom-up mode. However, lack of integration and divergence of interest can lead to dysfunction, conflict and dissipation within the system. We argue that rural development policies tend to fail because the central bureaucratic system imposes top-down control and objectives throughout the development process, thus failing to sufficiently promote the reconfiguration of local resources, which is better achieved through bottom-up processes and the local heuristic system. In other words, the tendency to disjunction between the two basic socio-political systems of rural development is the main reason for the failure of rural development policy. The paper offers analytical models of integrated and non-integrated rural development systems and illustrates the argument through some examples taken from the community initiatives and the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policies</b> of the European Union. The study is in two halves. The first half elaborates the concept of ‘integrated rural development’. based on international literature. The second part offers a few new conceptions, as a contribution to the ‘new rural development theory’ and simple models of integrated and non-integrated development.

This article analyses the effects of EU pre-accession programmes on the development of national-level structures for the coordination of EU funds in Croatia. The article is based on an in-depth case study of the Croatian coordination structures for EU funding, using a three-step analytical framework of adaptation. The empirical research focuses on the role and influence of the Croatian Central State Office for Development Strategy and Coordination of EU Funds (CODEF). The main finding was that preaccession assistance played a decisive role in the establishment and early support of national coordination structures. However, holistic reform in the state sector was not achieved and the new institutions were often challenged by domestic opposition structures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{transposition}} of European Union (EU) legislation in the twelve 'new' member states during the post-accession stage. To this end, we scrutinize the number of formal notice letters received by the new member states in the period from 2004 to 2007. Our analysis shows that there is considerable variation in the transposition behaviour. While Lithuania, Hungary as well as Slovenia are the best performers, the transposition of EU legislation is less effective in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and particularly Romania. The comparatively high number of transposition shortcomings by this latter country group clearly indicates that even the process of incorporating European provisions into domestic law is far from unproblematic, which suggests the existence of even more substantive problems with the practical side of implementation. The results of our descriptive analysis show that transposition failure is predominantly related {{to the degree of}} trade with the EU, bureaucratic capacity and <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy</b> alignment. We conclude that in the intermediate-term increasing bureaucratic capacities and stronger economic ties with the EU may help to reduce transposition failures. acquis communautaire; public administration; implementation; economic integration; enlargement; Europeanization; harmonisation; comparative public policy; post-Communism; European law; political science...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{potential}} impact of the introduction of the SFP in EU- 15 and of the SAP in NMS on farmers’ decisions. A survey conducted in Sweden, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2005 investigates farmers’ intentions over the next 5 years in two scenarios: introduction of SFP/SAP, and if the previous policy (Agenda 2000 or <b>pre-accession</b> national <b>policy)</b> remains in place. Results of the survey reveal that the global effect of the CAP switch on Swedish sector seems to be a reduction in production and in the willingness to remain a farmer. By contrast, in Slovakia and Lithuania individual farmers are willing to stay longer in farming and to increase their UAA. As for farmers’ expectation regarding the future of the CAP, the survey results show that in the three countries the most probable policy is continuing decoupled payments. However, the second most probable option is payments recoupled to production activities for Slovakian and Lithuanian farmers, but no payment at all for Swedish farmers...|$|R

Guy Peters, University of PittsburghHow does policy {{implementation}} {{impact on the}} institutionalised capacities of political agents? This question about the link between policy-making and institutional development {{lies at the heart}} of the study. It is inspired by an empirical puzzle about the dynamics of European integration. Since 1993 the European Union has developed a strategic approach to enlargement the most relevant trademark of which has been the criteria which acceding states have to meet before entering the Union. The conditionality-based preaccession policy provided the European Commission with a set of new competences vis-à-vis the candidate states that were not directly derived from the internally applicable legal framework, the acquis communautaire. This kind of conditionality established double standards applicable to the candidate, but not the member states. Scrutinising all cases in which such double standards were created brings to the fore the fact that only in two cases did policies remain indeed limited to the candidate states before accession. In a further three cases the steering instruments the Commission developed in the enlargement context were extended beyond the institutional sub-system of the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy</b> to the institutional core of the acquis: why and how? The theoretical framework draws from functionalist theory. The necessary condition for policies to be integrated from a distinct institutional sub-system – such as the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy</b> that applied to candidate states only – is functional pressure. Double standards create functional pressure for integration per se because they undermine the credibility of the political system in that candidates for membership need to comply with higher standards than members themselves. Functional pressure rises if policies are implemented successfully and if political problems persist so that at the moment of accession they become a common matter of concern for all member states. However, this alone does not explain why a single policy ‘spills-in’ from a sub-system to the institutional core. The sufficient condition and theoretical explanation builds on Theodore Lowi’s arenas of power approach. The variance between the single policies is explained by the policy type at stake that determines which steering instruments emerge in the respective arenas of power. The empirical results show that the Commission indeed extends its steering capacity if policies are formulated as non-binding rules and standards in the regulatory arena or in a restrictive way that limits redistributive effects in the distributive arena. In conclusion, the thesis contributes to three strands of European integration research. First, it offers a theoretically-guided analysis of European Union widening. Enlargement policy is conceptualised as an institutionally linked but distinct arena of institutional rules. The effect that policy-making in such an institutional sub-system has may hence be extended and applied to other institutional sub-systems that are linked to but distinct from the Union’s core legal framework. Second, the study provides insights into the functioning the European Commission and how the organisation continues effectively to extend its steering capacities in the post-Maastricht era. Moreover, the case studies cover policy fields not much discussed in the existing scholarly literature. They therefore provide original research on how the Commission actually develops new responsibilities and implements policies. Third, the findings inform the study of European integration at large. Spelling out how implementing enlargement has been a source for extending the European Commission’s action capacity, the thesis highlights the process of widening as a specific cause for supranational institutionalisation which has so far attained little if any attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{accession}} of Croatia to the European Union is {{yet another}} milestone {{in the history of}} EU enlargements. After seven enlargement rounds the membership has increased from the original six founding countries to twenty-eight Member States. Many claim, quite rightly, that the enlargement policy is the most successful of the EU’s foreign policy tools. Even those who bring this bold argument into doubt have to agree that, when contrasted with other external policies, and the European Neighbourhood Policy in particular, the overall balance sheet of the enlargement policy is positive. The accession of Croatia is symbolic in a number of ways. As argued in this article, it closes one big chapter in the history of EU enlargements but, at the same time, opens another. Croatia is – most likely – the last country to join the EU this decade. After a sometimes painful pre-accession process, it {{has proved to be a}} ‘success story’ of the stabilisation and association process. As the European Commission claims, it is living proof that the raison d’être and mechanics of the policy employed vis-à-vis the Western Balkans have their merits. However, a quick look into the future proves that the next enlargements will be far more complicated affairs. The current list of candidates and potential candidates is a mix of a heavyweight (Turkey) and the Western Balkan countries, all struggling to meet the fundamental prerequisites for a democracy based on the rule of law. Failure to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, together with a dwindling appetite for further enlargement among some Member States, create a rather dangerous mix. This article argues that following recent enhancements to the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy,</b> further improvements are necessary to make future expansions of the European Union possible. If only from the geo-political perspective, this is in the joint interest of the European Union, its Member States and the countries of the Western Balkans...|$|E
40|$|Since {{creation}} of the European Communities the number of Member States has gradually increased from the original six to current twenty-eight. Enlargement has become an EU’s flagship external policy, demonstrating the EU’s ability to shape its neighbourhood and {{to serve as a}} catalyst of deep and multilayered reforms. The consecutive seven enlargement rounds went in parallel with widespread internal developments, culminating with the {{creation of}} the European Union and, most recently, entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. As this volume demonstrates, EU criminal law has evolved considerably from its early days under the legal framework laid down by the Treaty of Maastricht to its current post-Lisbon shape. On 1 December 2014, that is with expiry of a five year transitional regime for the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters became a fully fledged EU policy, governed largely by the same modus operandi as other areas of EU competence and with compulsory jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. As EU criminal law developed internally, so did its external dimension, including the role it plays in the enlargement policy. In case of the latter the expiry of the same transitional period has brought to an end a rather anomalous situation whereby the European Union had more enforcement tools before and after accession vis-à-vis its future/new Member States than it could employ against the old ones. This bifurcation, quite rightly, triggered a lot of discussions about double standards used by the European Union in its <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy.</b> This is exacerbated by {{the fact that some of}} those standards are neither defined in EU law, nor pursued vis-à-vis the existing EU’s Member States. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that evolution with particular emphasis on the role of EU Criminal Law in the policy currently employed by the European Union vis-à-vis candidate and potential candidate countries of the Western Balkans and to Turkey. Arguably, together with political conditionality, it has become one of the pillars of the enlargement process and, as the examples of accession negotiations with Montenegro and Serbia prove, its role is likely to increase as rapprochement of other candidates and potential candidates progresses to the next stages...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} problems {{connected with}} the accession of Central European Countries (CECs) to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). A lot of attention {{is given to the}} analysis of the agricultural situation and prospects in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Also the evolution {{and the future of the}} CAP itself is broadly presented. Since the agricultural accession of CECs to the CAP will have an impact not only on the situation in the agricultural sectors in these countries but also on their overall economic situation, therefore some fiscal consequences are discussed in the end. The CECs problems with agriculture concern mainly the lack of modernisation (know-how), efficiency, and structural changes. The EU also has problems with agriculture. It is too costly. due to the high level of protection and overproduction (connected with storage of the costly surpluses). and unequally developed (there are big differences in rural development among the Member Countries). The accession may, to some extent, solve CECs. and EU. s problems with agriculture, but under the condition, that the CECc will get ready to join the CAP structures, as much as it is possible. Therefore, generally, the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policies</b> in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland should focus on investments in rural development and employment reductions since these policies guarantee improvement of agricultural productivity and improvement of agricultural to non-agricultural income ratio (which are the most desirable goals). It should be remembered, however, that the changes in agricultural sector need usually more time than the changes in other sectors so the agricultural accession of CECs to the CAP should come after the agricultural reorganisation. The pre-accession changes in agriculture will be co-financed by the EU. As far as budgetary effects are concerned, the pre-accession agricultural aid from the EU has little or no direct budgetary effects for the applicant countries. After the accession, the budgetary outflows from national CECs budgets to CAP will exceed budgetary inflows from CAP. This is because transfers from Member Countries to CAP come from national budgets but transfers from the CAP mostly do not come through the central national budgets but they are directed to the national paying agencies. agriculture, Common Agricultural Policy, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland...|$|R

In order to analyze the implications of alternative accession scenarios, we construct a simulation model of the agricultural economies in Eastern Europe and explore the consequences of various regimes of trade and support policies under different scenarios concerning the terms in the treaties of accession. The analysis focuses on the relationship between different negotiated accession contracts, <b>pre-accession</b> agricultural support <b>policies,</b> restructuring in the agricultural sector, and sectoral performance. The analysis suggests that the choice of transitional policies adopted during the pre-accession period are far more important in determining outcomes in the agricultural sector than are the terms of accession to the EU.

40|$|The time is {{not only}} ripe but {{pressing}} for the EU and {{the states of the}} Western Balkans to recalibrate and reinforce the current <b>pre-accession</b> strategy.

Eurozone doctrine should be adapted to realities. Rather than regarding the use of the euro by Montenegro and Kosovo as an unfortunate turn of events, {{the costs and benefits of}} unilateral adoption of the euro by not-yet member states of the region should be more openly appraised, and the option to ‘euroise’ recognised as a possibility. It is good that the EU has moved at the declaratory level towards visa ‘liberalisation’, which means scrapping visas rather than just ‘facilitation’ measures. However the Commission has not yet published guidelines or timelines for this. The region should be put on track for access to the Structural Funds on terms and scales progressively approaching those from which new member states such as Bulgaria and Romania already benefit. The ratio of these aid receipts between the new member states and the Western Balkans is currently 4 : 1; the former are receiving more than they can handle efficiently, whereas the Western Balkans have huge unsatisfied needs. Overall the case is made for significant moves towards ‘functional membership’ of the whole of the region with the EU, which would be a highly useful advance, irrespective of how or when the EU overcomes its Lisbon Treaty hiatus...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the latest CAP review in the EU New Member States (NMS) represents not only {{a change in the}} form of payments (from fully coupled to partially decoupled payments) but also an increase in the level of payments received by farmers. It is expected that farm restructuring in the NMS will be accelerated as greater payments, given with no obligation to produce, might allow those farmers who are willing to exit the farming sector to get the required funds to do so. If so, this might also give those farmers willing to increase the size of their farm more opportunities to expand. However, the transition to a market economy in these countries being still quite recent, the conditions under which the policy is implemented present some specificity as markets are likely to be less than perfect. The objective of the paper is to understand what impact the change in policy will have in one of the NMS, namely Slovakia, taking into account the impact of some potential market imperfections. This question is considered by assessing commercial individual farmers’ willingness to increase their scale of farming. The investigation focuses on land only, and will be based on the intention of Slovak farmers to alter the land area they intend to farm in the future, in the context of continuing <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy</b> (fully coupled support) and the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS, partially decoupled support). The determinants of the willingness to expand are estimated under different policy scenarios, as well as the determinants of a change in willingness to expand across scenarios. The analysis reveals that the determinants of the willingness to expand differ under coupled and decoupled policy as in particular the level of human capital does not seem to matter under SAPS. However, the introduction of SAPS might not greatly influence farm restructuring in Slovakia. Due to a less than perfect land market, farmers will have increased incentives to expand their farm and increased incentives to remain in farming. This means that farmers, despite their willingness to grow, {{might not be able to}} do so as land supplied by exiting individual farmers is unlikely to increase. However, the future supply of land also depends on the dynamism of other types of farms such as corporate farms...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 reform {{represents}} a significant {{shift in the}} EU policy, particularly in its movement to decoupled support. The potential impact of the reform depends {{on a range of}} factors including the modalities of its implementation and the structure of farming sectors in different countries. The then acceding countries had the flexibility to choose to implement the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or to opt for the simplified Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS). This paper attempts to provide a comparative overview of the level and distributional aspects of direct payments across seven New Member States (NMS) covering different sub-regions, the Baltics, Central and Eastern Europe, and the two most recent Member States from the Balkans – Bulgaria and Romania. Although the choice of 10 out of 12 NMS was similar – to implement SAPS – the preaccession policies, the structure of agricultural output and the distribution of farm sizes have created substantial differences in the distribution of support and the choices between decoupled and coupled Complementary National Direct Payments (CNDP) or ‘top-ups’. As expected, due to the phasing-in process there has been a tendency of increased payments per hectare over time; however this increase has not been uniformly manifested. The differences in the output structure and labour intensity, as well as the large differences in farm structures and farm size distribution have brought about substantial differences in amounts of direct payments per beneficiary and AWU. One of the countries with the most concentrated land use in large farms, some of them corporate farms (companies or co-operatives), are the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Hungary and Bulgaria occupy the middle ground, whilst the Baltic States, Poland and Romania are characterised by small size farms almost across the board. This variety across the NMS has substantial implications for several aspects of SAPS implementation and its beneficiaries, including the amount of direct payments per beneficiary, the average size of beneficiary and the share of holdings benefitting from the scheme. The share of beneficiaries varies from a small segment of the holdings covered by the Farm Structure Survey (FSS), as for example in Bulgaria and Slovakia, to covering almost all holdings included in FSS (Lithuania). One of the positive signals is that in some NMS the concentration of SAP on a small segment has been decreasing (although slowly) in parallel with the increasing farmers and administration experiences. All these structural and distributional differences mean that setting payments limitations or including (eventually) the NMS in a system of progressive modulation may have widely different effects on different NMS and thus may generate substantially different political positions. Analytical survey results are presented concerning the change (or the lack of) of farmers strategic plans {{as a result of the}} implementation of SAPS in two of the above NMS with contrasting farm structures and payment distribution. The results indicate that as the implementation of SAPS means more predictable and increasing payments in comparison to the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>policy</b> the main change in the strategic farmers’ plans is their increased willingness to stay longer in farming and increase the farm area operated. The expected response to 2003 CAP reform, namely lower incentives to produce and increased drive to diversification to non-farm activities was not detected in this early survey in NMS. However, it is difficult to disentangle the changes induced by SAPS from the general expectations due to accession to the EU.
