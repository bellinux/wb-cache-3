50|$|Offender <b>profiling,</b> {{also known}} as {{criminal}} <b>profiling,</b> is an investigative tool used by law enforcement agencies to identify likely suspects (descriptive offender <b>profiling)</b> and analyze patterns that may predict future offenses and/or victims (predictive offender <b>profiling).</b> Offender <b>profiling</b> dates back to 1888 and the spree of Jack the Ripper, and the <b>profiling</b> theory describes how <b>profiling</b> will ideally work. Current applications include predictive <b>profiling,</b> sexual assault offender <b>profiling,</b> and case linkage (using <b>profiling</b> to identify common factors in offenses and to help with suspect identification).|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} unified, low-overhead {{framework}} (ULF) to support continuous system <b>profiling</b> and optimization {{based on a}} specifically designed embedded board. Instead of building a new <b>profiling</b> tool from scratch, ULF provides a unified interface to integrate various existing <b>profiling</b> tools and optimizers, and helps to easily build future tools. ULF uses an embedded processor to offload tasks of post-processing <b>profiling</b> data, which reduces system overhead caused by <b>profiling</b> tools and makes ULF especially suitable for continuous <b>profiling</b> on production systems. By processing the <b>profiling</b> data in parallel and providing feedback promptly, ULF supports on-line optimization. Our case study on I/O <b>profiling</b> demonstrated that ULFenhanced <b>profiling</b> tool dramatically reduces overhead making continuous <b>profiling</b> on production systems feasible.

We also assess whether greenhouse studies {{can be used to}} predict shoot and root glucosinolate concentrations and <b>profiles</b> in the field. Root glucosinolate <b>profiles</b> showed significant intra-specific variation; however, this variation was unrelated to that in shoot <b>profiles.</b> One of the strongest determinants of the diversity in the root <b>profiles</b> was 2 -phenylethyl glucosinolate (gluconasturtiin). Root <b>profiles</b> were generally comparable between greenhouse studies and field trials, whereas shoot <b>profiles</b> were highly plastic. We conclude that among white cabbage cultivars, shoot glucosinolate <b>profiles</b> are not indicative of root <b>profiles.</b> We further conclude that greenhouse assessments of root glucosinolates can be reliable predictors of root glucosinolate <b>profiles</b> in the field due to their low plasticity. ...|$|R
