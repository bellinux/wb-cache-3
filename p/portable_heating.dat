40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, {{the use of}} {{traditional}} nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for detection of HIV- 1 DNA or RNA has been restricted to laboratory settings due to time, equipment, and technical expertise requirements. The availability of a rapid NAAT with applicability for resource-limited or point-of-care (POC) settings would fill a great need in HIV diagnostics, allowing for timely diagnosis or confirmation of infection status, as well as facilitating the diagnosis of acute infection, screening and evaluation of infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Isothermal amplification methods, such as reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for POC settings, since they are typically quicker, easier to perform, and allow for integration into low-tech, <b>portable</b> <b>heating</b> devices. METHODOLOGY/SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: In this study, we evaluated the HIV- 1 RT-LAMP assay using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heating devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water.

The performance of the NINA heaters was validated using whole blood specimens from HIV- 1 infected patients.

40|$|Cell {{culture has}} been a {{fundamental}} tool {{for the study of}} cell biology, tissue engineering, stem cell technology and biotechnology in general. It becomes more and more important to have a well-defined physiochemical microenvironment during cell culture. Conventional cell cultures employ expensive, manually controlled incubation equipment, making it difficult to maximize a cultures yield. Furthermore, previous studies use qualitative methods to assess cell culture proliferation that are inherently inaccurate and labour intensive, thereby increasing the cost of production. In addition, three dimensional cell culture, in scaffold, has been shown to provide more physiological relevant information as it mimic more accurate conditions that are similar to the physiological conditions of the human body compared with two dimension, which has special interest to regenerative medicine. Therefore, a portable and automated total-analysis-system (μTAS) was proposed with microenvironment control and quantitative analysis techniques to monitor cell proliferation and metabolic activity. The automated <b>portable</b> <b>heating</b> system was validated to be capable to maintain a stable physiochemical microenvironment, with little margin of error, for cellular substrate outside of conventional incubation. A standalone platform system was designed and fabricated with accurate temperature control by employing an optically transparent ITO-film with a large heating area. The transparency of the film is critical for continuous in-situ microscopic observation over long-term cell culture process. Previous studies have attempted to use ITO-film as a heating element, but were unable to distribute the heat evenly onto the microbioreactor platform. This nagging problem in the literature was improved through a novel film design. As a result, the ITO-film based heating system was evaluated and constructed successfully to serve as a heating element for long-term static cell culture with facilitated proliferation rate in gas-permeable PDMS microbioreactor outside of conventional incubation. In addition to maintaining a stable microenvironment, a non-invasive in-situ technology for monitoring cell viability and proliferation rate was constructed and developed based on bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). It was primarily focused on making decisions for structure and specification of proposed system-on a chip BIS measurement. The miniaturization of BIS system on microbioreactor platform was achieved by utilizing and integrating switching matrix array, impedance analyzer chip with reliable analogue-front-end circuitry. The realized system was verified with the DLD- 1 cells and its monitored data were validated with conventional bioassays. Three dimensional cell cultures with scaffold is a key to the success of tissue engineering. Engineered cornea collagen scaffold may be feasible using re-seeding proper human cells onto a decellularized corneal scaffold. The quality of the scaffold and the interaction of the cells are critical to the key function (i. e transparency, haze and total transmittance) of final products. An integrated corneal collagen scaffold quality assessment system, via optical property inspection unit, was innovatively designed and realized with non-invasive and non-destructive haracteristics. The H 1299 cells were seeded onto inspected corneal scaffold and BIS system, which were realized in the previous chapter, were used to validate its applicability for 3 D cell culture. The cell adhesion as an outcome at different scaffolds with different optical properties has revealed the importance of the microstructure of scaffold on the cell functions. The results showed the developed technologies can be used for the quality control of corneal scaffold and the fabricated μTAS not only enabled environmental control but, with BIS-based in-situ assay, it also facilitate the function (i. e adhesion) and viability monitoring with quantitative and qualitative analysis in 3 D-alike cell culture. Additionally, by considering its low decontamination and cost-effective nature with compatibility for highthroughput screening applications, the fabricated and integrated systems has significant applications in tissue engineering. </p...|$|E

The ECG machine was a <b>portable</b> <b>heated</b> stylus direct writing AT- 2 Swiss made electrocardiograph (Schiller AG Cardiovit CH 6341). Results: There were 350 males (53. 3 %) and 300 females (46. 7 %), with a male:female ratio of 1. 2 : 1. The mean heart rate decreased with increasing age. R-wave amplitudes were higher in the left precordial leads, in keeping with left ventricular dominance. Mean values were higher in boys than girls in the three age-groups in most of the precordial and limb leads. In V 4 R, V 2, and V 3 highest mean R wave voltages of 0. 5 ± 0. 1, 1. 4 ± 0. 3, and 1. 4 ± 0. 2 mV, respectively, were recorded in the 5 - 7 -year-old.

50|$|This {{concept was}} first {{postulated}} by Funk and Reinstrom (1966) as a reflexion {{about the most}} efficient way to produce fuels (e.g. hydrogen, ammonia) from stable and abundant species (e.g. water, nitrogen) and heat sources. Although fuel availability was scarcely considered before the oil crisis era, these researches were justified by niche markets. As an example, in the military logistics field, providing fuels for vehicles in remote battlefields is a key task. Hence, a mobile production system based on a <b>portable</b> <b>heat</b> source (a specific nuclear reactor was strikingly considered) was being investigated with the uttermost interest.Following the crisis, many programs (Europe,Japan,USA) were set up to design, test and qualify such processes for more peaceful purposes such as energy independence. High temperature (1000K) nuclear reactors were still considered as the heat sources. However, the optimistic expectations of the first thermodynamics studies were quickly moderated by more pragmatic analysis based on fair comparisons with standard technologies (thermodynamic cycles for electricity generation, coupled with the electrolysis of water) and by numerous practical issues (not high enough temperatures with nuclear reactors, slow reactivities, reactor corrosion, significant losses of intermediate compounds with time...). Hence, the interest for this technology was fading away during the next decades, or at least some tradeoffs (hybrid versions) were being considered with the use of electricity as a fractional energy input instead of only heat for the reactions (e.g. Hybrid sulfur cycle). A rebirth in the year 2000 can be explained by both new energy crisis and the rapid pace of development of concentrated solar power technologies whose potentially very high temperatures are ideal for thermochemical processes, while the environmentally friendly side of these researches attracts funding in a period with the peak oil shadow.|$|R

The range of jet Reynolds numbers considered was 63 to 1500; the applied compartment heat load ranged from 5 W- 15 W. Radiation effects were significant over the range of Reynolds numbers and heat loads considered, while the effect of natural convection was only noticeable for configurations when the ratio Gr/Re 2 exceeded 5. The predicted importance of Re rather than jet size was confirmed with test data. Proof of concept was demonstrated with a numerical model representative of a full laptop computer.
