25|$|Introduced by the Liberal {{government}} under Pierre Trudeau on October 28, 1980, the controversial National Energy Program (NEP) had three objectives: energy self-sufficiency; redistributing wealth from a non-sustainable resource {{to benefit the}} country as a whole; and increased ownership of the oil industry by Canadians. As implemented, the NEP gave the Federal government control over petroleum prices, imposing a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> and export duties.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} {{opted to}} use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn. This price control {{came in the}} form of the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> at 8.50 pesos per kilogram of tortilla. The hope was that a ceiling on corn prices would provide incentive for the market to lower all prices nationally.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. had to run a balance of payments current account deficit to provide liquidity for the conversion of gold into U.S. dollars. With more U.S. dollars in the system than were backed with gold under the Bretton Woods agreement, the U.S. dollar was overvalued. This meant that the United States had less gold as foreign governments started converting U.S. dollars to gold and taking it offshore. Foreign speculators were not a direct part of the gold flow out of the US, as under the Bretton Woods Agreement, only governments could exchange US currency for physical gold. Additionally, while the Bretton Woods Agreement was in place, direct speculation by US citizens who were banned from owning any gold other than jewelry following Executive Order 6102 which was enacted in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and enabled the US Government to confiscate all gold coinage, gold certificates, and gold bullion held by any citizen, did not contribute to the price imbalance and arbitrage opportunity via a wide disparity of gold prices between the US and other markets. A <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> had been enacted which fixed the price of gold at $35/oz USD following the previously mentioned gold confiscation from US citizens in 1933. As with all price controls, this caused supply and demand imbalances and an arbitrage opportunity which rapidly depleted the United States gold reserves. This led to less gold in the country and caused the US Dollar to become more overvalued, leading to a self-propagating cycle. Furthermore, the US had to run a balance of payments current account surplus to maintain confidence in the U.S. dollar.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 February 2014, the USAF reasserted the bomber's need at {{the annual}} Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Fla. It was stated it will be fielded in the mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the bombers will be procured. Lt. Gen. Burton Field {{clarified}} the 80 to 100 range is due to uncertainty over the price rather than a figure representing the minimum number of bombers needed to mitigate risk. Some USAF leaders expect the unit cost limit of $550 million per aircraft will be exceeded with additional equipment added to the airframe. The cost goal is to set design constraints to prevent extra requirements for capability growth desires and untested technologies that would increase the price more from being incorporated during development. Though the final cost may be greater than planned, a fixed price objective is expected to keep average procurement costs affordable. Rather than the <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> being too low to meet requirements, the USAF sees this arrangement as itself and the potential contractor being disciplined about the bomber's missions and roles. Research and development expenses {{are likely to be}} [...] "significant", but not expected to be double the cost of production aircraft.|$|E

50|$|A <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> is a government-imposed {{price control}} or limit on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments intend price {{ceilings}} to protect consumers from conditions {{that could make}} commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation or in monopolistic markets. In spite of these goals, a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> can cause problems if imposed {{for a long period}} without controlled rationing, and can lead to shortages. Furthermore, price ceilings can lead to serious problems if a government sets unrealistic prices. In an unregulated market economy price ceilings do not exist.|$|E
40|$|After a 2002 European Commission {{regulation}} {{prohibited the}} use of dealer-exclusive territories, automobile franchise contracts in Italy introduced <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> and standards on verifiable marketing and service inputs, such as advertising and salespeople.

The introduction of standards suggests that, consistent {{with a view of}} vertical restraints as coordination mechanisms, manufacturers used exclusive territories to induce desired dealer services, and, once {{the use of}} exclusive territories was prohibited, they switched to alternative contractual devices to achieve this goal. The introduction of <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> despite free intrabrand competition also suggests that car manufacturers tried to prevent some dealers from gaming the quantity floors by selling to other dealers' customers while charging monopolistic prices at their own locations.

5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{advocate the}} implementation of a free market system to combat the organ shortage that helps drive illegal organ trade. [...] The organ trade's illegal status creates a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> for organs at zero dollars. This <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> affects supply and demand, creating a shortage of organs {{in the face of a}} growing demand. According to a report published by the Cato Institute, a U.S.-based libertarian think tank, eliminating the <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> would eliminate the organ shortage. [...] However, the idea of organ [...] "scarcity" [...] had been opposed by Ivan Illich and other authors, who argue that [...] "scarcity" [...] is an [...] "artificially created need." [...] These critics argue that there is not an actual shortage of organs, but rather a surplus of [...] "excess and wasted" [...] organs. Scarcity only exists for some groups of people: those who are denied the organs, and those who cannot afford them. Thus, what needs to be regulated, according to these authors, is organ procurement and distribution practices.|$|E
