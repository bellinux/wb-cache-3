40|$|The US is {{currently}} caught between its international {{obligations to the}} World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 7) and its domestic obligations to US workers in the textile and clothing industries. As of January 1, 2005, quantitative restrictions on Chinese imports have been officially phased out-under {{the auspices of the}} WTO-thereby allowing a greater influx of Chinese goods into Member countries. The US, however, has contracted with the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (2 ̆ 2 China 2 ̆ 2) to work around this phase-out. By means of the US-China <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Provision</b> (2 ̆ 2 <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Provision</b> 2 ̆ 2), the US has contracted with China to allow the US to institute restrictions on Chinese imports for three additional years between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008. Thus, during this transition period, the US violates the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s mission of ensuring equality in international trade by creating its own exception to the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s nondiscrimination rule, as opposed to confining itself to a WTO-created exception. While China has announced its intent to impose tariffs on some of its own textile exports, such measures will not release the US from its responsibility to actively enforce WTO principles when vast numbers of cheap Chinese goods continue to enter the US market. The actions of the US are problematic from a policy perspective, though not necessarily from a legal one, for two reasons. First, the influence of the US in working toward liberalized trade is diminished when the US chooses not to follow the uniform rules of the GATT but instead creates its own, more favorable <b>safeguard</b> <b>provision,</b> thereby opening the door for other Members to follow in its footsteps. Accordingly, as a leader in the international community and {{a founding member of the}} WTO, the US must avoid any appearance of impropriety and must avoid setting a precedent for accepted defiance of the GATT. Second, it is unclear that the <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Provision</b> actually benefits the US and its WTO trading partners in the long term. Therefore, instead of simply holding onto uncompetitive US industries for three extra years, the US must innovate to become competitive in new industries...|$|R

Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) <b>safeguard</b> <b>provisions</b> for pork, Japan can raise its gate price by 24 percent when imports in a given quarter are 119 percent higher than the average imports of the last three years of the same quarter. Japan has already invoked the <b>safeguard</b> <b>provision</b> twice since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) was signed in 1995. In both cases, the level and volatility of retail prices increased; the CIF values of imports increased, making the impact on the government of Japan (GOJ) tax revenue uncertain; the level of imports and stocks increased; and the timing of imports changed. New underlying parameter estimates suggest that the reduction in pork exporters’ profit is three times higher when the Japanese General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) safeguard is invoked, providing foreign pork suppliers an incentive to collude to avoid exceeding the trigger. Workable and efficient allocation rules are constructed with a multi-plant monopolist structure that allows trade of quota.

40|$|PhDThis is a {{study of}} legal limits of the {{exercise}} of intellectual property, with emphasis on chip designs. In Part One, {{the focus is on}} the economics of innovation dynamics and the nature of the social bargain underlying intellectual property. It analyses the function of intellectual property and the structure of protection of chip designs under the US chip law, the IPIC Treaty and the Agreement on TRIPS. It suggests that while protection of intellectual property is designed to promote technical innovation and enhance competition in the public favour, the innovation process is carried out in conditions of increasingly imperfect competition. On these grounds, a point is made to limit the exercise of proprietary rights in the welfare/efficiency perspective. Part Two addresses the treatment of legal limitations. An analysis is made concerning the evolution of the <b>safeguarding</b> <b>provisions</b> on which unauthorised use of copyright and patent in the British legal system relies. These safeguards, structured within the intellectual property law, have gradually been developed to also rely on a resurgent competition legislation, which has been considerably used by OECD countries to order the exercise of proprietary rights. The ability of modem competition law to induce an intellectual property order, and the features of the adjudicatory process of non-voluntary licences over UK patents are also examined. From the findings the emergence of; namely, a safeguarding policy is identified. The conceptualisation of this institutional policy, aiming at efficiency and welfare objectives related to the exercise of proprietary rights, is a central theme. It shows that <b>safeguarding</b> <b>provisions</b> intrinsic to intellectual property law is insufficient to pursue these objectives, and holds that to protect intellectual property without an effective control of anti-competitive practices is a distorting and unsustainable legal policy...|$|R

40|$|This study surveys <b>safeguard</b> <b>provisions</b> {{on trade}} in goods in 232 {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) notified to the GATT/WTO up to 31 December 2012. In particular, it identifies those RTAs that modify the conditions applicable to the RTA partner (either substantively or procedurally) {{in the event that}} a global safeguard is invoked. In the case of bilateral (or intra-RTA safeguards), the study analyses provisions governing injury assessment, causation, conditions for the invocation of a measure and the types of measures that may be employed. We use the yardstick of GATT Article XIX and the WTO Safeguards Agreement to determine whether the provisions applicable to bilateral safeguard measures are more or less stringent than the corresponding multilateral rules. The study also includes an inventory of infant industry, balance of payments, and special safeguards applicable to agricultural products found in RTAs. We demonstrate through various examples that <b>safeguard</b> <b>provisions</b> have become more prescriptive in recent years, though little homogeneity in their design is found even for a given country. In the case of global safeguards, roughly a quarter of RTAs provide for the possible exclusion of the RTA partner, subject to certain criteria, thus discriminating against non-parties. In the case of bilateral safeguards, some RTAs use looser language to define the trigger mechanism to invoke a safeguard and to determine injury standards, thus potentially offering greater scope to use such measures. We found wide variety in the types of bilateral safeguard measures that are permitted in RTAs. A number of more recent RTAs tighten the conditions for application of a bilateral safeguard through limiting the duration of the safeguard measure, allowing the use of tariff-based measures only, and binding the use of the measure to the transition period. Other RTAs specify neither the length of the bilateral safeguard measure nor the conditions for its reapplication, thus providing greater scope to impose such measures than in the multilateral context...|$|R

Analysis of the existing agricultural safeguard, to which the special agricultural safeguard is similar, indicates that it has functioned not as an allowance for occasional response to unusual situations but as an expansion of the limits Members have accepted through tariff bindings. To be useful, the special agricultural safeguard should do more than provide formulas for import restrictions. It should provide for objective and participatory processes that would bring forward relevant information and guide an objective and balanced accounting of the interests at play.
