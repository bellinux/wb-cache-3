40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{linguistic}} characteristics of the central dialect zone of the Russian language and reviews various points of view on the formation of subdialects in this area. It is generally agreed that archaic language features are better retained in <b>peripheral</b> (<b>marginal)</b> dialects, while the central dialect is more subject to innovation. The issue of the oppositional nature of the central and <b>peripheral</b> (<b>marginal)</b> subdialects of Russian was initially raised by K. F. Zakharova and V. G. Orlova in their work The Dialectal Division of the Russian Language. The linguistic terrain mapped in their Russian Dialect Atlas based on phonetic and grammatical features {{made it possible to}} identify the dialectal center and periphery of the territory indigenously occupied by Russians, i. e. at the centre of the European part ofRussia. However, only some linguists have recognized the importance of this opposition between centre and periphery. Among those who have is S. V. Bromley, whose research focuses on central and peripheral language varieties. At their core, the central subdialects of Russian are descended from the Rostov-Suzdal dialect, as discussed in the works of R. I. Avanasov, K. V. Gorshkov, G. A. Khaburgaev. The opposition between centre and periphery was discovered thanks to analysis of phonetic and grammatical characteristics. However, the central subdialects are also determined by a number of accentual and lexical features, some are fairly ancient. For example, the persistence of such words as радуга -дуга (‘rainbow’), елоха (‘alder’), молотилка (‘threshing head of an agricultural flail’). Some counterparts of these words are found in the Southern Slavonic dialect region. Russian subdialects belonging to the central dialect zone are considered to be <b>peripheral</b> (<b>marginal)</b> in relation to the whole of the Slavic language spectrum and have their counterparts in other marginal regions of the Slavic world. </p...|$|R

Studies show that lobbying and political pressure exerted by special-interest groups are not atypical behavior in a modern democracy (Buchanan and Tullock 1962).

Improving a voter’s information makes her more willing to vote, consistent with a growing body of empirical evidence, but makes her peers more willing to abstain, providing a new explanation for various empirical patterns of voting.

Recently, a large-scale retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen, in which 315 different genes were mutated, that resulted in obvious phenotypic defects by 5 days postfertilization was completed. That the disrupted gene has been identified in each of these mutants provides unique resource through which the formation, function, or physiology of individual organ systems can be studied. To that end, a screen for visual system mutants was performed on 250 of the mutants in this collection, examining each of them histologically for morphological defects in the eye and behaviorally for overall visual system function. Forty loci whose disruption resulted in defects in eye development and/or visual function were identified.

40|$|The crucial {{function}} of blood platelets in hemostasis {{is to prevent}} blood loss by stable thrombus formation. This process is driven by orchestrated mechanisms including several signal transduction cas-cades and morphologic transformations. The cytoplasmic microtubule modulator RanBP 10 is a Ran and 1 -tubulin binding protein that is essential for platelet gran-ule release and mice lacking RanBP 10 harbor a severe bleeding phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that RanBP 10 -nullizygous platelets show normal adhe-sion on collagen and von Willebrand fac-tor under flow conditions. However, using a ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombo-sis model, the formation of stable thrombi was significantly impaired, preventing vessel occlusion or leading to recanaliza-tion and thromboembolization. Delta-granule secretion was normal in mutant mice, whereas platelet shape change in aggregometry was attenuated. Lack of RanBP 10 leads to increased 1 -tubulin protein, which drives -monomers into polymerized microtubules. In mutant platelets agonists failed to contract the <b>peripheral</b> <b>marginal</b> band or centralize granules. Pretreatment of wild-type plate-lets with taxol caused microtubule stabili-zation and phenocopied the attenuated shape change in response to collagen, suggesting that RanBP 10 inhibits prema-ture microtubule polymerization of 1 -tubulin and plays {{a pivotal role in}} throm-bus stabilization.

40|$|In {{species of}} the monogenean {{helminth}} Gyrodactylus, the opisthaptor is the main organ of attachment to the host. The opisthaptor comprises two large centrally positioned hooks or hamuli and sixteen peripherally distributed marginal hooks. This paper describes the functional morphology and the mechanism and sequence of attachment in this species. Information on the attachment process was gathered from observations of live gyrodactylids, from transmission electron microscopy, from scanning electron microscopy of skeletal elements, and by histochemical and X-ray elemental analysis of hook chemical composition. The marginal hooks provide the principal force of attachment whilst the hamuli are not actively employed {{in the process of}} attachment. Instead, the hamuli provide a system preventing accidental dislodgement and assist the action of the marginal hooks. Attachment is achieved by the alternating action of two systems of muscles attached respectively to the hamuli and to the marginal hooks. Relaxation or contraction of the muscles connected to the hamuli manoeuvres the hamuli over the extremities of the accessory ventral bar and allows them to pivot around their longitudinal axis, effectively raising or lowering the opisthaptoral dome. Under reduced opisthaptoral tension, the independent gaffing activity of the marginal hooks ensures a secure attachment to the host's epidermis. Repositioning of the hamuli then raises the opisthaptoral dome to tension the <b>peripheral</b> <b>marginal</b> hooks. The sequence of attachment is complete when all the muscles associated with the hooks {{are in a state of}} relaxation but are held securely and under tension by the surrounding, stretched, opisthaptoral dome...|$|R

The author focuses on oikonyms suffixed with -itsy/-itchi and those containing Balto-Fennic words kontu, kondu, kond ‘peasant household’ and selgä, vuara ‘mountain’. The areal analysis shows that oikonyms in -itsy/-itchi resulted from adaptation of Vepsian and Karelian names and outline the ways of ancient migrations of the Russians from Lake Ladoga region to Svir River and Lake Onega regions (Prisvirye and Obonezhye), Eastern Lake Onega region being a peripheral zone of the area traced by the model in question. The author argues that the few settlement names with the stem Kond- have relatively late origins, most likely Vepsian, though for some toponyms the Karelian origin {{is not to be}} ruled out. The low productivity of the selgä oikonymic model and the absence of settlement names with the determinant -vara {{can be explained by the}} historical dominance of the naming patterns using the Russian term gora ‘mountain’ which brings this region closer to the territory of the Russian North. The areal, statistic and linguistic analysis of the settlement names of Eastern Lake Onega region testifies to its marginal position as related to the Vepsian territories on the South, as well as the Karelian territories on the West and the Northern Russian lands on the East. This <b>peripheral,</b> <b>marginal</b> position of the region is due to its geographic features, first and foremost, to its association with the transit waterway which was, in the past, the Vodla River...|$|R

Information on bone structure is needed, {{as a basis for}} improving these procedures. There are, however, no data available on the distribution of mineral density within vertebral endplates. In this study the regional distribution of mineralization within the cervical endplates with respect to endplate orientation (inferior and superior endplate) and level distribution (C 3 –C 7) was examined by means of computed tomographic osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM). The distribution of mineralization in 80 cervical endplates of 8 spinal columns (4 male, 4 female, age range 38 – 62  years) in vertebrae C 3 –C 7 was investigated by CT osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM). The subchondral mineralization distribution revealed considerable topographic differences within each endplate, whereby the areas of greatest density were found in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>marginal</b> zones with maxima in the posterolateral surface, whereas mineralization density was much lower in the central areas. The superior endplates showed an additional posteromedial maximum, whereas the inferior endplates showed an additional anterior mineralization maximum. Comparison of the distribution patters of inferior and superior endplates at different levels from C 3 to C 7 reveals a uniform increase of mineralization in the anterior portions from cranial to caudal. The mineralization distribution showed characteristic reproducible patterns. The maximal values occurred in the posterolateral parts, and can thus be considered a morphological substrate of high long-term loading. This can serve as a basis for improved prosthesis design and the anchorage point for various fusion techniques...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{scientific}} study of mummies provides an insight {{into the life of}} past populations. Using CT-Osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM), a noninvasive technique based on conventional CT-data sets, it is possible to visualize the mineral density distribution in the subchondral bone plate, representing the long-term loading conditions of the articulation surface. The objective of the current study was to investigate the applicability of CT-OAM on mummies for the load analysis of joints as a new investigation technique in the field of mummy research. Material and methods: In order to clarify if apparent malpositions of the spinal column have existed during lifetime or occurred post-mortem, we evaluated the long-term loading patterns within the thoracic and lumbar endplates of 8 mummies. Results: The implementation of CT-OAM on mummies for load analysis of joints was feasible. The mineral density distribution within the endplates was not homogenous but followed distinct distribution patterns. In all of the endplates investigated the marginal zones were higher and the central areas lower mineralized, whereby the areas of greatest density were found in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>marginal</b> zones. The vertebra columns without malposition showed within the thoracic endplates an almost even circular allocation of the density maxima, whereas within the lumbar endplates an increased localization of the density maxima dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventral was observed. The thoracic endplates of the spines with kyphosis did not show an even circular allocation anymore but a concentration of the density maxima in the ventral area and the endplates of the spines with scoliosis exhibited a predominant localization of the density maxima on the concave side. The examined endplates showed characteristic reproducible density patterns consistent with the long-term loading conditions. Conclusions: With help of CT-OAM pathological load distributions can be visualized before macroscopical changes appear and the information obtained can be useful to solve paleopathological and paleoarchaeological questions...|$|R

However, critical knowledge gaps remain on specific B cell changes and immune adaptation in chronic infections. We hypothesized that expansion of atypical memory B cells (aMBCs) and reduction of activated <b>peripheral</b> <b>marginal</b> zone (MZ) -like B cells in constantly exposed individuals might be accompanied by phenotypic changes that would confer a tolerogenic profile, helping to establish tolerance to infections. To better understand malaria-associated phenotypic abnormalities on B cells, we analyzed {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from 55 pregnant women living in a malaria-endemic area of Papua Nueva Guinea and 9 Spanish malaria-naïve individuals using four 11 -color flow cytometry panels. We assessed the expression of markers of B cell specificity (IgG and IgM), activation (CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, b 220, TACI, and CD 150), inhibition (PD 1, CD 95, and CD 71), and migration (CCR 3, CXCR 3, and CD 62 l). We found higher frequencies of active and resting aMBC and marked reduction of MZ-like B cells, although changes in absolute cell counts could not be assessed. Highly exposed women had higher PD 1 +-, CD 95 +-, CD 40 +-, CD 71 +-, and CD 80 +-activated aMBC frequencies than non-exposed subjects. Malaria exposure increased frequencies of b 220 and proapoptotic markers PD 1 and CD 95, and decreased expression of the activation marker TACI on MZ-like B cells. The increased frequencies of inhibitory and apoptotic markers on activated aMBCs and MZ-like B cells in malaria-exposed adults suggest an immune-homeostatic mechanism for maintaining B cell development and function while simultaneously downregulating hyperreactive B cells. This mechanism would keep the B cell activation threshold high enough to control infection but impaired enough to tolerate it, preventing systemic inflammation...|$|R

The periphery {{of the range of}} at least 1400 taxa extends into British Columbia. Over 900 of these appear on the Red and Blue Lists prepared by the Conservation Data Centre. Conversely, less than half of British Columbia’s endemic taxa or taxa for which the province has significant global stewardship responsibility appear on the Red and Blue Lists.

We document the degree to which each enters provincial Red and Blue Lists. The Conservation Data Centre generates the Red and Blue Lists using seven ranking factors. These factors are correlated in a fashion that biases politically peripheral populations towards rankings of artificially high risk. Thus, the lists have little utility in guiding conservation priorities. Recovery plans for most politically peripheral species appear doomed to failure for sound biological reasons. We note alternative approaches to evaluating species for conservation action and recommend that conservation efforts for peripheral species be focused on disjunct populations, rather than politically peripheral populations...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} political incentives for {{redistribution of income}} and allocation policies in competitive democracies. In Chapter 2, I examine incentives for political redistribution through in-kind transfers. By analyzing the political game between office-motivated politicians and self-interested citizens, I first show that in economies with competitive markets in-kind transfers are not required. Politicians can win elections targeting groups of voters with differential cash transfers. However, in-kind transfers arise {{in the presence of}} externalities in consumption. In that case, targeting groups of voters with in-kind rather than cash transfers allows politicians to attract simultaneously voters in additional groups with the same amount of resources. Politicians undertake political redistribution depending on the expected electoral returns obtained from targeting both cash and in-kind transfers into different groups. Furthermore, electoral competition leads the economy to achieve Pareto efficient allocations that markets cannot reach. Politicians internalize the presence of external effects when competing for <b>marginal</b> <b>voters</b> who could swing their vote. In Chapter 3, this dissertation investigates the politicians' incentives to pursue income redistribution when governments are constrained to levy taxes on labor income and this creates distortions. Politicians who strive to be elected may strategically redistribute through in-kind rather than cash transfers and overprovide consumption of goods. I show that the overprovision of in-kind transfers reduces the disincentive effects of taxation in labor effort and enlarges the pool of resources for political redistribution. As a result, politicians are able to implement larger redistributive transfers and improve the well-being of swing voters. Hence, electoral competition for pivotal voters provides politicians incentives to implement redistributive schedules that reduce distortions in labor markets and improve the efficiency of the taxation system. In Chapter 4, I investigate the effect of ideological preferences over the public provision of goods on the scope of government and the political redistribution of income. I first point out that the presence of both ideological politicians who compete for office and electoral uncertainty generates a partisanship effect. In particular, I show that pro-market (right-wing) politicians commit to lower public provision of goods and taxation schedules that implement larger income inequality than pro-government (left-wing) politicians. Furthermore, I find out that the public funding of goods through income taxation confers an electoral advantage to pro-market ideological positions. In fact, pro-market politicians can court moderate pro-leftist voters by promises of higher income which pro-government politicians are not willing to fund completely. As a result, right-wing party exhibits larger chances of winning elections and its proposal supports lower ideological sacrifice than the left-wing party...|$|R

Island cities (densely populated small islands and population centres of larger islands and archipelagos) nevertheless play import cultural, economic, political, and environmental roles on local, regional, and global scales. Many major cities and ports have developed on small islands, and even villages can fulfil important urban functions on lightly populated islands. Island concepts are also deployed to metaphorically describe developments in urban space. The journal Urban Island Studies explores island and urban processes around the world, taking an island approach to urban research and an urban approach to island research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} a three-year research project developed by the Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Architettura e Studi Urbani (DAStU), in collaboration with Telecom Italia. Looking at territorial smartness from a spatial perspective, that leaves aside the purely technological aspects, the research aims at exploring different ICT potentialities: from new uses of space, to socio-economic and physical regeneration. With this goal, it reflects about the possible updating of concepts, which are widely used in urban planning: (i) from smart city to smart region, {{to deal with the}} regional scale of contemporary cities, thus including <b>peripheral</b> and <b>marginal</b> ‘in-between’ spaces; (ii) from urban nodes to urban digital nodes, to design multi-scalar smart spaces able to integrate traditional and digital services; (iii) from Internet of Things to Internet of Places, to make spaces able to interact through (at the same time) real and virtual experiences of users. These theoretical references are explored within the scenario of the metropolitan region between Milan and Turin. According to these issues, this paper {{presents the}} research process to the UDN localization along the infrastructural bundle between Milan and Turin: from the identification of urban/infrastructural nodes, to the selection of potential Urban Digital Nodes. Furthermore, it highlights the UDN contribution to a smart region development through the spatial implementation of an Internet of Places...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{paper is}} about problems, which {{shepherd}} {{the region in}} proximity the military area Brdy. This region is among others situated in inner periphery, which brings another problems in development this region. The main aim this paper are to find at the first how big influence has attendance military area to development this region, if it is positiv or negativ, and why. Next aims this work are analyze development this region since 1990 till this time, findings if stepwise open border parts of military area is positiv for development this region and how the municipals in surround feel this case. Next aim is findings how municipals and their citizens feel possibly build-up american military base, where should have be situated american radar. Last aim of this work is adumbration possibly future development at the base ascertained results. In {{first part of this}} paper is debate literature and definitions, which consider problems of development <b>peripheral</b> or <b>marginal</b> areas. In the next part is described interest area, its character and its development. The level of periphery is analyze at the base of demographical-structuration index, which was use in several diploma papers at Naturalistic faculty. This results are described in chapter 5. In next part is described qualitative research, which was made at the [...] . Department of Social Geography and Regional Develop.

40|$|A small smooth-shelled kinosternoid {{from the}} late Campanian Cerro del Pueblo Formation and the early Maastrichtian Canyon del Tule Formation of Coahuila, Mexico that is abundantly {{represented}} by isolated elements is described as Yelmochelys rosarioae gen. et sp. nov. A phylogenetic analysis concludes that Y. rosarioae is {{a representative of the}} stem lineage of the Kinosternidae. Inclusion of Y. rosarioae in Kinosternidae is supported by presence of a groove for the musk duct, the loss of the eleventh <b>peripheral</b> and twelfth <b>marginal,</b> reduced articulation between the plastron and carapace, and diamond-shaped vertebral scales. A basal position within Kinosternidae is indicated by the presence of distinct abdominal scales that meet at the midline and the presence of a relatively long costiform processes. The inclusion of Y. rosarioae in Kinosternidae supports the hypothesis that Kinosternidae and Dermatemydidae had diverged by the Late Campanian...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite the changes, the {{configuration}} of global and regional power centers can still be represented as an hierarchy in which the first among equals, the equal, the <b>peripheral</b> and the <b>marginal</b> centers coexist with each other. BRICS’ as the means for increasing adaptivity to global realities and influencing global and regional process can potentially contribute to the shaping of multipolarity. The article suggests that BRICS is the most prospective project for coordinating of actions of various power centers of the world, as this format combines the political will, the economic foundation {{and the use of}} soft power tools. A Greater Europe continues to be the priority region for Russia in a political, economic, financial and cultural sense, and due to its geographical and civilizational particularity Russia can act as the link between other world major players both within BRICS and Russia-BRICS-EU triangle. </p...|$|R
