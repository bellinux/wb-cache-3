40|$|Aims/hypothesis. This study {{investigated}} the influence of plasma glucose upon <b>pulsatile</b> ocular blood <b>flow</b> in subjects with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. A total of 19 subjects with Type II diabetes and 8 normal control subjects undertook a meal tolerance test after an overnight fast. The <b>pulsatile</b> ocular blood <b>flow,</b> using the Ocular Blood Flow Tonometer, and plasma glucose concentrations were taken at times 0 min, 90 min and 240 min. Blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin concentrations, in the subjects with diabetes, were also measured at time 0 min. <b>Pulsatile</b> ocular blood <b>flow</b> and plasma glucose were also measured at times 0 and 90 min in 5 subjects with Type II diabetes mellitus who remained fasting.

Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the change in <b>pulsatile</b> ocular blood <b>flow</b> and the change in plasma glucose concentration (r = 0. 671, p = 0. 001).

40|$|Transition of {{additive}} and non-additive <b>pulsatile</b> <b>flows</b> {{through a}} simple 3 D model of arterial stenosis is investigated {{by using a}} large eddy simulation (LES) technique. We find in both the pulsatile cases that {{the interaction of the}} two shear layers, one of which separates from the nose of the stenosis and the another one from its opposite wall, causes recirculation in the flow downstream of the stenosis where the nature of the transient flow becomes turbulent. The strength of this recirculation is found to be quite high from the non-additive pulsations when the flow Reynolds numbers, Re &# 8805; 1500, for which both the pressure and shearing stresses take on an oscillating form at the post-stenotic region. Potential medical consequences of these results are discussed in the paper. In addition, some comparisons of the non-additive pulsatile results are given with those of both the additive <b>pulsatile</b> and steady <b>flows.</b> The capability of using LES to simulate the <b>pulsatile</b> transitional <b>flow</b> is also assessed, and the present results show that the smaller (subgrid) scales (SGS) contributes about 78 % energy dissipation to the flow when the Reynolds number is taken as 2000.

50|$|A very {{different}} {{approach in the}} early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand—in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle.

However a similar operation (cardiomyoplasty) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results.

40|$|International audienceTo {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of}} flow phenomena in abdominal aortic aneurysms, numerical computations of <b>pulsatile</b> <b>flows</b> through aneurysm models and a stability analysis of these flows were carried out. The volume flow rate waveforms into the aneurysms were based on measurements of these waveforms, under rest and exercise conditions, of patients suffering abdominal aortic aneurysms. The Reynolds number and Womersley number, the dimensionless quantities that characterize the flow, were varied within the physiologically relevant range, and the two geometric quantities that characterize the model aneurysm were varied to assess the influence of the length and maximal diameter of an aneurysm on the details of the flow. The computed flow phenomena and the induced wall shear stress distributions agree well with what was found in PIV measurements by Salsac et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 560, 2006, pp. 19 – 51). The results suggest that long aneurysms are less pathological than short ones, and that patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm are better to avoid physical exercise. The <b>pulsatile</b> <b>flows</b> were found to be unstable to three-dimensional disturbances if the aneurysm was sufficiently localized or had a sufficiently large maximal diameter, even for flow conditions during rest. The abdominal aortic aneurysm can be viewed as acting like a 'wavemaker' that induces disturbed flow conditions in healthy segments of the arterial system far downstream of the aneurysm; this {{may be related to the}} fact that one-fifth of the larger abdominal aortic aneurysms are found to extend into the common iliac arteries. Finally, we report a remarkable sensitivity of the wall shear stress distribution and the growth rate of three-dimensional disturbances to small details of the aneurysm geometry near the proximal end. These findings suggest that a sensitivity analysis is appropriate when a patient-specific computational study is carried out to obtain a quantitative description of the wall shear stress distribution...|$|R
