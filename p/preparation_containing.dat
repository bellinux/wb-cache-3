25|$|Seddon and {{his wife}} became the chief {{suspects}} in what was by now a murder inquiry. During their trial at the Old Bailey the prosecution, led by the Attorney General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, proved that Margaret Seddon had previously bought {{a large amount of}} flypaper, which contained arsenic. The prosecution suggested that the poison used to kill Barrow had been obtained by soaking the flypaper in water. The renowned barrister Edward Marshall Hall led for the defence. He strongly resisted all claims that Barrow had been poisoned, claiming instead that she had died by taking a medical <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> arsenic. Despite the advise given by his Counsel, Seddon insisted on giving evidence in his own defence; it was claimed that he turned the jury against himself through his arrogant and condescending attitude. Certainly, his case was not helped by his ridiculous claim that Barrow might have drunk water from the dishes of flypaper that had been placed in her room to keep away the flies. Despite a fierce battle from the defence team, the jury found him guilty. Margaret Seddon was acquitted of any involvement in the murder. Marshall Hall always maintained that Seddon would have been acquitted had he not insisted on giving evidence, and on at least one occasion used it as an example in warning a client of the risks of giving evidence in one's own defence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1774, Mesmer {{produced}} an [...] "artificial tide" [...] in a patient, Francisca Österlin, {{who suffered from}} hysteria, by having her swallow a <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> iron and then attaching magnets to various parts of her body. She reported feeling streams of a mysterious fluid running through her body and was relieved of her symptoms for several hours. Mesmer {{did not believe that}} the magnets had achieved the cure on their own. He felt that he had contributed animal magnetism, which had accumulated in his work, to her. He soon stopped using magnets as a part of his treatment.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the partial}} {{completion}} of his studies, and his mother's death from cancer in 1971, McKenna, his brother Dennis, and three friends {{traveled to the}} Colombian Amazon in search of oo-koo-hé, a plant <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> dimethyltryptamine (DMT). [...] Instead of oo-koo-hé they found fields full of gigantic Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, {{at the urging of}} his brother, McKenna {{was the subject of a}} psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to bond harmine (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms) with their own neural DNA, through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists’ Philosopher’s Stone which they viewed as a [...] "hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter". McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with [...] "Logos": an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his [...] "Novelty Theory".|$|E

40|$|Bowel <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> Sodium {{phosphate}} – a {{risk for}} renal damage? - There are several well-documented cases of acute irreversible renal failure involving renal calcium phosphate deposits after {{the use of}} bowel <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> sodium phosphate (e. g., Colophos®). - Neither randomised clinical nor epidemiological studies have established an association between sodium phosphate use and renal damage in patients without preexisting renal dysfunction. - However, {{it is likely that}} patients with preexisting renal dysfunction and other risk factors were not sufficiently represented and analysed in these studies, and may be at increased risk of (further) renal damage through sodium phosphate. - Recommendations for clinical practice: 1. Routine determination of renal function through GFR estimation before prescription of bowel cleansing <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> sodium phosphate. 2. If sodium phosphate is administered, sufficient hydration is crucial: 2 L of fluids should be consumed with each 90 ml bottle of Colophos®. 3. Sodium phosphate should not be used in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction (GFR < 60 ml/min), and in those with other risk factors (heart failure, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics, preexisting dehydration and electrolyte disorders, old age).
