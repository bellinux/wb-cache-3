50|$|LGS is a {{piezoelectric}} material, with no phase transitions {{up to its}} {{melting point}} of 1470 °C. Single crystal LGS can be grown via the Czochralski method, in which crystallization is initiated on a rotating seed crystal lowered into the melt followed by pulling from the melt. The growth atmosphere is usually argon or nitrogen with up to 5% of oxygen. The use of oxygen in the growth environment is reported to suppress gallium loss from the melt; however, too high an oxygen level can lead to <b>platinum</b> (<b>crucible</b> material used for the melt) dissolution in the melt. The growth of LGS is primarily along the z direction. Currently the 3-inch (76 mm) langasite boules produced commercially have growth rates of 1.5 to 5 mm/h.

25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in <b>platinum</b> <b>crucibles</b> to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt.
