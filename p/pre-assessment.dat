5000|$|An {{important}} part of differentiated instruction and assessment is determining what students already know {{so as not to}} cover material students have mastered, or use methods that would be ineffective for students. The goal of <b>pre-assessment</b> is to determine a student's knowledge, understanding and skill prior to the unit of study. These are assessments for learning, and include diagnostic or pre-assessments that the teacher uses to help guide instruction and benefit each learner. [...] They are informal and provide qualitative feedback to teachers and students to address strengths and needs during the unit. Pre-assessments should be conducted several weeks before the unit of study and should not be graded. [...] Chapman and King (2005) note that when [...] "teachers strategically administer pre-assessments before planning their lessons, they can address the students' strengths and needs during instruction." [...] <b>Pre-assessment</b> can be conducted in two ways: 1) by identifying learning preferences and interests (i.e. Gardner's Multiple Intelligence test, or Visual, Auditory, or Kinesthetic learner), and 2) by identifying knowledge of student understandings (i.e. checklists, quizzes, class discussion, portfolios, entry/exit cards, anticipation guides, journals, self-reflections). Both of these types of <b>pre-assessment</b> are used to design student tasks, particularly when a student might require support, enrichment, or have different learning styles, intelligences, or interests.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>pre-assessment</b> of {{readiness}} {{is to find}} out what the students know and don't know to help plan your lessons to your specific students each year. Every year teacher's students are different. You may not be able to teach the same units the same way because of the classes readiness. At the beginning of the year and before new units it would be best to do a <b>pre-assessment</b> of the students to see what they know. The teachers should also give parents an evaluation in the beginning of the year because they know their child best. Planning and preparing for a class day is difficult, having these pre-assessments done will help you spend more time teaching students what they don't know and just refreshing them on what they do already do know. For example, if you are going to be starting a new unit in math, how to add and subtract. Just by asking the students [...] "What does addition mean?", [...] "What does subtraction mean" [...] and, [...] "Do they relate to each other?", the teacher would be able to know that the students had a good basic knowledge of the information and could start on application-based activities.Doing <b>pre-assessment</b> before each unit could help teachers using their time teaching students new information and save time by not teaching them what they may already know with remediation. There are many examples of ways to determine the classes understanding of different subjects. They can be used with formative and summative assessments not just <b>pre-assessment.</b> Once the teacher has decided on the next unit of study they can have the students trace their hands on a piece of paper. On one hand they can write 5 things they already know about the subjects and on the other hand they can write what they wish to know about the subject. This can be done with partners or individually. Teachers can use this to plan the unit and could also use it as another activity by having the students research and answer their own questions. Teachers can also create a worksheet or use note cards to have the students do as homework to get into the classroom the next day. Just asking them [...] "What do you know about the topic?", [...] "Is this topic interesting to you?". Another way is to give the class a test and go over the answers with them, allowing them to correct their own test and find prior knowledge. Using end-of-unit tests can be a great thing for the students; it helps them recognize the important parts of the upcoming unit. There are many ways to find out what students know about subjects that will help you better prepare and spend time wisely within the classroom.|$|E

Objectives: The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of a new, 1 -month wellness curriculum for 12 second-year family medicine residents on burnout, empathy, stress, and self-compassion. Methods: The pilot program, introduced during a new rotation emphasizing competencies around leadership, focused on teaching skills to cultivate mindfulness and self-compassion in order to enhance empathy and reduce stress. <b>Pre-assessments</b> and 3 -month follow-up assessments on measures of burnout, empathy, self-compassion, and perceived stress were collected to evaluate the impact of the curriculum.
