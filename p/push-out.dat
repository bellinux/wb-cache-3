5000|$|After {{the break}} (regardless of its result), {{before the second}} shot of the game, the player at the table may call a [...] "." [...] A <b>push-out</b> can be called by the {{breaking}} player if he legally pocketed a ball on the break, or the non-breaking player if no ball was pocketed on the break. Calling a <b>push-out</b> for the shot after the break allows the player taking the shot to legally hit the cue ball in almost any fashion with no foul, with the exception that the cue ball must stay {{on the table and}} illegal shots such as double-hitting the cue ball or a [...] "" [...] would still be called a foul. Playing a <b>push-out</b> shot ends the player's inning and play passes to the opponent. The main purpose of the <b>push-out</b> shot is to alleviate an unlucky lie after the break, where it is difficult to make a legal shot. Unlike any other shot of the game, for a <b>push-out</b> shot, the cue ball is not required to contact any object ball and if an object ball is contacted, it is not required to be the lowest numbered ball. If the nine-ball is pocketed on a <b>push-out</b> shot it is however, any other pocketed object ball remains pocketed and is not spotted. A <b>push-out</b> should be called so that the opponent or referee hears the call, and it is customary for the opponent or referee to confirm that he heard the <b>push-out</b> call, so that there is no controversy surrounding the shot. After a <b>push-out</b> shot was called and played, the incoming player has the choice of accepting the table as it lies, or forcing the pushing-out player to take the next shot of the game (always the third shot of the game). Only one <b>push-out</b> is allowed per game, and it must be immediately after the break. (See also [...] "The rise of 'Texas express' rules", below, for the historical multi-push-out rule variation.) If the pushing-out player has a particular type of shot he feels comfortable with, such as a jump shot, or two-rail bank shot, it may be strategical to leave that type of shot after the <b>push-out.</b> The ideal <b>push-out</b> shot leaves a lie that the opponent believes likely to be makeable, and will accept, but will fail to actually make, giving control of the table back to the pusher-out, and which the pusher-out is confident to make if the shot is passed back to him. Thus nine-ball players aim for a <b>push-out</b> that has about a 50/50 chance of being accepted or returned.|$|E

5000|$|For much of {{its history}} nine-ball rules allowed {{participants}} to [...] "" [...] multiple times during a game (see [...] "The push-out", above, for the modern <b>push-out</b> rules), meaning any player could call a [...] "push-out", and then hit the cue ball to any area on the table without being penalized by normal [...] rules, such as failure to contact the lowest-numbered ball on the table. However, once a <b>push-out</b> was called and executed, the incoming player {{had the right to}} shoot or give the inning back to the opponent. If the player shooting the resulting shot fouled, the other player would have ball-in-hand; hence this manner of play was called the [...] "two-foul" [...] version. [...] "One-foul" [...] became popular in the 1970s, as play turned more aggressive for the early televised matches. This newer version of nine-ball awarded ball-in-hand on any cue ball foul. A now-standard rule variant, which started to sweep the sport of nine-ball in the mid-1980s, restricted the <b>push-out</b> option to once per game and only to the inning immediately following the break. This change profoundly affected the way the game was played. By about 1990 this new <b>push-out</b> rule had become ubiquitous and it and any additional rules appended to it were collectively referred to as [...] "" [...] rules, so called because of the supposed US state of origin and the speeding up of the game. Today, Texas express <b>push-out</b> rules dominate the way nine-ball is played and is the variant incorporated into the official rules maintained by the WPA and its affiliates like the BCA.|$|E

For {{a smooth}} {{algebraic}} curve X over a field, applying H 1 to the Abel map X → Pic X/∂X to the Picard scheme of X modulo its boundary realizes the Poincaré duality isomorphism H 1 (X, Z/ℓ) → H 1 (X/∂X, Z/ℓ(1)) ∼ = H 1 c(X, Z/ℓ(1)).

40|$|Almost {{two decades}} of {{research}} have crystallized strong links between academic under-achievement, Zero Tolerance and similar "pushout" policies, and narrow codes of masculinity. Learning to enact traditional codes of masculinity is a major rite of passage for nearly every adolescent and teenage boy. Yet this imperative often puts them directly at odds with school disciplinary systems, especially in urban environments Unfortunately, boys don't display masculinity by sitting quietly in class, being respectful of teachers, obeying adult authority figures, observing all the rules, and turning in homework regularly [...] a set of behaviors, which, taken together, are a pretty good prescription for ostracism, bullying or harassment at many middle-schools. On the contrary, boys learn to impress peers, establish dominance hierarchies, and create social status by exemplifying traditional masculine attributes of strength, toughness, individualism, and aggression. In practice this means being boisterous, taking risks, breaking rules, defying adult authority figures, withstanding punishment silently, and generally disdaining book-learning as weak, feminine, or gay. Such findings point to two great systems in blind and often disastrous collision: an urban male "gender culture" which demands that adolescent boys master public displays of traditional masculinity, and school systems inclined to view precisely those displays as oppositional and threatening, a cause for constant surveillance and punishment, and markers of eventual failure or probable incarceration.

For many out-of-school learners, this form of education brought about relieve in that it increased access and flexibility, with a high emphasize on independent learning. However, same can not be said for the young and inexperienced school push outs. For them, this could mean a change from obedient child to adult and equal in this highly demanding and challenging world of self-directed learning. Against this scenario, the present study aimed at exploring differences in opinions of Management as policy developers and Learners on how the Open program responds to the diverse educational needs of young learners. It followed a qualitative interview method, with selected groups of informants from both Management and Learners. The sample consists of 6 informants from both groups and mainly targeted learners between the ages 16 and 17 years. Opinions were first analysed individually, then within the particular group and lastly between the two groups. The study discovered that there are indeed differences in opinions of the two groups. It further identified challenges faced by the program in effective and efficient delivery systems towards these young and inexperienced users.
