5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their money to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies {{before moving to the}} more profitable British home computer market.|$|E

5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{spent her}} {{remaining}} years in Auburn, tending {{to her family}} and other people in need. She worked various jobs to support her elderly parents, and took in boarders to help <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> One of the people Tubman took in was a 5-foot, 11 inch tall farmer born in North Carolina named Nelson Charles Davis. He was {{a veteran of the}} 8th United States Colored Infantry, serving as a private in the unit from September 1863 to the late summer of 1865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years younger than she was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874, and lived together as a family; Nelson died on October 14, 1888 of tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, he has never met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize {{he wanted to be}} a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E

5|$|Half a {{year after}} the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, {{eventually}} finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (Pooky Quesnel). Jenny begins a relationship with a dotcom millionaire (Ben Miles), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (Mel Martin) moves in for a couple of episodes. Karen is reunited with an old boyfriend (Richard Dillane), who is in Manchester for a photography exhibition. Karen is rivalled by Jenny, who has returned to working to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> while Pete is living elsewhere. David takes a sudden interest in politics after meeting local residents' activist Jessica (Yasmin Bannerman). He starts an affair with her but she dumps him after being offended by his insensitivity when he tries to end it. Karen finds out about the affair in Episode 8 but is adamant that she and David will stay together for the children. Adam and Rachel decide to have children but are distraught to discover that she is infertile from complications with her abortion. They decide to get married instead but Adam is briefly tempted when he reunites with a long-lost love (Victoria Smurfit) on his stag weekend to Belfast.|$|E

50|$|In North Korea, where rigid {{social systems}} {{are still in}} place, it is most common for {{the person of the}} highest social standing, such as a boss or an elder figure, to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> This not only applies in a 1 to 1 {{situation}} but also in groups. Among the younger generation, it is quite common for friends to alternate when <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> or for one to pay for dinner and another to pay for drinks.|$|R

25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) and Nothing But a Man (1970).|$|E
25|$|MEFO was a dummy {{company that}} was formed with {{relatively}} small amounts of capital {{that was used to}} finance German rearmament off the books. It issued bills without backing by its own resources but which were guaranteed redeemable at 1:1 for Reichsmarks for five years by the government. The MEFO bills amounts were considered a state secret and were an important element in the impression that Hitlerian economics was a success. This company essentially created a large amount of Reichsmarks off the books, inflating the currency in secret. Payment was about to come due giving Hitler the option of shifting the German economy to export goods to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> or going to war and paying the debts off from looting profits extracted from conquered states.|$|E

25|$|In that setting, he says, {{providers}} {{almost always}} charged minimal fees for services {{in order to}} improve the chance of being paid. He argues that the emergence of government as a payer for healthcare services in the form of Medicare and Medicaid, along with government policies of the 1970s that led to the expansion of private insurance to cover routine medical services in addition to hospitalization and emergency care, and which required most employers to provide health insurance for their employees, interfered with the traditional physician-patient relationship. The incentive for healthcare providers and patients to keep costs as low as possible was lost. He says that now providers always charge the maximal fees for services, since the government or insurance company can be counted on to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century the Du Pont Company {{had become one}} of world’s major corporations, {{bringing}} enormous wealth to its owners and providing employment and other opportunities to their native state. One of the three key owners of the company was T. Coleman du Pont, a capable, energetic and ambitious man, who was also Buck’s father-in-law. Du Pont had a vision of a super highway running the length of Delaware, and the ambition, talent, and money to make it a reality. Construction began in 1917 and in that same year a new State Highway Department was established to oversee the work. Nevertheless, du Pont continued to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> amounting to $4 million by 1924. With his engineering education and family connections, Buck was assigned to work on the project, becoming Chief Engineer in 1921 and remaining in the role until 1929.|$|E
25|$|Further work by Hawking in {{the area}} of arrows of time led to the 1985 {{publication}} of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept. Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal, and in 1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Awards do not <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time, was completed in 1984.|$|E

25|$|After fleeing Ireland, Hamilton Rowan {{was unable}} to access his fortune and was reduced to {{supporting}} himself by his own labour. He was able to borrow money from William Poole, a prominent Quaker in Wilmington, Delaware, and purchase a calico mill. In Wilmington, Hamilton Rowan led a very public life, enjoying the company of prominent Wilmingtonians such as Poole, John Dickinson, and Caesar A. Rodney, who later became Secretary of State under Jefferson. Living in constant fear of summary deportation under the Alien and Sedition Acts, Hamilton Rowan took pains to socialise with both Federalists and Republicans, and he studiously avoided American politics. On Christmas Day 1797 his cottage on the Brandywine {{burned to the ground}} killing his two dogs, destroying most of his library, and leaving him homeless. The next year his business partner refused to make up the accounts for the calico mill, so Hamilton Rowan was forced to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> out of pocket, and take over the entire operation himself. But with little knowledge of the operations or business, the press was sold at a loss of $500. Hamilton Rowan then worked for the flour mills hauling grain and flour by wheelbarrow to and from Wilmington.|$|E
