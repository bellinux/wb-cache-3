40|$|Noncentral {{distributions}} {{appear in}} two sample problems {{and are often}} used in several fields, for example, in biostatistics. A higher order approximation for a percentage point of the noncentral t-distribution under normality is given by Akahira (1995) and is also shown to be numerically better than others. In this article, without the normality assumption, we obtain a higher order approximation to a percentage point {{of the distribution of}} a noncentral t-statistic, in a similar way to Akahira (1995) where the statistic based on a linear combination of a normal random variable and a chi-statistic takes an important role. Its application to the confidence limit and the confidence interval for a noncentrality parameter are also given. Further, a numerical comparison of the higher order approximation with the limiting normal distribution is done and the former one is shown to be more accurate. As a result of the numerical calculation, the higher order approximation seems to be useful in practical situations, when the size of sample is not so small.

One of them is Tarok Puskesmas {{which is one of}} the public health centers in Payakumbuh. Currently the outpatient service system in Tarok Puskesmas is still done manually so that there is often a long process of information exchange or the occurrence of misinformation between sections in the puskesmas. Therefore, an application is required to improve the system by designing and building a web-based information system using mobile features. Development methods on this system use waterfall method and application testing using blackbox testing method. The system is designed by analyzing the needs of the current system with three functionalities, ie viewing the history of patient visits, viewing medical records, and viewing reports of puskesmas that can be described by contex diagrams in seven entities, ie patients, admissions officers, policemen, pharmacists, Doctors, and leaders. This app is designed using a PostgreSQL database. This outpatient information system database has eleven <b>tables,</b> ie patient <b>table,</b> visit <b>table,</b> traffic_transaction <b>table,</b> family_name <b>table,</b> drug <b>table,</b> employee <b>table,</b> access <b>table,</b> poly <b>table,</b> disease <b>table,</b> preset <b>table,</b> and transaction <b>table.</b> The test results show that the implementation results have been in accordance with the functional requirements of system applications...|$|R
