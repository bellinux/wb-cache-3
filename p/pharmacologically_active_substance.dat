40|$|Veterinary {{medicinal}} products {{are used in}} livestock farming in order to both prevent illness and treat sick animals. Food derived from treated animals can therefore contain residues of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> Even in the excretions of treated animals such residues can, under certain circumstances, be detected. Through the use of liquid and solid manure, these residues can reach areas used for agricultural purposes. The BfR has analysed the currently available data {{on the existence of}} residues of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in plants. A search of the literature showed that transfer of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> into plants is possible in principle. The findings for 22 pharmacological substances were above the relevant analytical quantification limit. For the most part, the tested substances are antibiotics widely used in veterinary medicine. As regards the evaluated studies, it must be borne in mind that they are typically based on worst-case scenarios. In addition, the studies hardly ever take into account the whole transfer path of the treatment and excretions of animals (liquid and solid manure), to the soil and absorption by the plants.

Nicotine, a <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in tobacco, {{has been identified}} as a major risk factor for lung diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of curcumin on tissue lipid peroxidation and antioxidants in nicotine-treated Wistar rats. Lung toxicity was induced by subcutaneous injection of nicotine at a dose of 2. 5 mg/kg (5 days a week, for 22 weeks). Curcumin (80 mg/kg) was given simultaneously by intragastric intubation for 22 weeks. The enhanced level of tissue lipid peroxides in nicotine-treated rats was accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. Administration of curcumin significantly lowered the level of lipid peroxidation and enhanced the antioxidant status.

Methods: Selective literature review. Results: Recent studies employing modern imaging techniques have provided objective correlates of the effect of placebo administration for certain indications. A recent paper even suggested a genetic basis for it. Two main mechanisms underlie the effect of placebo administration: conditioned reflexes, which are subconscious, and the patient's expectations, which are conscious.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{epidemiological}} {{studies suggest that}} coffee drinking {{is associated with a}} slower progression of fibrogenesis in patients with chronic, particularly alcoholic, liver disease. However, a causal, mechanistic explanation was pending. New results indicate that the methylxanthine caffeine, major component of coffee and the most widely consumed <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the world, might be responsible for this phenomenon as it inhibits the synthesis of Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN 2) in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, primarily by inducing degradation of Smad 2 (and to a much lesser extent Smad 3). In particular paraxanthine has been identified as the most potent inhibitor of CTGF synthesis among the three primary metabolites of caffeine, i. e. paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine. CTGF plays {{a crucial role in the}} fibrotic remodeling of various organs which has therefore frequently been proposed as therapeutic target in the management of fibrotic disorders.

For residues of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and environmental contaminants such as heavy metals or dioxins, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and Maximum Levels are set, which must not be exceeded in food of animal origin. The aim of food control as part of the NRCP and the ICP is, to check that these MRLs and Maxiumum Levels are complied with, to detect non-compliant use of substances (e. g. prohibited or non-allowed <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances)</b> and to investigate the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants. The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has presented the findings from the 58998 samples which were monitored by the official control laboratories of the federal states as part of the NRCP 2012 and from the 1338 samples of the ICP in 2012. In 350 findings (0. 59 %) of the NRCP samples, residues and contaminants were noncompliant. The rate is thus lower than the findings of the year 2011 (0, 73 %). In 8 findings of the 1338 samples of the ICP the limit values for residues and contaminants were exceeded. Nevertheless, the rate of exceeded limit values decreased slightly for food of animal origin imported from countries outside of the EU.

40|$|Although the hmmodynamic {{responses}} to cigarette smoking have been extensively studied, considerable controversy still exists {{as to the}} presence or degree of deleterious effects on the circu-latory system (Roth and Shick, 1958). There is, however, general agreement that nicotine is the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in tobacco smoke (Comroe, 1960; Haag, 1940; Roth, 1960). From 1 to 4 mg. of nicotine is absorbed into the blood stream during the smoking of one cigarette when the smoke is inhaled (Pierce, 1941). Excitation of the adrenal medulla and peripheral sym-pathetic ganglia occurs with a resultant tachycardia and a rise of the circulating epinephrine level followed by stimulation of the supra-optic nuclei with the subsequent release of posterior pituitary hormone causing mild pressor effects (Burn, 1960).

Objective: We examined the associations of maternal caffeine intake, {{on the basis of}} coffee and tea consumption, with fetal growth characteristics measured in each trimester of pregnancy and the risks of adverse birth outcomes. Design: Associations were studied in 7346 pregnant women participating in a population-based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onward in the Netherlands (2001 - 2005). Caffeine intake in the first, second, and third trimesters was on the basis of coffee and tea consumption and was assessed by questionnaires. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound. Information about birth outcomes was obtained from hospital records. Results: We observed no consistent associations of caffeine intake with fetal head circumference or estimated fetal weight in any trimester. Higher caffeine intake was associated with smaller first-trimester crown-rump length, second- and third-trimester femur length, and birth length (P for trend < 0. 05). Offspring of mothers who consumed ≥ 6 caffeine units/d tended to have increased risks of small-for-gestational-age infants at birth.

40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} by the European Commission to deliver a Scientific Opinion on {{guidance}} on methodological principles and scientific methods {{to be taken into account}} when establishing Reference Points for Action (RPAs) for non-allowed pharmacologically active substances in food of animal origin. This guidance document presents a simple and pragmatic approach which takes into account both analytical and toxicological considerations. The aim is to define an analytical concentration for a non-allowed <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> that can be determined by official control laboratories and is low enough to adequately protect the consumers of food commodities that contain that substance. The proposed step-wise approach considers factors such as analytical capability, toxic potential and pharmacological activity of the substance in question, and includes the identification of the Reasonably Achievable Lowest Limit of Quantification (RALLOQ), the establishment of a Toxicological Screening Value (TSV) and the derivation of a Toxicologically Based Limit of Quantification (TBLOQ). The TBLOQ is compared with the RALLOQ for the respective substance. If the TBLOQ is equal to or higher than the RALLOQ, then the latter can be accepted as the RPA. If the TBLOQ is lower than the RALLOQ, then the sensitivity of the analytical method needs to be improved. In the case where no further analytical improvements are feasible, a substance-specific risk assessment should be considered. The CONTAM Panel concluded that RPAs should be matrix independent. The CONTAM Panel noted that sometimes non-edible matrices are monitored to identify the administration of non-allowed pharmacologically active substances. In these cases, RPAs cannot be applied. The CONTAM Panel also proposed several criteria where the European Commission might consider it appropriate to consult EFSA for a substance-specific risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Uncarinic acid C (URC) is triterpene {{isolated}} from Uncaria rhynchophylla {{and is a}} <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> The induction of dendritic cells (DC) is critical for the induction of Ag-specific T lymphocyte responses and may be essential {{for the development of}} human vaccines relying on T cell immunity. DC might be a potential target for URC. We demonstrate that URC activates human DC as documented by phenotypic and functional maturation, and altered cytokine production. The expression of CD 1 a, CD 38, CD 40, CD 54, CD 80, CD 83, CD 86, HLA-DR and CCR 7 on URC-primed DC was enhanced. The production of IL- 12 p 70 by URC-primed DC was higher than that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -primed DC. The production of IL- 12 p 70 by URC-primed DC was inhibited by the anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) monoclonal antibody (mAb), but partially abolished by anti-TLR 2 mAb. mRNA coding for TLR 2 and TLR 4 was expressed in URC-primed DC. URC-primed DC induced the NF-κB transcription factor. Naïve T cells co-cultured with URC-primed DC turned into typical Th 1 cells that produced large quantities of IFN-γ depending on IL- 12 secretion. URC enhanced the T cell stimulatory capacity in an allo MLR. In the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assay (CTL) assay, DNA fragmentation assay and 51 Cr release on URC-primed DC were more augmented than that of TNF-α-primed DC. DC matured with URC had an intermediate migratory capacity towards CCL 19 and CCL 21. These results suggest that URC modulates DC function in a fashion that favors Th 1 polarization via the activation of IL- 12 p 70 dependent on TLR 4 signaling, and may be used on DC-based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy...|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|R
