25|$|A new villainous Supernova arises after {{stealing}} Daniel's costume, and {{aided by}} evil time traveler Rex Hunter, intends to exploit weaknesses in history, keen on rewriting it and destroying the League (they are later revealed to {{in fact be}} working under the orders of the Ultra-Humanite, Despero, and Per Degaton). As Booster is {{thought of as a}} buffoon, the <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>persons</b> behind the altering of time will not suspect he is thwarting them, but Booster must maintain his poor reputation to protect himself. Booster's condition for following Rip's orders is that he may travel back in time to avert the death of his best friend, Ted Kord.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of deadly}} force is often granted to law {{enforcement}} officers when the <b>person</b> <b>or</b> <b>persons</b> in question {{are believed to be}} an immediate danger to people around them, or when a person poses a significant threat to a law enforcement officer, usually when the officer is at risk of serious bodily injury or death. Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about widespread and ongoing excessive use of force. Other non-fatal incidents and arrests have raised similar concerns.|$|E
