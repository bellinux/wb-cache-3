5000|$|The Nikon F {{revolutionized}} the photographic market, stealing {{the thunder of}} German manufacturers Leica and Zeiss. The F also {{had a reputation for}} being extremely resilient to damage or mechanical failure. It became known as [...] "the hockey puck". Many professional photographers, especially photojournalists, began using the F camera system. In some limited markets the camera was marketed as a [...] "Nikkor F" [...] due to trademark conflicts. In Germany, for example, the well established Zeiss Ikon camera line saw the [...] "Nikon" [...] name as too similar to their own and Nikon was forced to avoid using [...] "Nikon" [...] in that area. (Engraved this way, they have become highly collectable cameras in today's collector market.)The first Nikon F <b>Photomic</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> delivered since 1962, had an independent photocell. Then Nikon introduced the Photomic T (superseded by the Photomic Tn), which featured through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The final metering prism for the Nikon F, the Photomic FTn, introduced in 1968, provided 60% center-weighted TTL which became the standard metering pattern for Nikon cameras for decades afterwards. Additional viewfinders included a waist-level viewer, a 6 power magnifying finder, and an [...] "action finder" [...] with a larger viewable area through which one could see the entire frame while wearing goggles and/or a helmet.|$|E
