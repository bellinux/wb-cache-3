5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee,</b> who put Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding the house itself. Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E
5|$|The Connétable is {{the head}} of each parish, elected at a public {{election}} for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. The Procureur du Bien Public (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the Loi (1804) au sujet des assemblées paroissiales). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a <b>public</b> <b>trustee</b> for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly.

25|$|Probably under Archbold's ownership, {{the house}} {{was used by the}} Glenfell sisters (Jean, Reynolda and Ellen) as a {{boarding}} house for pupils from Christchurch Girls' High School, who at the time used a building later known as the Cranmer Centre as their school. The connection with the girls school lasted for four years. The building became known as Glenfell House during that time. The ownership of the property kept changing. From Livinstone, the property passed to the <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee</b> in 1957, who onsold to the Staffordshire Finance Company in 1964.

25|$|In 1873 he matriculated to the University of Sydney and {{attended}} lectures for several terms. In January {{of the next}} year, his father secured for him a clerkship in the New South Wales Department of Lands. He transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court in 1876 and was admitted to practice law as a solicitor on 25 February 1882. He became registrar of probates in 1890, curator of intestate estates as well in 1896, and the <b>public</b> <b>trustee</b> in 1914. When he retired in 1924, his staff had increased from fourteen to 67, and some 25,000 estates, involving over £10 million, had passed through his office. That year, Garrett returned to private practise as a solicitor and, at 81, still attended his office daily.|$|E
25|$|Shaw {{had served}} from 1926 to 1939 on the BBC's Advisory Committee on Spoken English, which {{included}} several exponents of phonetic writing. He also knew Henry Sweet, creator of Current Shorthand (and a prototype {{for the character}} of Henry Higgins), although Shaw himself used the shorthand system of Isaac Pitman. All of his interest in spelling and alphabet reform was made clear in Shaw's will of June 1950, in which provision was made for (Isaac) James Pitman, with a grant in aid from the <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee,</b> to establish a Shaw Alphabet. Following Shaw's death in November 1950, and after some legal dispute, the Trustee announced a worldwide competition to design such an alphabet, {{with the aim of}} producing a system which would be an economical way of writing and of printing the English language.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} on, the Army of Flanders began to enjoy various {{distinctly}} modern institutions, often {{before they were}} adopted {{by the rest of}} Europe. Alba set up a military hospital at Mechelen near Brabant in 1567; it was closed the following year, but after many complaints by mutineers it reopened in 1585, ultimately having 49 staff and 330 beds, paid for partially by the troops. The 'Garrison of our Lady of Hal' was created as a more permanent rest home for crippled veterans. A <b>public</b> <b>trustee</b> was also appointed in 1596 to administer the wills of soldiers who had fallen in service. After 1609, a number of small barracks (baraques, called after the French version of the Catalan barraca) were created away from the main urban centres to house the Army – a move that was eventually copied by other nations.|$|E

25|$|In 1877, the English {{language}} {{rough draft}} of the Treaty was published along with photolithographic facsimiles, and the originals were returned to storage. In 1911, historian and bibliographer Dr Thomas Hocken, searching for historical documents, found the Treaty papers in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents. The papers were restored by the Dominion Museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the Treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the Treaty House during the Centenary celebrations. It was possibly {{the first time the}} Treaty document had been on public display since it was signed. After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with the <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee</b> at Palmerston North by the local MP, who did not tell staff what was in the case. However, as the case was too large to fit in the safe, the Treaty document spent the war at the side of a back corridor in the Public Trust office.|$|E
25|$|Hurst {{was called}} to the Bar in 1910 but then entered the UK civil service, serving in the <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee</b> Office from 1911, before {{transferring}} to the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. At {{the end of the}} war, he moved to the Ministry of Labour and it was as a labour relations expert that he was drawn into the controversies of the UK coal-mining industry, serving as the secretary of the Royal Commission that attempted to bring warring owners and unions together in the period leading up to the General Strike of 1926, and then to the Coal Mines Reorganization Commission which was charged by the UK government with creating larger units within a highly fragmented industry but proved ineffective. Finally, from 1938, he was secretary to the Coal Commission which, with the imminence and then the reality of the Second World War, had the necessary power to reshape the industry and pave the way for state ownership as the National Coal Board in 1947. Hurst was offered a post within the nationalised industry, but chose instead to retire. He was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Bath and the Officer of the Order of the British Empire honours for his public service.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee</b> Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E

500|$|Outside of his {{involvement}} in rugby, Ellison was a lawyer, {{and was one of}} the first Māori admitted to the bar. He practised as an interpreter for the Land Courts and as a solicitor; later, he worked as a barrister in the practices of Brandon & Hislop in Wellingon. Ellison was also involved in politics, and stood unsuccessfully for the Southern Maori parliamentary seat several times against Tame Parata, as well as working for government consideration of Ngāi Tahu land claims. He married Ethel May Howell, a daughter of John Howell, on 22 March 1899; the couple had three children, only one of whom survived infancy, daughter Hinemura who died in 1989. In 1904 Ellison was struck down with tuberculosis, and was admitted to Porirua Lunatic Asylum before dying on 2 October that same year. Ellison was buried in Otakou, Otago Heads, following the original plan of a burial at Karori. Representatives of Ellison's parents intercepted the body in Porirua, and his wife and <b>Public</b> <b>Trustee</b> then agreed for him to be buried at Otakou. There his gravestone reads [...] "One of the greatest rugby footballers New Zealand ever possessed".|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Farmer {{testified in}} United States Senate {{hearings}} regarding improprieties in a United Mine Workers (UMW) pension scheme. [...] The UMW {{was led by}} W. A. [...] "Tony" [...] Boyle, who was elected union president in 1963. Well known as a bare-knuckle negotiator, the autocratic Boyle also did not shrink from using physical intimidation within the union to get his way. Boyle was challenged for the presidency in 1969 by Joseph [...] "Jock" [...] Yablonski. In an election widely seen as corrput, Yablonski lost the election. He, his wife, and his adult daughter were [...] murdered in their home on December 31, 1959. That same year, Boyle forced a 30 percent increase in miner pension benefits through the three-person board of trustees of the UMW Welfare and Retirement Fund. A unanimous vote by Boyle, George Judy, and <b>public</b> <b>trustee</b> Josephine Roche was required to approve the increase, which came just before the 1969 UMW election. Yablonski had challenged the timeliness of the increase as [...] "vote buying", and BCOA members were angry that their pension contributions had jumped without notice or negotiation. Boyle defended the increase by saying that Judy and Roche also approved the increase. But Roche was hospitalized {{at the time of}} the vote. Judy claimed to have a proxy vote given to him by Roche. Farmer was called as a witness by a special Senate Labor and Pensions subcommittee, and verified to some degree Judy's claims to have a proxy. Roche denied ever giving him a proxy. The conflicting testimony did not result in perjury charges or a rescinding of the pension increase. But Judy's 1969 resignation, the press reported, was due to BCOA anger over the pension increase. Boyle was found guilty of hiring Yablonski's murderers in April 1974 and sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
