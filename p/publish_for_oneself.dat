Such principles are formally discussed in the Buddhist scriptures, but jiriki implies experiencing them <b>for</b> <b>oneself.</b>|$|R

"Hip {{morality}} {{is to do}} what one feels whenever and wherever it is possible, and - {{this is how the}} war of the Hip and the Square begins- to be engaged in one primal battle: to open the limits of the possible <b>for</b> <b>oneself,</b> <b>for</b> <b>oneself</b> alone, because that is one's need. Yet in widening the arena of the possible, one widens it reciprocally for others as well, so that the nihilistic fulfillment of each man’s desire contains its antithesis of human co-operation (354)." ...|$|R

While many of these {{decisions are}} taken on behalf of others rather than <b>for</b> <b>oneself,</b> the existing literature finds mixed results on whether people take more or less risk for others then for themselves. Recent studies suggest that taking decisions for others reduces loss aversion, thereby increasing risk taking on behalf of others. To test this, we elicit loss aversion in three treatments: making risky decisions <b>for</b> <b>oneself,</b> <b>for</b> one other subject, or for the decision maker and another person combined. We find a clear treatment effect when making decisions for others but not when making decisions for both...|$|R

Thinking <b>for</b> <b>oneself</b> is usually associated with 18 th century Western Enlightenment - the automatic problematization of collectively held beliefs -skepticism, and individualism.

The term was introduced by Masters and Johnson, and was aimed at increasing personal and interpersonal awareness of self and the other's needs. Each participant is encouraged to focus on their own varied sense experience, rather than to see orgasm as the sole goal of sex. Initially, the emphasis is on touching in a mindful way <b>for</b> <b>oneself</b> without regard <b>for</b> sexual response or pleasure <b>for</b> <b>oneself</b> or one’s partner.|$|R
