On one occasion, while under enemy fire, he risked his own life to save the life of a wounded fellow airman. For this act, Bonin received a Good Conduct Medal in recognition of his gallantry.

50|$|Females are monogamous, mating {{with one}} male {{within a few}} days after {{emergence}} in the spring. However, males encounter difficulties in completing successful copulation with females, including male inability to determine from where and when females will emerge. Nests are dispersed widely, increasing the number of sites from which new females can emerge. Additionally, females fly away from the nests as soon as they emerge, increasing the mating challenge for males. To counteract these difficulties, males can increase their mating chances by positioning themselves close to foraging sites. Factors including value, <b>patrolling</b> <b>time,</b> and the number of competing males are taken into account when males roam foraging sites for females.|$|R
50|$|When {{it comes}} to mating selection, females prefer males who exhibit {{endurance}}. By scoring endurance (measured in flight/ <b>patrol</b> <b>time),</b> females can gather reliable and valid information on a male’s quality. A female’s preference towards long-term patrollers could potentially help explain the prolonged male lekking behavior.|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} was for {{a low-cost}} air-launchable system {{to aid in the}} destruction of enemy air defense networks. The proposed unit would combine elements of cruise missiles and UAVs, it would be launched in large numbers by heavy bombers, fighters, or possibly mass ground launch systems. The missiles would fly in advance of manned aircraft up to 450 km (280 mi) to pre-programmed target zones and patrol there until enemy radar sources were detected which would then be destroyed. This extended <b>patrol</b> <b>time</b> on target ("loiter time") was the key feature of the new system, a Persistent Anti-radiation Missile (PARM) as opposed to a HARM.|$|E

At midmonth she returned briefly to Tulagi, then resumed operations off New Guinea. On the night of 29 November, she participated in a Task Force 74 bombardment of Japanese positions on New Britain.

50|$|In the 1950s, the Soviet Union sought {{means to}} defend against nuclear-armed American bombers {{possibly}} penetrating its borders (especially its long and vulnerable northern border). Contemporary interceptors, even the Yakovlev Yak-28P, were able to cover only a radius {{of a few hundred}} kilometers; the newly developed surface-to-air missiles had even shorter range. Considering both, the sheer numbers required to defend a 5,000 km air front were economically impossible to maintain. This left the Soviet Union able to provide a modern air defense only for selected valuable areas. The PVO decided to cover the entire territory, but with a looser defense. In 1955 it placed a requirement for a large area-defense interceptor, that would achieve it with sparse airbases. The PVO requirement called for a supersonic aircraft with enormous fuel tanks for both a good <b>patrol</b> <b>time</b> and long range, a capable radar, and the most powerful air-to-air missiles possible. The first attempt, although unsuccessful, was a 30-tonne Lavochkin La-250 prototype, the last of the Lavochkin design bureau's aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of August 31, 1943 that the flag at Ohio’s own Coastal Patrol Base No. 14 was lowered for the last time. The closure of the coastal patrol base did not end entirely in Florida, but rather California. In January 1944 the {{national}} CAP headquarters assigned some of the base personnel to Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale, California to become Tow Target Unit No. 7, {{under the command of}} CAP Major Lloyd H. Fales, former command of Coastal Patrol Base No. 7, at Miami, Florida. Instead of spotting submarines, the pilots now towed large canvas sleeves {{at the end of a}} steel cable that could be played out via a winch up to 5,000 feet behind their aircraft. Pilots with considerable nerve and intestinal fortitude towed the targets while antiaircraft batteries practiced their marksmanship and target tracking and perfected their aerial gunnery procedures. Only the most powerful aircraft could pull the targets for daylight missions, while lighter aircraft flew tracking missions at night for searchlight tracking missions. By March 1945 the tow target mission was complete and the Ohio men returned to home to the Buckeye state, having joined CAP and seen the war. In 1948, the Department of Defense awarded Air Medals to any coastal patrol pilot or observer with over 200 hours of <b>patrol</b> <b>time.</b> Forty-three Ohio CAP members received the medal for their wartime service, the sixth highest total in the nation.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of field supervisor behavior modeling on patrol officer use of unassigned <b>patrol</b> <b>time.</b> Specifically, the study explored whether field supervisor engagement in proactive stops and checks resulted in an increased frequency of proactive stops and checks among patrol officers. Hierarchical analyses of computer-aided dispatch data from two municipal police departments were con-ducted with 320 shifts and 1, 385 individual patrol officer tours of duty. After con-trolling for call for service workload, shift, agency, and officer demographic characteristics, the findings suggested that when field supervisors engage in proactive investigative activities, the volume of proactive activity by patrol officers approxi-mately doubles. The policy implications and {{limitations of this study}} are then discussed...|$|E

This included carrying out repair work, looking for evidence of escape attempts, examining the area for signs of suspicious activities and so on. The <b>patrol</b> <b>times</b> and routes were deliberately varied to ensure that there was no predictability, ensuring that a patrol could potentially appear at any time from either direction. Guards posted in watchtowers {{played an important role in}} monitoring the border, though shortages of personnel meant that the watchtowers were not continuously manned. During the final years of the East German state, the lack of manpower was so severe that cardboard cut-outs of guards were placed in towers to present the illusion that they were occupied.|$|R
