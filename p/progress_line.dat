40|$|AbstractThe {{efficient}} {{display of}} project schedules and {{the comparison between}} the plans and the actual data have been key areas of project management since the appearance of planning techniques. Various graphic techniques exist for displaying the project data, among which the most widespread is the Gantt chart, which is associated with Henry Gantt. The Gantt chart has gone through great development in the past decades: the logic-Gantt, which also contains the logical relationships, has appeared; furthermore, the available project planning applications provide several possibilities for the efficient display of the schedules and for the comparison of different plan versions and the planned and actual conditions. In this paper, a new graphic system is introduced, which makes the overview of large- scale projects much faster. This new system is called the system of evaluation lines. Its development has been inspired by {{the concept of the}} <b>progress</b> <b>line,</b> which is already present in project planning systems. In this sense, the <b>progress</b> <b>line</b> can be considered as a type of evaluation line. In the paper, the definition of the evaluation line is given and the evaluation lines are grouped according to their common characteristics. Then some, more interesting examples are shown. The paper redefines the concept of the progress lines, and sheds light on the disadvantages of the former solutions...|$|E

For each {{learning}} area, one tiny diagram contained coded letters, squares, shaded areas, {{black and white}} dots and a menacing <b>progress</b> <b>line</b> known as a class average. This year it's simpler. Your child's results are mapped onto the state-wide expected average for each learning area along a five-point scale: from A to E. C is {{where you need to}} be. A is well above the expected standard, E is well below. Parents can exhale. It's plain English all the way. Yet the welcome simplicity hides behind it the same essentially dishonest attitude towards children's education. We still don't know how and what our children are doing...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether resistance to chemoimmunotherapy is acquired during therapy, we investigated {{the effects of}} chemotherapeutic agents and anti-tumour polysaccharide, lentinan, on the progression of Rous sarcoma virus-induced S 908. D 2 fibrosarcomas. The chemoimmunotherapy was effective against the parental S 908. D 2 -bearing mice. Nearly all the mice that were treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) and lentinan achieved complete tumour regression. Only {{a few of the}} mice that achieved complete regression of the primary tumours showed a recurrence of the tumour in regional lymph nodes. S 908. D 2 -vp. 1 was established from metastatic tumours that developed in the regional lymph nodes of parental S 908. D 2 -bearing mice during therapy. S 908. D 2 -vp. 2 -or vp. 3 cells were sequentially derived in a similar way from S 908. D 2 -vp. 1 -or-vp. 2 -bearing mice respectively, in which complete tumour regression at each primary site was achieved during therapy. These lines acquired resistance to CY and lentinan and also to 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) / 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fluorouracil and lentinan. No significant difference in either the sensitivity to 5 -FU or 4 -deoxycyclophosphamide in vitro or in the susceptibility to immune effector cells was observed between the parental and <b>progressed</b> <b>lines</b> (S 908. D 2 -vp 1 -vp 3). There was an increase in the level of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in the <b>progressed</b> <b>lines</b> during repeated therapy (parental, 1171 pg ml(- 1); vp. 1, 2199 pg ml(- 1); vp. 2, 5500 pg ml(- 1); vp 3, 16187 pg ml(- 1)). There was no significant increase in the production of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). The amount of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) produced by spleen cells isolated from the S 908. D 2 -vp. 2 -bearing mice was decreased compared with the amount produced by the parental S 908. D 2 - bearing mice. Furthermore, combination therapy with lentinan and IL- 2 achieved complete tumour regression in all the mice transplanted with S 908. D 2 <b>progressed</b> tumour <b>lines,</b> although IL- 2 alone did not show any anti-tumour effects in either the S 908. D 2 parental or <b>progressed</b> <b>lines.</b> The findings suggest that the reduced production of IL- 2 induced an increase in the production of the PGE 2 by <b>progressed</b> tumour <b>lines</b> is involved in the acquisition of resistance...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring is an {{important}} process used to track work progress in a project. It is also to avoid delay of a construction project. This study explores the monitoring methods of project progress used by the contractors in a private project which is Sekolah Islam Hidayah, Johor Bahru. In this study, the key elements in work scheduling used for project monitoring are identified {{through the use of}} Microsoft Project software. Besides that, comparison of monitoring methods used by private project and government project is done. Factors that cause changes of work scheduling are also identified through physical monitoring. Therefore, Microsoft Project {{has been used as a}} tool in scheduling and effective monitoring. Meanwhile, physical monitoring on site project is done to monitor the project progress and photos are also taken for the work progress record. From this study, there are three elements in work scheduling which helps in monitoring which are tasks, time and <b>progress</b> <b>line.</b> Financial S-Curve (Cost versus Time) is generated to track the project progress and percentage of work done has been recorded from the analysis of S-Curve. From the comparison of work monitoring used by private and government project, it has shown that both of them have their owned Standard Operation Procedure used as a project monitoring method. Through physical monitoring, the factors that causes changes of work schedule are identified which are include lack of materials, amendment of design, unpredictable weather condition and lack of financial resources. In conclusion, this study has shown that monitoring methods are a basis part in order to control project activities and to avoid risks of delay in a construction project...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Association of Applied BiologistsDevelopment of phoma leaf spot (caused by Leptosphaeria maculans) on winter oilseed rape (canola, Brassica napus) was assessed in two experiments at Rothamsted in successive years (2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05 growing seasons). Both experiments compared oilseed rape cultivars Eurol, Darmor, Canberra and Lipton, which differ in their resistance to L. maculans. Data were analysed to describe disease development in terms of increasing numbers of leaves affected over thermal time from sowing. The cultivars showed similar patterns of leaf spot development in the 2003 - 04 experiment when inoculum concentration was relatively low (up to 133 ascospores m- 3 air), Darmor developing 5. 3 diseased leaves per plant by 5 May 2004, Canberra 6. 6, Eurol 6. 8 and Lipton 7. 5. Inoculum concentration was up to sevenfold greater in 2004 - 05, with Eurol and Darmor developing 2. 4 diseased leaves per plant by 16 February 2005, whereas Lipton and Canberra developed 2. 8 and 3. 0 diseased leaves, respectively. Based on three defined periods of crop development, a piece-wise linear statistical model {{was applied to the}} progress of the leaf spot disease (cumulative diseased leaves) in relation to appearance ('birth') and death of leaves for individual plants of each cultivar. Estimates of the thermal time from sowing until appearance of the first leaf or death of the first leaf, the rate of increase in number of diseased leaves and the area under the disease <b>progress</b> <b>line</b> (AUDPL) for the first time period were made. In 2004 - 05, Canberra (1025 leaves x degrees C days) and Lipton (879) had greater AUDPL values than Eurol (427) and Darmor (598). For Darmor and Lipton, the severity of leaf spotting could be related to the severity of stem canker at harvest. Eurol had less leaf spotting but severe stem canker, whereas Canberra had more leaf spotting but less severe canker...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of professionalism in medical students is a challenging task faced in every medical curriculum. This chapter briefly summarizes {{some of the}} international achievements in this field and reports about the initial experience at the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry of “Sapienza” University of Rome. A vertical integration of teaching/learning professionalism throughout the formal curriculum was set up, according to a spiral learning educational design. The principles of “assessment for learning” were also taken into account, with repeated and progressive tests. We conceive professionalism as {{the expression of the}} relationship between the profession and the social and cultural context in which healthcare professionals function. Professionalism encompasses the ability of critical reflection on technical expertise. It is expressed through the ability to act and make decisions when dilemmas or elements of complexity are present. We started offering a special stream of courses along the six years of our curriculum. These courses only partially relate to the acquisition of specific technical knowledge or skills, and mainly deal with the general ability of using knowledge to set and solve problems of increasing complexity. In this light, we focused on the integration of clinical reasoning in problematic socio-cultural, ethical and emotional-relational contexts. According to these principles, a set of multidimensional assessment methods was designed. To set a baseline of data for assessment, a cross-sectional survey was led using three instruments, selected from the literature and translated into Italian. They were designed to measure knowledge and attitudes towards socio-cultural competence, empathy, and the interactions with self, patients, colleagues, and institutions. The Italian versions of the instruments were validated and data were collected from students at the first and third year of course. This first set of empirical data showed a progression of scores from the first to the third year. The next step will be the full integration of clinical reasoning in the framework of professionalism, through the {{development of}} Virtual Patients (VPs) and of scripts for Simulated Patients (SPs) in which problems of diagnostic and therapeutic management are embedded in realistic, complex situations requiring communication skills and socio-cultural and ethical competencies. VPs are computer-based simulations, while SPs are probably the best way to assess both clinical competence and professionalism at large. Our final aim is to draw a <b>progress</b> <b>line</b> for the multidimensional assessment of developing professionalism from the first to the sixth year of medical curriculum, moving toward a systemic approach...|$|E

40|$|We have {{witnessed}} the rise of ecologist movements since {{the second half of}} 20. Century when it is understood that t he mankind has exploited and polluted the world he/ she lives on as far as the world will be exterminated by the mankind. This rise has sometimes been concrete with the acts of an organization that is environmental protector; has come into existence with t he basic thesis of green parties that contains ecologist policies or {{has been one of the}} basic arguments of international politics. As a consequence of this, environmental awareness and protectionist approach have been mentioned from national policy docume nts and green party programs to international/ supranational agreements and acts of environmentalist activists in the academic studies in a broad framework. Moreover, a lot of ecological based philosophical trend like deep ecology, eco - socialism, eco - femin ism, etc. has emerged in this process. In the period in question, a sector has also adopted the environmental awareness as a subject; but this sector’s activities haven’t been mentioned so much in academic studies. Mentioned sector is cinema; in other wor ds, it is American and European based film industry. American based Holywood is the center that made the first production in this sense. Starting from 1970 ’s, lots of films have been begun to play under the main topic of disaster movie. European film indus try has started to use this theme as of 2000 ’s yet. First produced films were fictionalized via disaster scenarios which arise depending on a singular problem. In this frame, lots of factors like an earthquake, flood, a disease that a virus appears suddenl y creates were thought as the initiator of disaster. The solutions found for singular problem are usually the solutions found depending on the work of a person or a small group of professionals. In time, we can see that the themes change into global ecolog ical disasters which affect the world in general, dystopias or ecotopias in some films (like avatar). With reference to the basic thesis which is that the environmentalist approach in the sector of cinema improves appropriately to basic ecological paradigm s; this study aims to trace ecological approach in this sector. Within the frame of this objective, films which have important role in the history of the cinema (chosen films have 6 points and above in IMDB lists) and reflect environmental awareness have b een tried to be analyzed as part of common themes in the study. The source of environmental problems (of pollution), found solution and source of solution, mass movements in the solution process, action manners and convenience of film’s release date to th e <b>progress</b> <b>line</b> of ecological movements constitute the fundamental points of analysis...|$|E

Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing. As shooting <b>progressed</b> <b>lines</b> of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production.
