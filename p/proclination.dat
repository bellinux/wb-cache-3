40|$|Objective. Maxillary {{anterior}} spacing is {{a common}} aesthetic complaint of patients. Midline diastema has a multifactorial etiology such as labial frenulum, microdontia, mesiodens, peg-shaped lateral incisors, agenesis, cysts, habits such as finger sucking, tongue thrusting, or lip sucking, dental malformations, genetics, <b>proclinations,</b> dental-skeletal discrepancies, and imperfect coalescence of interdental septum. Appropriate technique and material for effective treatment are based on time, physical, psychological, and economical limitations. Direct composite resins in diastema cases allow dentist and patient complete control of these limitations and formation of natural smile. Clinical Considerations. In this case report a maxillary midline diastema was closed with direct composite resin restorations in one appointment without any preparation. One bottle total etch adhesive was used and translucent/opaque composite resin shades were layered on mesial surfaces of the teeth that were isolated with rubber dam and Teflon bands. Finishing and polishing procedures were achieved by using polishing discs. Patient was informed for recalls for every 6 months. Conclusions. At one-year recall no sensitivities, discolorations, or fractures were detected on teeth and restorations. Direct composite resins seemed to be highly aesthetic and durable restorations that can satisfy patients as under the conditions of case presented...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the very {{long-term}} results after Herbst treatment with respect to changes in the mandibular incisor segment: incisor inclination, incisor alignment, and gingival status. METHODS: Fourteen patients were derived from a sample of 22 consecutive patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusions treated with the banded Herbst appliance. Intraoral photographs, mandibular dental casts, and lateral head films were analyzed from before (T 1, age 12. 5 years) and after (T 2, age 14 years) treatment, and at 6 years (T 3, age 20 years) and 32 years (T 4, age 46 years) after treatment. RESULTS: At T 1, incisor inclination in the 14 subjects was, on average, 100. 1 °. From T 1 to T 2, the incisors were proclined in 11 (79 %) of the 14 patients, with an average value of 5. 2 °. Maximum <b>proclinations</b> of 10 ° were found in 2 subjects. From T 2 to T 4, tooth inclination recovered completely in 7 (63 %) of the 11 patients. Incisor irregularity values were, on average, 3. 4 mm at T 1 and 3. 0 mm at T 2. These increased from T 2 to T 4 by 40 % and had an average value of 5. 0 mm at T 4. Clinically insignificant labial gingival recessions on single front teeth were registered in 1 subject at T 2 and in 8 subjects at T 4. Gingival recessions were seen especially on bodily displaced incisors. CONCLUSIONS: In Herbst patients followed for 32 years after therapy, proclined mandibular incisors generally rebounded. The increase in posttreatment incisor tooth irregularity was not thought to be related to incisor tooth inclination changes but more likely resulted from physiologic processes occurring throughout life. Minor gingival recessions (especially on bodily displaced and crowded canines and incisors) seen in a few patients, 32 years after treatment, seemed not to be related to the posttreatment tooth inclination changes...|$|R

30|$|A {{treatment}} protocol for managing patients with gingival recession was presented, in which, ideally further incisor <b>proclination</b> should be avoided.

40|$|The {{pressures}} {{from the lower}} lip on the lower incisors were measured at the midline between the central incisors and between the left lateral incisor and canine. The measurements were made with the lip at rest and during swallowing of water in 24 boys and 40 girls aged 9 - 15 years. The children were divided into four groups, two treated with a lip bumper with and without an oral shield, and two with a lingual arch with and without springs for <b>proclination</b> of the lower incisors. Recordings of the pressures were made {{before the start of}} the treatment, and 3 and 8 months after the use of the appliance, as well as 4 months after the removal of the lip bumper or lingual arch. The treatment with a lip bumper did not change the pressure from the lip on the lower incisors at rest. The pressure at the midline during swallowing was also unaffected by the lip bumper therapy, but the pressure between the lateral incisor and canine increased. Thus, lip bumper therapy did not lead to decreased pressure from the lip on the incisors. <b>Proclination</b> of the lower incisors with a lingual arch resulted in an increase of the pressure from the lip at rest.

30|$|The {{concept of}} an {{alveolar}} ‘envelope’ was proposed, within which the teeth should be maintained. The cortical bone of the alveolar process {{was considered to be}} the anatomic border of this envelope. Thus, the prospect of alveolar distraction in the anterior region was discussed as a means of ‘transporting’ the alveolar process with the teeth, creating better conditions to avoid recessions. This was evaluated in a comparative controlled longitudinal study of orthodontic treatment alone versus orthodontic treatment in conjunction to distraction[10]. Overall all groups demonstrated an increase in clinical crown height and a variable degree of gingival recession over the follow-up period, no matter if the <b>proclination</b> was achieved with pure orthodontics or by means of destruction. No definable value of incisor <b>proclination</b> leading to gingival recession could be identified. However, severe <b>proclination</b> appeared to be contributory. It appeared that respect for the bony envelope alone was not sufficient to avoid recessions. The importance of the soft tissue envelope could be considered in the future as a contributing factor.|$|E
30|$|This {{preliminary}} study describes {{the association of}} a modified Herbst appliance and TADs comparing {{the effects of this}} new protocol to traditional Herbst treatment. To date, with a history of over 100 years, the Herbst appliance is still considered a state-of-the-art solution and the most used noncompliance device for class II treatment[23 – 26]. All fixed bite-jumping devices generate both skeletal and dental effects, resulting as a main side effect in a <b>proclination</b> of the lower incisors, contributing to overjet reduction[14 – 16]. This undesired effect can minimize the skeletal effects and impede the desired forward displacement of the mandible, thereby preventing the establishment of a solid class I final dental relationship and a tight intercuspation. Although many {{attempts have been made to}} avoid lower incisor <b>proclination,</b> e.g., with the use of cast mandibular appliances, archwires with torque bends, or brackets with selective torques, absolute anchorage control has not yet been achieved and loss of mandibular anchorage can be anticipated[27, 28]. This is especially undesirable in patients where the lower incisors already exhibit a compensatory <b>proclination</b> at the start of treatment, for which reason, further <b>proclination</b> should be avoided during the correction of the sagittal discrepancy. This was taken into consideration when the patients were assigned to the experimental or the control group. A randomized assignment to groups was considered unethical, and the five cases with the greatest <b>proclination</b> of the lower incisors measured to the mandibular plane were therefore assigned to the EG. To reduce bias, the same bracket prescription was used in all the cases, and patients either requiring extractions or with lower arch crowding greater than 4 mm were excluded from the sample. Therefore, the changes in lower incisor position that resulted from leveling and alignment or the space closure phases were excluded. Most cephalometric errors are either due to experience of the operator or to landmark identification[29]. All landmark identification and measurements were carried out twice by the same experienced operator. In case of discrepancy between the first and second measurements, a third measurement was then performed.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the aims}} of using TADs in our {{treatment}} protocol was to reduce the unwanted dentoalveolar side effects; however, <b>proclination</b> of the upper incisors and retroclination of the lower incisors were unavoidable. This could {{be a result of}} the inherent flexibility of the vertical arms that connect the lower TADs to the mandibular incisors, as this may have allowed wire flexion under the effect of the heavy inter-maxillary elastics, thereby allowing for retroclination of the lower incisors. Similarly, the arms that connect the palatal TADs to the acrylic pads of the hybrid MARPE may have flexed under the protractive effect of the Class III elastics, allowing for <b>proclination</b> of the maxillary incisors.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} dental, skeletal, and profile changes after {{functional}} appliances and subsequent fixed appliances treatment {{in order to}} quantify their effect and evaluate the influence of initial incisal inclination and growth pattern. Materials and methods: A retrospective cephalometric analysis was performed in 125 patients (77 females and 48 males). Three lateral cephalograms per patient were available: before treatment (T 0, mean age 11. 9 years), after functional treatment (T 1, mean age 12. 9 years), and after fixed appliances (T 2, mean age 14. 8 years). Results: At T 1, a decrease of SNA (0. 38 ° ± 0. 77, P < 0. 05), an increase of SNB (1. 46 ° ± 0. 66, P < 0. 05), and a less convex profile (increase N′–Sn′–Pog′ of 2. 93 ° ± 0. 87, P < 0. 05) were observed as compared to T 0. The position of the upper incisors normalizes: initially retroclined upper incisors showed <b>proclination</b> and proclined incisors retroclination. At T 1, <b>proclination</b> of the lower incisors was also noticed, being smaller the higher the initial I^NB. At T 2, no significant changes in upper and lower incisor position were noticed compared to T 1, {{as well as a}} decrease of the SNA (1. 17 ° ± 0. 75, P < 0. 001) and SNB angles (0. 41 ° ± 0. 64, P < 0. 05) and a stable profile convexity. Conclusion: The improvement of the Class II relationship at T 1 was mostly due to dentoalveolar changes: correction of the upper incisor position and <b>proclination</b> of the lower incisors.

30|$|Three recent {{retrospective}} {{studies also}} tested various Invisalign groups. One showed the moderate ability of Invisalign to manage overbite [29].

On the other hand, a second study [31] reported {{the ability of}} Invisalign to bodily distalize maxillary molars in adult nonextraction mild class II cases (≤[*]½ cusp), with no changes in facial height. Finally, a third study [32] showed the ability of Invisalign to correct mild to moderate crowding nonextraction cases without causing {{significant changes in the}} mandibular incisor position and inclination. On the contrary, such changes (protrusion and <b>proclination)</b> were induced in cases with severe crowding (≥[*] 6  mm).|$|E
30|$|Only minor {{skeletal}} {{changes with}} very little clinical relevance were seen after the observational period. Most of the changes produced by the FR- 2 treatment were at the dental level including palatal tipping of the maxillary incisors and slight <b>proclination</b> of the mandibular incisors, both accounting for the noteworthy overjet reduction.|$|E
30|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to avoid mandibular anchorage loss, among the others, class III elastics and mandibular splints, but these approaches are usually not effective [12]. Recently, innovative methods that are more effective in controlling mandibular arch anchorage and in maintaining {{the position of the}} lower incisors have been experimented [13]. In fact, previous {{studies have shown that the}} Herbst appliance can be used together with orthodontic miniscrews, anchored into the mandibular bone, in order to ensure better lower incisor anchorage and to reduce flaring of these teeth. It was showed a causal effect between the control of mandibular incisor <b>proclination</b> and the increase in skeletal effects of the Herbst appliance; in fact, a better mandibular incisor <b>proclination</b> control seems to allow a slightly mesial displacement of the mandible [14, 15] and consequently could increased the pharyngeal dimension.|$|E
30|$|The mentolabial {{region and}} angle must be {{carefully}} evaluated when planning orthognathic surgery, particularly mandibular surgery, osseous genioplasty or the placement of chin implants. The upper component of the angle may be affected by mandibular incisor <b>proclination</b> during class III decompensation, which will, to some extent, lead to concomitant <b>proclination</b> of the lower lip and thereby reduction of the mentolabial angle. Any surgical procedure that increases mentolabial height will increase the mentolabial angle and thereby open the fold, e.g. mandibular advancement, to a three-point (tripod) landing, antero-inferior advancement genioplasty or clockwise rotation of the mandible or maxillomandibular complex. The opposite is also true; any procedure that reduces lower face height tends to deepen the mentolabial fold and decrease the angle. Therefore, the aesthetics of this region are vitally important {{both in terms of}} dentofacial surgical diagnosis and treatment planning [3].|$|E

Methods Retrospective study. Inclusion criteria: a) Class II ≥ 5 mm molar relationship; b) Herbst appliance ≥ 9 months in situ; and c) finished active treatment. Incisor position was measured on digital models before treatment, on the digital target setup, and on digital models obtained at the day of debonding. All measurements were performed by one investigator. Results Twelve patients (8 females, 4 males) out of 632 cases treated with a lingual appliance were included in the study. The measurement error computed with Dahlberg's formula was 0. 2 °. Seven cases had planned (target setup) mandibular incisor uprighting (ccr), and five cases had <b>proclination</b> (clockwise rotation). There was no statistical difference (p > 0. 05) between planned incisor rotations of the target setup and achieved incisor rotations at the day of debonding.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{prerequisite}} {{for development of}} gingival recession {{is the presence of}} alveolar bone dehiscence. <b>Proclination</b> of mandibular incisors can result in thinning of the alveolus and dehiscence formation. OBJECTIVE: To assess an association between <b>proclination</b> of mandibular incisor and development of gingival recession. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen subjects who met the following inclusion criteria were selected: 1. age 11 - 14 years at start of orthodontic treatment (TS), 2. bonded retainer placed immediately after treatment (T 0), 3. dental casts and lateral cephalograms available pre-treatment (TS), post-treatment (T 0), and 5 years post-treatment (T 5), and 4. post-treatment (T 0) lower incisor inclination (Inc_Incl) 100. 5 degrees. Two groups were formed: non-proclined (N = 57; mean Inc_Incl = 90. 8 degrees) and proclined (N = 60; mean Inc_Incl = 105. 2 degrees). Clinical crown heights of mandibular incisors and the presence of gingival recession sites in this region were assessed on plaster models. Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, and regression models were computed for analysis of inter-group differences. RESULTS: The mean increase of clinical crown heights (from T 0 to T 5) of mandibular incisors ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 83 mm in the non-proclined and proclined groups, respectively (P = 0. 273). At T 5, gingival recession sites were present in 12. 3 % and 11. 7 % patients from the non-proclined and proclined groups, respectively. The difference was also not significant (P = 0. 851).

40|$|The {{effects of}} labial incisor {{movements}} are controversial, {{and the effects}} of expansion of maxillary posterior teeth remain unknown. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the long-term prevalence of gingival recession following orthodontic tooth movements. Records of 205 patients (162 female, 43 male) were obtained from two private practice orthodontists who were careful to avoid excessive labial movement of mandibular incisors and maxillary posterior teeth. Using pre-treatment (14. 0 ? 5. 9 years) and post-treatment (16. 5 ? 6. 0 years) lateral cephalograms and dental models, changes in mandibular incisor inclination and maxillary arch widths were determined. Gingival recession was measured based on post-treatment and post-retention (32. 3 ? 8. 5 years) intraoral slides. Associations between tooth movements and gingival recession were evaluated statistically. There was only limited recession at the end of orthodontic treatment (5. 8 % of teeth exhibited recession; 0. 6 % exhibited recession greater than 1 mm). Recession increased long-term (41. 7 % of teeth), however the severity was limited (7. 0 % over 1 mm). Both incisor <b>proclination</b> and retroclination occurred, resulting in no statistically significant treatment change (- 0. 05 ? 6. 4 ?). <b>Proclination</b> was greatest in individuals with the most upright incisors at the beginning of treatment (R = - 0. 575; p < 0. 001). There was no relationship between the treatment changes in mandibular incisor <b>proclination</b> and the post-treatment changes in gingival recession. There was also no difference in recession between incisors that finished treatment at an incisor to mandibular plane angle (IMPA) of less than 95 ? versus those that finished at an IMPA greater than or equal to 95 ?. Expansion of the maxillary posterior teeth was limited (1. 1 ? 2. 0 mm, 0. 2 ? 2. 6 mm, and - 0. 2 ? 2. 2 mm for the first premolars, second premolars, and first molars, respectively). There were weak positive correlations (0. 173 to 0. 407) between increases in maxillary arch widths and recession long-term. Orthodontic treatment is not a risk factor for the development of gingival recession. <b>Proclination</b> of the mandibular incisors does not increase the risk for recession long-term if care is taken to avoid excessive labial movements. Expansion of the maxillary premolars and first molars does increase the risk of long-term recession, but the increase is limited...|$|E
