Sullivan Award to his—and his father's—former {{high school}} alma mater, Saint Stanislaus College prep school, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He also <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> jersey to the school. The trophy, awards and jersey were {{enshrined}} in the Brother Alexis Memorial Resource Center on the Saint Stanislaus campus until they were briefly lost to flooding during Hurricane Katrina. The items have since been recovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, the Swiss anatomist Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905) <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> orthogenetic theory, heterogenesis, {{arguing for}} wholly {{separate}} lines of descent with no common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> first {{budget in}} April 1932. He {{maintained}} the severe budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E
5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E

5|$|Shatner had <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> idea to studio head Frank Mancuso while filming The Voyage Home. Mancuso liked Shatner's {{idea and}} agreed to hire a writer to draft a film treatment. Shatner wanted novelist Eric Van Lustbader, but {{negotiations}} between Lustbader and Paramount failed over the author's requested $1million salary. Shatner dictated the story himself {{and gave it to}} Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.|$|E
5|$|The poet John Lydgate (1370–1451), {{who lived}} {{all his life}} in Bury St Edmunds, <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> twelve-year-old king Henry VI of England with a long poem (now known as Metrical Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund) when Henry came to the town in 1433 and stayed at the abbey for four months. The book is now kept by the British Library in London.|$|E
5|$|After he {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} civil engineering from Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada, Ram Gopal Varma opened a video-rental shop in Ameerpet. Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former sound recordist for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Akkineni Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna rejected it, Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view.|$|E

5|$|After he had {{realized}} {{the validity of}} this geometric analogy, it took Einstein a further three years to find the missing cornerstone of his theory: the equations describing how matter influences spacetime's curvature. Having formulated what are now known as Einstein's equations (or, more precisely, his field equations of gravity), he <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> new theory of gravity at several sessions of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in late 1915, culminating in his final presentation on November 25, 1915.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to shoot animals {{when it was}} necessary for the purpose of examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, as a gift to the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Gaols Committee's inquiries, several key figures within the jails were tried for murder in August 1729, {{including}} Thomas Bambridge of the Fleet and William Acton of the Marshalsea. Given the strongly worded report of the Gaols Committee, the trials were major public events. Ginger writes that, when the Prince of Wales's bookseller <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> bill {{at the end of that}} year, two of the 41volumes on it were accounts of William Acton's trial.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was sworn}} in on December 31, 2005 at the Buffalo Convention Center. During his first day in office he toured the Buffalo Waterfront to show his {{commitment}} to its development. Before {{the end of the}} year, restoration on the original point where the Erie Canal met the Great Lakes was underway. Brown <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> plans for the development during subsequent tours by top state leaders, including future New York State Governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson. Erie Canal Harbor eventually opened on July 2, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the hostility}} with which Candaules was met on its exhibition, it {{was bought by}} Robert Vernon, who had made a fortune {{supplying}} horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection. Vernon <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> collection to the nation in 1847, although {{in the case of}} Candaules a painting so controversial becoming government property was a source of some embarrassment. In 1929 Candaules was transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Dalton orally <b>presented</b> <b>his</b> first list of {{relative}} atomic weights {{for a number}} of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures. The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E
