50|$|The <b>Pyrotron</b> is {{a device}} {{designed}} to help firefighters better understand how to combat the rapid spread of bush fires in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The closed {{nature of}} the <b>Pyrotron</b> enables {{researchers}} to carry out tests under consistent conditions without need for unpredictable variables. The data of these tests, the CSIRO website notes, is recorded by a myriad of sensors and high speed, as well as thermal cameras. By testing different types of fuel and wind speeds, bushfire researchers are able to create predictive models of the spread of fires based on the local topography of the region at risk, thus enabling firefighters to better combat the conflagrations.|$|E
