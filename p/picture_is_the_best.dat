40|$|High-speed motion {{pictures}} have {{enabled us to}} study the swimming movements of Bosmina Zongirostris. These small cladocerans swim using antenna 1 movements which superficially resemble those of a human breaststroke, The time taken for each stroke is relatively constant, and {{the movements of the}} antennae during a stroke are nearly invariant. Thus, the animals vary their average speed mainly by varying the interval between strokes. In the absence of antenna 1 forces, a Bosmina body would move broadside. Forces produced by the antennae of a swimming Bosmina constrain the body to move edgewise. The shape of <b>the</b> body <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> shape which minimizes drag. The orientation and shape of the body may reflect opposing selection for reducing drag and the ability of predators to find Bosmina and for the ability of predators to manipulate Bosmina. The precision and accuracy with which we can measure the swimming motion of a zooplankter limit our understanding of its energetics and of the ability of other animals to detect, pursue, and capture it. Because the velocity of a zooplankter changes very rapidly during each swim-ming stroke, an analysis of high-speed motion <b>pictures</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> means toward understanding the drag forces exerted on it (see Enright 1977; Lehman 1977; Strickler 1977; Vlymen 1977).

The key question is: If this reactive backward looking approach does not portray <b>the</b> true <b>picture,</b> what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> approach? What <b>the</b> industry needs <b>is</b> a new paradigm for measuring safety performance on construction sites i. e. a proactive approach rather than just depending on the reactive data. Studies by many researchers have suggested looking away from these post-accident scenarios. The proactive approach measures site activities. It measures safe behaviour rather than unsafe behaviour. <b>The</b> proactive approach <b>is</b> able to provide essential feedback on performance before incidents occur. These on-going measures will be able to monitor the safety performance on site. The safety performance measurement tool (SPMT) was designed as an interactive assessment tool using MS Access and MS Excel to measure safety performance for construction sites. SPMT uses available knowledge to generate a solution to an industry safety problem. This tool concentrates on proactive measures of culture and behaviour. It is applied on site using questionnaires, observations and document checks, which are be entered into a measurement database. The tool requires the involvement of personnel within the construction project. At present, SPMT has been designed to include the participation of head office management, site management, site supervisors, site operatives and specialist-contractor’s management. Using SPMT enables real-time feedback on safety performance. SPMT is a measurement tool that identifies substandard performance, allows focussed remedial action and evaluates the progress or regress of safety performance on construction sites. SPMT aims to move the industry away from a purely reactive response and towards a more proactive approach to the improvement of safety performance. This approach will contribute to changing the working culture in the construction industry...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} motion models {{that can be}} used to warp blocks between frames, such as the affine, projective, and bilinear motion models [19]. In the past, these motion models have <b>been</b> used in <b>the</b> context of predictive video codecs to obtain more accurate predictions, especially when non-translational motion is present. For example, in [20], block matching with several first-order geometric transforms was proposed and significant RD performance improvements were obtained when compared to simple translational block matching. More recently, a parametric motion representation was proposed [21] where a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracking algorithm is adopted to match correspondence points and a motion segmentation algorithm is used to compute several parameter sets for a perspective transform; then, several warped reference <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> generated and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>is</b> selected for <b>the</b> coding process. In [22], a parametric Skip mode is proposed using a parametric motion estimation algorithm with cubic spline interpolation to obtain a set of motion model parameters for each frame; these parameters describe the global motion between the current and last decoded frames. Then, a new zero-residue Skip mode makes use of the estimated parameters to obtain a new prediction that can be selected for each block (although more typically used for background areas that may be well described with global motion). In the past, advanced motion models have brought significant advances in terms of coding performance for predictive video codecs at the cost of higher encoding and decoding complexity. However, these advanced motion models have not yet <b>been</b> exploited in <b>the</b> context of distributed video codecs, i.e., SI creation solutions employing advanced motion models based on geometric transforms to perform the SI frame interpolation are not available in the literature.|$|R

Traditional measurement approaches include accident investigations, inspections and job safety analyses. The question often posed is do these statistics reflect the actual safety effectiveness on site? Almost always they do not. These numbers often just tell how lucky or unlucky <b>the</b> site has <b>been</b> and do not reflect the level of effectiveness of safety performance on site. <b>The</b> key question <b>is</b> if this reactive, backward looking approach does not portray <b>the</b> true <b>picture,</b> what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> approach? What <b>the</b> industry needs <b>is</b> a new paradigm for measuring safety performance on construction sites i. e. a proactive approach rather than just depending on the reactive data. Studies by many researchers have suggested moving away from these post- accident scenarios towards a proactive approach that measures site activities and safe behaviour rather than unsafe behaviour. <b>The</b> proactive approach <b>is</b> able to provide essential feedback on performance before incidents occur. These on-going measures are able to monitor the safety performance on site. Various in-house systems exist but the industry lacks a comprehensive tool that can be used on any site. The safety performance measurement tool (SPMT) has been designed as an interactive assessment tool using MS Access and MS Excel to measure safety performance for construction sites. SPMT uses available knowledge to generate a solution to an industry safety problem. This tool concentrates on proactive measures of culture and behaviour. It is applied on site using questionnaire, observations and document checks, which are entered into a measurement database. SPMT has been designed to include the participation of head office management, site management, site supervisors, site operatives and specialist-contractor's management. <b>The</b> tool has <b>been</b> developed from an extensive literature review and three incremental surveys using expert opinion and a broader verificationirom a large industry sample. SPMT has been validated through field tests on four construction projects, with two projects including a further application after responding to feedback from the first test. SPMT enables real-time feedback on safety performance, identifies substandard performance, allows focussed remedial action and evaluates the progress or regress of safety performance on construction sites. The future potential of SPMT as a generic safety performance measurement tool has been demonstrated. SPMT aims to move the industry away from a purely reactive response and towards a more proactive approach to the improvement of safety performance. This approach will contribute to changing the working culture in the construction industry...|$|R
