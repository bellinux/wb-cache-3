5|$|Tesla {{obtained}} around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, {{and various}} sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are {{a minimum of}} 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into <b>patent</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having secured <b>patent</b> <b>protection</b> for his {{designs and}} general {{adoption}} by the Brandywine millers, Evans now {{turned his attention}} outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans's work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 {{to thank him for}} the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans's technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village and was so impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans's brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.|$|E

To the extent that <b>patent</b> <b>protections</b> are needed as part of the incentive structure for new drug and vaccine development, it may be better to strengthen <b>patent</b> <b>protections</b> on nonterror-related drugs and vaccines to avoid production capacity problems, as well as follow-up research and development problems.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of R&D investment {{at the national level}} with an emphasis on the roles of <b>patent</b> rights <b>protection,</b> international technology transfer through trade and FDI, and economic growth, in addition to the essentials of human capital accumulation and the number of scientific researchers. The Extreme-Bounds-Analysis (EBA) approach is applied to examine the robustness and sensitivity of these factors. The results of the EBA tests on data from 26 OECD countries from 1996 to 2006 showed that tertiary education and the proportion of scientific researchers in a country were robust determinants that had positive effects on R&D intensity.

Service industry innovations differ from innovations in industries that produce physical products because they rarely have intellectual property and <b>patent</b> <b>protections.</b> However, investment banking services are typically a series of interrelated businesses such as consulting, wealth management and accounting, and innovations require a business wide coordinated approach.

25|$|Ondansetron (marketed {{under the}} brand name Zofran) was {{developed}} in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted US <b>patent</b> <b>protection</b> in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the US FDA in January 1991.

By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US).

50|$|In {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, {{obstacles}} to industrialization were largely internal, while in the second half largely external. Internal impediments to industrialization were due to Mexico's difficult topography and lack of secure and efficient transportation, remedied in the late nineteenth century by railroad construction.

Internal tariffs, licensing for enterprises, special taxes, lack of legislation to promote joint-stock companies that protected investors, lack of enforcement to collect loans or enforce contracts, lack of <b>patent</b> <b>protections,</b> and the lack of a unified court system or legal framework to promote business made creating an enterprise a lengthy and fraught process.|$|R
