To that end, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, Brent oil prices, the US dollar, the American Dow Jones Industrial Index, Wholesale Price Index, Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 Index, and monthly average time deposit interest rates were selected as the factors with possible impact on gold prices; and relevant econometric models were constructed. In the model that delivered the best results among all the models estimated by using the Engle-Granger two-step estimation procedure, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices {{were found to be}} the single and most important variable that influences the gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> the Istanbul Gold Exchange.
