40|$|Background: <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> exert {{important}} homeostatic {{functions in}} the healthy intestinal mucosa, whereas in case of colorectal cancer (CRC), infiltration of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the tumor is crucial for an effective anti-tumor immune response. In both situations, the recruitment mechanisms of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the tissues are essential for the immunological functions deciding the outcome. The recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is largely dependent on their expression of various chemokine receptors. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify potential chemokine receptors involved in the recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to normal human colonic mucosa and to CRC tissue, respectively, by examining the expression of 16 different chemokine receptors on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> isolated from these tissues. Methods: Tissues were collected from patients undergoing bowel resection for CRC. Lymphocytes were isolated through enzymatic tissue degradation of CRC tissue and nearby located unaffected mucosa, respectively. The expression of a broad panel of chemokine receptors on the freshly isolated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was examined by flow cytometry. Results: In the normal colonic mucosa, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2, CCR 4, CXCR 3, and CXCR 6 differed significantly between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> suggesting that the molecular mechanisms mediating <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recruitment to the gut differ between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In CRC, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2 and CXCR 5 were significantly lower in both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations compared to unaffected colonic mucosa, and the frequency of CCR 9 + cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was significantly decreased in CRC tissue. Conclusions: With regard to the normal gut mucosa, the results suggest that the molecular mechanisms mediating <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recruitment differ between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which are important for understanding gut homeostasis. Importantly, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from CRC compared to normal colonic tissue displayed a distinct chemokine receptor expression profile, suggesting that mechanisms for recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to CRC tissue are skewed compared to normal colonic mucosa.

40|$|Tissue {{eosinophil}} infiltration, {{which is}} a hallmark of allergic and helminthic diseases, is mainly coordinated by <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> via the production of eosinophilotactic chemokines. Among <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets, lymphocytes expressing gamma delta TCR have been determined as a key factor for eosinophil accumulation via direct and indirect mechanisms. This knowledge is strongly supported by the fact that, in different experimental models of eosinophilic airway inflammation and helminth-induced Th 2 lung inflammation, an evident tissue accumulation of gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is observed. In addition, the depletion of gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is correlated with the impairment of eosinophil accumulation in inflamed tissue. Gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are non-conventional <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which comprise a minor <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subset, mainly distributed in the tissue, and present crucial roles in innate and acquired immune responses.

However, the nature of opioids produced by T cells is still matter of debate in mice. Whereas β-endorphin has been found in <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by using antibody-based methods, messenger RNA (mRNA) quantification shows mainly mRNA encoding for enkephalins. The objective of the study is to elucidate the nature of T cell-derived opioids responsible for analgesia and clarify discrepancy of the results at the protein and genetic levels. MethodsCD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were isolated from wild-type and enkephalin-deficient mice. mRNA encoding for β-endorphin and enkephalin was quantified by RT-qPCR. The binding of commercially available polyclonal anti-endorphin antibodies to lymphocytes from wild-type or enkephalin knockout mice was assessed by cytofluorometry. Opioid-mediated analgesic properties of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from wild-type and enkephalin-deficient mice were compared in a model of inflammation-induced somatic pain by measuring sensitivity to mechanical stimuli using calibrated von Frey filaments. ResultsCD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> expressed high level of mRNA encoding for enkephalins but not for β-endorphin in mice. Anti-β-endorphin polyclonal IgG antibodies are specific for β-endorphin but cross-react with enkephalins. Anti-β-endorphin polyclonal antibodies bound to wild-type but not enkephalin-deficient CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Endogenous regulation of inflammatory pain by wild-type <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was completely abolished when <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were deficient in enkephalins.

Thus, staining of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by anti-β-endorphin polyclonal IgG reported in most of studies in mice is because of their binding to enkephalins.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was determined in CMV-seropositive rhesus macaques {{with or without}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by using the sensitive assays of intracellular cytokine staining and gamma interferon ELISPOT. Both techniques yielded 3 - to 1, 000 -fold-higher frequencies of CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> than traditional proliferative limiting dilution assays. The median {{frequency of}} CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in 23 CMV-seropositive SIV-negative macaques was 0. 63 % (range, 0. 16 to 5. 8 %). The majority of CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were CD 95 pos and CD 27 lo but expressed variable levels of CD 45 RA. A significant reduction (P < 0. 05) {{in the frequency of}} CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was observed in pathogenic SIV-infected macaques but not in macaques infected with live attenuated strains of SIV. CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were not detected in six of nine pathogenic SIV-infected rhesus macaques. CMV DNA was detected in the plasma of four of six of these macaques but in no animal with detectable CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In pathogenic SIV-infected macaques, loss of CMV-specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was not predicted by the severity of CD 4 + T lymphocytopenia.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade a {{substantial}} body of evidence has accumulated that supports the existence of functionally distinct subsets of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> This concept has been particularly reinforced by the observations that cytolytic activity by <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> correlates with recognition of (or restriction by) class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ~ gene products while <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> helper/ amplifier function is associated with recognition of class II MHC gene products (1, 2). The association of these discrete functional activities with <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations expressing mutually exclusive cell surface markers further supports this hypothesis (3). However, the concept that cytolytic function is a property of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> recognizing class I MHC gene products has been called into question by observations made with alioreactive <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Several reports (4 - 7) in the mouse demonstrated the generation of cytolytic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CTL) directed to H- 2 I region products in mixed leukocyte cultures.

40|$|Antigen {{presentation}} to <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{has been characterized}} extensively in terms of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation and eventual cell death. In contrast, {{little is known about}} the consequences of antigen presentation for the antigen-presenting cell (APC). We have determined the outcome of major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted peptide {{presentation to}} a specific T cell. We demonstrate that specific <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> interaction with peptide-presenting APCs led to apoptosis in the APC population. In contrast, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> interaction with nonpeptide-loaded APCs or APCs loaded with monosubstituted peptide failed to induce <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> secretion of interleukin- 2 and APC apoptosis. Phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial depolarization were used to evaluate APC apoptosis. Fas/Fas ligand interactions were not required, but cytoskeletal integrity and caspase activation were essential for APC apoptosis. Antigen presentation leading to <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation is therefore coordinated with apoptosis in the APC population and could provide a mechanism of immune response regulation by eliminating APCs, which have fulfilled their role as specific ligands for <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation. This pathway may have particular importance for APCs, which are not sensitive to death receptor-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{outcome for}} {{glioblastoma}} patients remains dismal for its invariably recrudesces within 2 cm of the resection cavity. Local immunotherapy {{has the potential}} to eradicate the residual infiltrative component of these tumors. Here, we report the development of a biodegradable hydrogel containing therapeutic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> for localized delivery to glioblastoma cells for brain tumor immunotherapy. Thermoreversible poly(ethylene glycol) -g-chitosan hydrogels (PCgels) were optimized for steady <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> release. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the chemical structure of poly(ethylene glycol) -g-chitosan, and rheological studies revealed that the sol-to-gel transition of the PCgel occurred around ≥ 32 °C. <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> invasion through the PCgel and subsequent cytotoxicity to glioblastoma were assessed in vitro. The PCgel was shown to be cellular compatible with <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and the <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> retain their anti-glioblastoma activity after being encapsulated in the PCgel. <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the PCgel were shown to be more effective in killing glioblastoma than those in the Matrigel control.

40|$|International audienceClonally {{expanded}} CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{are present}} in multiple sclerosis lesions, {{as well as in}} the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are found in spinal cord and brainstem lesions. However, the exact phenotype of central nervous system-infiltrating CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and the mechanism by which these cells cross the blood-brain barrier remain largely unknown. Using cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and coronavirus-induced encephalitis, we demonstrate that central nervous system-infiltrating CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are mostly of the effector memory phenotype (CD 62 L(-) CCR 7 (-) granzymeB(hi)). We further show that purified human effector memory CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> transmigrate more readily across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells than non-effector memory CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and that blood-brain barrier endothelium promotes the selective recruitment of effector memory CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Furthermore, we provide evidence for the recruitment of interferon-γ- and interleukin- 17 -secreting CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by human and mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium. Finally, we show that in vitro migration of CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells is dependent on α 4 integrin, but independent of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 /leucocyte function-associated antigen- 1, activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule/CD 6 and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 /CCL 2. We also demonstrate that in vivo neutralization of very late antigen- 4 restricts central nervous system infiltration of CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in active immunization and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Our study thus demonstrates an active role of the blood-brain barrier in the recruitment of effector memory CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to the CNS compartment and defines α 4 integrin as a major contributor of CD 8 (+) <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> entry into the brain...|$|R

In the thymus, CD 3 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were increased at 25 dpi, with significant increases in the FAV infected noted at 1, 12, 20 dpi (p< 0. 05). This was accompanied by a corresponding increase of CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In the spleen, CD 3 + and CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were increased significantly at 30 dpi (p< 0. 01) whereas CD 8 + and TCR &# 947; &# 948;+ <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were decreased at 1 (p< 0. 05), 30 dpi (p< 0. 01).

40|$|The major {{complication}} after allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation is the occurrence of acute GvHD. This complication can be successfully prevented when <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are depleted from a bone marrow graft. The beneficial effect of prevention of acute GvHD is counterbalanced by an increased frequency of engraftment failures. In view of this problem several experiments were planned to unravel whether the engraftment failures after <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> depletion were attributable {{to the loss of}} the trophic function of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> or were attributable to the loss of the immunosuppressive action of donor Tlymphocytes. When the latter option is valid, more immunosuppression of the recipient would result in sustained engraftment ofT lymphocyte depleted bone marrow grafts. With regard to <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> depletion, it was attempted to positively select for stem cells and concomitantly negatively select for <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Stem cells are the essential cells in a bone marrow graft since they are responsible for sustained engraftment.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of IL- 2 with the IL- 2 -R plays {{a central role}} in the regulation of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation (1). Triggering oftheTCR leads to the synthesis of IL- 2 (in certain <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets) and to the induction of high affinity IL- 2 -Rs in antigen-activated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (2 - 4). It is the binding of IL- 2 to the high affinity IL- 2 -R (and the subsequent internalization of this complex) that leads to the cascade of events resulting in <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation (5, 6). While the role of IL- 2 /IL- 2 -R interaction in driving <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the cell cycle is well established, the factors that control the magnitude and duration of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation in response to antigen are less well understood. Early evidence favored the view that IL- 2 availability was the sole regulator of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation (1, 4). Later studies on the kinetics of IL- 2 -R expression revealed that IL- 2 -Rs were only transiently expressed on activated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and that the level of cell surface IL- 2 -Rs declined as a function of time after activation (7, 8).
