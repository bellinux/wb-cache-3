500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|At their reunion shows, the New York Dolls {{performed}} [...] "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory", with member Sylvain Sylvain {{singing the}} lead vocal and sometimes changing the title lyric to [...] "I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around you, Johnny." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> {{behind her}} and took a handful of her dear soft hair {{in my hand and}} kissed it.|$|R
60|$|She {{thanked me}} {{presently}} for my telegram, and I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> {{about her and}} drew her into the living room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Biddy," [...] I cried, getting up, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> {{round her}} neck, and {{giving her a}} kiss, [...] "I shall always tell you everything." ...|$|R
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a soft}} {{smile on}} her face; as she raised it to mine I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around her.|$|E
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{about him}} and, as my ankle gave {{way at the}} same moment, we nearly rolled upon the ground together.|$|E
60|$|And {{she looks}} at me so pitiful that I goes up to her and <b>puts</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round her and pats her on the back.|$|R
60|$|Now Ralph swung {{to and fro}} like {{a drunken}} man, and had I not <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> about him I believe {{that he would have}} fallen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isabel!" [...] I repeated, {{and then}} crossed {{over to her}} and crept closely to her, <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine.|$|R
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> round {{his neck}} and kissed him just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer.|$|E
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> round his neck, for I {{always felt}} {{to my father}} as to another boy; bigger than myself and older, but not so very much.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she moved}} her arm as though she felt for me blindly, and I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> about her and drew her head to my {{shoulder}} and she wept....|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} out with me," [...] I answered, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> through hers, and felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on the balcony.|$|R
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> on {{the back}} of his chair, and I saw in his glance that my words and my look at her empty place had {{prepared}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Catherine, {{why are you}} crying, love?' I asked, {{approaching}} and <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> {{over her}} shoulder. 'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around him, and found that I could raise him from the ground.|$|E
6000|$|I leant {{across and}} <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around him; I {{suppose it was}} un-English; {{there are times when}} one forgets these points. [...] "I did not know! I did not know," [...] I cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how cruel it is! When I saw {{the sorrow}} and {{surprise}} {{in his eyes}} I very nearly <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> about {{him and told him}} all. Don't you think we have done enough?" ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round {{his neck}} {{and sat down on}} his knee (the course I always take when I want to persuade him to {{anything}} with as few words as possible).|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mamma, I do wish you'd see {{the mouth}} of the oracle. It is so large, and so round, and so ugly. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> into it all the way," [...] said Mimmy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} you're {{wondering}} why I don't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round your waist,' the Duchess {{said after a}} pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?' ...|$|R
6000|$|A cod {{she laid}} below my head, [...] And served me with due respect, [...] And, to salute her wi' a kiss, [...] I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> about her neck. [...] The bonie lass, &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here he comes," [...] she murmured, {{and they}} could hear that her lips were dry with emotion. [...] "And I have to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> round his neck and look into his face as Marian did." ...|$|E
60|$|Shall we ever laugh again? If I {{could only}} see a dog that I knew in the old times! and could <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{around his neck and}} tell him all, everything, and ease my heart.|$|E
60|$|She {{helped me}} to rise, with the {{encouraging}} words which she might have used to a child. She <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> in hers, and led me carefully along through the wood, as if I had been an old man.|$|R
6000|$|His uncle {{shook his}} 'ead agin. [...] "She didn't want no asking," [...] he ses, {{speaking}} very slow and mournful. [...] "I just 'appened to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round her waist by accident {{one day and}} the thing was done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'None {{will ever}} know what I {{suffered}} then. But my love was my support and my strength, and I took my rightful place at my Kalula's side, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> about his neck, and whispered in his ear, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she seized my downcast {{head and}} kissed my hair. She caught {{at my face}} between her hands and kissed my lips. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> about her and we kissed together. I sprang {{to my feet and}} clasped her.|$|E
6000|$|... "There--there--let me <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around you. Don't cry. There--put your {{cheek to}} mine. Be comforted. I wish to live. I will live if I can. Ah, {{what could she}} do without me!... Does she often speak of me?--but I know she does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I did,' ses 'Arry. 'I do. And when I see 'im I'm {{going to}} <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> round 'im and twist 'is neck; then I'm {{going to break}} every bone in 'is body, and arter that I'm going to shy 'im {{overboard}} to pison the fishes with.' ...|$|E
60|$|I silently rose on <b>my</b> side, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> in his. We {{walked on}} slowly {{towards the end}} of the pier. Arrived there, he stood still, and spoke those hard first words--looking out over the broad blue waters: not looking at me.|$|R
2500|$|... "Went to luncheon in {{the ballroom}} in the White House. James Roosevelt took us in to see his father, President Roosevelt. He said, 'It's about time you came. How can I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> around all of you? Which is the oldest? You are all so big.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, {{my dearest}} father; my sheet is full; I wish I could <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> in yours and pace {{up and down}} the pier with you, and tell you more and more. But you know enough now, and that I am your affectionate son always, C. N." ...|$|R
