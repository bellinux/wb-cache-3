40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{particle}} swarm optimization (PSO) method for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem in power systems. Many nonlinear characteristics of the gener-ator, such as ramp rate limits, prohibited <b>operating</b> <b>zone,</b> and non-smooth cost functions are considered using the proposed method in practical generator operation. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated for three different systems, and it is com-pared with the GA method {{in terms of the}} solution quality and com-putation efficiency. The experimental results show that the pro-posed PSO method was indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in ED problems.

40|$|<b>Programs</b> <b>operating</b> on inductively defined data structures, such as lists, are {{naturally}} defined by recursive <b>programs,</b> while <b>programs</b> <b>operating</b> on `indexable' data structures, such as arrays, {{are naturally}} defined by iterative programs. It {{has recently been}} shown how many recursive programs can be transformed or compiled to iterative <b>programs</b> <b>operating</b> on arrays. Such transformed programs can be run more efficiently than the original programs, particularly on parallel computers. The present work is aimed at providing means for writing such iterative programs directly, using available language constructs of first order predicate calculus. The paper proposes the introduction of `bounded quantifications' in logic programming languages. These formulas offer a natural way to express <b>programs</b> <b>operating</b> on arrays and other `indexable' data structures. `Bounded quantifications' are similar to `array comprehensions' in functional languages such as Haskell. They are inherently concurrent and can [...] ...|$|R
