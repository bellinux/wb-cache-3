5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners have returned to work, and the mine <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while the soldiers are here, but when they go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E
50|$|The steam-powered <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> used until 1970, {{when new}} {{electric}} <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> brought into use.|$|R
50|$|Fuel is {{injected}} into a pre-combustion chamber. A Bosch M in-line injection <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> used, with a mechanical governor and vacuum-operated stop control. The <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> lubricated by {{a connection to}} the engine oil circulation and the fuel lift <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> mounted {{on the side of the}} injection <b>pump.</b> Preheating <b>is</b> by glow plugs with automatic control of preheating time.|$|R

5|$|Little {{attempt was}} made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, {{possibly}} because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as {{they were on the}} Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> used today.|$|E
5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{mounted on}} a common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
30|$|The {{hydraulic}} <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> {{the heart}} of a hydraulic system, which determines whether the whole system can run normally or not. Therefore, performance assessment and fault diagnosis of the hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> of great importance. Usually, when a hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> under an abnormal state, it will be revealed by changes of vibration. Because most mechanical faults are reflected by vibration[33], the vibration signals of the hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>are</b> collected and analyzed in this experiment for performance assessment and fault diagnosis.|$|R

Pump design, system parameters, and characteristics of the liquid <b>pumped</b> <b>are</b> all key factors in determining which <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> most suited for a given application. This paper covers design elements of nine different positive displacement pumps, their respective operating limits, performance characteristics, and a number of factors to consider when choosing a pump.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> empty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Most {{people who}} live in rural areas come from the low income families. One {{reason for this is that}} the revenue {{generation}} is limited to certain domestic economic activities due to poor access to electricity. As a result, it limits the productivity of the people in these particular areas. By using this new pump where sling <b>pump</b> concept <b>is</b> adopted, it is believe that the people in rural areas could have more access to electricity and simultaneously grow the income related activities. This new <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> capable of providing water supply to the domestic agriculture areas. Sling <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> the enhancement of the coil pump where it powered by the water flow. This <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> driven by a propeller which finally resulting the entire pump to rotate the water and turns it into stream. Water and air enter the rear side of the <b>pump</b> and <b>are</b> forced to flow through a coil of plastic tubes while the <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> rotating. Water will be channeled through a hose and into stock tank or reservoir. The <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> applicable for low head and low flow river.
