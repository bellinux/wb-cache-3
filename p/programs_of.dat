5000|$|Requirement <b>of</b> {{relation}} to <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study: OPT {{needs to be}} related to the student's <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study. Students do not need to get prior approval for their jobs from the government. However, the government may at any time request the student to furnish evidence that each of the jobs that he or she did while on OPT was related to his or her <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study. Since students can be asked to retroactively furnish evidence for jobs that they have already left while on OPT, it is recommended that students maintain documentation for each job of how the job relates to their <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study. There are two aspects of this: (i) the student cannot take up jobs unrelated to the <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study (even as additional jobs, over and above jobs related to the <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study), and (ii) the student must take jobs related to the <b>program</b> <b>of</b> study for the entire duration of OPT, excepting the 90-day unemployment period.|$|R
