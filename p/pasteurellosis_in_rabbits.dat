40|$|Pasteurella multocida toxin {{is a major}} {{virulence}} {{factor of}} Pasteurella multocida, which causes <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>in</b> men and animals and atrophic rhinitis <b>in</b> <b>rabbits</b> and pigs. The ≈ 145 kDa protein toxin stimulates various signal transduction pathways by activating heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gαq, Gαi, and Gα 12 / 13 families by using an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Pasteurella multocida toxin deamidates glutamine- 205 of Gαi 2 to glutamic acid. Therefore, the toxin inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαi and causes persistent activation of the G protein. A similar modification is also evident for Gαq, {{but not for the}} closely related Gα 11, which is not a substrate of Pasteurella multocida toxin. Our data identify the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins as the direct molecular target of Pasteurella multocida toxin and indicate that the toxin does not act like a protease, which was suggested from its thiol protease-like catalytic triad, but instead causes constitutive activation of G proteins by deamidase activity...|$|R

40|$|Pasteurella multocida is a mucosal {{pathogen}} that colonizes {{the upper}} respiratory system of rabbits. Respiratory infections can result, but the bacteria can also invade the circulatory system, producing abscesses or septicemia. P. multocida produces extracellular sialidase activity, which {{is believed to}} augment colonization of the respiratory tract {{and the production of}} lesions in an active infection. Previously, it was demonstrated that some isolates of P. multocida contain two unique sialidase genes, nanH and nanB, that encode enzymes with different substrate specificities (S. Mizan, A. D. Henk, A. Stallings, M. Meier, J. J. Maurer, and M. D. Lee, J. Bacteriol. 182 : 6874 - 6883, 2000). We developed a recombinant antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the NanH sialidase of P. multocida and demonstrated that rabbits that were experimentally colonized with P. multocida produce detectable anti-NanH immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG in serum, although they demonstrated no clinical signs of <b>pasteurellosis.</b> <b>In</b> addition, clinically ill pet rabbits infected with P. multocida possessed IgM and/or IgG antibody against NanH.

Pasteurella multocida have five types of capsular serotype i. e. type A, B, D, E and F. Diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on the clinical sign and symptom, post mortem findings. Confirmatory diagnosis is done by isolation and identification of causative agent. A variety of laboratory diagnostic techniques have been developed over the years for pasteurellosis and used routinely in the laboratory. Among these techniques molecular techniques of diagnosis is most important. This technique not only gives diagnosis but it also provides information regarding capsular type of Pasteurella multocida. Techniques which are used for molecular diagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia are PCR based diagnosis, Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), Ribotyping, Colony hybridization assay, Filled alternation gel electrophoresis (FAGE), Detection of Pasteurella multocida by Real Time PCR.

Specific pathogen free male guinea pigs were anesthetized and a tracheostomy performed to introduce 10 (5), 10 (4) or 10 (3) Pasteurella haemolytica-A 1 {{into the left}} principal bronchus. The surgical site was closed with tissue adhesive and staples and the animals were monitored for signs of respiratory tract infection. Within 24 hours after inoculation they became depressed, anorectic, pyretic and dyspneic. Fibrinous pleuropneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis and hemorrhage was present. Pericardial effusion was a frequent finding. There was infiltration of the pleura and alveoli with degenerate heterophils and macrophages, a hyperplastic mesothelium and fibrin exudation on the pleura and within alveoli. Hemorrhage, congestion, consolidation, edema and fibrin exudation were prominent in the hilar region of the lungs. Bacterial colonies were evident in all airways. More bacteria were recovered from infected lungs than were inoculated (p less than 0. 05) indicating P. haemolytica was actively multiplying in the lungs. Hematological and clinical chemistry data were consistent with fibrinous pneumonia, however, blood cultures were positive for P. haemolytica in 61 % (11 / 18) of animals sampled.
