5000|$|On Monday night, April 28, 2008, an inferno {{rose into}} the air from the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center. The fire was started by a heat lamp that was being used to keep a litter of piglets warm through the cold Maine nighttime. Presumably, the lamp tipped over and fell into the hay bedding, which sent the 100-foot-long, three-story barn up in flames that were high enough to be seen over the {{surrounding}} trees. Suddenly, the famous mansion right next door, which had for so many decades been a local treasure, {{was in danger of}} extinction. Thankfully, in a battle against the blaze that lasted until the next morning, the mansion and {{most of the rest of}} the center (the library, meeting house, and schoolhouse), with the exception of the barn and farmer’s cottage, was saved. This miracle could not have happened had it not been for intelligent preparation and management foresight. The local Livermore Fire Department, which is composed entirely of volunteers, had gone through numerous drills in case the exact event were to occur. It is usual practice for all fire departments to identify buildings and areas that could be considered “target hazards” within their communities, such as the Norlands had been considered. The preconceived strategies and knowledge of the closest water body, along with the help from 10 other departments surrounding the area, paid off. The Livermore Fire Chief, Donald Castonguay, directed his team and community members who had come to observe to get all of the treasures out of the mansion just in case. Thankfully, this precaution was not needed, as the Assistant Chief, Andrew Berry, led the men on the outside to make “trench cuts” in the roof of the barn before it joined with the mansion so that the flames would exit through the roof instead of continuing along the hall floor into the upper levels of the mansion. In addition, he placed a positive <b>pressure</b> <b>fan</b> at the doors of the mansion in order to direct the flames away from the main building. Berry was quoted as saying “The flames stopped where we wanted them to.” The ability to make quick decisions due to preparedness is what spared the rest of the Center; a vital piece of the town’s identity and culture. The rescue of the Norlands garnered much praise. Langhorne Washburn of Virginia is the only living descendant who was born at the Norlands and was quoted by the Sun Journal as saying “...Thank God Norlands didn’t burn. I would like to commend (the firefighters) on their efficiency.” [...] The men and women on the department were commended once more at a Chamber of Commerce meeting where the Maine State Fire Marshall declared “No other Fire Department could have done better.”The Norlands Living History Center is a fun and interesting place where both children and adults can learn about what life was like in the days of the Washburn family, which is why when upon seeing the 17-room mansion still standing after the fire was extinguished, Norma Boothby, a volunteer at the Center for over 25 years, burst into tears. Over the years, thousands of schoolchildren and college students have gone through the Norlands in order to get the experience of its original inhabitants, who are portrayed by volunteers like Boothby. Some of these students even came back to help out with clean up, sorting through debris and reflecting on the laughs and lessons they had experienced there. Norlands trustee President Kathleen Beauregard said on Wednesday, April 30, 2008, “We are going to rebuild the buildings that were lost.”As of June 13, 2016, rebuilding efforts have begun for the barn, with the framework established. Though there is still plenty of work to do, the town of Livermore is inspired to rebuild, remembering that fateful night where they were at risk of losing such a precious historical landmark.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{defines the}} {{normalization}} efficiency function, the efficiency similarity of different variable-speed fans, and the efficiency similarity fan station. We propose a efficiency optimization method for such fan stations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct {{measurement}} of building ventilation rate in livestock housing {{is a formidable}} task due to uncontrollable variations in fan and system performance that are caused by factors such as building static <b>pressure,</b> <b>fan</b> belt slippage, and dust accumulation on shutters and blades. Estimating building ventilation rate by an indirect method based on a CO 2 balance offers a potentially viable alternative to direct measurement. The validity of the CO 2 balance method depends on the validity of relationship between CO 2 production inside the building and metabolic rate of the animals and the knowledge of CO 2 generation by the housing environment. Metabolic rates of modern laying hens have recently been quantified in intensive large−scale laboratory measurements. However, performance of the indirect method remains to be evaluated under field conditions. This article compares building ventilation rates obtained by direct measurement and by a CO 2 balance. The test was conducted at a commercial laying hen house that used manure belts with daily manure removal. The results indicate that ventilation rates estimated by the indirect method {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 2) from those as determined by the direct measurement when the averaging or integration time interval was 2 h or longer. Careful application of the indirect method could greatly improve the affordability and versatility of endeavors toward quantifying air emissions from confined animal housing...|$|E

40|$|Acoustics plays a {{vital role}} in {{maintaining}} the health, safety, and comfort of crew members aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In order to maintain this livable and workable environment, acoustic requirements have been established to ensure that ISS hardware and payload developers account for the acoustic emissions of their equipment and develop acoustic mitigations as necessary. These requirements are verified by an acoustic emissions test of the integrated hardware. The Amine Swingbed ExPRESS (Expedite the PRocessing of ExperimentS to Space) rack payload creates a unique challenge to the developers in that the payload hardware is transported to the ISS in phases, making an acoustic emissions test on the integrated flight hardware impossible. In addition, the payload incorporates a high back <b>pressure</b> <b>fan</b> and a diaphragm vacuum pump, which are recognized as significant and complex noise sources. In order to accurately predict the acoustic emissions of the integrated payload, the individual acoustic noise sources and paths are first characterized. These characterizations are conducted though a series of acoustic emissions tests on the individual payload components. Secondly, the individual acoustic noise sources and paths are incorporated into a virtual model of the integrated hardware. The virtual model is constructed with the use of hybrid method utilizing the Finite Element Acoustic (FEA) and Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) techniques, which predict the overall acoustic emissions. Finally, the acoustic model is validated though an acoustic characterization test performed on an acoustically similar mock-up of the flight unit.

This thesis work began by mind mapping how to create savings on the compressed air system at Billerud Skärblacka AB. Certain issues have been chosen for further studies. In order to identify the consumption of compressed air at PM 8 and 9, several measurements were made. At PM 8 there were not found any pressure drop, only large pressure variations for short periods of time. The causes of these pressure variations were not established. At PM 9 a registered pressure drop of around 1 bar was found. The cause of the pressure drop at PM 9 was not found. A solution for the pressure drop was presented, which also could give an opportunity to reduce the nominal pressure in the compressed air system. An idea for improvement of the compressed air system structure has also been presented. A search for leakages on the compressed air system was carried out both at PM 8 and PM 9. Leakages at PM 8 seem to be lower than at PM 9. The search for leakages pointed out that those leakages on the compressed air system reduces {{the efficiency of the}} compressed air system.

40|$|A {{commercial}} phosphine (PH₃) generator {{manufactured by}} Beijing Liangmao Technology Development Company Limited, China {{was used in}} a fumigation trial on 5000 tonne bunker storage. The generator’s production of PH₃ {{is controlled by the}} rate of dosing conventional aluminum phosphide (AlP) tablets into 100 kg water in the reaction chamber. Because PH₃ is flammable and explosive if certain a concentration is reached in air, it is usually mixed with carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the weight ratio of 50 : 1. This trial’s objective was to minimise the amount of CO₂ and dilute the generated PH₃ with air. The PH₃ generated is purged from the reaction chamber by a continuous low flow of regulated CO₂ gas. The PH₃-rich CO₂ purge stream was fed into the suction inlet of an external venturi. A high <b>pressure</b> <b>fan</b> was used to produce the air flow through the venturi to create the vacuum to suck in and dilute the PH₃ rich stream from the generator. The PH₃ was diluted in the air-flow to ensure a non-flammable concentration of less than 1 % (10. 000 ppm) and thence fed directly into the bunker storage. The trial successfully demonstrated the viability of generating phosphine in this manner, and excellent results in PH₃ concentration and distribution was achieved in very short time periods. The capacity of the generator was limited to 8 kg of AlP tablets, equivalent to 2. 667 kg of PH₃, or sufficient to fumigate 2667 m³ of grain at a dosage rate of 1 g/m³.

EtO is lethal to bacteria, viruses, moulds, insects and their eggs. Historically EtO was used in the fumigation of bulk grain. EtO is still widely used in “cold” sterilization of medical devices and instruments. With the precondition of destroying vented EtO at the completion of fumigation, EtO could be a niche methyl bromide (CH₃Br = MeBr) alternative. EtO is toxic by inhalation with an LD₅₀ of 330 mg. kg⁻¹ EtO is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Occupational Limits: TLV-TWA (1 ppm); OEL (UK) -LTEL (5 ppm). EtO is a colourless, highly flammable gas (Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) = 3 vol% in air) which liquefies at 10. 9 oC. To reduce flammability EtO is mixed 12 vol% EtO in carbon dioxide (CO₂). Onsite mixing of EtO and Air is an option, however the EtO must be kept below 54 g. m⁻³ (3 vol%) – higher doses of EtO would require onsite mixing with CO₂ or N₂.

Five designs were tested for fan speed, differential and static nozzle pressure, static fan <b>pressure,</b> <b>fan</b> input current and voltage, wet and dry bulb temperatures, nozzle temperature, barometric pressure and the fan outlet area. These measurements were used to determine the best performing fan/heat sink design. The results of these fan performance tests showed fans that are similar in physical characteristics vary greatly in their performance. At a static pressure of 0. 2 in. wg (49. 8 Pa) the air flow rate ranged from 1. 81 to 5. 88 CFM (0. 85 to 2. 78 dM 3 /S) with the fan alone and ranged from 0. 93 to 5. 58 CFM (0. 44 to 2. 63 dM 3 /S) with the heat sink attached. These results also showed that {{all but one of the}} fan/heat sink designs had restricted air flow for the fans when the heat sink was in place. Tests with a Pentium [] processor and fan/heat sink designs revealed the effects of using different fan/heat sink designs on the top and bottom surface temperatures of the processor and the heat flux at the top surface of the processor. At a CPU speed of 200 MHz, the top and bottom surface temperatures were 120. 6 'F (49. 2 'C) and 138. 9 'F (59. 3 'C) for one of the poorest performing fan/heat sink designs and were 102. 1 'F (3 8. 9 'C) and 123. 3 'F (50. 7 'C) respectively, for the best design. Other testing with the processor determined that an increased air flow rate over the processor will enhance heat transfer. This was shown by measuring the surface temperatures and heat flux for the CPU with two different fans attached to the same heat sink at a speed of 200 MHz. The temperature difference between the two fans ranged between 1. 5 to 7. 6 'F (0. 83 to 4. 2 'C) for both surfaces. An increased air flow rate can be obtained by using a better fan and heat sink design or by changing the fan and heat sink design from a surface mounted design to an elevated design...|$|E

The objective {{of this study is to}} use design parameters, such as flight Mach number, compressor <b>pressure</b> ratio, <b>fan</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, <b>fan</b> bypass ratio, linear relation between high- and low-pressure turbines, and high-pressure turbine inlet temperature to obtain engine performance parameters, such as specific thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption. Results of this study can provide guidance in identifying the performance characteristics of various engine components, which can then be used to develop, analyze, integrate, and optimize the system performance of turbofan engines with an ITB...|$|R
