Both Kenneth and Patrick seek Arlena and finally Patrick asks Emily to join her daily row and go to Pixy Cove. There they find a body, lying with arms outstretched, face hidden by a hat and red curls <b>peeking</b> <b>out.</b> Patrick stays with the body, while Emily, who is not good at climbing heights, rows back to get the doctor, who diagnoses strangulation by powerful hands, therefore male.|$|E

500|$|Alex Browning, {{the last}} role cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who {{previously}} {{starred in the}} 1999 film Idle Hands. [...] Sawa said that when [...] " [...] read the script on a plane, [...] found [...] <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> {{the window at the}} engine every couple of minutes" [...] and [...] " [...] went down and met Glen and Jim and [...] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas". However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-2000s, whale tails became {{common to}} celebrities, {{providing}} opportunities to the paparazzi. Whale tail display spawned a new accessory [...] clip-on jewelry for the visible straps. Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian claimed that following pop {{stars in the}} hipster trousers {{gave rise to the}} [...] "low-slung jeans, whale-tail G-string era". On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from above her miniskirt." [...] Actresses Gillian Anderson, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Tara Reid, MTV's Molly Sims, model Kate Moss, singers Beyoncé Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, LeAnn Rimes and Britney Spears have been associated as propagators of the trend by ABC.|$|E
500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

2500|$|The figure stands {{outdoors}} at {{the base}} of a set of stone steps with no visible detail aside from some undergrowth and rocks. He looks off to his right, which is to say away from the other two characters in the triptych. His face has a serious expression, and he holds a long unsheathed sword in front of him with both hands. The empty black [...] sheath is tucked into his blue patterned obi sash, and <b>peeks</b> <b>out</b> from behind his back along with a second matching sheathed sword. Both tsuka sword handles would <b>peek</b> <b>out</b> from his left side, the standard position for samurai as it made them more accessible for the right-handed.|$|R

2500|$|An {{ability to}} pick out subliminally {{depicted}} labia from advertisements and elsewhere, whether actual or imagined, was exploited in a recurring magazine article in which René, dubbing himself [...] "Nature's Ambassador", would point out occurrences of [...] "the sacred image" [...] <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from, as per one entry, sculptural elements found decorating New York's Central Park.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "lady" [...] {{is shown}} {{a number of}} silks and brocades {{possibly}} suitable for her wedding dress, into which she inserts {{a small piece of}} cloth and then removes it, sticking it into her kimono. Noticed by Kōbei, she is accused of stealing, and a scuffle erupts. Rikimaru (as the lady's retainer) manages finally to mediate, {{with the help of the}} shop's neighbor and a few others. He shows a receipt from another shop for the scrap of fabric, proving it was not stolen from the Hamamatsu-ya. In the course of the fighting however, the [...] "lady" [...] suffered a blow to her head, for which Rikimaru then demands 100 ryō as recompense. As the pair prepare to leave with their illicit gains, however, a man by the name of Tamashima Ittō (Nippon Daemon in disguise) emerges from the backroom and points Kozō out, noting that the cherry blossom tattoo <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> under his sleeves reveals him as a man.|$|E
6000|$|Peek for Peep. Seldom {{heard in}} England, though common here. [...] "I <b>peeked</b> <b>out</b> through the curtain and saw him." [...] That it is {{a variant of}} peep {{is seen in the}} child's word peek-a-boo, {{equivalent}} to bo-peep. Better use the senior word.|$|R

2500|$|The scene {{opens in}} Venice with 24 farm girls declaring their passionate {{love for a}} pair of gondoliers, Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri. [...] These two gondoliers are so gallant and {{peerless}} in their manly beauty that the maidens are waiting for them to select brides before they can consider other suitors. [...] A large group of merry gondoliers enter, saying that they adore the girls, but the ladies explain that the two brothers must choose first. [...] When the Palmieri brothers enter, the ladies present them with flowers. [...] The two gondoliers amiably offer to pick their brides in a game of blind man's buff. [...] They appear to be cheating by <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from under their blindfolds, however. [...] Eventually, from the crowd of maidens, Giuseppe picks Tessa, and Marco picks Gianetta [...] "Just the very girl I wanted!" [...] (although the two then politely offer to switch girls). [...] All leave to go to church for the double wedding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creature}} {{inside the}} mechanical casing {{is soft and}} repulsive in appearance and vicious in temperament. The first-ever glimpse of a Dalek mutant, in The Daleks, was a claw <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from under a Thal cloak after it {{had been removed from}} its casing. The mutants' actual appearance has varied, but often adheres to the Doctor's description of the species in Remembrance of the Daleks as [...] "little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour". In Resurrection of the Daleks a Dalek creature, separated from its casing, attacks and severely injures a human soldier; in Remembrance of the Daleks, there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade) and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from Resurrection, the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen, a common misconception exists that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots. In the new series Daleks are retconned to be mollusc-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes, and an exposed brain.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E

5000|$|In some instances, {{the china}} was {{accompanied}} with a scarf or kerchief of silk to hide any cleavage that might <b>peek</b> <b>out</b> of the blouse.

2500|$|Hale began {{painting}} her self-portrait in 1884, {{working on}} it at her family's home in Roxbury, Massachusetts and at their summer home in Matunuck, Rhode Island. The painting, Self-Portrait, depicts Hale gazing confidently at the viewer with her right hand dangling slightly over the chair. Dressed in all black, Hale wears a dress with buttons and a fur collar, covered by a loose jacket. <b>Peeking</b> <b>out</b> of a round black hat are Hale's bangs, {{which at the time}} were praised as a youthful hairstyle but could also connote promiscuity. Hale seems to be making a fashion statement with her bangs, choice of costume, and the ostrich-feather fan that she holds. When Hale first showed the painting to her instructors in 1885, artist Bouguereau significantly criticized the size and position of the hand and encouraged Hale to make it [...] "prettier". However, Hale did not make any of the suggested changes to the hand, refusing to conform her work to the idealized, academic notions of beauty. The compositional weight of her hand is also notable because it was extremely rare for artists of any gender to portray themselves looking directly at the viewer without any tools to identify their profession.|$|E

60|$|Almost {{instantly}} {{there was}} a snort and a rustle of bushes in the thicket above me. <b>Peeking</b> <b>out</b> I saw the evergreens moving nervously; a doe's head appeared, her ears set forward, her eyes glistening. I waved the handkerchief more erratically. My rifle lay across the stump's roots, pointing straight at her; {{but she was not}} the game I was hunting. Some more waving and dancing of the bright color, some more nervous twitchings and rustlings in the evergreens, then a whistle and a rush; the doe disappeared; the movement ceased; the thicket was silent as the winter woods behind me.|$|E
