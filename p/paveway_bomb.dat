25|$|In February 2015, Saudi Typhoons {{attacked}} ISIS targets over Syria using <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bombs</b> for {{the first}} time.|$|R
50|$|Seven {{tanks were}} {{destroyed}} by RAF Tornado aircraft, two in Ajdabiya and five in Misrata, using <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bombs</b> and Brimstone missiles.|$|R
50|$|The most {{dramatic}} example was the Thanh Hoa Bridge, 70 {{miles south of}} Hanoi, a critical crossing point over the Red River. Starting in 1965, U.S. pilots had flown 871 sorties against it, losing 11 planes without managing {{to put it out}} of commission. In 1972 the “Dragon’s Jaw” bridge was attacked with <b>Paveway</b> <b>bombs,</b> and 14 jets managed to do what the previous 871 had not: drop the span, and cut a critical North Vietnamese supply artery.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 83/BLU-110 {{is used as}} the warhead for {{a variety}} of precision-guided weapons, {{including}} the GBU-16 <b>Paveway</b> laser-guided <b>bombs,</b> the GBU-32 JDAM and Quickstrike sea mines.|$|R
50|$|RAF Tornado {{aircraft}} launched <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bombs</b> against pro-Gaddafi forces. Two main {{battle tanks}} in Sirte and several small ground-attack aircraft at an airfield near Misrata were reportedly hit.|$|R

25|$|In 1969, in {{response}} to demands for a capable night interdiction aircraft for combat operations in the Vietnam theatre, a total of 16 B-57B Canberras were substantially rebuilt during a lengthy upgrade program. These aircraft received an entirely new nose section containing an AN/ANQ-139 forward-looking radar, a low-light television system, and an AN/AAS-26 forward-looking infrared detector. A laser rangefinder/designator was also installed, and the wing pylons modified to accommodate laser-guided <b>Paveway</b> <b>bombs,</b> while all the guns were removed to save weight. During the production run from 1953 to 1957, a total of 403 B-57s were built.|$|R
50|$|On 2 December 2015, the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{voted to}} expand Operation Shader into Syria with a {{majority}} of 397-223. That day, two British Tornado aircraft took off from RAF Akrotiri immediately at 22:30, each carrying three <b>Paveway</b> <b>bombs.</b> Two further aircraft were deployed at 00:30 on 3 December, and all aircraft returned by 06:30 without their bombs. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that the strikes hit the Omar oil fields in eastern Syria, and that eight more jets (two Tornados and six Typhoons) were being sent to RAF Akrotiri to join the eight already there.|$|R

50|$|A {{detachment}} of between 6 and 8 Tornado GR4 aircraft and nearly 400 personnel was once {{stationed at the}} base. The aircraft were equipped {{with a range of}} stores, including the Vicon Recce Pod, LITENING targeting pod, 1000 lb HE <b>bombs,</b> <b>Paveway</b> II and <b>Paveway</b> III laser-guided <b>bombs,</b> and the RAPTOR Recce Pod. Of the personnel detached to RAF Al Udeid, approximately 130 were direct aircraft engineers, with the remaining 270 being in the support and operation management role.|$|R
50|$|On 26 March, RAF Tornado GR4's, {{supported}} by a Voyager tanker, used <b>Paveway</b> IV laser-guided <b>bombs</b> to attack three ISIL strongholds in Tikrit.|$|R
50|$|The BGL {{targeting}} {{system are}} attached to 250, 400 and 1,000 kg free-fall general-purpose bombs. The French Air Force discontinued the purchases due to the higher cost compared to the US <b>Paveway</b> family <b>bombs</b> that were adopted as an interim solution {{while waiting for the}} French-made AASM family of guided bombs to enter service.|$|R
50|$|Royal Navy Tomahawk {{missiles}} reportedly {{fired from}} HMS Triumph, and <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bombs</b> released by RAF Tornado aircraft {{were reported to}} have struck intelligence agency buildings and a training base used by Colonel Gaddafi's Executive Protection Force. RN and RAF attacks {{were reported to have}} damaged or destroyed over 300 targets since the start of Operation Ellamy.|$|R
50|$|On 19 June 2015 the RAF {{successfully}} launched two 500 lb <b>Paveway</b> IV precision-guided <b>bombs,</b> {{making the}} test {{the first time}} non-US munitions were deployed by the aircraft.|$|R
500|$|In early 2009, several GR4s {{arrived at}} Kandahar airfield, Afghanistan {{to replace the}} Harrier GR7/9 {{aircraft}} deployed there since November 2004. In 2009, <b>Paveway</b> IV guided <b>bombs</b> were brought into service on the RAF's Tornados, having been previously used in Afghanistan by the Harrier II fleet. In Summer 2010, extra Tornados were dispatched to Kandahar {{for the duration of}} the 2010 Afghan election. British Tornados ended their operations in Afghanistan in November 2014. [...] They flew over 5,000 pairs sorties over 33,500 hours, including 600 [...] "shows of force" [...] to deter Taliban attacks. [...] During more than 70 engagements, some 140 Brimstone missiles and <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bombs</b> were deployed in total (roughly half each) and over 3,000 27mm cannon shells were fired.|$|R
50|$|Evening Standard {{reported}} that, RAF Typhoons {{carried out}} an airstrike with two <b>Paveway</b> IVs guided <b>bombs</b> targeted and destroyed an IS {{headquarters in the}} north-western outskirts of the city.|$|R
50|$|Many Mark 84s {{have been}} {{retrofitted}} with stabilizing and retarding devices to provide precision guidance capabilities. They {{serve as the}} warhead {{of a variety of}} precision-guided munitions, including the GBU-10/GBU-24/GBU-27 <b>Paveway</b> laser-guided <b>bombs,</b> GBU-15 electro-optical bomb, GBU-31 JDAM and Quickstrike sea mines. The HGK is a Turkish guidance kit used to convert 2000-lb Mark 84 bombs into GPS/INS guided smart bombs.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} night of combat operations, an F-117A dropped a 2000-pound laser-guided GBU-27 <b>Paveway</b> III <b>bomb</b> right through the roof of the general {{communications}} building in downtown Baghdad. In another attack on the communications building next to the Tigris River, another GBU-27 Paveway III was dropped through an air shaft {{in the center of the}} roof atop the building and blew out all four walls.|$|R
50|$|On 16 January 2015, A patrol of Tornado GR4's, {{operating}} near Baiji {{in support}} of Iraqi ground forces, attacked three ISIL positions with <b>Paveway</b> IV laser-guided <b>bombs.</b> A fourth position nearby was attacked shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|On April 5, RAF Tornado GR4's {{provided}} {{air support}} to Iraqi military units near Ramadi which had {{come under fire}} from ISIL. A successful attack {{was conducted on the}} building using a <b>Paveway</b> IV laser-guided <b>bomb.</b>|$|R
5|$|The GR1 {{participated in}} the Kosovo War in 1999. The Tornados {{initially}} operated from RAF Bruggen, Germany; they later moved to Solenzara Air Base, Corsica. Experience from fighting in Kosovo led to the RAF procuring AGM-65 Maverick missiles and Enhanced <b>Paveway</b> smart <b>bombs</b> for the Tornado fleet. Following the Kosovo War, the GR1 was phased out as more aircraft were upgraded to GR4 standard. The final GR1 was upgraded {{and returned to the}} RAF on 10 June 2003.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} first tested on the Atlas Cheetah, later an Aerosud-owned former South African Air Force (SAAF) Dassault Mirage F1 was used after the Cheetah retired. The {{system has been}} {{integrated}} on the SAAF's BAE Hawk Mk120 lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. Qualification on the SAAF's Saab JAS 39 Gripen was not considered due to the high costs associated with integration on a supersonic aircraft. The Gripens have been armed with GBU-12 <b>Paveway</b> II <b>bombs</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|On 24 November 2015, Turkey {{shot down}} a Russian warplane that {{allegedly}} violated Turkish airspace and crashed in northwestern Syria, {{leading to the}} Russian pilot's death. Following the crash, {{it was reported that}} Syrian Turkmen rebels from Syrian Turkmen Brigades attacked and shot down a Russian rescue helicopter, killing a Russian naval infantryman. A few days after, Russian aircraft were reported to have struck targets in the Syrian town of Ariha in Idlib province that was controlled by the Army of Conquest causing multiple casualties on the ground. On 2 December 2015, the Parliament of the United Kingdom voted to expand Operation Shader into Syria with a majority of 397-223. That day, two British Tornado aircraft took off from RAF Akrotiri immediately at 22:30, each carrying three <b>Paveway</b> <b>bombs.</b> Two further aircraft were deployed at 00:30 on 3 December, and all aircraft returned by 06:30 without their bombs. Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said that the strikes hit the Omar oil fields in eastern Syria, and that eight more jets (two Tornados and six Typhoons) were being sent to RAF Akrotiri to join the eight already there.|$|R
50|$|A laser {{designator}} is a {{laser light}} source {{which is used}} to designate a target. Laser designators provide targeting for laser-guided bombs, missiles, or precision artillery munitions, such as the <b>Paveway</b> series of <b>bombs,</b> AGM-114 Hellfire, or the M712 Copperhead round, respectively.|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2015, {{a pair of}} Tornado GR4's {{conducted}} an armed reconnaissance patrol over Baiji in support of Iraqi ground forces. Two ISIL armoured vehicles were identified in a building and were attacked with two <b>Paveway</b> IV laser-guided <b>bombs,</b> scoring two direct hits.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, an RAAF F-111 {{was chosen}} to scuttle the North Korean ship Pong Su that had been seized in 2003 {{in one of the}} largest drug hauls in Australia. The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU-10 <b>Paveway</b> II laser-guided <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A-4K: 10 {{aircraft}} for Royal New Zealand Air Force. In the 1990s, {{these were}} upgraded under Project KAHU with new radar and avionics, provision for AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-9 Sidewinder, and GBU-16 <b>Paveway</b> II laser-guided <b>bomb.</b> The RNZAF also rebuilt an A-4C and 10 A-4Gs to A-4K standard.|$|R
50|$|As part of Operation Vigilant Resolve, on 28 April 2004, Carrier Air Wing Seven squadrons VFA-136, VFA-131, VF-11, and VF-143 flew combat air sorties against {{insurgents in}} Fallujah, {{dropping}} 13 GBU-12 <b>Paveway</b> II laser-guided <b>bombs</b> on insurgent positions, while providing combat air {{support to the}} 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.|$|R
50|$|Bombe Guidée Laser (BGL) laser-guided {{bombs were}} {{developed}} by Matra (now MBDA) starting in 1978. The guidance system had to work using the same principles as the US <b>Paveway</b> guided <b>bombs.</b> The guidance kits were intended as modifications to existing free fall bombs that were in service with the French Air Force. The semi active laser homing (SALH) guidance system was developed starting from the AS-30 laser-guided missile sensor. The guidance system allowed for in-flight target illumination by the aircraft-mounted ATLIS 2 (Automatic Tracking Laser Illumination System) or with ground-based laser designator targeting pod.|$|R
25|$|Flight {{testing of}} laser-guided bombs began at Eglin AFB on 18 November 1967. The first use in combat {{will be on}} 23 May 1968, when an F-4D Phantom II of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, drops a <b>Paveway</b> Laser Guided <b>Bomb.</b> Modified F-4Ds, fitted with laser illuminators, {{designate}} target for the strike.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on {{lessons learned from}} the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bomb</b> and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|R
50|$|The first F-16IQ Block 52 fighter was {{delivered}} to Iraq on 5 June 2014, making it the 28th country to receive the F-16. The fighter {{was the first of}} six two-seat D-models. F-16IQs can be armed with AIM-9L/M Siderwinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles, AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and <b>Paveway</b> guided <b>bombs.</b> Due to advances made by Islamic State militants in mid-2014 which forced the evacuation of contractors from Balad Air Base, Iraqi F-16s were sent to Tucson, Arizona, where Iraqi pilots trained on their aircraft. 4 F-16 IQs were delivered to Balad Air Base on 13 July 2015.|$|R
5000|$|In September, the United States sent an {{additional}} 250 US troops to protect American personnel, {{while the first}} engagement of the British military against IS targets took place when a British Panavia Tornado jet dropped a <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bomb</b> on [...] "a heavy weapon position" [...] operated by ISIS in northwest Iraq {{at the end of}} the month. In addition, Australia offered 200 special forces to the Kurds and 600 Australian troops landed in the UAE. The following month, Australia authorized its special forces troops to go to Iraq as part of the anti-ISIS coalition that day, as well as authorizing airstrikes.|$|R
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, <b>Paveway</b> III laser-guided <b>bombs</b> and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} <b>Paveway</b> IV <b>bomb</b> and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|R
