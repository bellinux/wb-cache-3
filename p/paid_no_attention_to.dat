5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> race, and brought several African-American players onto the team {{at a time when}} many northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the {{problems}} she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible {{on the grounds of}} habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E

He ordered {{the execution of}} Ziying and his family, {{as well as the}} destruction of the Epang Palace by fire. It was said that Xiang Yu would leave behind a trail of destruction in the places he passed by, and the people of Guanzhong were greatly disappointed with him.|$|E

Falasca confirmed that, after interviewing the nuns who found him and documents from the Vatican Secret Archives, Luciani {{died of a heart}} attack in late evening hours of 28 September.|$|E

25|$|On 25 January 2011, {{protests against}} Mubarak and his {{government}} erupted in Cairo and around Egypt calling for Mubarak's resignation. Mubarak stated in a speech {{that he would not}} leave, and would die on Egyptian soil. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Mubarak's remarks and labeled it as a trick designed to help Mubarak to stay in power. In a state televised broadcast on 1 February 2011, Mubarak announced that he would not seek re-election in September but would like to finish his current term and promised constitutional reform. This compromise was not acceptable for the protestors and violent demonstrations occurred in front of the Presidential Palace. On 11 February, then Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak had resigned and that power would {{be turned over to the}} Egyptian military.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac warned on 31 July (just before mobilisation) {{that the}} Germans might come further west through Belgium, {{although}} he still thought Sedan their likely objective. His report of July 1914 warned {{that he had}} too few troops to advance into Belgium as planned, and cited a German wargame of 1911 which called for three German armies to march through Belgium. Lanrezac later claimed that Joffre <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his report, but the report did not in fact reach Joffre until 1 August, and Joffre later wrote {{that it would have}} been “premature” to discuss things with Lanrezac while the strategic situation was still unfolding. A fellow officer described the letter, which was to become a key source in the recrimination after the war, as being like a professor’s critique of a B- thesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1606, a {{conflict}} between Venice and the Holy See began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes, and with a law restricting the Church's right to enjoy and acquire landed property. Pope Paul V held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an interdict. The Republic <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the interdict or the act of excommunication, and ordered its priests {{to carry out their}} ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite monk Paolo Sarpi, a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria's adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.|$|E

25|$|Brittany has {{the same}} {{education}} system {{as the rest of}} France. As in other French regions, formal education before the 19th century was the preserve of the elite. Before 1460, Brittany did not have a university, and Breton students had to go to Angers, Poitiers or Caen. The University of Nantes was founded under the duke Francis II, who wanted to affirm the Breton independence from France. All the traditional disciplines were taught there: arts, theology, law and medicine. During the 17th century, it had around 1,500 students. It declined during the 18th century, mostly because Nantes was flourishing with the Atlantic slave trade and <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its cultural institutions. A mayor eventually asked the university to be relocated to Rennes, more devoted to culture and science, and the faculties progressively moved there after 1735. The transfer was interrupted by the French Revolution, and all the French universities were dissolved in 1793.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1809, Blake made a {{stand in}} the Battle of Belchite. The Spanish army formed on some hills {{in front of the}} town of Belchite. Suchet <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Blake's center while sending Musnier to attack the Spanish left and Habert to assault the right. Musnier's troops made some progress, driving back Blake's left wing. Just as Habert struck on the other flank, a lucky hit blew up the Spanish {{ammunition}} stores. At this, Blake's men panicked and fled the field. Suchet left Musnier to watch Blake's force and returned to Zaragoza to restore order in Aragon. The Spanish lost 2,000 casualties out of 11,000 infantry and 870 cavalry, plus all nine of their artillery pieces. French losses were only 200 killed and wounded. Musnier {{spent the rest of the}} year pacifying the southern part of Aragon. He scored a few successes but the guerillas learned to avoid major concentrations of French troops.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci {{packed his}} {{equipment}} {{and had a}} full meal. At dawn, he brought his bow and a quiver of arrows with him, and rode out of the fortress. He was accompanied by two riders, each carrying a target stand for archery practice. When the rebels saw Taishi Ci {{coming out of the}} fortress, they immediately readied themselves for battle. To their surprise, Taishi Ci took the two stands, placed them in the ditch around the fortress, fired some arrows at them, and then returned to the fortress. The following day, he repeated the entire process. Some of the rebels stood up and prepared for battle upon seeing him, while others ignored him and remained relaxed. On the third day, when Taishi Ci came out again, the rebels thought {{that he was going to}} practise archery again, so they <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> him. Taishi Ci then seized the opportunity to break out of the siege. By the time the rebels realised what was going on, Taishi Ci had already escaped and killed several rebels along the way. None of them dared to pursue him.|$|E

500|$|F/L Currie and F/O Rose saw a V-2 rocket {{in flight}} {{on the night}} of 10/11 September, the first Canadian pilots to do so. While on patrol from Brussels to Antwerp and Rotterdam they saw a bright orange light {{directly}} ahead and seemingly at their own altitude, [...] At first glance, Currie <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it, taking it for a bright star. Suddenly, Currie said: [...] "It began to climb – hell it climbed!" [...] The light appeared to go straight up so rapidly that within a few seconds it had passed out of sight. On return to base, the crew reported the sighting as a V-1 flying bomb, but their account of the spectacular rate of climb and other details aroused great interest amongst senior officers. That night, a few moments after Currie and Rose had made their sighting, a V-2 rocket crashed onto the English coast. Two nights later, F/Os Fullerton and Gallagher saw a similar ball of yellow flame streak vertically into the night sky, and {{in the weeks that followed}} there were many other reports.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Marks re-examined the {{reparation}} clauses of {{the treaty}} and wrote that [...] "the much-criticized 'war guilt clause', Article 231, {{which was designed to}} lay a legal basis for reparations, in fact makes no mention of war guilt" [...] but only specified that Germany was to pay for the damages caused by the war they imposed upon the allies and [...] "that Germany committed an act of aggression against Belgium is beyond dispute". [...] "Technically, Britain entered" [...] the war and French troops entered Belgium [...] "to honor" [...] the [...] "legal obligation" [...] to defend Belgium under the 1839 Treaty of London and that [...] "Germany openly acknowledged her responsibility in regard to Belgium on August 4, 1914 and May 7, 1919." [...] Marks also wrote that [...] "the same clause, mutatis mutandis" [...] was incorporated [...] "in the treaties with Austria and Hungary, neither of whom interpreted it as declaration of war guilt." [...] Wolfgang Mommsen wrote that [...] "Austria and Hungary, understandably <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> this aspect of the draft treaty".|$|E
500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} {{there is every reason}} to take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery took place during the Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been over-estimated and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - <b>paid</b> <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E
