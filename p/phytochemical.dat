40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that nutritional behaviors constitute decisive components of human health. <b>Phytochemicals</b> (small, nonenergetic molecules of vegetal origin) are overall inhibitory on {{the expression of}} gene products promoting proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.

They are effective modulators that act synergistically on membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear enzymatic reactions to dampen cellular hyperproliferation and hyperactivity, reequilibrate metabolic activity and promote apoptosis of genetically unstable cells. Despite important gaps in our knowledge regarding how <b>phytochemicals</b> interfere with cellular function in vivo, effective chemopreventive measures have shown that <b>phytochemicals</b> can be utilized to prevent cancer, and possibly to treat cancer patients as well.

2500|$|In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge {{isolated}} relatively pure caffeine for {{the first}} time; he called it [...] "Kaffebase" [...] (i.e. a base that exists in coffee).

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>phytochemicals</b> are {{consumed}} for their perceived health benefits. Many of these <b>phytochemicals</b> {{have been found to}} alter numerous cell functions, but the mechanisms underlying their biological activity tend to be poorly understood. Phenolic <b>phytochemicals</b> are particularly promiscuous modifiers of membrane protein function, suggesting that some of their actions may be due to a common, membrane bilayer-mediated mechanism. To test whether bilayer perturbation may underlie this diversity of actions, we examined five bioactive phenols reported to have medicinal value: capsaicin from chili peppers, curcumin from turmeric, EGCG from green tea, genistein from soybeans, and resveratrol from grapes. We find that each of these widely consumed <b>phytochemicals</b> alters lipid bilayer properties and the function of diverse membrane proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these <b>phytochemicals</b> modify bilayer properties by localizing to the bilayer/solution interface. Bilayer-modifying propensity was verified using a gramicidin-based assay, and indiscriminate modulation of membrane protein function was demonstrated using four proteins: membrane-anchored metalloproteases, mechanosensitive ion channels, and voltage-dependent potassium and sodium channels. Each protein exhibited similar responses to multiple <b>phytochemicals,</b> consistent with a common, bilayer-mediated mechanism.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that high {{consumption}} of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of cancer. <b>Phytochemicals,</b> mainly phenolics and flavonoids, have been suggested to be responsible for these health benefits. However, the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of fruits and vegetables are not fully understood. Fourteen grape varieties were analyzed for the profiles of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and trans-resveratrol. <b>Phytochemicals</b> in those grapes have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. In addition, thirteen grape varieties and fourteen common <b>phytochemicals</b> were evaluated for their ability to induce mammalian phase II detoxification enzyme ? quinone reductase. Grape <b>phytochemicals</b> had strong activity in quinone reductase induction and potent antiproliferative activities toward Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells. These results support the hypothesis that <b>phytochemicals</b> prevent cancer by acting as free radical scavengers and/or inducers of phase II detoxifying enzymes in the initiation stage, and/or as cell proliferation suppressors in the promotion/progression stages. Combinations of selected fruits and <b>phytochemicals</b> were studied for their antioxidant activity, antiproliferative activity, and induction of quinone reductase. The combination of apple extracts and quercetin 3 -b-D-glucoside (Q 3 G) exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity when compared to the apple extracts and Q 3 G alone. The combination of grape extracts and quercetin, genistein, and resveratrol showed higher induction activity of quinone reductase than grape extracts and <b>phytochemicals</b> alone. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the additive and synergistic effects of <b>phytochemicals</b> in fruits are responsible for their potent antioxidant activity, antiproliferative activity, and phase II detoxifying enzyme induction activity, and that the health benefit of a diet rich in fruits is attributed to the complex mixture of <b>phytochemicals</b> and their interactions present in those foods...|$|R
