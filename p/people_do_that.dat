500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, Palin {{posted to}} her Facebook page to seek {{contributions}} to SarahPAC to help defeat 20 House Democrats in the 2010 Congressional election. [...] Her post featured a graphic that used gunsight crosshairs {{to mark the}} Democrats' districts. [...] She also tweeted to her supporters, [...] "'Don't Retreat, Instead – RELOAD!' Pls see my Facebook page." [...] Palin critics said she was inciting violence. [...] One of the targeted Democrats, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, objected to the graphic, saying, [...] "we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> they've got {{to realize that there}} are consequences to that action."

I'd love to do more and more Gspel projects". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, [...] "I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know?
