5|$|The initial VC attack {{had split}} allied {{formations}} within the garrison; the 1st and 2nd Platoons of the 11th MSF Company were <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eastern perimeter, while the Marines were either alone or had organized themselves into {{small groups of}} two or three, but none were in contact with each another. Meanwhile, from inside his command post, White called in air-support which later {{came in the form}} of an AC-47 Spooky gunship, a modified version of the C-47 Skytrain equipped with 7.62mm General Electric miniguns for the support of ground troops. On the eastern side of the garrison, VC soldiers of the 40th Battalion continued to charge up the hill firing their AK-47 assault rifles. Simultaneously, other elements of the VC 1st Regiment probed the southern and western end of the garrison, now held by Captain White's 1st and 3rd Platoons, to test the strength of allied defenses in that part of the garrison. By that stage, however, most Nung soldiers had retreated from their positions on the eastern end of the garrison, while the U.S. Marines were pinned down around the perimeters. By 03:30, the VC had captured the Marines' gun position. Captain White was able to maintain contact with Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas through telephone, but they could not coordinate their forces.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{causes of}} the Gaelic revival were {{political}} and personal grievances against the Hiberno-Normans, but especially impatience with procrastination and the very real horrors that successive famines had brought. <b>Pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fertile areas, the Irish were forced to eke out a subsistence living on marginal lands, which left them with no safety net during bad harvest years (such as 1271 and 1277) or in a year of famine (virtually the entire period of 1311–1319).|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} bowling footwork styles {{use either}} a four- or five-step approach beginning 8 to 16 feet (2.4 to 4.8 meters) behind the foul line. In the typical four-step approach, {{the ball is}} <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> body in step one; step two has the ball {{at the bottom of}} the backswing; in step three, the ball is at the top of the backswing; finally, the ball is swung forward and delivered in conjunction with the fourth and final slide-step. In a five-step approach, the bowler takes an initial timing step before pushing the ball away from the body.|$|E

25|$|On July 12, Al-Wushka, {{a little}} town 35 {{kilometers}} east of Abu Grain, {{was taken over by}} the Libyan branch of ISIL, without any resistance from the militant forces that control western Libya. It is known that the Islamic State has been gaining a lot of ground west of their stronghold Sirte after militia fighters from Misrata were <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city. That same day in Morocco, the Libyan factions signed the draft peace deal, but without the participation of the team from the General National Congress who boycotted the meetings because of objections to parts of the text.|$|E
25|$|In June 1862, {{during the}} Seven Days Battles, the Army of the Potomac was rapidly <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Confederate capitol of Richmond. On {{the third day}} of fighting, the 22nd Massachusetts was heavily engaged in the Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27, 1862. The {{regiment}} had been held in reserve, behind the other regiments of its brigade. After repelling many Confederate charges, the units in front of the 22nd finally retreated in the late afternoon. As the other regiments retired, the 22nd was quickly surrounded by advancing Confederates. Gove, at first, ordered the 22nd to about face and to march towards the rear. But, reluctant to give up the ground, he then ordered the regiment to halt, about face again, and prepare to receive the Confederate attack. Almost instantly after halting the regiment, Gove was shot and killed. The 22nd suffered their most severe casualties of the war (numerically) during the Battle of Gaines' Mill. Gove's body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Despite Advani's arrest, the kar sevaks or activists {{accompanying}} the yatra continued on towards Ayodhya. Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, ordered {{the arrest of}} all activists bound to Ayodhya, and 150,000 individuals were jailed. However, {{a large number of}} activists succeeded in reaching Ayodhya. Guha estimates this number at 75,000, while Christophe Jaffrelot states that it was 40,000. The town also held 20,000 security personnel, brought there by the state government. On 30 October a large number of activists pushed past the cordon of security officers, and moved towards the Babri Masjid. Although they were intercepted by more security forces, they succeeded in avoiding these, and reached the mosque. There, one volunteer placed a saffron flag on top of the mosque, while other activists attempted to tear the building down using tools like axes and hammers. The security personnel responded by initially using tear gas to expel the kar sevaks, and later using actual ammunition. The kar sevaks were <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mosque, but a pitched battle with security followed, which lasted three days, and led to the death of 20 VHP volunteers.|$|E

25|$|The Fort des Ayvelles, {{also known}} as the Fort Dubois-Crancé, is a {{fortification}} near the French communes of Villers-Semeuse and Les Ayvelles in the Ardennes, just to the south of Charleville-Mézières. As part of the Séré de Rivières system of fortifications, the fort was planned as part of a new ring of forts replacing the older citadel of Mézières with dispersed fortifications. With advances in the range and destructive power of artillery, the city's defensive perimeter had to be <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city center to the limits of artillery range. The Fort des Ayvelles was the only such fortification to be completed of the ensemble, as resources were diverted elsewhere. At the time of its construction the fort controlled the Meuse and the railway line linking Reims, Montmédy, Givet and Hirson. The Fort des Ayvelles was reduced in status in 1899, its masonry construction rendered obsolete by the advent of high-explosive artillery shells. However, it was re-manned for the First World War before it was captured by the Germans on 29 August 1914. The fort was partly destroyed in 1918. During the Battle of France in 1940 the fort was bombarded. French resisters were executed at Ayvelles during both world wars. At present the fort is maintained by a preservation society, and may be visited.|$|E

They suddenly surprised a group of about 20Melanesian soldiers led by three German reservists, who were apparently laying an ambush on the road for the advancing Australians. They opened fire, wounding one German in the hand and capturing him, and scattering the Melanesians. By means of a ruse Wuchert and Mayer were also captured, depriving the defenders of two important commanders, while several significant maps also fell into Australian hands at this time.|$|E
50|$|The wallflip is {{an easier}} and simple trick because it {{consists}} of only a three quarter rotation instead of a full rotation. The extra quarter is subtracted because <b>the</b> trick starts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vertical surface used. To perform this trick correctly one must <b>push</b> both <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wall and upwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wall. <b>The</b> force <b>pushing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wall is so that the user does not {{come into contact with}} the surface during the trick, such as hitting their head on the surface while they are rotating. The upwards force gives the trick height and will also force rotation to ensure a proper landing.|$|R

500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via double exposure. Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{founding}} members of Zao, were vocalist Eric Reeder, guitarist Roy Goudy, bassist Mic Cox, and drummer Jesse Smith. The band's {{name comes from}} the Greek word (ζάω), which means [...] "alive" [...] or [...] "to have life". Zao vocalist Eric Reeder has been credited with {{coming up with the}} band's name. Calling their sound [...] "Christ-centered hardcore", they sought to reach an audience that they felt has been <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> organized church. Most of their early songs, which appeared on their first two full-length albums, All Else Failed and The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation (which saw the band re-recording much of the All Else Failed material), contained explicit references to God and centered on the theme of the peace of God. Reeder (who appeared on Zao's Author and Sustained demos, as well as a split with Outcast) left before Zao recorded All Else Failed and was replaced by Shawn Jonas, who went on to form Symphony in Peril. Jonas left the band after recording two albums and is now a youth pastor at New Life Church in West Virginia; original bassist Mic Cox left the band, and Kevin Moran took his place. Ron Gray also joined the band as a second guitarist after the recording of The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation. All of the band members, except for drummer Jesse Smith, quit Zao following the 1997 Cornerstone festival and a couple of shows they played on the way back home.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had <b>pushed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
