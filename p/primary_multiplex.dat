50|$|NICAM was {{originally}} intended to provide broadcasters with six high-quality audio channels within a total bandwidth of 2048 kbit/s. This figure was chosen to match the E1 <b>primary</b> <b>multiplex</b> rate, and systems using this rate could {{make use of the}} planned PDH national and international telecommunications networks.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, {{the relay}} was {{equipped}} to provide the four <b>primary</b> DTT <b>multiplexes</b> (Multiplex 1, 2, A and B) and after a three-month period, all local residents were given Freeview boxes. Three of the four analogue services were switched off at midnight on 30 March 2005.|$|R
40|$|By {{applying}} {{optical multiplexing}} techniques, the bandwidth of fiber optics can be utilized more efficiently. There are three <b>primary</b> optical <b>multiplexing</b> techniques. The most basic technique, space-division multiplexing (SDM), is a brute-force approach that simply uses separate optical fibers for each channel. Of course, this approach starts to become unwieldy {{as the number}} of channels and connections increases in a fully connected network...|$|R
50|$|Encore {{broadcasts}} its <b>primary</b> and <b>multiplex</b> channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel {{are usually}} packaged together (though most cable providers only offer {{the east and}} west coast feeds of the main Encore channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
50|$|MoviePlex {{broadcasts}} its <b>primary</b> and <b>multiplex</b> channels on an Eastern Time Zone schedule. Because MoviePlex {{operates a}} singular broadcast feed that covers every U.S. time zone, {{the difference in}} local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two locations will be at most six hours. The premium film service Starz and Encore, which are both also owned by Starz Inc., operate as separate services - although subscribers to MoviePlex do not necessarily have to subscribe to {{either of the two}} sister services.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Starz {{provides}} up to twelve multiplex channels – six 24-hour multiplex channels, {{all of which are}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Starz On Demand). Starz broadcasts its <b>primary</b> and <b>multiplex</b> channels on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
50|$|Sister service Movie Central {{operated}} as {{a separate}} service under a separate licence - and subscribers {{to one of the}} two services did not necessarily have to subscribe to the other. However, Encore Avenue was very frequently sold together in a package with Movie Central. Encore Avenue broadcast its <b>primary</b> and <b>multiplex</b> channels on an Pacific Time Zone schedule. Because Encore Avenue operated a singular feed and its license was restricted to broadcast solely in a geographical area covered by the Pacific, Mountain and Central time zones, this resulted in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years {{there has been}} {{extensive}} research on the application of spread spectrum multiplexing techniques for communications via optical fiber. Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) is the technique that has exhibited the most promise as a <b>primary</b> <b>multiplexing</b> vehicle for the transition into all-optical processing of data, and as a supplement to other techniques such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM). OCDMA can be classified into incoherent OCDMA, where coding and detection is done on the basis of optical power, and coherent OCDMA where coding is done on a field amplitude basis. The commercialization of these technologies has been a slow process as interferometic noise (know as beat noise), multiuser access interference (MAI) and optical component cost are the major hurdles. ^ This thesis concentrates on the application of incoherent OCDMA on a Fiber to the Home (FTTH) type access network where users receive information from a central terminal that is OCDMA encoded electronically. Only the user with the proper optical decoding stage will be able to discriminate and reconstruct the original information. The decoding is done via passive optical delay lines performing a convolution between the electrical orthogonal optical code (OOC) and the impulse response of the optical delay lines. The result is an autocorrelation peak or a crosscorrelation that provides no outstanding optical intensity peak. ^ This document analyzes the proper autocorrelation and crosscorrelation waveforms for 2 users on this “hybrid” OCDMA coding scheme and defines threshold, beat noise mitigation and information reconstruction techniques for further expansion of the network. ...|$|R

40|$|Silver–Russell {{syndrome}} (SRS) and Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome {{are described}} in isolation. However, their co-occurrence has only been rarely reported. Here, we present a case report of an adolescent with SRS who was diagnosed with MRKH during the evaluation of <b>primary</b> amenorrhoea. <b>Multiplex</b> ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis showed a normal methylation pattern and normal dosage at 11 p 15. 5. A PubMed search for all peer-reviewed publications (original articles and reviews) using the key words Silver–Russell syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, genetics, hypomethylation and reproductive anomalies identified three cases of SRS with MRKH, two of which were associated with significant hypomethylation of the H 19 imprinting control region of the 11 p 15. 5 locus. This report highlights the association between SRS and MRKH. The absence of hypomethylation and normal dosage at 11 p 15. 5 suggests these two rare entities share alternative aetiopathogenic mechanism...|$|R

2500|$|HBO {{distributed}} its {{programming for}} only nine hours each day, from 3:00p.m. to 12:00a.m. Eastern Time, {{during its first}} nine years of operation. The network first adopted a 24-hour schedule on weekends in September 1981, running from 3:00p.m. on Friday afternoons until 12:00a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday nights/early Monday mornings; [...] this round-the-clock schedule was expanded to weekdays three months later on December 28, 1981 (however, HBO {{was not the first}} pay television network to maintain an uninterrupted programming schedule as Showtime and The Movie Channel had both switched to 24-hour daily schedules months earlier). By this time, the full [...] "Home Box Office" [...] name was de-emphasized by the network, in favor of branding solely by the [...] "HBO" [...] initialism (although the full name is still used as the legal corporate name of its parent division under Time Warner, and in on-air use within copyright tags featured during the closing credits of the channel's original programs and a legal disclaimer slide seen daily on its <b>primary</b> and <b>multiplex</b> channels).|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, video coding {{designers}} have proposed robust coding approaches that combine Multiple Description Coding (MDC) schemes with Distributed Video Coding (DVC) principles. In this way, {{it is possible}} to obtain a better error resilience since the distortion drifting through the sequence is significantly mitigated by the DVC coding unit. The paper presents a Multiple Description Distributed Video Coder (MDDVC) that codes the input video signal generating a set of "lossy" syndromes for each pixel block and creates different descriptions <b>multiplexing</b> <b>primary</b> and redundant video packets. Experimental results show that at high loss probabilities the proposed solution improves the results of the original MDC approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The low {{luminance}} {{levels of}} light-emitting diodes (LEDs) compared to arc lamps {{make it difficult}} to design high-brightness LED-based projectors. Besides, the specificities of LEDs do not always allow using the same design schemes as with arc lamp-based projection displays. This paper performs a taxonomy of the techniques {{that can be used to}} increase the brightness of LED-based projection displays. We show that, in étendue-limited systems, the perceived brightness depends on the system étendue limit, the efficiency of the light engine, and the source luminance. The ability to improve each of these parameters depends on the design constraints. The system étendue limit can be increased at the expense of bulkier, more complex, and more expensive designs. The light engine efficiency can be increased by using free-form shape components adapted to the shapes and the emission patterns of the considered LEDs. The apparent source luminance can be increased at the expense of the flux by either recycling light or restricting the light collection to a smaller étendue with higher average luminance. Luminance can also be increased by using multiple color <b>primaries</b> (spatial <b>multiplexing)</b> or pulsed LEDs (temporal multiplexing). Finally, we review how light recycling can be implemented to convert polarization without increasing étendue.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{pathogenicity}} {{is mainly}} {{due to the}} production of a number of secreted and cell surface-associated proteins under the regulation of the agr gene. A region of the agr gene was used to subgroup S. aureus strains according to restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Additionally, strains were subtyped according to the coagulase gene in order to strengthen discriminatory power. Virulence capabilities of agr genotype subgroups were evaluated using an in vitro neutrophil bactericidal assay, which showed that prevalent genotypes were significantly better at evading this <b>primary</b> host defense. <b>Multiplex</b> PCR was then used to detect enterotoxin genes among the genotype subgroups in order to determine possible virulence candidates that enable strains to combat neutrophil killing. The prevalent genotype strains were found to possess higher production capabilities for enterotoxin A than did low-prevalence strains. The significance of enterotoxin A production capabilities in affecting pathogenicity of S. aureus strains was evaluated and found to {{have a profound effect on}} neutrophil killing abilities. The use of a large epidemiological database as a tool for subgrouping strains with varying degrees of pathogenicity has allowed the identification of relevant and previously undefined virulence factors that affect a pathogen's capability to overcome host immune defenses...|$|R
40|$|The <b>primary</b> {{barriers}} to <b>multiplexed</b> {{point of care}} immunoassays are: (1) cost; (2) response time; and (3) sample handling. Described here is a self-contained, multiplexed immunoassay platform for point of care detection that leverages a number of enabling technologies to address these barriers. This platform {{is referred to as}} the "D 4 " assay, as it is composed of the following four sequential, concerted events (Figure 1) : (1) Dispense (droplet of blood); (2) Dissolve (printed reagents on chip); (3) Diffuse across surface; (4) Detect binding event. The D 4 assay process begins when a finger-stick is administered and the resulting droplet of blood is applied to the surface of a detector chip. Hydrophobic ink printed onto the surface of the chip confines the blood droplet to a non-fouling region containing soluble, labile spots of detection antibodies and insoluble, non-labile spots of capture antibodies. As the soluble detection antibodies are dissolved from their printed spots by the droplet of blood, three serial events occur to generate signal (Figure 2) : (1) the first half of the detection complex is formed by the binding of analytes present in blood to the stable capture agent spots; (2) diffusion of the blood laterally through the polymer brush, resulting in the dissolution and diffusion of soluble detection antibody spots; (3) solubilized detection antibodies bind to their respective analyte-capture agent spots, completing the detection complex and resulting in signal generation at the position of the non-labile capture antibody spots. This assay relies upon the ability of labeled detection antibodies, printed into a nonfouling brush as "labile spots", to be carried by blood flow to adjacent rows of stably immobilized capture antibodies by diffusion of the analyte solution (Figure 2). Generation of signal at a given capture spot location provides identification of individual analytes (positives). Quantification of the concentration of the different analytes is carried out identically to a conventional fluorescence immunoassay by pre-calibration of the system using a dilution series of the analyte spiked into whole blood. The D 4 assay addresses several critical needs in point of care testing as follows: First, the cost of testing is reduced through miniaturization, multiplexing and one-step, on-site processing of undiluted whole blood obtained from a finger stick. Second, in order to simplify the immunoassay process, the D 4 relies on diffusion to bring spatially localized reagents together to create a functional assay and thereby eliminate the need for liquid transfer steps, microfluidic manipulation of sample or reagents, and wash steps. Third, this multiplexed platform is capable of screening for a panel of markers in a single drop of blood with no sample preprocessing. Fourth, the assay is fast, which alleviates the difficulties often associated with communicating the outcome of diagnostic tests. A prototype of the D 4 assay is shown in Figure 3 below.
