5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} <b>particularly.</b> <b>Because</b> most of the ACLU's efforts {{were associated with the}} labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Nasser {{returned}} to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent {{as a member of}} the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Antoine posted an {{advertisement}} in the Spiritist journal The Messenger (Le Messager), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt {{did not meet}} with success. At the same time, he was deeply influenced by Léon Denis' book In the Invisible. He began {{to give up his}} remedies, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> of his then recent trial, and gradually left Spiritism, as he was sometimes deceived by false mediums. In 1902, his group The Vine Growers of the Lord, although solicited, did not participate {{in the creation of a}} Spiritist Federation, then in 1905, the members did not attend the preparatory meeting of the Congress in Liège and refused the 0.25 franc contribution. In 1905, he consultated up to 400 patients per day. Around the same time, he published a four-page leaflet which commented passages of the Gospels without reference to Spiritism.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>because,</b> after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc.|$|E

5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> of the diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial {{displacement of the}} abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|To {{help with}} the {{stresses}} of her various issues – understanding her new relationship with Grayson, dealing with Travis leaving for college, and trying to fit Bobby into her life – Jules (Courteney Cox) has started {{to see a new}} therapist, Glenn (Jennifer Aniston). Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> Glenn seems to have a mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, <b>particularly</b> <b>because</b> many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E
