50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> {{may receive}} their funding from an {{obligatory}} television licence fee, individual contributions, government funding or commercial sources. <b>Public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> do {{not rely on}} advertising {{to the same degree}} as commercial broadcasters, or at all; this allows <b>public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> to transmit programmes that are not commercially viable to the mass market, such as public affairs shows, radio and television documentaries, and educational programmes.|$|R
50|$|The {{board of}} <b>public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> sued the German states for {{interference}} with their budgeting process, and on 11 September 2007 the Supreme Court decided in their favour.

50|$|Faced {{with the}} problem of licence fee evasion, some {{countries}} choose to fund <b>public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> directly from taxation or via other less avoidable methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing. National <b>public</b> <b>broadcasters</b> in some countries also carry supplemental advertising.|$|R

Newspapers critical of the government, such as the Daily News, closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their license. BBC News, Sky News, and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe. In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted. Sky News continue to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden {{from the}} 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole {{administrative}} language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as Finnish.
