50|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} or <b>Pygas</b> is a naphtha-range {{product with}} a high aromatics content.

Currently, <b>PyGas</b> is generally used as a gasoline blending mixture due to its high octane number. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or distilled (in BTX process) to separate it into its components, including benzene.|$|E

40|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} (<b>PyGas)</b> is {{a by-product}} of high temperature naphtha cracking during ethylene and propylene production. It is a high octane number mixture which contains aromatics, olefins and paraffins ranging from C 5 s to C 12 s. <b>PyGas</b> has high potential {{for use as a}} gasoline blending mixture and/or as a source of aromatics. Currently, <b>PyGas</b> is generally used as a gasoline blending mixture due to its high octane number, but global production of <b>PyGas</b> is very high and further increases are anticipated in the future due to higher demands for ethylene and propylene. However, current strict fuel regulations for aromatic content make <b>PyGas</b> utilisation as a blending mixture more difficult, therefore a useful avenue for <b>PyGas</b> consumption is desired. Catalytic hydrogenation of <b>PyGas</b> is an important industrial and academic research area for the stabilisation, upgrading and utilisation of <b>PyGas.</b> Limited work has been performed on the hydrogenation of <b>PyGas</b> and an incomplete picture of the process has been obtained. The composition of <b>PyGas</b> is very complex and therefore most of the studies have been carried out with single compounds or a mixture of a few model compounds for simplicity and generality. However, the single model compound cannot be representive of the entire <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation process. Furthermore, the behaviour of these compounds is generally different in mixtures than as individual compounds. Hence, the hydrogenation of a <b>PyGas,</b> which contained styrene, toluene, 1 -octene, cyclopentene, heptane, decane and 1, 3 -pentadiene/ 1 -pentene, was investigated over alumina supported nickel and palladium catalysts. This is a comprehensive model for the broader groups of hydrocarbons present in <b>PyGas.</b> The aim of the work was to investigate the effect of reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, total reaction pressure, hydrogen partial pressure and WHSV of <b>PyGas</b> on the hydrogenation of <b>PyGas.</b> Different strategies were proposed for <b>PyGas</b> consumption to obtain; (i) a high octane number gasoline blend, (ii) an aromatic source mixture and (iii) hydrogenation of surplus aromatics present in <b>PyGas.</b> These desired products were achieved during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation over both the nickel and palladium catalysts by using different reaction conditions. However, the palladium catalyst was found to be preferable for the selective hydrogenation of reactive species such as styrene, diolefins and for the isomerisation of olefins, without the hydrogenation of aromatics during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation at mild reaction temperatures. However, surplus aromatics hydrogenation can be achieved over the palladium catalyst with an increase in reaction temperature. Conversely, a greater amount of aromatics saturation was observed during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation over the nickel catalyst. Therefore the nickel catalyst was found to be preferable when aromatic ring saturation is desired during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation. The selective hydrogenation of <b>PyGas</b> without aromatics saturation was achieved over a nickel catalyst when using a low hydrogen partial pressure. The kinetics of <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation were also investigated for {{a better understanding of the}} process. The apparent orders for hydrogenation /isomerisation of the <b>PyGas</b> components were investigated by using an empirical rate equation. During <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation, first order (1. 1 to 1. 6) kinetics were observed for the hydrogenation of olefins to their respective paraffins over both the nickel and palladium catalysts with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure, which became zero or negative order kinetics when sufficient amounts of hydrogen were available on the surface of the catalyst. Negative order kinetics were observed for olefin isomerisation to internal olefin with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure. Meanwhile the hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene followed zero order kinetics with respect to hydrogen over both catalysts due to the strong adsorption of styrene onto the catalyst. Third order kinetics were observed for aromatics hydrogenation over both catalysts. On the other hand, the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins followed zero to negative order (0 to - 0. 7) kinetics, whilst positive order (1. 6 to 3. 6) kinetics were observed for isomerisation of olefins to internal olefins with respect to <b>PyGas.</b> Moreover, positive order (0. 7 to 1. 0) kinetics were observed for styrene hydrogenation to ethylbenzene with respect to <b>PyGas.</b> The hydrogenation of aromatics followed negative orders kinetics with respect to <b>PyGas</b> over both catalysts due to competitive hydrogenation of the olefinic and aromatic components. Coke deposition is believed to be the main reason for catalyst deactivation during the <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation reaction. The amount and nature of the coke deposited was investigated by in-situ temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). The increase in reaction temperature not only increased the amount of coke deposition but also produced more condensed hydrogen deficient type coke. Conversely, the carbon laydown decreased with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure. Larger amounts of coke deposition took place over the nickel catalyst when compared to the coke deposited over the palladium catalyst under identical reaction conditions. Moreover, a soft type coke (with lower C/H ratio) was deposited over the palladium catalyst, while a comparatively hard type coke (with higher C/H ratio) was deposited over the nickel catalyst. Both the nickel and palladium catalysts used during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation were effectively regenerated by in-situ TPO with no significant loss to their catalytic properties.

40|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} - <b>PYGAS</b> - is {{an intermediate}} boiling product of naphtha steam cracking {{with a high}} octane number and high aromatic/unsaturated contents. Due to stabilization concerns, <b>PYGAS</b> must be hydrotreated in two stages. The first stage uses a mild trickle-bed conversion for removing extremely reactive species (styrene, dienes and olefins) prior to the more severe second stage where sulfured and remaining olefins are hydrogenated in gas phase. This work addresses the reaction network and two-phase kinetic model for {{the first stage of}} <b>PYGAS</b> upgrading. Nonlinear estimation was used for model tuning with kinetic data obtained in bench-scale trickle-bed hydrogenation with a commercial Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. On-line sampling experiments were designed to study the influence of variables - temperature and spatial velocity - on the conversion of styrene, dienes and olefins...|$|E
30|$|<b>PyGas</b> wash was {{performed}} by injecting the <b>PyGas</b> {{from the bottom of}} the QWT in the feed of the caustic scrubber, sample A was sampled from the red-oil settler after a month of such treatment. The TX-cut wash {{was performed}} by injecting TX-cut directly at the feed of the caustic scrubber, samples B, C, D were sampled from the red-oil settler after 2, 15 and 30  days of TX-cut wash. All samples were compared to each other visually and using UPLC-QTOF as described below.|$|E
30|$|As {{illustrated}} by the contour plots from UPLC-QTOF, this study successfully showed {{that the nature of}} the aromatic wash (<b>PyGas</b> vs TX-cut) applied to the caustic tower greatly influences the red-oil structures and their concentration. Reactive monomers such as styrene, CPD or indene present in <b>PyGas</b> can easily react with the polyaldols to form aromatic/conjugated oxygenate. Additionally, this study proved that the <b>PyGas</b> wash altered the red-oils structure which led to species having stronger emulsification properties than the red-oils coming from TX-cut wash, most probably because of the generation of these new oxygenated species mentioned above. It is therefore recommended to perform caustic tower washes with an aromatic solvent which contains little to no reactive compounds (such as TX-cut). Alternatively, it is recommended to reroute the red-oil stream downstream the QWT to avoid emulsification issues. Finally, it was shown that the in-house UPLC-QTOF method that has been developed is perfectly adapted to analyze complex samples with hydrocarbons compounds containing multiple oxygens such as red-oils species.|$|E
30|$|These small aromatic/conjugated oxygenates are {{not present}} in the samples issued from the {{treatment}} with TX-cut {{as can be seen}} with the absence of this large dark red zone in samples B, C and D. Because of the low operating temperature of the caustic scrubber (i.e., 40  °C) and the low molecular weight of the species identified in sample A, it is speculated that <b>PyGas</b> enhances the amount of red-oil oligomers, most probably from monomeric species from the <b>PyGas</b> (e.g., indene) which can react through a Diels–Alder mechanism with the aldol oligomers to form these aromatic/conjugated oxygenates; red-oil oligomers being highly reactive dienophile due to the presence of oxygen next to the double bond.|$|E
40|$|Silica-alumina {{supported}} nickel catalysts (Ni/ASA) {{have been}} modified by {{the incorporation of}} electrodonor (Li) or electro acceptor (Pd) elements {{with the objective of}} determining the factors controlling the catalyst thioresistance in benzene hydrogenation. The catalysts were tested in benzene hydrogenation (HYD) in the presence of 1 -butanethiol (C 4 H 9 SH 5 ppm of S) and in the hydroconversion of pyrolysis gasoline (<b>PyGas)</b> and compared with zeolite NaY-supported ones. In addition, the catalysts were characterized by variety of techniques (XRD, N 2 adsorption-desorption, TPD-H 2, TPD-NH 3, CO chemisorption, TPR, XPS, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, TGA-DTA). It was found that the monometallic Ni/ASA catalyst with 24 wt. % of Ni was the most active among the catalysts studied in both benzene hydrogenation (+S) and hydroconversion of <b>PyGas.</b> The data of catalyst characterization suggests that the concentration of both metal and acid sites govern catalytic activity in both activity tests being the catalyst ability for hydrogen adsorption {{one of the most important}} factors to be taken into account. In general, it was found that the S-poisoning of the catalysts increased with an increase of the catalyst reactivity and diminished when "refractory-type" coke deposited on the metal sites inhibited the S-compound adsorption. For <b>PyGas</b> transformation, the importance of Pd promotion of the nickel catalysts was confirmed for both hydrogenation and ring-opening reactions...|$|E
30|$|The {{deposition}} of coke is {{highly dependent on}} the reaction conditions, especially on reaction temperature and hydrogen partial pressure.

30|$|Hydrogenation of the {{synthetic}} pyrolysis gasoline (<b>PyGas)</b> was investigated over the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst in a fixed-bed, high-pressure, continuous flow reactor.

The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was reduced for 16  h at a temperature of 723  K. Following this, the reactor temperature was decreased to the required reaction temperature (413  K). The reactor was then pressurised to the desired pressure (20  barg). Once the reactor had obtained the desired conditions, the reaction was started with a particular flow of <b>PyGas</b> feed of 0.042  ml min− 1 (WHSVPyGas 8  h− 1) and a flow of H 2 /N 2 gas (10  ml min− 1). The <b>PyGas</b> was vaporised and mixed with hydrogen and then passed through the catalyst bed. The hydrogenated <b>PyGas</b> was condensed in a knockout pot, which was chilled to 273  K. Liquid samples were collected every 2  h during daytime and analysed using a Thermo Finnigan Focus G.C. The hydrogenated <b>PyGas</b> mainly condensed in the knockout pot; however, very small amounts of the reaction products remained in the gaseous phase and, therefore, the effluent gas was also analysed at regular intervals by online Agilent G.C. All reactions were run for 76  h. After finishing each reaction, nitrogen gas was passed through the catalyst over night so as to remove any species present in the reactor. The reactor was then cooled to room temperature in the flow of nitrogen gas and then an in situ TPO was performed on the post reaction catalyst. The gas was switched to a flow of 2  % O 2 /Ar (40  ml min− 1) and the temperature increased to 723  K at a ramp of 5  K min− 1 and then the reactor temperature was held constant at 723  K until all evolution of gases other than O 2 and Ar ceased. The TPO process was monitored by an online mass spectrometer (QMS) in which the ion current of main species of mass fragments with m/z 28 (CO), 44 (CO 2), 32 (O 2), 18 (H 2 O) was monitored. Other species with m/z 68 (cyclopentene), 70 (1 -pentene), 72 (pentane), 78 (benzene), 92 (toluene), 98 (methylcyclohexane), 104 (styrene), 106 (ethylcyclo-hexane), 112 (1 -octene), 114 (octane), 15 (CH 3), 29 (C 2 H 5) and 2 (H 2) were also followed for detailed investigation of deposited coke.|$|E
30|$|The global {{intensity}} of the contour plots of the samples during the TX-cut wash is also lower than for the contour plot obtained of the samples treated with <b>PyGas.</b> The oxygen-containing compounds are present at a lower level during the TX-cut trial, indicating less potential fouling and possibly less emulsification capacity. Indeed, oxygen-containing compounds are more polar and have a higher tendency to stabilize oil in water emulsion.|$|E

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the contour}} lots of O vs C in Fig.  4, the first sample (sample A—caustic tower treated with <b>PyGas)</b> {{contains}} a very high amount (dark red zone) of molecules having about 5 – 7 oxygens and 10 – 25 carbons. Similar high concentrations are observed in the contour plot of O vs DBE and correspond to the area of about 5 – 7 oxygens and 0 – 15 DBE. Thus, sample A contains a significant amount of small aromatic/conjugated oxygenates.|$|E
30|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{deactivation}} of catalysts during <b>PyGas</b> hydrogenation is the deposition of carbonaceous residue (coke) {{on the surface of}} the catalyst [10, 11]. The nature of the coke depends on the process conditions and length of reaction with the carbonaceous residues deposited, varying from hydrocarbons and poly-aromatics to graphitic coke. The deposition of coke decreases accessibility for the reactants to the catalyst surface and can block pores. Continued heavy build up of coke in pores may result in fracturing of the support material which can cause plugging of reactor voids [7, 13].|$|E

30|$|Results {{indicate}} that a higher turbidity is reached for the vessel containing the red-oil from <b>PyGas</b> wash compared with the vessel containing the red-oil from the TX-cut wash with 20  % increase vs 9  % increase, respectively. These experiments show {{that the quality of}} the red-oil is positively affected by the change to a TX-cut wash which lowers its emulsifying properties. However, one should keep in mind that red-oils can be only one of the contributing factors to emulsions in quench water systems and other factors may also affect emulsion stability; including types of feedstock and other recycle streams.|$|E
30|$|No {{particular}} {{effect of}} the red-oils on the demulsification times, even at 2  % concentration, was observed. However, after full demulsification, {{a significant increase in}} the turbidity values for the vessels containing red-oils was noticed (up to 26  % increase), even at low red-oils concentration. Since the separate addition of 2  % red-oils to an isolated water phase does not lead to a turbidity increase, this effect can only be explained by an enhanced emulsification phenomenon. The role of red-oils in enhancing the emulsion phenomenon was thus proven. The plant trial using TX-cut instead of <b>PyGas</b> as aromatic wash was thus performed to evaluate if the emulsifying {{effect of the}} red-oils could be minimized.|$|E

30|$|Two common {{methods can}} be used to {{mitigate}} red-oil from formation and accumulation: (1) carbonyl traps to reduce the rate of aldol formation [2]; and (2) aromatic solvent washes [1, 4]. Carbonyl traps are often effective in reducing the rate of aldol condensation and in removing aldols through the caustic purges, but they do not suppress the Diels–Alder type oligomerization mechanism. Additional use of dispersants on top of the carbonyl trapping agent (and even a radical scavenger) are thus often proposed by chemical vendors to cover all possible mechanisms, leading to costly treatments [9]. Within our company, the “aromatic solvent washes” option proved to be a very efficient and cheap alternative and was achieved by rerouting a plant stream containing high amounts of aromatic compounds with low unsaturated hydrocarbons content (e.g., a Toluene–Xylene cut: “TX-cut”). This aromatic wash acts as a solvent, which efficiently displaces the oligomeric red-oils from the water phase into the aromatic phase avoiding their further oligomerization and precipitation. Since aromatic solvents are often of commercial value in the industry, a cheaper gasoline stream, i.e. pyrolysis gasoline (<b>PyGas)</b> from the quench water tower (QWT) of the plant, was used instead. This stream contains a high amount of reactive compounds (about of 7  % of indene, styrene, cyclopentadiene,…), which might have the potential of enhancing the mass of red-oil type of fouling through pathways A or C shown in Fig.  1.|$|E
40|$|Deactivation of a 0. 53 wt% Pt/γ-Al 2 ­ O 3 {{catalyst}} due {{to strongly}} adsorbed carbonaceous residue was investigated.   The {{role of the}} carbonaceous residue formed during hydrocarbon conversion reactions of 1 -octene, toluene and 1 : 1 volume mixture of 1 -octene/toluene at 300, 400 and 450 °C was established and a model developed {{to account for the}} activity and selectivity changes at the very start of the reaction, just as the hydrocarbon residue begins to form {{on the surface of the}} catalyst.   CO pulse chemisorption was used to determine the extent of Pt surface blocked by the hydrocarbon residue by titrating the Pt sites that remained exposed.   The efficiency of catalyst regeneration with H 2 at 400 °C was investigated and hydrocarbon reactions were performed on the regenerated catalyst to assess the catalytic activity and selectivity on a Pt surface covered with carbonaceous residue.   Characterisation of the carbonaceous residue deposited on the catalyst during hydrocarbon conversion reactions was carried out using TPO, TGA-MS and Raman microspectroscopy.   The amount, composition, reactivity and chemical structure of the carbonaceous residue in relation to reaction time and temperature was investigated. Increasing the reaction temperature accelerated the formation of coke.   The H:C ratio of the carbonaceous residue played an important role in the selectivity of the hydrocarbon reaction.   In addition, two batches of the 0. 53 wt% Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst spent six months in an industrial Pyrolysis gasoline (<b>Pygas)</b> Hydrotreatment reactor.   The catalyst batches were strategically placed at the inlet and outlet of the reactor.   Raman microspectroscopy revealed that the coke accumulated on the individually coked samples consisted of a mixture of disordered and ordered pre-graphitic polycrystalline coke.   The reactivity and type of the coke varied between the samples placed near the inlet or the outlet of the industrial reactor.

40|$|The studied {{compound}} {{belongs to}} the family of [MPy 2 ̆ 084 X 2 ̆ 082] 2 ̆ 2 c 5 2 Py isomorphous clathrates. Its crystal structure exhibits a van der Waals architecture formed by neutral [HgPy 2 ̆ 084 (NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082] host molecules, with the guest pyridine molecules included in the cavities of the host lattice. The host complex is formed by coordination of four pyridines, located near the equatorial plane, and two nitrates, located axially, to the Hg(II) cation. One of nitrates ligates as a monodentate ligand and another as a bidentate. The coordination polyhedron is 'HgN 2 ̆ 084 O 2 ̆ 083 ', with average Hg-NPy and Hg-Onitrate distances of 2. 38 (5) and 2. 68 (1) 5, respectively. The crystal structure is complicated with a superlattice and the crystal symmetry reduced to monoclinic, as compared to the structure usually occurring in the [MPy 2 ̆ 084 X 2 ̆ 082] 2 ̆ 2 c 5 2 Py clathrates. The pyridine vapor pressure over the clathrate was measured in the 293 - 369 K temperature range by the static tensimetric method. Thermodynamic parameters of the clathrate dissociation were calculated from these data. For the reaction 1 / 3 [HgPy 2 ̆ 084 (NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082] 2 ̆ 2 c 5 2 Pysolid= 1 / 3 [HgPy 2 ̆ 083 (NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082] solid + <b>Pygas</b> the parameters are as follows: 3 ̆ 94 H = 49. 4 (2) kJ/mol, 3 ̆ 94 S = 127 (2) J/(mol K) and 3 ̆ 94 G 2 ̆ 0822 ̆ 0892 ̆ 088 = 11. 4 (3) kJ/mol. The results are compared with previously reported data on compounds of the [MPy 2 ̆ 084 (NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082] 2 ̆ 2 c 5 2 Py series. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
