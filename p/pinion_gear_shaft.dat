50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a <b>gear</b> to the <b>shaft,</b> the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a <b>pinion</b> <b>gear,</b> the input <b>shaft</b> takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the <b>pinion</b> <b>gear.</b> Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study is to find the optimum power {{contribution}} ratio defined as the ratio of traction force applied onto rack rail by front <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> and rear <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> of monorail used in this study. At first, relation between loading weight and applied stress was investigated when loading weight Mb on the bogie was changed. Power contribution ratio was estimated using this relationship. The effect of the condition of power contribution ratio on the normal stress applied onto the rack tooth was simulated using obtained relations. The optimum power contribution ratio of front <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> was defined as an effective designing parameter to reduce the stress applied onto the rack tooth. A reduction ratio determined with the ratio of maximum compression stress on the tooth considering power contribution ratio to that of conventional case was estimated when the optimum power contribution ratio was considered. It was found that most of traction force was sheared by the front <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> not depending on magnitude of traction force, because the revolutions of the front and rear <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> was directly constraint due to the link system of the connection in the gear box of current monorail. The optimum power contribution ratio was α= 0. 53 when the representative location of the contacting forces on front <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> was h 1 = 5. 6 mm measured from the root of tooth, and that on rear <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> was h 2 = 7. 0 mm, respectively. The maximum reduction with 47 % in observed compression stress was obtained by determining optimum power contribution ratio under the condition at 5. 54 kN of total traction force...|$|R

Field measured time series of SCADA signals, including wind speed, generator power and rotational speed, were used to obtain the statistical variation of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> torque and rotational speed. From the SCADA data obtained over a 2. 2 year period random number datasets of smaller sizes were selected. Based on these random number datasets the effect of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> torque and rotational speed variations on the probabilistic risk of gear micro-pitting was investigated. Determinations of the gear tooth flank contact stress and lubricant film thickness were based on the technical report of gear micro-pitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 (2010). The study has shown that the considered <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> is subjected to high load conditions resulting in high contact stresses. The variation of rotational speed causes greater sliding between the gear teeth. The results of specific lubricant film thicknesses have shown that there is considerable risk of gear micro-pitting under the operational conditions recorded from the SCADA field data...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of <b>gear</b> supporting <b>shafts.</b> As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises <b>pinion</b> and <b>gear</b> supporting <b>shafts</b> is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by <b>shaft</b> deflections in <b>gear</b> generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.

40|$|Abstract. 50 CrV 4 {{spring steel}} is a tough, shock resisting, shallow {{hardening}} chromium vanadium steel having high fatigue and impact {{resistance in the}} heat treated condition. It is used extensively in <b>gears,</b> <b>pinions,</b> springs, <b>shafts,</b> axles, pins, bolts, etc., which require high modulus of resilience. The alloy was realised through conventional melt route of electric arc furnace (EAF) followed by ESR. The application of the alloy {{is limited to a}} section thickness of 15 mm [1]. Hence obtaining optimum mechanical properties becomes a challenging task. In this study, the hardening as well as tempering operations were limited to 15 mm thickness. The samples from the alloy were subjected to hardening at 860 °C for 1. 25 h. and oil quenching to room temperature followed by tempering at four different temperatures of 250, 300, 370 & 450 °C for 3 h. each with oil quenching to room temperature. It was found that the alloy exhibited good combination of strength and ductility when tempered at 450 °C. Microstructural study revealed the presence of fine tempered lath martensite along with the presence of a very small amount of delta ferrite along prior austenitic grain boundaries.

A 4 -Degree of Freedom torsional gear dynamics model, {{taking into account the}} torsional stiffness of the <b>pinion</b> and the <b>gear</b> <b>shafts,</b> is used in order to evaluate the contact load, the surface velocities and the contact radii of curvature of the mating teeth during a full meshing cycle. The torsional gear dynamics model takes into account both the geometric non-linearities of the system (backlash non-linearity) as well as the time varying properties (contact radii, meshing stiffness) and the internal excitations caused by geometrical imperfections of the teeth pair (static transmission error). The input torque used {{for the study of the}} film thickness and the sub-surface stress distribution corresponds to the region after the main resonance, where no teeth separation occurs. The contact conditions predicted by the gear dynamics are used as the input for the elastohydrodynamic elliptical point contact analysis. The lubricant film thickness, the corresponding pressure and surface traction distributions are obtained quasi-statically using the output load of the dynamic gear pair model. The variation of the induced sub-surface stress field is determined throughout a meshing cycle. Based on the sub-surface reversing orthogonal shear stresses, marginal differences occur when the viscous shear on the conjunctional surfaces are taken into account, which are mainly influenced by the applied pressure distribution. The numerical prediction of lubricant film thickness agrees reasonably well with that predicted using the well-established extrapolated oil film thickness formulae reported in the literature...|$|R
