40|$|The {{effect of}} {{titanium}} dioxide addition on bonding strength of CaO-P 2 O 5 -Na 2 O-TiO 2 glass-ceramic system was investigated as a coating on titanium substrate. Thus, different amounts of TiO 2 (2, 3. 5 and 5 mol %) {{were added to}} the base glass batch composition. The <b>prepared</b> <b>glaze</b> slips were applied on the substrate by dip coating method, dried and then heat treated at various temperatures. After that, bonding strength of the glass- substrates was determined via shear stress testing method. The de-bonded interfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). According to these results, the 5 mol% TiO 2 containing coating showed the best bonding strength, comparing with the other coatings. The bioactivity of the coated samples was investigated by soaking them in simulated body fluid (SBF). The surface of the samples was studied using SEM and X-Ray microprobe and it was observed that an apatite layer was grown on their surfac...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on using the dust from {{metallurgy}} as a pigment. The agglomerating dust is formed during metallurgical processes. This waste product is interesting for recycling process. The main mineralogical phase of dust is hematite alpha-Fe 2 O 3. Both synthetic and natural iron oxides are commonly used as pigments in ceramic industry. In this experiment the metallurgy dusts were used as a pigment for preparation of glazes and engobes. Agglomerating dusts were used both precalcined thermally at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C and in an original state. The <b>prepared</b> <b>glazes</b> were composed of a transparent glaze base with 10 wt% agglomerating dusts as pigment. The glazes calcined at 1060 degrees C were finally yellow colored and glazes calcined at 900 degrees C were brown colored. Engobes contained a ceramic clay base with 1, 5, 10 and 50 wt% of dust as pigment. Engobes calcined at 900 degrees C were red and grey colored. The pigments were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical (XRFS) analysis, granulometry (PSD), thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CIELab values.

50|$|The first Imari wares (ko-Imari) {{commenced}} {{production in}} the second decade of 17th century-perhaps 1620-30 (late Genwa era) and continued {{until the end of}} the Tempo era (1844). Imari porcelain production occurred because of two key factors: the discovery of fine white clay deposits in Arita, and the skills and knowledge of Korean/Chinese potters, particularly Yi Sam-pyeong. During the early 17th century many mainland Asian artisans were conscripted and brought to Japan to developed high quality porcelain <b>preparing,</b> throwing, <b>glazing</b> and firing techniques.|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates tensile bond {{strength}} (TBS) of metal orthodontic attachments to sandblasted feldspathic porcelain and zirconia with various bonding protocols. Thirty-six (36) feldspathic and 36 zirconia disc samples were <b>prepared,</b> <b>glazed,</b> embedded in acrylic blocks and sandblasted, and {{divided into three}} groups according {{to one or more}} of the following treatments: hydrofluoric acid 4 % (HF), Porcelain Conditioner silane primer, Reliance Assure® primer, Reliance Assure plus® primer, and Z Prime™ plus zirconia primer. A round traction hook was bonded to each sample. Static tensile {{bond strength}} tests were performed in a universal testing machine and adhesive remnant index (ARI) scoring was done using a digital camera. One-way ANOVA and Pearson chi-square tests were used to analyze TBS (MPa) and ARI scores. No statistically significant mean differences were found in TBS among the different bonding protocols for feldspathic and zirconia, p values = 0. 369 and 0. 944, respectively. No statistically significant distribution of ARI scores was found among the levels of feldspathic, p value = 0. 569. However, statistically significant distribution of ARI scores was found among the levels of zirconia, p value = 0. 026.

30|$|Water is an {{important}} raw material in the ceramic-tile industries (Enrique et al. 2000; Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2014). Water consumption varies in different parts and processes of manufacturing tiles (Huang et al. 2013). Generally, the consumed water per square meter of manufactured tile is about 20  L; 85 percent of this amount is consumed in the slurry process and the remaining 15 percent {{is used in the}} glazing section (Enrique et al. 2000). The wastewater of the ceramic-tile industries is produced through the following processes: slurring, spray drying, <b>preparing</b> <b>glaze,</b> coloring, engobing, as well as polishing and washing the floors of the production halls (Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2014; Shu et al. 2010). The major part of the produced wastewater in these sectors is attributed to washing (Moliner-Salvador et al. 2012). Wastewaters of such industries contain clays, insoluble ferrites and silicates, electrolytes, anions such as sulfate (100 – 500  mg/L) and chloride (100 – 700  mg/L), as well as heavy metals such as lead, zinc, chemical oxygen demand (COD) (150 – 1000  mg/L), and BOD 5 (50 – 400  mg/L). Organic materials in wastewater are mainly produced from the additives used in decorating tiles (Al-Asheh and Aidan 2017; Moliner-Salvador et al. 2012). In the ceramic-tile industries, a considerable amount of suspended solids and wastewater turbidity can be removed using a simple sedimentation process (Chong et al. 2009). The produced wastewater after this stage is only applicable in the slurry sector. This recycled water does not have the necessary quality to be used in other sectors, especially in glaze preparation or other coating processes. Therefore, it requires a more comprehensive treatment process (Chong et al. 2009; Martínez-García et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|Glass ceramic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in dental application because of their strong similarity with natural teeth. In this study LAS glass ceramic/glass materials were <b>prepared</b> by <b>glazing</b> processing and characterized in terms of mechanical flexural strength. The selected glass ceramic support derives from an industrial process. Different glasses were applied to the glass ceramic support in order to investigate firstly their effect on the glass ceramic/glass interface and secondly how these structural changes are correlated to the flexural strength property. Different thermal cycles were applied to the glass ceramic {{in order to promote}} the increasing of mechanical flexural strength. Preliminary results clearly points out that the application of a glass on the support leads to the decrease of the flexural strength if compared to the materials without any coating applied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Red mud is {{the main}} solid residue {{generated}} during the production of alumina {{by means of the}} Bayer process. In order to expand the comprehensive utilization field of red mud and develop new ceramic products with low radioactivity utilizing red mud, the exploration of <b>preparing</b> self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic materials using red mud as raw material was carried out. During the exploration, the self-releasing glaze ceramic materials with low radiation level were produced by normal pressure sintering process using the main ingredients of red mud, red sandstone, barium carbonate and ball clay. The properties of the self-releasing glaze ceramic samples were investigated by the measurements of mechanical properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and radiation measurement. The results show that the self-releasing glaze ceramic materials have good mechanical properties (the bulk density, 3. 10 g/cm 3; the compressive strength, 78. 00 MPa). Adding barium carbonate to the raw materials and then calcine them to ceramics, which can extend the sintering temperature range and the radioactivity level of the self-releasing glaze ceramic materials can be reduced to that of the natural radioactive background of Guilin Area, Karst landform (the average 60 Total/Timer) ...|$|R
30|$|Copper {{resinate}} {{was used}} as a <b>glaze,</b> <b>prepared</b> by mixing Cu-acetates (verdigris) with oil and/or resins. In this process, some of the acetates remain unreacted [147]. When mixed with oil, the coordination of the copper ion changes [147, 151]. Copper carboxylates are formed from the oil fraction of the binder, while metalloproteins may appear if egg tempera was used [147]. It darkens with light exposure [98, 132] and in alkaline conditions [132]. Also, being an artificial pigment, its production process might affect its stability, if reactive moieties are not carefully removed [98]. The lipidic fraction of the paint layer undergoes photo-oxidation, with Cu acting as a catalyst: local molecular arrangement changes are likely to be involved in colour changes [20, 147]. Upon prolonged exposure to X-rays, Cu 2 + is reduced to Cu+ [151].|$|R
50|$|A glaze {{in cooking}} is a coating of a glossy, often sweet, {{sometimes}} savoury, substance applied to food typically by dipping, dripping, {{or with a}} brush. Egg whites and basic icings are both used as glazes. They often incorporate butter, sugar, milk, and certain oils. For example, doughnut glaze is made from a simple mixture of powdered or confectioner's sugar and water that the doughnuts are dipped in, or some pastry doughs have a brushed on coating of egg whites. Glazes can also be made from fruit or fruit juice along with other ingredients and are often applied to pastries. A type of savory glaze {{can be made from}} reduced stock that is put on meat or vegetables. Some candies or confections may be coated in edible wax glazes.

40|$|Glazed {{ceramic tiles}} {{are the most}} common {{building}} material for floor and wall covering. Glazes are produced from frits. The aim of this work is to make a total or partial replacement of a raw material, zircon, widely used in ceramic tiles manufacturing, with a waste material, in order to prepare ceramic frits. The waste material used in this work, is the overspray zirconia, which is produced during the deposition process by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) of thermal barrier coatings (TBC) on turbine blades. In particular, a replacement of 100. wt%, 1. wt% and 0. 2. wt% of zirconium silicate with zirconia has been studied. Ceramic <b>glazes</b> <b>prepared</b> mixing frits and other raw materials are applied on a single-fired tile. The glazes obtained were characterized with different analytical techniques. This study has revealed that the substitution of zircon with waste zirconia is possible in small percentages due to the presence of small amount of chromophore ions in the overspray zirconia, which tend to colour the glaze...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nano-sized}} cobalt-aluminate pigment on thermal {{behavior of a}} typical frit was investigated. The nano-sized cobalt-aluminate powder was prepared by combustion method and the synthesized powder was calcined at 800 and 1000 ◦C. The prepared powder was characterized by DTA-TG, BET, SEM and TEM techniques. 2. 0 wt. % of the calcined powders were added into the used frit and hot stage microscopy, HSM, tests were carried out on frit and modified glazes to understand the role of calcination temperature on melting behavior. The differences found in HSM data were evaluated by Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman equation for the estimation of viscosity. The results showed that viscosity increases with addition of pigment.

She remained at the Leach Pottery {{for a year and}} learnt alongside Michael Cardew, Shoji Hamada and Tsuronosuke Matsubayashi known as Matsu. Katharine did the necessary odd jobs at the pottery whilst observing technical lectures from Matsu and was soon given the nickname of [...] "Beano". In 1925 she started her first pottery with a wood-fired kiln in the grounds of her family estate at Coleshill in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), where she was joined by Norah Braden. They used ash <b>glazes,</b> <b>prepared</b> from wood and vegetables from trees and plants growing on the estate. In 1946 she moved to her second pottery at Kilmington Manor in Wiltshire where she worked until her death in 1985. At Kilmington she used first an oil fired kiln, and then an electric one.|$|R
60|$|Lithograph Maps.--It may add {{greatly to}} the {{interest}} which a traveller will take in drawing up a large and graphic route-map of his journey, if he knows the extreme ease and cheapness with which copies of such a map may be multiplied to any extent by a well-known process in lithography: for these being distributed among persons interested {{in the country where}} he has travelled, will prevent his painstaking from being lost to the world. Sketches and bird'[S-eye views may be multiplied in the same manner. The method to which I refer is the so-called Anastatic process; the materials can be obtained, with full instructions, at any lithographer's shop, and consist of autographic ink and paper. The paper has been <b>prepared</b> by being <b>glazed</b> over with a composition, and the ink is in appearance something like Indian ink, and used in much the same way. With an ordinary pen, with this ink, and upon this paper, the traveller draws his map; they are neither more nor less difficult to employ than common stationery, and he may avail himself of tracing-paper without danger. He has one single precaution to guard against, which is, not to touch the paper overmuch with his bare and, but to keep a bit of loose paper between it and the map as he draws. As soon as it is finished, the map is taken to a lithographer, who puts it face downwards on a stone, and passes it under his press, when every particle of ink leaves the surface of the paper and attaches itself {{to the surface of the}} stone, precisely as though it had originally been written there; the glaze on the paper, which prevents the ink from soaking into it, makes this transference more easy and complete. The stone can now be worked with, just as a stone that has been regularly lithographed in the usual manner; that is to say, printing ink may be rubbed over it and impressions may be taken off in any number. It will be observed that the writing on the paper is reversed upon the stone, and is re-reversed, or set right again, in the impressions that are taken from it. The lithographer's charges for furnishing autographic ink and paper, working the stone, striking off fifty copies of a folio size, and supplying the paper (common white paper) for the copies--in fact every expense included--need not exceed ten shillings, and may be much less. If before drawing his map the traveller were to go to some working lithographer and witness the process, and make two or three experiments in a small way, he would naturally succeed all the better. A map drawn on a large scale, though without any pretension to artistic skill, with abundance of profile views of prominent landmarks, and copious information upon the routes that were explored, written along their sides, would be of the utmost value to future travellers, and to geographers at home.|$|R
