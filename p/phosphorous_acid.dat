The X-ray structures of 5 and 6 reveal unsymmetrical and symmetrical dimers of the phosphoryl anion groups linked to each other via intermolecular O-H···O hydrogen bonds, respectively, and to the imidazolium cations through almost linear monofunctional C-H···O hydrogen bonds...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to their}} low cost {{phosphorus}} fire-retardants find vast application in making fire-retardant cellulosic compostions. They {{have been used}} both as a physical additive as well {{as part of the}} polymer structure. Acid forming phosphorus compounds are generally effective in cotton and other cellulosic. Acidic retardants produce char via a dehydration process and this brings about the final fire-retardancy in phosphate-containing composition. High efficiency of phosphorus fire retardants in polyurethane foam has also been suggested {{to be the result of}} stable char formation. The char affects the flammability in the three following ways: reduction of flammable fuel, insulation by the char and coating by the non-volatile thermally stable <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acids</b> which screen the hot carbon from the oxygen. Nitrogen-phosphorus synergism in cellulose in controversial and evidence indicates that it is non existent in polymers...|$|R

The word phosphorous is the adjectival {{form of the}} P3+ valence: so, just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds, phosphorus forms phosphorous compounds (e.g., <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid)</b> and P5+ valence phosphoric compounds (e.g., phosphoric acids and phosphates).|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} complex {{inorganic}} solids with open-framework and other fascinating architectures, involving silicate, phosphate, and other anions, have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The {{past few years}} have also seen the successful synthesis and characterization of several molecular compounds that can act as precursors to form open-framework and other materials, some of them resembling secondary building units (SBUs). Transformations of rationally synthesized molecular compounds to materials constitute an important new direction in both structural inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry and enable possible pathways for the rational design of materials. In this article, we indicate the potential of such a bottom-up approach, by briefly examining the transformations of molecular silicates and phosphates. We discuss stable organosilanols and silicate secondary building units, <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acids</b> and phosphate secondary building units, di- and triesters of phosphoric acids, and molecular phosphate clusters and polymers.

25|$|Phosphorous oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and {{sometimes}} structurally complicated. They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms, some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus - phosphorus bonds. Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed, only nine are important, {{and three of}} them, hypophosphorous acid, <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid,</b> and phosphoric acid, are particularly important.|$|E
500|$|Pauling's second rule is {{that the}} value of the first pKa for acids of the formula XOm(OH)n depends {{primarily}} on the number of oxo groups m, and is approximately independent of the number of hydroxy groups n, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of pKa are 8 for m=0, 2 for m=1, −3 for m=2 and < −10 for m = 3. Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including pKa = 8 − 5m (known as Bell's rule), pKa=7−5m, or pKa=9−7m. The dependence on m correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid. For example, pKa for HClO is 7.2, for HClO2 is 2.0, for HClO3 is −1 and HClO4 is a strong acid (...) [...] The increased acidity on adding an oxo group is due to stabilization of the conjugate base by delocalization of its negative charge over an additional oxygen atom. This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> (H3PO3) has a pKa near 2 suggested that the structure is HPO(OH)2, as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and not P(OH)3 which would be expected to have a pKa near 8.|$|E

5000|$|Fungicides for {{the control}} of potato blight are {{normally}} only used in a preventative manner, optionally in [...] with disease forecasting. In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend {{on the nature of}} local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of P. infestans became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenytin, mancozeb and others. In the past, copper sulfate solution (called 'bluestone') was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that {{have been shown to be}} effective include horticultural oils, <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acids,</b> and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing [...] "beneficial" [...] microbes such as Bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.|$|R

2500|$|Lavoisier, {{together}} with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François de Fourcroy, submitted {{a new program}} for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled Méthode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry. The Classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances {{which could not be}} decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown [...] "radicals" [...] of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and [...] "fluoric" [...] acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, barite, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the [...] "radicals" [...] of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved {{together with}} the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous <b>acids,</b> phosphoric and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acids,</b> nitric and nitrous acids, the [...] "ic" [...] termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the [...] "ous" [...] ending. Similarly, salts of the [...] "ic" [...] acids were given the terminal letters [...] "ate," [...] as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the [...] "ous" [...] acids terminated with the suffix [...] "ite," [...] as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name [...] "copper sulfate" [...] with the old term [...] "vitriol of Venus." [...] Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This {{marked the beginning of the}} anti-phlogistic approach to the field.|$|R

40|$|Background. This study {{investigated}} whether quercetin could alleviate vascular calcification in experimental {{chronic renal failure}} rats induced by adenine. Methods. 32 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups fed normal diet, normal diet with quercetin supplementation (25 [*]mg/kg·BW/d), 0. 75 % adenine diet, or adenine diet with quercetin supplementation. All rats were sacrificed after 6 weeks of intervention. Serum renal functions biomarkers and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured and status of vascular calcification in aorta was assessed. Furthermore, the induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) /p 38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) pathway was determined to explore the potential mechanism. Results. Adenine successfully induced renal failure and vascular calcification in rat model. Quercetin supplementation reversed unfavorable changes of <b>phosphorous,</b> uric <b>acid</b> (UA) and creatinine levels, malonaldehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum and the increases of calcium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the aorta (P< 0. 05) and attenuated calcification and calcium accumulation in the medial layer of vasculature in histopathology. Western blot analysis showed that iNOS/p 38 MAPK pathway was normalized by the quercetin supplementation. Conclusions. Quercetin exerted a protective effect on vascular calcification in adenine-induced chronic renal failure rats, possibly through the modulation of oxidative stress and iNOs/p 38 MAPK pathway...|$|R
30|$|Our {{study reveals}} the toxic effects of {{monocrotophos}} (OPI) to C. elegans, characterized by mortality, and AChE inhibition and paralysis at sub-lethal concentrations after 4  h exposure. We observed a strong inverse correlation between AChE activity {{and extent of}} paralysis in worms. Organophosphorus insecticides are derivatives of phosphoric, <b>phosphorous,</b> or phosphinic <b>acid</b> (Abou-Donia, 2003). The toxicity of active OPI is attributed {{to their ability to}} inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE, choline hydrolase, EC 3.1. 1.7), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). AChE inhibition leads to cholinergic stress as a result of stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (Abou-Donia, 2003; Fukuto, 1990; Sogorb & Vilanova, 2002). The ubiquitous presence of AChE in invertebrates and vertebrates and its crucial role in nervous system predisposes not only insects but also animal and human health to toxic action of OPIs.|$|R
