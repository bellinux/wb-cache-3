5|$|After a {{lunch with}} Logan, Veronica notices that the Hearst Lampoon’s offices were egged. Weevil tells her the Dean's office was egged the same night, which Veronica relays to her father. Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} of Dean O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t find anything useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death.

Mike (Tony Hirst) and Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley) struggled to cope with Kathy's pregnancy, as the two were still teenagers at the time, and they discussed <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> up for adoption, although Mike then became attached to Sarah after her birth and the couple decided to keep her when Mike realised {{that he wanted to}} be a father after all.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Borgore {{stated that}} an {{extended}} play (EP) and studio album were under development, {{the latter of}} which he tentatively planned to release in 2013. After the release of her third studio album Can't Be Tamed (2010), Cyrus originally announced plans to focus on her film career, effectively <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> musical endeavors on hiatus. She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film Hotel Transylvania, but {{dropped out of the}} project to coordinate a musical comeback in 2012.

She began to do so {{as part of her}} addiction recovery during a twelve-step program. She put her notes down on legal pads and they became numerous over time. By the time Dickinson began to compile her writing into book format she had become established in her career and resided in Los Angeles, California with her two children.

5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with a crucifix pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy on October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion. On October 22, Candice legitimately cracked her clavicle during her rematch for the Women's Title against Phoenix in a {{two out of three}} falls match; Phoenix ran into the ropes, causing Candice to fall face-first off of the turnbuckle onto her face, neck, and shoulders necessitating a rushed finish and <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> out of action for 14 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, Meissner {{returned}} to Baltimore. On the return flight, she partially ruptured {{one of her}} eardrums and fully ruptured the other. This affected her hearing as she trained for the 2006 World Championships, her first senior ISU Championship. At Worlds, Meissner placed second in her qualifying group and fifth in the short program, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> in third place overall going into the free skate. During the free skate, Meissner completed seven triple jumps, including two triple-triple combinations, to win the title. This win made her the first woman since Kristi Yamaguchi to win a world title before a national title. Meissner is also {{the first woman to}} win Worlds on her first appearance since Oksana Baiul in 1993. She is the seventh-youngest ladies World Champion in history.

Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that year}} in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve {{searches}} for Dallas, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> {{at odds with}} the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.|$|E

5|$|That month, Lovato also {{announced}} her departure from Sonny with a Chance, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later {{said that she}} would return to acting when she felt confident doing so. Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season. Lovato released her third album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R and featured less pop rock. The album and the stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who saw a growth in musicianship because of her struggles and have praised Lovato's vocals but found the music more generic than her previous efforts. The record was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, being certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} Tirpitz {{several times}} during 1942 and 1943. When the battleship sortied to intercept Convoy PQ 12 on 6 March 1942 , which formed part of the convoy's escort, attempted to attack her using torpedo bombers. These aircraft launched twenty torpedoes at the battleship but all missed. On several occasions during 1942 and 1943 bombers from the Royal Air Force and Soviet Air Forces attempted to strike Tirpitz in her anchorages without success. On 23 September 1943 two British X-class midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship at her main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during Operation Source, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> out of service for six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

5|$|In March, Melina {{was placed}} in an angle where she became jealous of SmackDown! Diva Ashley Massaro, who was {{receiving}} attention because of her appearance in Playboy. The angle had Melina claim in her blogs that no Playboy cover models were capable of fighting her. This resulted in scheduled matches against former Playboy cover girls Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle, with both women losing to Melina. The storyline {{came to an end}} at WrestleMania 23, where Melina pinned Ashley in a Lumberjill match to retain her Women's Championship. After WrestleMania, Melina organized a photo op with the Women's Championship belt in the ring, but was interrupted by Mickie James, resulting in another storyline feud between the two Divas. On April 24, at a house show in Paris, France, Melina lost the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match to James when James pinned Victoria, but on the orders of Jonathan Coachman, she was entitled to a rematch on the same night, where she pinned James by <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> hands on the ropes to regain the title and become a two-time WWE Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E

5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{repeatedly}} attacked Tirpitz at Kaafjord from September 1943 until August 1944. On 23 September 1943, {{the crews}} of two British midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship during Operation Source, and placed explosive {{charges in the}} water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> out of service for six months. Further midget submarine attacks were not considered feasible, and an air raid designated Operation Tungsten was conducted by Royal Navy aircraft carriers on 3 April 1944 as repairs to the battleship neared completion. Tirpitz did not suffer heavy damage in this operation, but was out of action for several more months while repairs were completed. The Home Fleet sortied to attack Kaafjord on a further four occasions between April and July; all but the last of these operations were frustrated by bad weather, and the Operation Mascot raid on 17 July did not inflict any damage on Tirpitz. Four more carrier attacks targeting Tirpitz were undertaken between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but again resulted in only minor damage to the battleship.|$|E
