25|$|In July 2015 a Polish {{woman in}} the Dublin branch was awarded €55,000 after a {{judgement}} by the Equality Tribunal. She had been expected to work 70 hours a week while heavily pregnant, and had been promoted to a 'trainee manager' position, meaning she was not <b>paid</b> <b>overtime.</b> The tribunal found {{that she was the}} de facto manager of the store.|$|E
25|$|Overtime: The {{existing}} contract stated {{that if any}} stagehand is required to work overtime during a load-in, all workers must stay and be <b>paid</b> <b>overtime.</b> The producers proposed loosening the rule so that producers determined how many stagehands would stay and earn overtime. The union agreed to discuss modifying the contract, {{but only if the}} League agreed to strengthen other parts of the contract.|$|E
50|$|Island of Lost Men {{was filmed}} in early 1939. Production was delayed by cost overruns of {{approximately}} $25,000. Among {{the most expensive}} scenes were those involving the jungle and the river scene. Wong's salary was $6000 with another $1000 <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime,</b> while Quinn only earned $750.|$|R
50|$|The {{working time}} {{can also be}} divided in actual working time (working hours, during which the worker should {{immediately}} fulfill its obligations) and being on disposal (working hours will be paid in reduced amount. Should the employee be called to perform actual work, this time is <b>paid</b> as <b>overtime).</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, a {{class action}} lawsuit against Gap and 21 other {{companies}} alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime</b> work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions. A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.|$|R
25|$|The {{first problem}} {{occurred}} in July 1930, when the lathers union struck {{to win a}} $2 per day (16.7 percent) pay increase, halting work {{for a short period}} of time on the Archives, Interstate Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Post Office sites. A second strike occurred in late summer 1931 over a new federal wage law. The Davis-Bacon Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931. On August 4, 1931, painters working on the Internal Revenue building struck, arguing that out-of-town workers were being imported into the city to work on the building and being paid $5-to-$7 a day rather than the prevailing local wage rate of $11 a day. Both the Treasury and Labor Departments stepped in to arbitrate the strike. The dispute was settled a few days later when the Labor Department found that the contractor had paid the correct wages, and that no workers were being <b>paid</b> <b>overtime.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{over thirty}} years, Armfield then {{served as a}} female police detective, mainly working in the localities of Surry Hills and Darlinghurst. At first a {{probationary}} special constable, Armfield was not provided with a uniform, or <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime</b> and ancillary expenses as her male colleagues were. Unlike her male colleagues, she also experienced discrimination in terms of recompense for injuries sustained {{in the line of}} duty and had no superannuation benefit rights at the end of her career.|$|R
60|$|Work! I, who {{had worked}} with men, found that I didn't {{know the first thing about}} real work. A ten-hour day! I had to pass coal for the day and night shifts, and, despite working through the noon-hour, I never {{finished}} my task before eight at night. I was working a twelve-to thirteen-hour day, and I wasn't being <b>paid</b> <b>overtime</b> as in the cannery.|$|E

50|$|The lack of {{systemic}} regulation {{makes it difficult}} for contract violations to be contested. Under the law, contracts should specify total work hours, vacation time, wages, and benefits. However, in a study conducted by a Montreal organization, PINAY together with the McGill University School of Social Work, it was found that in 25% of the 148 live-in caregivers studied, employers did not sign a contract at all, and 43% claimed that they weren't <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime</b> work.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{possibility}} for success in Reuther’s demands shrunk “early in the year 1946, when both the United Steelworkers and the United Electrical Workers accepted wage increases of 17.5 percent from their employers.” In fact, this had a direct influence on the UAW-GM bargaining deal. The result, on March 13, 1946, was a raise of “18 1/2 cents an hour percent, <b>paid</b> vacations, <b>overtime</b> and other changes.” Also, GM workers did not gain access to determining product pricing.” ...|$|R

I find that workers not <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime</b> work significantly more than workers who are. No previous research has tested whether or not salaried workers who are not paid for extra hours of work are compensated for their additional hours. My results indicate that these salaried workers are compensated for their additional work by receiving higher salaries in both current and future time periods. ...|$|R

The department's total budget that year was 77 million dollars.|$|R

50|$|Iceland has no {{official}} minimum wage. Instead, minimum wages for specific occupations are negotiated in collective bargaining agreements {{which may be}} “industry-wide, sector-wide, {{or in some cases}} firm-specific.” The official workweek is 40 hours, including nearly three hours of breaks.

50|$|The Classified Municipal Employees Association (CMEA), a {{union for}} white-collar city workers in Baltimore, did not back the strike; indeed, its members had been <b>paid</b> <b>overtime</b> {{to act as}} strikebreakers.

50|$|There are {{financial}} incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign <b>paid</b> <b>overtime</b> to them.

30|$|Table  3 {{presents}} {{evidence that}} {{all types of}} workers are likely to face overtime pay violations. A high proportion of workers of all education, age, and gender are not paid the legally-mandated wage for overtime work. Workers who work <b>overtime</b> but <b>paid</b> any additional wage beyond their regular pay work in both state-owned and privately-owned firms. Workers in firms with owners from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, and foreign countries {{are more likely to}} work overtime and {{are also more likely to}} be <b>paid</b> for <b>overtime</b> hours, although the overtime pay is still generally less than 1.5 times the regular wage.|$|R
