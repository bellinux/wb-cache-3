These latter organs of infinitely diversified kinds graduate into, {{and in some cases}} can hardly be distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such as the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects.

40|$|Modern {{accounts}} of the doings of scientists habitually obscure practices of bodily knowing. This thesis therefore speculatively prolongs {{a critique of the}} disembodiment of scientists, adapted from a philosophical tradition within Science and Technology Studies. Part one takes as point of entry the inheritance of modern science to the powerful philosophical imperatives of detachment and lucidity, emphasising a body deprived of its curious, inventive, and adventurous dimension. The sensing, moving, and relational body is reclaimed in a turn to ontology, not only as situated within its world(s), but also as continuously in passage through diverging experiential, and affectual states. Conceptually extending the body invokes haptics as an indigenous theory of touch, drawing on the moved, and moving body. Through haptics, the body’s renderings of objectivity are rethought as indeterminate and hallucinatory <b>prehensions.</b> Required for haptic knowing is then an ethos of yielding to material alterity, animating a kind of objective (un) knowing. Part two analyses archaeological theory for its ethico-political conditions of knowing. Rethinking touch in archaeological excavations, the suggestion is made that archaeological knowing is alchemical, favouring affectual and material relations over objects. Following and observing haptic encounters between participants in excavations at the Burrough Hill Iron Age Fort, and the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, experiential affects are found to be crucial for the contingent material continuity of archaeological knowing. These affects are shown to groove the excavation and bodies of archaeologists, in their imaginings of a knowing, responsive to events in their environment...|$|R

6000|$|As soon as {{some ancient}} {{member in the}} great series of the Primates came, owing {{to a change in}} its manner of {{procuring}} subsistence, or to a change in the conditions of its native country, to live somewhat less on trees and more on the ground, its manner of progression would have been modified; and in this case it would have had to become either more strictly quadrupedal or bipedal. Baboons frequent hilly and rocky districts, and only from necessity climb up high trees;[203] and they have acquired almost the gait of a dog. Man alone has become a biped; and we can, I think, partly see how he has come to assume his erect attitude, which forms one of the most conspicuous differences between him and his nearest allies. Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands which are so admirably adapted to act in obedience to his will. As Sir C. Bell[204] insists “the hand supplies all instruments, and by its correspondence with the intellect gives him universal dominion.” But the hands and arms could hardly have become perfect enough to have manufactured weapons, or to have hurled stones and spears with a true aim, {{as long as they were}} habitually used for locomotion and for supporting the whole weight of the body, or as long as they were especially well adapted, as previously remarked, for climbing trees. Such rough treatment would also have blunted the sense of touch, on which their delicate use largely depends. From these causes alone it would have been an advantage to man to have become a biped; but for many actions it is almost necessary that both arms and the whole upper part of the body should be free; and he must for this end stand firmly on his feet. To gain this great advantage, the feet have been rendered flat, and the great toe peculiarly modified, though this has entailed the loss of the power of <b>prehension.</b> It accords with the principle of the division of physiological labour, which prevails throughout the animal kingdom, that as the hands became perfected for <b>prehension,</b> the feet should have become perfected for support and locomotion. With some savages, however, the foot has not altogether lost its prehensile power, as shewn by their manner of climbing trees and of using them in other ways.[205] ...|$|E

[Footnote 6: I say 'help' to furnish: for I by {{no means}} {{believe that it was}} any {{original}} difference of cerebral quality, or quantity which caused that divergence between the human and the pithecoid stirpes, which has ended in the present enormous gulf between them. It is no doubt perfectly true, in a certain sense, that all difference of function is a result of difference of structure; or, in other words, of difference in the combination of the primary molecular forces of living substance; and, starting from this undeniable axiom, objectors occasionally, and with much seeming plausibility, argue that the vast intellectual chasm between the Ape and Man implies a corresponding structural chasm in the organs of the intellectual functions; so that, it is said, the non-discovery of such vast differences proves, not that they are absent, but that Science is incompetent to detect them. A very little consideration, however, will, I think, show the fallacy of this reasoning. Its validity hangs upon the assumption, that intellectual power depends altogether on the brain--whereas the brain is only one condition out of many on which intellectual manifestations depend; the others being, chiefly, the organs of the senses and the motor apparatuses, especially those which are concerned in <b>prehension</b> and in the production of articulate speech.] ...|$|E
60|$|As the {{progenitors}} of man {{became more}} and more erect, with their hands and arms more and more modified for <b>prehension</b> and other purposes, with their feet and legs at the same time modified for firm support and progression, endless other changes of structure would have been necessary. The pelvis would have had to be made broader, the spine peculiarly curved and the head fixed in an altered position, and all these changes have been attained by man. Prof. Schaaffhausen[206] maintains that “the powerful mastoid processes of the human skull are the result of his erect position;” and these processes are absent in the orang, chimpanzee, &c., and are smaller in the gorilla than in man. Various other structures might here have been specified, which appear connected with man’s erect position. It is very difficult to decide how far all these correlated modifications are the result of natural selection, and how far of the inherited effects of the increased use of certain parts, or of the action of one part on another. No doubt these means of change act and react on each other: thus when certain muscles, and the crests of bone to which they are attached, become enlarged by habitual use, this shews that certain fictions are habitually performed and must be serviceable. Hence the individuals which performed them best, would tend to survive in greater numbers.|$|E
60|$|Means {{by which}} worms {{excavate}} their burrows.--This is effected in two ways; by pushing away the earth on all sides, and by swallowing it. In the former case, the worm inserts the stretched out and attenuated anterior extremity {{of its body}} into any little crevice, or hole; and then, as Perrier remarks, {36} the pharynx is pushed forwards into this part, which consequently swells and pushes away the earth on all sides. The anterior extremity thus serves as a wedge. It also serves, as we have before seen, for <b>prehension</b> and suction, and as a tactile organ. A worm was placed on loose mould, and it buried itself in between two and three minutes. On another occasion four worms disappeared in 15 minutes between {{the sides of the}} pot and the earth, which had been moderately pressed down. On a third occasion three large worms and a small one were placed on loose mould well mixed with fine sand and firmly pressed down, and they all disappeared, except the tail of one, in 35 minutes. On a fourth occasion six large worms were placed on argillaceous mud mixed with sand firmly pressed down, and they disappeared, except the extreme tips of the tails of two of them, in 40 minutes. In none of these cases, did the worms swallow, as far as could be seen, any earth. They generally entered the ground close to the sides of the pot.|$|E
60|$|We are, however, here {{concerned}} {{only with}} that kind of selection, which I have called sexual selection. This depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to reproduction. When the two sexes differ in structure in relation to different habits of life, as in the cases above mentioned, they have no doubt been modified through natural selection, accompanied by inheritance limited to one and the same sex. So again the primary sexual organs, and those for nourishing or protecting the young, come under this same head; for those individuals which generated or nourished their offspring best, would leave, cæteris paribus, the greatest number to inherit their superiority; whilst those which generated or nourished their offspring badly, would leave but few to inherit their weaker powers. As the male has to search for the female, he requires for this purpose organs of sense and locomotion, but if these organs are necessary for the other purposes of life, as is generally the case, they will have been developed through natural selection. When the male has found the female he sometimes absolutely requires prehensile organs to hold her; thus Dr. Wallace informs me that the males of certain moths cannot unite with the females if their tarsi or feet are broken. The males of many oceanic crustaceans have their legs and antennæ modified in an extraordinary manner for the <b>prehension</b> of the female; hence we may suspect that owing to these animals being washed about by the waves of the open sea, they absolutely require these organs in order to propagate their kind, and if so their development will have been the result of ordinary or natural selection.|$|E
60|$|The {{salmon is}} not the only fish in which the teeth differ in the two sexes. This is the case with many rays. In the thornback (Raia clavata) the adult male has sharp, pointed teeth, {{directed}} backwards, whilst those of the female are broad and flat, forming a pavement; so that these teeth differ in the two sexes of the same species more than is usual in distinct genera of the same family. The teeth of the male become sharp only when he is adult: whilst young they are broad and flat like those of the female. As so frequently occurs with secondary sexual characters, both sexes of some species of rays, for instance R. batis, possess, when adult, sharp, pointed teeth; and here a character, proper to and primarily gained by the male, appears to have been transmitted to the offspring of both sexes. The teeth are likewise pointed in both sexes of R. maculata, but only when completely adult; the males acquiring them at an earlier age than the females. We shall hereafter meet with analogous cases with certain birds, in which the male acquires the plumage common to both adult sexes, at a somewhat earlier age than the female. With other species of rays the males even when old never possess sharp teeth, and consequently both sexes when adult are provided with broad, flat teeth like those of the young, and of the mature females of the above-mentioned species.[9] As the rays are bold, strong and voracious fishes, we may suspect that the males require their sharp teeth for fighting with their rivals; but as they possess many parts modified and adapted for the <b>prehension</b> of the female, it is possible that their teeth may be used for this purpose.|$|E

60|$|Little {{light can}} be thrown on the gradual acquirement {{of the third}} {{remarkable}} character possessed by the more highly developed genera of the Droseraceae, namely the power of movement when excited. It should, however, be borne in mind that leaves and their homologues, as well as flower-peduncles, have gained this power, in innumerable instances, independently of inheritance from any common parent form; for instance, in tendril-bearers and leaf-climbers (i.e. plants with their leaves, petioles and flower-peduncles, &c., modified for <b>prehension)</b> belonging to a large [page 364] number {{of the most widely}} distinct orders,--in the leaves of the many plants which go to sleep at night, or move when shaken,--and in the irritable stamens and pistils of not a few species. We may therefore infer that the power of movement can be by some means readily acquired. Such movements imply irritability or sensitiveness, but, as Cohn has remarked,* the tissues of the plants thus endowed do not differ in any uniform manner from those of ordinary plants; it is therefore probable that all leaves are to a slight degree irritable. Even if an insect alights on a leaf, a slight molecular change is probably transmitted to some distance across its tissue, with the sole difference that no perceptible effect is produced. We have some evidence in favour of this belief, for we know that a single touch on the glands of Drosera does not excite inflection; yet it must produce some effect, for if the glands have been immersed in a solution of camphor, inflection follows within a shorter time than would have followed from the effects of camphor alone. So again with Dionaea, the blades in their ordinary state may be roughly touched without their closing; yet some effect must be thus caused and transmitted across the whole leaf, for if the glands have recently absorbed animal matter, even a delicate touch causes them to close instantly. On the whole we may conclude that the acquirement of a high degree of sensitiveness and of the power of movement by certain genera of the Droseraceae presents no greater difficulty than that presented by the similar but feebler powers of a multitude of other plants.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--This is prominent, {{and almost}} probosciformed (Pl. IX, fig. 4 b), {{and in the}} {{abnormal}} Anelasma (Pl. IV, fig. 2 d), quite probosciformed,--such, also, was its character in the larval condition. In outline, it is either sub-triangular, or oval with the longer axis transverse; the whole is capable, {{as well as the}} separate organs, of considerable movement, as I have seen in living sessile Cirripedes. It is composed (Tab. V, fig. 2) of a labrum, swollen or bullate, often to such an extent as to equal in its longitudinal axis the rest of the mouth; of palpi soldered to the labrum; of mandibles, maxillæ, and outer maxillæ, the latter serving as a lower lip. These organs have only their upper segments free, but there are traces, clearly seen in the mandibles (Pl. X, fig. 1, a, b), of their being formed of three segments. The two lower segments are laterally united, and open into each other, the prominence of the mouth being thus caused: this condition appears to me curious, and is, to a certain limited extent, intermediate between those articulated animals which have their trophi soldered into a proboscis, and those furnished with entirely free masticatory or prehensile organs. The palpi adhere to the corners of the labrum; and I call them palpi only from seeing that they spring laterally from above the upper articulation of the mandibles. The prominence of the mouth, measured from the basal fold by which the whole is separated from the body, is much greater on the half formed by the labrum and mandibles, than on the other half facing the cirri. The trophi surround a cavity--the supra-oesophageal cavity--in the middle of which, between the mandibles is seated the orifice of the oesophagus. The oesophagus is surrounded by long, fine, muscular fasciæ, radiating in all directions, opposing the constrictor muscles, and is capable of violent swallowing movements,--constriction after constriction being seen to run down its whole course: there are also some fine muscles attached to the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal cavity. The trophi serve merely for the <b>prehension</b> of prey, and not for mastication.|$|E
60|$|The {{mouth in}} its {{earliest}} condition alone {{remains to be}} described; in S. vulgare, it is seated on a very slight prominence, in a most remarkable situation, namely, in a central point between the bases of the three pairs of legs. I traced by dissection the oesophagus for some little way, until lost in the cellular and oily matter filling the whole animal, and it was directed anteriorly, which is the direction {{that might have been}} expected, from the course followed by the oesophagus in the larva in the last stage, and in mature Cirripedes. Mr. A. Hancock has called my attention to a probosciformed projection on the under side of the larva of Lepas fascicularis, when just escaped from the egg. Mr. Bate has described this same proboscis in Balanus and Chthamalus, and states the important fact, that it is capable of being moved by the animal; and, lastly, I have seen it in an Australian Chthamalus, and in Ibla, of remarkable size. This proboscis, which is always directed posteriorly, (like the mouth in the mature animal,) certainly answers to the mouth as made out by dissection in Scalpellum; and I believe I saw, as has Mr. Bate, a terminal orifice: it certainly does not possess any trophi. In Ibla (in which the larva is large enough for dissection), the base of the proboscis arises posteriorly to the first pair of legs, and the orifice at the other end reaches beyond or posteriorly to the point, where the mouth in Scalpellum opens, namely between the middle pair of legs. The mouth being either so largely probosciformed or seated only on a slight eminence, in two genera so closely allied as Ibla and Scalpellum, and (judging from Mr. Thompson's figures, and from what I have seen myself,) in the species of the same genus Lepas, is a singular difference: in the cases in which, at first, the proboscis is absent, it would probably soon be developed. I cannot but suppose that the inwardly directed spines on the bases of the two posterior legs, which are so rapidly developed, serve some important end, namely, as organs of <b>prehension</b> for the larvæ, like the mandibles and maxillæ of mature Cirripedes, for seizing their prey, and conveying it to their moveable mouths, conveniently seated for this purpose.|$|E
60|$|Structure.--A few remarks {{must be made}} on this subject. The body of a large worm {{consists}} of from 100 to 200 almost cylindrical rings or segments, each furnished with minute bristles. The muscular system is well developed. Worms can crawl backwards as well as forwards, and by the aid of their affixed tails can retreat with extraordinary rapidity into their burrows. The mouth is situated at the anterior end of the body, and is provided with a little projection (lobe or lip, {{as it has been}} variously called) which is used for <b>prehension.</b> Internally, behind the mouth, there is a strong pharynx, shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1) which is pushed forwards when the animal eats, and this part corresponds, according to Perrier, with the protrudable trunk or proboscis of other annelids. The pharynx leads into the oesophagus, on each side of which in the lower part there are three pairs of large glands, which secrete a surprising amount of carbonate of lime. These calciferous glands are highly remarkable, for nothing like them is known in any other animal. Their use will be discussed when we treat of the digestive process. In most of the species, the oesophagus is enlarged into a crop in front of the gizzard. This latter organ is lined with a smooth thick chitinous membrane, and is surrounded by weak longitudinal, but powerful transverse muscles. Perrier saw these muscles in energetic action; and, as he remarks, the trituration of the food must be chiefly effected by this organ, for worms possess no jaws or teeth of any kind. Grains of sand and small stones, from the 1/20 to a little more than the 1/10 inch in diameter, may generally be found in their gizzards and intestines. As it is certain that worms swallow many little stones, independently of those swallowed while excavating their burrows, it is probable that they serve, like mill-stones, to triturate their food. The gizzard opens into the intestine, which runs in a straight course to the vent at the posterior end of the body. The intestine presents a remarkable structure, the typhlosolis, or, as the old anatomists called it, an intestine within an intestine; and Claparede {13} has shown that this {{consists of}} a deep longitudinal involution of the walls of the intestine, by which means an extensive absorbent surface is gained.|$|E

Some animals extremely low in the scale have been modified for this same purpose; thus the males of certain parasitic worms, when fully grown, have the lower surface of the terminal part of their bodies roughened like a rasp, and with this they coil round and permanently hold the females. (4. M. Perrier advances this case ('Revue Scientifique,' Feb. 1, 1873, p. 865) as one fatal to the belief in sexual election, inasmuch as he supposes that I attribute all the differences between the sexes to sexual selection. This distinguished naturalist, therefore, like so many other Frenchmen, has not taken the trouble to understand even the first principles of sexual selection.
