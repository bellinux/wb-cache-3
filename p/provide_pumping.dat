One chamber was coated with titanium nitride (TiN) and one with amorphous silicon (a-Si) immediately following fabrication. One chamber remained uncoated throughout, and the last chamber was first tested without any coating, and then coated with a-Si following a series of heat treatments. The outgassing rate of each chamber was measured at room temperatures between 15 and 30 deg C following bakes at temperatures between 90 and 400 deg C. Measurements for bare steel showed a significant reduction in the outgassing rate by more than a factor of 20 after a 400 deg C heat treatment (3. 5 x 10 {sup 12 } TorrL s{sup - 1 }cm{sup - 2 } prior to heat treatment, reduced to 1. 7 x 10 { sup - 13 } TorrL s{sup - 1 }cm{sup - 2 } following heat treatment).

40|$|New {{divertor}} hardware {{is being}} designed and fabricated for the Radiative Divertor {{modification of the}} DIII-D tokamak. The installation of the hardware has been separated into two phases, the first phase starting in October of 1996 and the second and final phase, in 1998. The phased approach enables {{the continuation of the}} divertor characterization research in the lower divertor while providing pumping for density control in high triangularity, single- or double-null advanced tokamak discharges. When completed, the Radiative Divertor Project hardware will <b>provide</b> <b>pumping</b> at all four strike points of a double-null, high triangularity discharge and provide baffling of the neutral particles from transport back to the core plasma. By puffing neutral gas into the divertor region, a reduction in the heat flux on the target plates will be be demonstrated without a large rise in core density. This reduction in heat flux is accomplished by dispersing the power with radiation in the divertor region. Experiments and modeling have formed the basis for the new design. The capability of the DIII-D cryogenic system is being upgraded as part of this project. The increased capability of the cryogenic system will allow delivery of liquid helium and nitrogen to three new cryopumps. Physics studies on the effects of slot width and length can be accomplished easily with the design of the Radiative Divertor. The slot width can be varied by installing graphite tiles of different geometry. The change in slot length, the distance from the X-point to the target plate, requires relocating the structure vertically and can be completed in about 6 - 8 weeks. Radiative Divertor diagnostics are being designed to provide comprehensive measurements for diagnosing the divertor. Required diagnostic modifications will be minimal for Phase 1, but extensive for Phase 2 installation. These Phase 2 diagnostics will be required to fully diagnose the high triangularity discharges in the divertor slots...|$|E

The micro cell culture platform can maintain homogenous and stable culture environments, {{as well as}} <b>provide</b> <b>pumping</b> of multiple mediums and efficient cell/agarose (scaffold) loading functions, which allows realization of more precise and high-throughput cell culture-based assays. In this study, {{the design of a}} high-throughput medium pumping mechanism was especially highlighted. A new serpentine-shaped pneumatic micropump was used to provide the required medium pumping mechanism. Pneumatic microchannels with a varied length and U-shape bending corners were designed to connect three rectangular pneumatic chambers such that one can fine-tune the pumping rate of the S-shape micropump by using the fluidic resistance. To achieve a high-throughput medium pumping function, a pneumatic tank was designed to simultaneously activate all of the 30 pneumatic micropumps with a uniform pumping rate. Results show that the pumping rates of the 30 integrated micropumps were statistically uniform with a flow rate ranging from 8. 5 to 185. 1 microl h(- 1), indicating the present multiple medium pumping mechanism is feasible for high-throughput medium delivery purposes. Furthermore, as a demonstration case study, 3 -D culture of oral cancer cell was successfully performed, showing that the cell viability remained as high as 95 % - 98 % during the 48 h cell culture. As the result of miniaturization, this perfusion-based 3 -D cell culture platform not only provides a well-defined and stable culture condition, but also greatly reduces the sample/reagent consumption and the need for human intervention. Moreover, due to the integrated capability for multiple medium pumping, high-throughput research work can be achieved. These traits are found particularly useful for high-precision and high-throughput, 3 -D cell culture-based assay...|$|E

In this work, an ion-drag EHD pump is used to provide the pumping power necessary to ensure the cooling requirements. The present study contributes to two major areas which could provide significant improvement in electronics cooling applications. One direction concerns development of an EHD micropump, which could provide the pumping power for micro-cooling systems capable of providing more efficient and localized cooling. Using a 3 M fluid, a micropump with a 50 mm gap between the emitter and collector and a saw-tooth emitter configuration at an applied voltage of about 250 V provided a pumping head of 650 Pa. For a more optimized design a combination of saw tooth emitters and a 3 -D solder-bump structure should be used. The other major contribution involves the application, for the first time, of the EHD pumping technique to cryogenic liquids. Successful implementation of these cooling techniques could provide on-demand and on-location pumping power which would allow tight cryogenic temperature control on the cooling surface of sensors, detectors and other cold electronics. Pumping heads of up to 1 Pa with mass flow rates of 0. 8 g/s were achieved using liquid nitrogen. Although the pressure head results seem relatively small, the corresponding liquid nitrogen mass flow rate meets the targeted heat removal requirements specific to superconducting sensors and detectors...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To avoid flooding in New Orleans after a rain storm, the city's Sewerage and Water Board pumps rainwater from the city into three drainage canals which then flow unrestricted into Lake Pontchartrain. While critical to prevent flooding from rainfall, these canals are vulnerable to storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain during a hurricane, and consequently are lined with floodwalls along both sides to protect storm surge from overtopping the canals and flooding the city. However, during Hurricane Katrina, several breaches occurred in the canal floodwalls allowing significant amounts of water to enter New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain. In its efforts to restore pre-Katrina levels of hurricane protection to New Orleans by the June 1 st start of the 2006 hurricane season, in late 2005, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) considered strengthening the drainage canal floodwalls but decided to postpone this effort due to cost and time constraints. Instead, the Corps decided to install three interim closure structures (gates) at the points where the canals meet the lake. These gates would be closed during major storm events to prevent storm surge from entering the canals and potentially breaching the canal floodwalls and flooding the city. Due to space constraints along the canals and the limited {{amount of time it}} had {{before the start of the}} 2006 hurricane season, the Corps decided to procure 34 large-capacity hydraulic pumping systems 1 to provide the most pumping capacity possible by June 1, 2006. The Corps acknowledged that its decision to install the gates and <b>provide</b> <b>pumping</b> capacity that was less than what was needed to keep the city dry could result in some flooding by rainfall but believed that the risk from a hurricane-induced storm surge was far greater than the risk of flooding from heavy rainfall. During the process of acquiring, testing, and installing the pumping systems for the drainage canals, many concerns were raised by the media about potential problems with the operation of these pumping systems, and GAO was asked to examine the (1) specifications and requirements of the contract and the basis for selecting the supplier of the pumping systems; (2) concerns identified during factory testing and the Corps' rationale to install the pumping systems in light of the factory test failures; (3) actions the Corps has taken to address the known problems with the pumping systems; and (4) pumping capacity that existed on June 1, 2006, the capacity that currently exists, and the capacity that is planned for the 2007 hurricane season. ...|$|E
40|$|Analytical, {{computational}} {{and experimental}} studies {{were carried out}} to investigate heat transfer and fluid flow in micro-channel absorber plates for compact (thin and light-weight) solar thermal collectors. The main objective of the work was to study different design and/or operating scenarios as well as study the significance of various micro-scaling effects. Analytical investigation showed that, under similar conditions, the proposed design yields a much higher fin efficiency, F and collector efficiency factor, F’ compared with the conventional solar collector design. An analytical model combining convective heat transfer in the collector fluid with axial conduction in the metal plate was developed. The predicted plate temperature profiles from the analytical model were in close agreement with the measured profiles. The model further showed that axial thermal conduction can significantly alter the plate temperature profile. Experiments were designed to represent real life operation of the proposed system. A CFD study, using the same design and operating parameters, produced results comparable with experiments. This numerical simulation also gave further insight into the heat transfer and fluid flow patterns in the micro-channel plate. The effect of channel cross section geometry was studied. The Nusselt number was observed to increase as the aspect ratio approached unity. Measured friction factors were similar in trend to the predictions for rectangular channels, although the overall rise in fluid temperature resulted in slightly lower friction factors. Thermal performance reduced slightly with increase in hydraulic diameter. The significance of various scaling effects was also investigated experimentally and numerically. Most of the typical scaling effects such as viscous dissipation and entrance effects were found to be insignificant however, conjugate heat transfer, surface boundary condition, surface finish and measurement uncertainties could be significant. The results showed a Reynolds number dependent Nusselt number which has been attributed to axial thermal conduction. It was also observed that only three walls were transferring heat; the walls of heat transfer had a uniform peripheral temperature while the heat flux varied peripherally. The closest simplified thermal boundary condition to represent heat transfer in these channels is the H 1 with three (3) walls transferring heat. Increased surface roughness (obtained by using an etching technique to create the channels) was found to have a detrimental effect on heat transfer. The results showed that thermal improvement can be achieved by increasing the fluid velocity; however, pumping the thermal fluid above a pump power per plate area of 0. 3 W/m 2 resulted in marginal improvement. In practice, optimum microchannel geometry in plates should be sized based on fluid properties and operating conditions. The micro-channels should also have thin walls to minimise the effects of conjugate heat transfer. A Photovoltaic pump should be installed alongside the collector in order to <b>provide</b> <b>pumping</b> power required and minimise the overall fluid temperature rise. The results are beneficial for the design of micro-channel absorber plates for low heat flux operation up to 1000 W/m 2. ...|$|E
