2500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to resolve a}} periapical lesion of endodontic origin, {{it is essential to}} be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection. [...] Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and <b>periapical</b> <b>infection</b> cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct diagnosis and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion. [...] Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease, proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with incision and drainage of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient signs and symptoms.

30|$|Our {{study did}} not find a {{significant}} association between endodontically treated teeth and mucosal thickening. Though {{this finding is consistent}} with some previously published studies [27, 28], other studies [21, 31] did report an association. These discrepant findings could be the result of different inclusion criteria in the study design. Since our {{study did not}} include any patients with radiographic signs of pulpal pathoses, these data suggest that successful root canal treatment without signs of apical radiolucency should not be considered as a risk indicator of future mucosal thickening. On the other hand, it has been reported [32, 33] that the presence of apical periodontitis is related to sinus mucosal thickening, which should alert clinicians when planning future implant-related procedures. Because <b>periapical</b> <b>infections</b> are considered a multifactorial entity, they should be carefully evaluated and treated to ensure a favorable implant treatment outcome [34, 35]. In addition, the influence of a periapical scar of dense collagen tissue, formed after conventional root canal treatment, on implant treatment outcomes has not yet been fully explored. Therefore, additional future investigations are needed to examine these unresolved issues.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{results from}} a mutational analysis of {{the region of the}} dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene encoding dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) in 12 families with dominantly inherited dentin diseases. In eight families (five mutations in the N-terminal third of DPP), the clinical and radiologic features were uniform and compatible with dentin dysplasia type II (DD-II) with major clinical signs in the deciduous dentition. In the other families (four mutations in the more C-terminal part), the permanent teeth also were affected, and the diseases could be classified as variants of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Attrition was not prominent, but <b>periapical</b> <b>infections</b> were common. Discoloring with varying intensity was evident, and pulps and root canals were obliterated in the permanent dentition. All mutations caused a frameshift that replaced the Ser-Ser-Asx repeat by a code for a hydrophobic downstream sequence of approximately original length. We conclude that frameshift mutations in DSPP explain a significant part of dentin diseases. Furthermore, we propose that the location of the mutation is reflected in the phenotypic features as a gradient from DD-II to more severe disease that does not conform to the classic definitions of DI-II.

The pathogenesis of focal diseases has been classically attributed to dental pulp pathologies and <b>periapical</b> <b>infections.</b> Nonetheless, in recent years, their role is being dismissed while increasing interest is being devoted to the possible associations between periodontal infection and systemic diseases. In fact, periodontal pathogens and their products, as well as inflammatory mediators produced in periodontal tissues, might enter the bloodstream, causing systemic effects and/or contributing to systemic diseases. On the basis of this mechanism, chronic periodontitis has been suggested as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases associated with atherosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disease, preterm delivery, rheumatoid arthritis, and, recently, osteoporosis, pancreatic cancer, metabolic syndrome, renal diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

The root canals were instrumented to a standardized apical size. Among all, 90 teeth received final irrigation with MTAD and were divided into three groups according to their obturation materials; i. e. gutta-percha/AH 26, Resilon/RealSeal SE and positive controls. All these groups were divided into three 1 -, 3 - and 6 -week time interval subgroups. Thirty teeth as negative control had no final irrigation with MTAD, but were obturated with gutta-percha/AH 26 or Resilon/RealSealSE. Dentin powder was prepared after 1, 3 and 6 weeks.

40|$|Published: February 2, 2017 Enterococcus faecalis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} species present in post-treatment disease and {{plays a significant role}} in persistent <b>periapical</b> <b>infections</b> following root canal treatment. Its ability to persist in stressful environments is inter alia, due to its ability to form biofilms. The presence of certain D-amino acids (DAAs) has previously been shown to reduce formation of Bacillus subtilis biofilms. The aims of this investigation were to determine if DAAs disrupt biofilms in early and late growth stages for clinical E. faecalis strains and to test their efficacy in disrupting E. faecalis biofilms grown in sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of commonly used endodontic biocides. From thirty-seven E. faecalis strains, the ten "best" biofilm producers were used to test the ability of a mixture containing D-leucine, D-methionine, D-tyrosine and D-tryptophan to reduce biofilm growth over a period of 24, 72 and 144 hours and when compared to their cognate L-Amino Acids (LAAs). We have previously shown that sub-MIC levels of tetracycline and sodium hypochlorite promotes biofilm growth in clinical strains of E. faecalis. DAAs were therefore tested for their effectiveness to reduce biofilm growth in the presence of sub-minimal concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl- 0. 031 %) and Odontocideâ¢ (0. 25 % w/v), and in the presence of Odontopasteâ¢ (0. 25 % w/v). DAAs significantly reduced biofilm formation for all strains tested in vitro, while DAAs significantly reduced biofilm formation compared to LAAs. The inhibitory effect of DAAs on biofilm formation was concentration dependent. DAAs were also shown to be effective in reducing E. faecalis biofilms in the presence of Odontopasteâ¢ and sub-MIC levels of NaOCl and Odontocideâ¢. The results suggest that the inclusion of DAAs into current endodontic procedures may reduce E. faecalis biofilms. Peter S. Zilm, Victor Butnejski, Giampiero Rossi-Fedele, Stephen P.

The most common clinical manifestation of these insults is the paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve or mental nerve paresthesia. Paresthesia usually manifests as burning, prickling, tingling, numbness, itching or any deviation from normal sensation. Altered sensation and pain in the involved areas may interfere with speaking, eating, drinking, shaving, tooth brushing and other events of social interaction which will have a disturbing impact on the patient. Paresthesia can be short term, long term or even permanent. The duration of the paresthesia depends upon {{the extent of the}} nerve damage or persistence of the etiology. Permanent paresthesia is the result of nerve trunk laceration or actual total nerve damage. Paresthesia must be treated as soon as diagnosed to have better treatment outcomes. The present paper describes a case of mental nerve paresthesia arising after the start of the endodontic therapy in left mandibular first molar which was managed successfully by conservative treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} {{present study was}} to assess the {{surgical}} management of impacted third molar with proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve and complications associated with coronectomy in a series of patients undergoing third molar surgery. Material and Methods: The position of the mandibular canal in relation to the mandibular third molar region and mandibular foramen in the front part of the mandible (i. e., third molar in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve [IAN] or not) was identified on panoramic radiographs of patients scheduled for third molar extraction. Results: Close proximity to the IAN was observed in 64 patients (35 females, 29 males) with an impacted mandibular third molar. Coronectomy was performed in these patients. The most common complication was tooth migration away from the mandibular canal (n = 14), followed by root exposure (n = 5). Re-operation to remove the root was performed in cases with <b>periapical</b> <b>infection</b> and root exposure. Conclusions: The results indicate that coronectomy can be considered a reasonable and safe treatment alternative for patients who demonstrate elevated risk for injury to the inferior alveolar nerve with removal of the third molars. Coronectomy did not increase the incidence of damage to the inferior alveolar nerve and would be safer than complete extraction in situations i...|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus faecalis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} species present in post-treatment disease and {{plays a significant role}} in persistent <b>periapical</b> <b>infections</b> following root canal treatment. Its ability to persist in stressful environments is inter alia, due to its ability to form biofilms. The presence of certain D-amino acids (DAAs) has previously been shown to reduce formation of Bacillus subtilis biofilms. The aims of this investigation were to determine if DAAs disrupt biofilms in early and late growth stages for clinical E. faecalis strains and to test their efficacy in disrupting E. faecalis biofilms grown in sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of commonly used endodontic biocides. From thirty-seven E. faecalis strains, the ten "best" biofilm producers were used to test the ability of a mixture containing D-leucine, D-methionine, D-tyrosine and D-tryptophan to reduce biofilm growth over a period of 24, 72 and 144 hours and when compared to their cognate L-Amino Acids (LAAs). We have previously shown that sub-MIC levels of tetracycline and sodium hypochlorite promotes biofilm growth in clinical strains of E. faecalis. DAAs were therefore tested for their effectiveness to reduce biofilm growth in the presence of sub-minimal concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl- 0. 031 %) and Odontocideâ¢ (0. 25 % w/v), and in the presence of Odontopasteâ¢ (0. 25 % w/v). DAAs significantly reduced biofilm formation for all strains tested in vitro, while DAAs significantly reduced biofilm formation compared to LAAs. The inhibitory effect of DAAs on biofilm formation was concentration dependent. DAAs were also shown to be effective in reducing E. faecalis biofilms in the presence of Odontopasteâ¢ and sub-MIC levels of NaOCl and Odontocideâ¢. The results suggest that the inclusion of DAAs into current endodontic procedures may reduce E. faecalis biofilms...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>periapical</b> and {{periodontal}} <b>infections</b> {{are isolated}} {{by the body}} which produces a protective pyogenic membrane or abscess wall to keep the area of infection localized. Micro-organisms which are sufficiently virulent may destroy this barrier. Factors which may contribute to this are decreased host resistance, surgery or repeated movement of fracture segments, as may occur with an untreated fracture. Mechanical trauma burnishes the bone, causing ischemia by crushing blood vessels and seeds micro-organisms into the tissues.|$|R
50|$|Sinusitis is {{inflammation}} of the paranasal air sinuses. Infections associated with teeth {{may be responsible for}} approximately 20% of cases of maxillary sinusitis. The cause of this situation is usually a <b>periapical</b> or periodontal <b>infection</b> of a maxillary posterior tooth, where the inflammatory exudate has eroded through the bone superiorly to drain into the maxillary sinus. Once an odontogenic infection involves the maxillary sinus, it is possible that it may then spread to the orbit or to the ethmoid sinus.|$|R
