40|$|Abstract. In {{the premise}} of {{mechanics}} model and the kinetic equation, the numerical simulation model of pile-soil system has been established with MATLAB, and the numerical analytic solution of kinetic equation has been got by fourth-order Runge-Kutta. And the relationship curves between the pile-soil interface’s friction and time, displacement, acceleration and velocity of the pile have been mainly studied when the exciting amplitude is 100 kN, 200 kN respectively. With the work, the exciting amplitude will be obtained. In this way, the friction of the pile-soil can be decreased and work efficiency can be improved; besides this paper can also provide a further theoretical basis of pile <b>pressing</b> <b>machine's</b> dynamic optimization...|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Research Institute CARIRI {{investigated}} possibilities to mass-produce raw {{forms with}} the use of <b>pressing</b> <b>machines</b> in the 1970s. Much of this project took place in Sweden in collaboration with the Saab Company. Although first results were promising, the project has been abandoned due to lack of finances and support by local pan tuners in Trinidad. Another method of shaping the pan was attempted: by spinning. The pan was spun on a lathe-like device, and a roller {{on the end of a}} bar was used to sink the pan. While this did create pre-sunk pans, a problem was that there would often be scratches and grooves in the steel.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} primary entrances to U.N.C.L.E. headquarters. In the daytime, field agents are {{admitted}} {{by way of}} Del Floria's, a small, nondescript tailor/dry-cleaning shop located one flight below street level. The agents go to the single fitting booth and turn the coat hook on the back wall. Outside in the shop, an operator activates a mechanism on the <b>pressing</b> <b>machine</b> that releases the disguised armored door. The wall swings inward and an agent finds him/herself in the main admissions area. There, a receptionist pins on a security badge (white or later, yellow for highest security clearance; red and green for low clearance and visitors). A chemical on the receptionist's fingers activates the badge. There are also entrances through the Men's and Women's lockers {{at the rear of}} the parking garage (admissions for non-field personnel). After hours, when Del Floria's is closed, agents may also enter through the Masque Club or through the offices of the charitable organization.|$|E
50|$|The Strengberg {{tobacco factory}} {{was one of}} the largest and most {{successful}} tobacco firms in Finland, situated in the Ostrobothnian town Jakobstad. From this position of strength, it was also (probably) the first Finnish company to open a subsidiary abroad, in the Swedish town of Härnösand in 1903. The severe competition between the Finnish tobacco producers (such as P.C. Rettig & Co and Tollander & Klaerich) led to rapid technological development in the branch. By the 1840s, Strengberg had started to install machinery and industrialise artisan production. Cutting machines were acquired and installed in the 1850s, and the first steam engine to drive the cutting and <b>pressing</b> <b>machines</b> were acquired in 1863, and in 1900, the factory employed around 1000 people in Jakobstad.|$|R

50|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the north wall Rivera depicts the manufacturing process of the exterior parts to the motor car. In this mural Rivera focuses on technology as an important quality of the future. He then allegorizes this concept through one of the huge parts <b>pressing</b> <b>machines</b> that is depicted in the mural. The machine is meant to symbolize the story of the Aztec goddess Coatlicue. In Aztec mythology Coatlicue was the mother of the gods, and gave birth to the moon, stars, and Huitzilopochtli, the god of the sun and war. The story of Coatlicue was important to the Aztecs and summarized the complexity of their culture and religious beliefs. In comparison to the aztec story, technology had become what the modern world found to be important culturally, and at times supported and defended technology as passionately as a religion.|$|R
50|$|In Hungary, beer, {{wine and}} {{standardized}} liquor bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized {{in the recent}} past. Beer bottles have 25 forints on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and hypermarkets, such as Lidl, Auchan, Tesco, Interspar. They all use reverse vending machines to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while ALU cans are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a <b>pressing</b> <b>machine,</b> thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2 forints/ALU can and 1 forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1940 Burlingham were {{instructed}} to cease coach building and concentrate on war work. For the duration Preston New Road works and the assembly shop at Vicarage Lane were to produce airframe assemblies for Vickers Wellington medium bombers, which were assembled at a Vickers shadow factory {{on the site of}} today's Blackpool Airport. As well as this work the Newhouse Road workshop built mobile canteens on Austin chassis for the armed forces and produced a limited number of utility-design bodies for half-cab single-deckers. Although such chassis were not produced under the utility scheme some chassis were assembled from remaining stock parts or from export orders impossible to deliver, and in 1941-2 Burlingham built bus bodies for 15 such chassis and in 1943-5 again built bodies to replace worn out or war-damaged ones. Customers included Barton Transport, East Kent and United Automobile Services. During early 1945, before other coachbuilders, Burlingham were allowed to reintroduce compound curvature to the rear-dome of its bus body designs, as it had a crude, but effective, <b>pressing</b> <b>machine</b> for this task, unlike other coachbuilders, who required skilled panel-beaters to do the work.|$|E
50|$|The {{intricate}} <b>pressing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was spread}} across both floor levels. It essentially consisted {{on a large}} cantilevered beam (dolare haga) which passed between the two central vertical support beams (dolare zutabeak) of the building. The fixed end was {{held in place by}} a wooden beam (dolare zutabeak) right beside the actual press. The far end of the beam sat around a tall wooden screw (ardatza) which ran between beams under the roof (gain hagak) and the ground floor of the building, ending in a capstan-like turning mechanism. At the bottom end of the screw hung a stone weight (pisu harria) which rotated in a hole in the ground. By turning the screw at the ground floor level, the horizontal beam on the first floor would gradually be pulled downwards and, along with the gravitational pull, exert pressure on the apple press at the far end. The apple press itself consisted essentially out of a wooden base with a surrounding groove to catch the juices upon which the apple pomace is placed and a wooden platform which pressed down on the apples. Today, modern machinery is used to press the apples.|$|E
50|$|The red wines of Domaine Louis Latour {{are still}} vinified and aged at the {{historical}} Winery Corton Grancey. Maison Louis Latour respects Burgundian traditions for the vinification of its red wines from the harvest {{to the final}} product. Only the finest grapes are selected and placed into traditional French oak vats {{for a short period}} of fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the wine is drained from the vats. This is called free-run wine. All grape skins and pips are then removed manually and pressed gently by top of the range pneumatic <b>pressing</b> <b>machines.</b> The press wine is blended with the free-run wine and spends approximately 12 months in barrel. It undergoes three rackings to clear it of any deposit that may have collected. After bottling, the wine is allowed to settle for a further few months before distribution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} {{researches}} have conducted {{in order to}} evaluate the ductile fracture occurrence by using forming limit diagram. However, specimen shape and testing machine for obtaining forming limit diagram of sheet metal have some problems. The problem about specimen shape is occurring at the specimen edge. In uniaxial tensile test, the specimen edge may cause a defused neck in width direction and may have influence on fracture occurrence. In biaxial tensile test by using a cruciform specimen, a uniform biaxial deformation is not obtained because uniaxial tensile stress occurs at the specimen edge. Tensile test by using a specimen which does not have such edges should carry out, for example, in bulge test and multi-axial tube expansion test, specimens without edge are used. However, these methods need special machines. Therefore, new biaxial tensile testing method is required. By this method, materials deform depending on biaxial strain state by using popular <b>pressing</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R
