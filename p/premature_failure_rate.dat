Large, complex aerospace systems such as aircraft, launch vehicle and satellites are subjected to most exhaustive and comprehensive acceptance-testing program at the factory that is also used in other industries and that also suffer from the high <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> <b>rates.</b> Desired/required spacecraft equipment performance is measured confirmed during factory testing, however equipment usable/mission life requirement is not measured but calculated manually and so the spacecraft and launch vehicle equipment that will fail prematurely are not identified and replaced before use. Spacecraft equipment mission-life is calculated using stochastic equations from probability reliability analysis engineering standards such as MIL STD 217. The change in the engineering practices used to manufacture and test spacecraft to identify the equipment that will fail prematurely include using a prognostic and health management (PHM) program. The PHM includes using predictive algorithms to convert equipment analog telemetry of any type into a measurement of equipment usable life by demodulating the telemetry behavior in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. The conversion of equipment analog telemetry from performance data to a measurement of usable life is done in a prognostic analysis. A prognostic analysis includes an engineering analysis that is shared with manufacturing and test, but results in <b>premature</b> equipment <b>failures</b> at <b>rates</b> as high as 70 % once the equipment gets to space in space, but also includes a scientific analysis of the analog telemetry so that conjecture and speculation is not used to identify the presence as systemic noise...|$|R

Large, complex aerospace systems such as aircraft, launch vehicle and satellites are first subjected to most exhaustive and comprehensive acceptance testing program used in any industry and yet suffer from the highest <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> <b>rates.</b> Desired/required spacecraft equipment performance is confirmed during factory testing using telemetry, however equipment mission life requirement is not measured but calculated manually and so the equipment that will fail prematurely are not identified and replaced before use.

40|$|With {{substantial}} {{operating hours}} on the RF system, considerable information on reliability of the 5 kW CW klystrons has been obtained. High early <b>failure</b> <b>rates</b> led to examination of the operating conditions and failure modes. Internal ceramic contamination caused <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of gun potting material and ultimate tube demise through arcing or ceramic fracture. A planned course of reporting and reconditioning of approximately 300 klystrons, plus careful attention to operating conditions and periodic analysis of operational data, has substantially reduced the <b>failure</b> <b>rate.</b> It is anticipated that implementation of planned supplemental monitoring systems for the klystrons will allow most catastrophic failures to be avoided. By predicting end of life, tubes can be changed out before they fail, thus minimizing unplanned downtime. Initial tests have also been conducted on this same klystron operated at higher voltages with resultant higher output power. The outcome of these tests will provide information {{to be considered for}} future upgrades to the accelerator...|$|R

40|$|The failure {{sequence}} following {{crack formation}} in a chevron-notched four-point bend 1 specimen is examined in a parametric study using the Bluhm slice synthesis model. <b>Premature</b> <b>failure</b> resulting from crack formation forces which exceed those required to propagate a crack beyond alpha (min) is examined {{together with the}} critical crack length and critical crack front length. An energy based approach is used to establish factors which forecast the tendency of such <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> due to crack formation for any selected chevron-notched geometry. A comparative study reveals that, for constant values of alpha (1) and alpha (0), the dimensionless beam compliance and stress intensity factor are essentially independent of specimen width and thickness. The chevron tip position, alpha (0) has its primary effect on the force required to initiate a sharp crack. Small values for alpha (0) maximize the stable region length, however, the <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> tendency is also high for smaller alpha (0) values. Improvements in <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> resistance can be realized for larger values of alpha (0) with only a minor reduction in the stable region length. The stable region length is also maximized for larger chevron based positions, alpha (1) but the chance for <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> is also raised. Smaller base positions improve the <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> resistance with only minor decreases in the stable region length.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to review the {{performance}} of plate bonded flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete beams. This paper also describes the methods and materials used for flexural and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams and weaknesses of plate bonded systems. The plate bonding method often has some serious <b>premature</b> debonding <b>failure</b> which can be classified as plate end debonding (end peeling), tension delamination and <b>premature</b> shear <b>failure</b> due to insufficient shear reinforcement. <b>Premature</b> <b>failures</b> must be prevented in order to utilize the full flexural capacity of flexural strengthened reinforced concrete beams. <b>Premature</b> shear <b>failure</b> {{is one of the major}} concerns of the flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams.

But {{depending upon the}} exposure conditions, the <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> may {{takes place in the}} structures and it may affect its service life span too. The <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the RCC structures occurs due to corrosion of the reinforcement, spalling/cracking of the {{reinforced concrete}}, improper design, improper construction, chemical ingress, etc. The corrosion of the reinforcement is the major factor behind the <b>premature</b> <b>failure.</b> This paper describes the effect of age-related deterioration (corrosion) and spalling/cracking on the structural performance of the reinforced concrete members in probabilistic terms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} comprehensive {{data and}} their interpretation {{on the plate}} bonding repair technique in terms of effects of plate thickness and end anchorage on ductility, ultimate load, and mode of failure. Reinforced concrete (RC) beams were preloaded to 85 percent of their ultimate capacity and subsequently repaired by bonding steel plates of different thicknesses with and without end anchorages. Anchor bolts were used for end anchorages. The repaired beams showed higher strength than the original beams, provided the plates did not exceed a certain limiting thickness. Increasing the plate thickness changed the mode of failure of the repaired beams from flexural to <b>premature</b> <b>failure,</b> developed due to shear and/or tearing of the plate, causing a reduction in ductility. End anchorages to the bonded plates could not prevent the <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the beams but improved ductility with decreasing significance as the plate thickness increased, and yielded a marginal improvement in ultimate strength. A procedure for designing the bonding plate to avoid <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of an {{aluminium}} injection {{die with}} a duplex surface treatment (plasma nitriding and {{physical vapor deposition}} coating) was investigated, {{in an effort to}} identify the causes of such <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of the component. The manufacturing and the operating conditions were documented. Analytical tools were used, including scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray capability, X-ray diffraction, and instrumented microhardness testing. Preliminary observations showed a microstructure of coarse tempered martensite, and a considerably rough surface with porosity and cracks. A detailed analysis of crack initiation sites identified sulfur inclusions in the subsurface, underneath the coating. A further revision of the processing conditions revealed that a sulfur-impregnated grinding stone had been used to polish the die. The chemical composition of such grinding stone matched that of the inclusions found in the subsurface of the failed component. Thus, searched causes of <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> could be discussed on the lights of the present findings...|$|R

Recreating aesthetics and function are the two practical goals of such restorative treatment. However, the <b>failure</b> <b>rate</b> of ceramic prostheses is relatively high due to their inherent brittleness. A primary reason to <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> of ceramic prostheses is surface and subsurface damage induced in dental intraoral finishing using dental handpieces and abrasive burs. In this paper, finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to predict quantitatively finishing-induced stress fields and subsurface damage depths in dental porcelain surfaces using fine grit diamond burs. The results indicate that while finishing using fine diamond burs diminished subsurface damage, damage depths of smaller than 20 µm remained depending on the bur depth of cut and feed rate. In the FEA modeling, the minimum damage was obtained under very fine finishing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Thermal cycling {{durability}} of Plastic {{ball grid array}} (PBGA) interconnects is known to decrease as I/O count increases. This is due, in part, to mechanistic effects; such as increasing thermal expansion mismatches between component and PWB, due to increasing package sizes. Failure prediction due to these mechanistic effects is a deterministic process {{and is based on}} the load level found in the critical joint (joint with the most severe loading). However, due to probabilistic effects, for example manufacturing variabilities, <b>premature</b> <b>failure</b> may result in one of several joints in the neighborhood of the critical one. Failure probability increases as the number of joints in this critical region increases. Thus, observed <b>failure</b> <b>rates</b> are due to a convolution of deterministic and probabilistic effects. In effect, for large BGAs, deterministic predictions may overestimate interconnect durability. This thesis uses thermal cycling experiments and detailed mechanistic modeling to present a methodology for adjusting deterministic predictions of solder joint failure with a suitable probabilistic correction factor...|$|R
