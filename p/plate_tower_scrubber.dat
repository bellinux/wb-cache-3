5000|$|Scrubbers which {{utilized}} {{water were}} {{designed in the}} 25 years after {{the foundation of the}} industry. It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon {{the way in which the}} gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the <b>Tower</b> <b>Scrubber.</b> This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or weak gas liquor, trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted. The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The <b>Tower</b> <b>Scrubber</b> and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.|$|R
5000|$|Spray towers can be {{used for}} gas absorption, but they are not as {{effective}} as packed or <b>plate</b> <b>towers.</b> Spray towers can be very effective in removing pollutants if the pollutants are highly soluble or if a chemical reagent is added to the liquid.|$|R
30|$|Following the cyclones, the hot syngas is {{routed through}} a quench venturi {{scrubber}} system to cool and scrub any remaining particulates, condensable organic particulate contaminants, gases, and other contaminants. First, hot syngas from the cyclones is {{passed through a}} series of water-spray quench vessels, which cool the syngas and coagulate and remove the bulk of micro-particles and contaminants. The cooled syngas then passes through a venturi scrubber to remove particles down to 0.5 – 1  µm in size. The syngas is next routed through an optional air cooler and then into a vertical packed-bed <b>tower</b> <b>scrubber</b> system.|$|R

50|$|They are {{the most}} widely used {{scrubbers}} because their open construction enables them to remove most particles without plugging or scalding. Venturis {{can also be used to}} absorb pollutant gases; however, they are not as efficient for this as are packed or <b>plate</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} that remove {{gaseous pollutants}} {{are referred to}} as absorbers. Good gas-to-liquid contact is essential to obtain high removal efficiencies in absorbers. Various wet-scrubber designs are used to remove gaseous pollutants, with the packed <b>tower</b> and the <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> being the most common.|$|R

5000|$|The crib was {{transported to}} the site from Amherstburg, Ontario. It was built pre-fabricated 45 by 18 ft, sunk in 22 ft of water, filled with {{concrete}} and surrounded by a granite pier. The light station pier is shaped like a vessel. Its pointed end is directed toward {{the mouth of the}} river to break river-powered ice floes. Above the crib and pier, the 49 ft high cast iron boiler <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> is 22 ft in diameter at its base and 18 ft at the top.

The lower two stories are shaped like a stylized octagon with four flat and four curved sides. The upper story and cupola are circular. Each floor has three 15" [...] port lights; in addition, the first story has a door, the second holes that once held the resonator horns, and the third a smaller port light. The cupola {{is approximately}} 3 feet in diameter, and sits atop the upper story surrounded by a circular open-air gallery.|$|R
5000|$|To promote maximum gas-liquid {{surface area}} and {{residence}} time, {{a number of}} wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray <b>towers,</b> venturis, <b>plate</b> <b>towers,</b> and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently {{with respect to the}} liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent [...] removal than other absorber designs.|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of spray <b>towers</b> over other <b>scrubbers</b> is their completely open design; {{they have no}} internal parts except for the spray nozzles. This feature eliminates many of the scale buildup and plugging problems associated with other scrubbers. The primary maintenance problems are spray-nozzle plugging or eroding, especially when using recycled scrubber liquid. To reduce these problems, a settling or filtration system is used to remove abrasive particles from the recycled scrubbing liquid before pumping {{it back into the}} nozzles.|$|R
40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions and nonexplosive (storage) containers, and shipping and packing materials (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: Incinerator for the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk containers, shells, and bombs; and Dunnage incinerator for the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a quench <b>tower,</b> venturi <b>scrubber,</b> <b>scrubber</b> <b>tower,</b> demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U. S. sites after the incinerators begin to work was estimated in the 1988 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to be from 11 months (at Lexington-Blue Grass Arm...|$|R
5000|$|The {{flue gas}} system uses the boiler exhaust as its source, {{so it is}} {{important}} that the fuel/air ratio in the boiler burners is properly regulated to ensure that high quality inert gas is produced. Too much air would result in an oxygen content exceeding 5%, too much fuel oil would result in carryover of dangerous hydrocarbon gas. The flue gas is cleaned and cooled by the <b>scrubber</b> <b>tower.</b> Various safety devices prevent overpressure, return of hydrocarbon gas to the engine room, or supply of IG with too high oxygen content.|$|R

40|$|Deodorization and {{volatile}} organic compound abatement from polluted air streams can be accomplished with the biological <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> (BPT), which {{has proved to be}} a reliable alternative to biofilters and biotrickling filters. Unlike those, the BPT is a non-clogging device, with constant active surface, and steady performance, making it ideal for scale-up and modelling. The initial BPT design needed improvement for better performance. The cylindrical body (circular plates) was replaced by a rectangular cuboid (rectangular plates). Holes in the plates did augment the amount of active biomass (hanging from the holes and under the plates), without reducing the transfer of toluene from the gaseous to the liquid phase. The diminished distance between plates was well tolerated in cocurrent flow, allowing much higher quantities of biomass in the same reactor volume. With 18 and 14 mm spacing between adjacent plates, the BPT, with and without holes, was tested for flooding, holdup and pressure drop. Several gas and liquid flows were tested, both in co-current and countercurrent. In hydrodynamic terms, the BPT-HB with co-current flow was clearly the best option. Higher stability with higher flow rates, and lower pressure drops were observed. The inoculum was obtained from wastewater plant activated sludge (petrochemical industry) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to devise techniques which would reduce acid gases like CO 2, H 2 S and other sulphoric components arising from the combustion of fossil fuels, present in natural gas, industrial gas and domestic processes effluent gas. They {{may have to be}} removed from the gas streams for environmental, economical and operational reasons. Efficient and flexible technologies capable to remove acid gases are needed operating over a wide range of concentration levels and a wide range of volumetric flow rates. Conventional industrial methods to reduce acid gases employ gas absorption devices like packed towers, spray <b>towers,</b> venture <b>scrubbers,</b> bubble column etc. In these devices gas-liquid contacting is achieved by dispersing the gas phase in the liquid phase to obtain large contact areas thereby increasing the mass transfer rate. Even though these contacting methods are very popular in industry they have several drawbacks such as difficulty of obtaining an accurate estimate of the gas-liquid mass transfer area and a limited range of gas and liquid flow rates due to operational problems...|$|R
40|$|Butadiene 1 : 3 is {{separated}} from other C 4 -hydrocarbons by extractive distillation in a sieve <b>plate</b> <b>tower.</b> Prior to the development work to be described, the pressure in the extraction tower was controlled at a fixed value. The tower pressure-boilup control loop did not behave satisfactorily {{in the presence of}} non-condensables which entered with the feed. The capacity of the flooded reflux drum condenser for the tower was limiting production during summer months. The tower pressure control loop was put on manual. The pressure was allowed to drop to its lowest attainable value for the existing conditions of boilup and condenser cooling capability. This manner of operation is known as floating pressure control. By taking advantage of the higher relative volatility at the lower tower pressure, energy usage was reduced and there was an increase in production capacity. The tower operation at a lower temperature reduced tower and reboiler fouling. Substantial savings have resulted from these improvements. The annual energy consumption has been reduced by 25 % and maximum productive capacity is higher by 15 %. The rate of tower and reboiler fouling has not been fully quantified but is greatly reduced. A more stable tower operation has also contributed to higher productivity and reduced energy usage. Venting of non-condensables does not affect tower stability and the operators have adapted well to the new control strategy...|$|R
