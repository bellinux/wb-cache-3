500|$|In {{comparing}} Olivier and {{the other}} leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, [...] "It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor. There is simply {{no such thing as}} a greatest actor, or painter or composer". Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers. Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession, thought Richardson the greater actor. Others, such as the critic Michael Coveney, awarded the <b>palm</b> <b>to</b> Gielgud. Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, [...] "the supreme man of the theatre of our time", pioneering Britain's National Theatre. As Bragg identified, [...] "no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument".|$|E

500|$|In 1990 the Church of Scientology {{released}} a document, {{said to be}} a copy of Hubbard's official record of service, to support its assertion that Hubbard had been awarded 21 medals and decorations.

[...] Among the other awards listed on the record released by the Church is the British Victory Medal, an award issued for service in the British armed forces in the First World War and that was never awarded by itself. The Church's document also credits Hubbard with a Purple Heart with a Palm, implying two wounds received in action. However, the U.S. Navy uses gold and silver stars, not a <b>palm,</b> <b>to</b> indicate multiple wounds. The Church has distributed a photograph of medals said to have been won by Hubbard; two of the medals were not even created until after Hubbard left active service.|$|E

[...] Clear-cutting, burning, and logging have modified the island’s vegetation. [...] Seed stock for species once present on the island no longer exists locally. [...] Fire allowed resistant species (e.g., thatch <b>palm)</b> <b>to</b> dominate, and logging left stock for a future forest canopy dominated by softwoods (e.g., loblolly pine, blolly, and Geiger tree).

2500|$|Many signs have metaphoric {{mappings}} {{as well as}} iconic or metonymic ones. For {{these signs}} there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is [...] "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open <b>palm</b> <b>to</b> the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as [...] "double mapped".|$|E

In ceremonial magic, the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either <b>palm</b> <b>to</b> palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a T shape. After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.|$|E

2500|$|The Casa de Cultura Jesús Reyes Heroles {{is located}} on Francisco Sosa, named after a {{historian}} and political scientist from Veracruz. The house is on a property, which was called Izotitlán, meaning “izotes” a type of wild <b>palm</b> <b>to</b> make hats. In the colonial period, the house belonged to Juan de Luis Celis who had a small paper factory. [...] It changed hands several times by the 20th century, but all this time, the structure kept its original appearance including very old atrium cross in the first courtyard. In the 1940s, it was enlarged, but its colonial style was respected. The building gained its current function in 1985, when President Miguel de la Madrid donated the house and lands to create a cultural center. [...] Today, the center has three art galleries, named after Alfredo Ramos Martinez, Guillermo Kahlo and Miguel Alvarez Acosta to house temporary exhibits, an area to teach the culinary arts and two multiuse rooms. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the Casa de Cultura Jesús Reyes Heroles was inhabited by María Concepción Armida, who is being considered for beatification by the Catholic Church. It is said that she performed a number of miracles in this house. Behind this house is the Callejón del Aguacate, which is said to be haunted by the ghost associated with the woman, and local school children are known to go looking for the ghost.|$|E
