A pulp filtrate of model stickies led to deposition according to the proportion of stickies-containing pulp in the mixture. Other mixtures of pulps, however, led to deposition that differed from the predicted value. It is theorised that pulp fibres present in the mixture could adsorb the polysaccharides that would otherwise keep the colloidal system electrostatically stable. This destabilisation was most prominent at lower proportions of the stickies-free pulp suspensions used for mixing. These results show that care must be taken when mixing different pulps for paper and board production, as even a small amount of replacement pulp can lead to destabilisation of DCM and formation of deposits. Furthermore, special care must be taken when mixtures of pulps are used to validate stickies measurements...|$|R

In the theoretical part of this work are summarized previously used methods of hydrolysis and lignocellulosic materials used for the process of hydrolysis as a source of fermentable sugars for fermentation technology. The different types of waste paper are evaluated from the composition and usability with consideration to the papermaking process in order to select the appropriate type of waste paper for the enzymatic hydrolysis process. In the next part of this work are suggested technological premises and procedures for the preparation of raw materials and the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of these pre–treated materials. In the experimental part were optimized parameters of enzymatic hydrolysis using the Novozymes company enzyme package. Enzymatic degradation of cellulose to reducing sugars was observed using Somogyi – Nelson method. For the verification of hydrolysis conditions were used model materials with high cellulose content – <b>pulp</b> and <b>filter</b> paper. Conditions, which seems to be the best after testing on the model materials, were verified on specific waste paper materials – offset cardboard, recycled paper, matte MYsol paper and for comparison again on model materials – <b>pulp</b> and <b>filter</b> paper.

Due to the rod-like {{shape of the}} nanocrystals, these aqueous suspensions display liquid crystalline behaviour. This thesis examines these unique suspensions at three different concentration ranges. At low cellulose concentrations the suspensions are disordered, becoming ordered upon reaching a critical concentration, which depends on the aspect ratio of the rods. AFM and TEM were used to characterize particle size and polydispersity. Just beyond the critical concentration for anisotropic phase formation is an intermediate concentration range in which the isotropic and anisotropic phases co-exist. This biphasic region was examined for its potential to partition dextran molecules. At extremely high cellulose concentrations, solid cellulose films that maintain some chiral nematic order may be obtained. The degree of order in the films has been measured using induced circular dichroism and optimized by magnetic alignment.

Orange juice inoculated with E. coli (106 CFU mL- 1) as a challenge microorganism was treated with ozone at 75 - 78 µg mL- 1 for different time periods (0 - 18 min). The efficacy of ozone for inactivation of both strains of E. coli was evaluated {{as a function of}} different juice types: model orange juice, fresh unfiltered juice, juice without <b>pulp,</b> and juice <b>filtered</b> through 500 mm or 1 mm sieves. Fast inactivation rates for total reduction of E. coli were achieved in model orange juice (60 seconds) and in juice with low pulp content (6 min). However, in unfiltered juice inactivation was achieved after 15 - 18 min. This indicated that juice organic matter interferes with antibacterial activity of gaseous ozone. The effect of prior acid (pH 5. 0) exposure of E. coli strains on the inactivation efficacy of ozone treatment was also investigated. There was a strain effect observed, where prior acid exposure resulted in higher inactivation times in some cases by comparison with the control cells.

Chlorhexidine {{is the most common}} ingredient in mouthwash so we can use it as a gold standard to compare the effects of new products. Garlic is a strong antimicrobial agent and acts as an inhibitor on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Objectives: The present study was conducted to compare the effect that garlic juice and Chlorhexidine mouthwash has on oral pathogens. Materials and Methods: Fresh garlic bulbs were used to extract the antibacterial juice. The yellow juice was separated from the <b>pulp</b> with Whatman <b>filter</b> paper. After filtration the liquid was freeze dried and stored at 4 °C until required. The bacteria that were tested were: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei. After cultivation of the bacteria, the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the garlic juice and Chlorhexidine were measured using the E-test method, then the Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of the Chlorhexidine and garlic juice were measured by tube test. Results: The lowest MIC of garlic juice was for S. mutans 0. 25 µg/mL and the highest was for L. casei 2. 5 µg/mL. The MIC of Chlorhexidine for these two bacteria was 0. 62 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL respectively. The MBC of Chlorhexidine and garlic for S. mutans had the lowest concentration compared with the other tested bacteria. The MBC of Chlorhexidine and garlic for S. mutans was 0. 35 μg/mL and 0. 3 µg/mL respectively. The highest MBC of Chlorhexidine was for S. salivarius 10 µg/mL. The MBC of garlic for S. sanguis was similar at 10. 4 µg/mL. Conclusions: The efficacy of garlic juice was higher than Chlorhexidine against target bacteria and could be used as an effective mouthwash, but its side effects need to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} water {{available}} is usually restricted, {{which leads to a}} situation where a complete understanding of the process, including water circulations and the influence of water components, is essential. The main aim of this thesis was to clarify the possibilities for the efficient use of residual peroxide by means of water circulation rearrangements. Rearranging water circulations and the reduction of water usage may cause new problems, such as metal induced peroxide decomposition that needs to be addressed. This thesis introduces theoretical methods of water circulations to combine two variables; effective utilization of residual peroxide and avoiding manganese in the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. Results are mainly based on laboratory and mill site experiments concerning the utilization of residual peroxide. A simulation model (BALAS) was used to evaluate the manganese contents and residual peroxide doses. It was shown that with optimum recirculation of residual peroxide the brightness can be improved or chemical costs can be decreased. From the scientific perspective, it was also very important to discover that recycled peroxide was more effective pre-bleaching agent compared to fresh peroxide. This can be due to the organic acids i. e. per acetic acid in wash press filtrate that have been formed in alkaline bleaching stage. Even short retention time was adequate and the activation of residual peroxide using sodium hydroxide was not necessary. There are several possibilities for using residual peroxide in practice regarding bleaching. A typical modern mechanical pulping process line consist of defibering, screening, a disc filter, a bleach press, high consistency (HC) peroxide bleaching and a wash press. Furthermore there usually is not a particular medium consistency (MC) pre-bleaching stage that includes additional thickening equipment. The most advisable way to utilize residual peroxide in this kind of process is to recycle the wash press filtrate to the dilution of disc <b>filter</b> <b>pulp</b> (low MC pre-bleaching stage). An arrangement such as this would be beneficial in terms of the reduced convection of manganese to the alkaline bleaching stage. Manganese originates from wood material and will be removed to the water phase already {{in the early stages of}} the process. Recycling residual peroxide prior to the disc filter is not recommended because of low consistencies. Regarding water circulations, the novel point of view is that, it would be beneficial to divide water circulations into two sections and the critical location for the division is the disc filter. Both of these two sections have their own priority. Section one before the disc filter: manganese removal. Section two after the disc filter: brightening of pulp. This division can be carried out if the disc <b>filter</b> <b>pulp</b> is diluted only by wash press filtrate before the MC storage tower. The situation is even better if there is an additional press after the disc filter, which will improve the consistency of the pulp. This has a significant effect on the peroxide concentration in the MC pre-bleaching stage. In terms of manganese content, it is essential to avoid the use of disc filter filtrate in the bleach press and wash press showers. An additional cut-off press would also be beneficial for manganese removal. As a combination of higher initial brightness and lower manganese content, the typical brightness increase varies between approximately 0. 5 and 1 % ISO units after the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. This improvement does not seem to be remarkable, but as it is generally known, the final brightness unit is the most expensive and difficult to achieve. The estimation of cost savings is not unambiguous. For example in GW/TMP mill case 0. 6 % ISO units higher final brightness gave 10 % savings in the costs of bleaching chemicals. With an hypothetical 200 000 ton annual production, this means that the mill could save in the costs of bleaching chemicals more than 400 000 euros per year. In general, it can be said that there were no differences between the behavior of different types of processes (GW, PGW, TMP and BCTMP). The enhancement of recycling gave a similar response in all cases. However, we have to remember that the utilization of residual peroxide in older mills depends a great deal on the process equipment, the {{amount of water}} available and existing pipeline connections. In summary, it can be said that processes are individual and the same solutions cannot be applied to all cases...|$|R
40|$|A maior parte da energia consumida no planeta provÃÂm dos combustÃÂveis fÃÂsseis (petrÃÂleo, carvÃÂo e gÃÂs natural), que se constituem em fontes de energia nÃÂo-renovÃÂveis e limitadas. Neste cenÃÂrio, o desenvolvimento e a procura por fontes alternativas de energia se tornam, a cada dia, mais relevantes. Este trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} avaliar as diferenÃÂas entre as emissÃÂes de poluentes inorgÃÂnicos e orgÃÂnicos do biodiesel de soja e do biodiesel produzido pelas blendas de sebo bovino (62 %) e soja (38 %), e de suas misturas com o diesel mineral em diferentes proporÃÂÃÂes volumÃÂtricas (B 0, B 5, B 20, B 50 e B 100). Para realizaÃÂÃÂo dos testes utilizou-se Diesel Interior tipo A, biodiesel de soja e biodiesel composto conjuntamente por soja (38 %) e sebo bovino (62 %) em motor de bancada com injeÃÂÃÂo direta e potÃÂncia de 7, 36 kW (10 cv), acoplado a um gerador de 5, 5 kW. Para avaliaÃÂÃÂo do desempenho do motor, determinou-se o consumo mÃÂssico, especÃÂfico e energÃÂtico para as diferentes misturas combustÃÂveis bem como a eficiÃÂncia de conversÃÂo do combustÃÂvel em energia, para as formulaÃÂÃÂes testadas. Para a avaliaÃÂÃÂo das emissÃÂes de combustÃÂo utilizou-se filtros de fibra de celulose para retenÃÂÃÂo e quantificaÃÂÃÂo de particulados, analisador automÃÂtico da marca Bacharach, modelo PCA 3, na amostragem e anÃÂlise de gases inorgÃÂnicos e amostragem ativa com concentraÃÂÃÂo para coleta de gases orgÃÂnicos (BTEX), conforme o mÃÂtodo TO 17 da USEPA, o qual prescreve o uso de resinas adsorventes para captura de compostos de natureza orgÃÂnica. O mÃÂtodo de anÃÂlise dos gases orgÃÂnicos compreendeu o uso de cromatÃÂgrafo a gÃÂs, acoplado a uma unidade de dessorÃÂÃÂo tÃÂrmica (ATD) e de um detector de ionizaÃÂÃÂo de chama (DIC). Os resultados obtidos indicaram que nÃÂo houve diferenÃÂa estatÃÂstica entre os consumos especÃÂficos do diesel e dos biodiesel utilizados, que o consumo energÃÂtico do diesel foi levemente maior que o dos biodiesel usados e que a eficiÃÂncia de conversÃÂo do combustÃÂvel em energia aumentou quando se forneceu maior carga ao motor e conforme se adicionou biodiesel ao diesel. Quanto ÃÂs emissÃÂes de material particulado, verificou-se que a concentraÃÂÃÂo mÃÂssica retida em filtro foi cerca de 50 % menor com o uso do biodiesel, para as duas condiÃÂÃÂes de carga aplicadas (0, 5 kW e 1, 5 kW). Obteve-se uma reduÃÂÃÂo nas emissÃÂes de CO com o uso do biodiesel de soja (BS 100) de 48 %, 55 % e 46 % sob as cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. JÃÂ em relaÃÂÃÂo ao uso do biodiesel de gordura animal (BG 100) os resultados levaram a uma reduÃÂÃÂo de 65 % sob a carga de 0, 5 kW e 66 % para as cargas de 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW. Para o SO 2 os percentuais de reduÃÂÃÂo foram de 72 %, 73 % e 80 % para o B 100, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. JÃÂ com o BG 100, conseguiu-se reduÃÂÃÂes da ordem de 80 % (para a carga de 0, 5 kW) e 76 % (para as cargas de 1, 0 e 1, 5 kW), em relaÃÂÃÂo ao diesel. As emissÃÂes de NOx aumentaram em condiÃÂÃÂes de carga mais elevada. As maiores concentraÃÂÃÂes foram verificadas para o BG 100, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW e 1, 0 kW (46 % e 57 % maiores, respectivamente, comparativamente ao petrodiesel). As emissÃÂes de BTEX apresentaram significativa reduÃÂÃÂo, em relaÃÂÃÂo ao diesel, quando do uso dos biodiesel puro. Tais reduÃÂÃÂes foram da ordem de 80 % (em 0, 5 kW), 68 % (em 1, 0 kW) e 37 % (em 1, 5 kW) com o uso do BS 100. Para o BG 100, as reduÃÂÃÂes totais de BTEX foram de 95 %, 85 % e 73 %, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. Concluiu-se que o uso do biodiesel puro em motor gerador apresentou vantagens ambientais, pois promoveu a reduÃÂÃÂo de uma grande quantidade de gases poluentes lanÃÂados ÃÂ atmosfera e nÃÂo comprometeu, de forma significativa, o desempenho (consumo especÃÂfico e eficiÃÂncia) do motor. Sugere-se, para trabalhos futuros, que sejam realizadas tambÃÂm avaliaÃÂÃÂes da engenharia do motor gerador para se determinar quais fatores mecÃÂnicos induzem a um aumento / reduÃÂÃÂo das emissÃÂes quando do emprego do biodiesel como combustÃÂvel. Most of {{the energy}} consumed on the planet comes from fossil fuels, which {{are a source of}} non-renewable energy, and with limited forecasting future depletion. In this scenario, the development and demand for alternative energy sources become relevant. This study aimed to evaluate the differences of pollutant emissions from soybean and tallow beef biodiesel and their blend with diesel (B 0, B 5, B 20, B 50 and B 100). To perform the tests we used Diesel Interior Type A, soybean biodiesel and beef tallow biodiesel in a diesel engine with direct injection and power of 7. 36 kW (10 hp) coupled to a generator of 5. 5 kW. To evaluate the performance of the engine was determined the mass consumption, brake specific fuel consumption and energetic consumption to the various fuel blends as well. The efficiency of conversion of each fuel in energy was also determined. For the evaluation of particulate matter we used a <b>pulp</b> fiber <b>filter.</b> The exhaust emissions of inorganic gases have been performed by a Bacharach portable gas analyzer. The BTEX were sampled according to the method TO- 17 of USEPA, which prescribes the use of adsorbent resin for the capture of organic gases. The method of BTEX analysis included the use of gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a thermal desorption unit (ATD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The results indicated that there was no statistical difference between the specific consumption of diesel and biodiesel used, the energy consumption of diesel was slightly higher than that of biodiesel used and the efficiency of conversion of fuel to energy increased when provided greater load as if the engine and biodiesel added to diesel. Regarding the emissions of particulate material, {{it was found that the}} concentration by weight retained on filter was about 50 % lower with the use of biodiesel, for both loading conditions applied (0. 5 kW and 1. 5 kW). CO emissions decrease with the use of soybean biodiesel (BS 100) about 48 %, 55 % and 46 % under loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW, respectively. In relation to the use of biodiesel animal fat (BG 100) results led to a reduction of 65 % under the load of 0. 5 kW and 66 % for loads of 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW. SO 2 reduction percentages were 72 %, 73 % and 80 % for B 100, in loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW respectively. Already, with the BG 100 was achieved by reductions of 80 % (for the 0. 5 kW load) and 76 % (for loads of 1. 0 and 1. 5 kW) compared to diesel. NOx emissions increased in higher load conditions. The highest concentrations were observed for BG 100, in loads of 0. 5 kW and 1. 0 kW (46 % and 57 % higher, respectively, compared to petrodiesel). The emissions reported significant reduction in BTEX, in relation to diesel, when the use of pure biodiesel. Such reductions were approximately 80 % (0. 5 kW), 68 % (at 1. 0 kW) and 37 % (1. 5 kW) using the BS 100. For the BG 100, the reductions of total BTEX were 95 %, 85 % and 73 % under loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW, respectively. It was concluded that the use of biodiesel in motor generator showed environmental advantages, since promoted reduction of a large quantity of polluting gases released to the atmosphere and did not affect significantly the performance (specific consumption and efficiency) of the engine. It is suggested for future work, which are also held engineering evaluations engine generator to determine which mechanical factors induce an increase / decrease in emissions when the use of biodiesel as a fuel...|$|R
40|$|The dessert banana is {{the most}} popular fruit {{worldwide}} in terms of export. And ACP countries have fought bitterly to retain their commercial advantage in the European market, since access is crucial to the economic development of their rural areas. Even so, exports only account for 13 % of the 70 million t of dessert bananas produced worldwide. The remaining 87 % are consumed locally. Sweet bananas aside, a further 30 million t of cooking bananas or plantains are produced each year for the domestic market. Bananas therefore {{play a key role in}} the economy and food security of producer countries. But other parts of the banana tree may also be used and the by-products sold on local or overseas markets. In ACP regions, countries are constantly researching, developing and inventing new uses, because nothing goes to waste in the banana tree. Drinking bananas with and without moderation Extending the banana s shelf-life Every last bit has its use, but not for long. The fruit is sensitive to heat and is highly perishable. More than one-quarter of total output is estimated to be lost in this way each year. In Ghana and Papua New Guinea for example, production rates exceed local demand, but the poor state of the roads makes it difficult to supply markets in the surrounding towns with sufficient speed. However, when the dessert bananas or plantains are processed into flour, dried fruit or chips, the shelf-life increases from 2 weeks to more than 6 months or even a year. Such products can replace wheat flour and potato chips, both of which are often imported. In the Pacific islands of Samoa, plantain varieties make excellent savoury chips. In South Africa, for the past 30 years a company in Mpumalanga, 400 km from Johannesburg, has been processing 10 % of its output into dried bananas (cubes and slices) for sale to local schools. As for the banana skins, these provide free fodder for pigs. In Uganda, a banana processing company specialises in using solar power to dry the fruit in 2 or 3 days. It makes the dryers and sells them on credit for US$ 200 (165) per unit to their producers, after first training them on how to use it. Realising that production and processing are inextricably linked, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP) worked between 2002 and 2004 to select the species of bananas that would be most amenable to these various processing techniques. Drinking bananas with and without moderation Overripe sweet bananas can be made into pulp or drinks. In Fiji, the fruit is squeezed and the <b>pulp</b> is then <b>filtered</b> and enriched with vitamin C to prevent it from darkening. The product is sent by container to manufacturers of infant foods, ice creams and confectionery. In West Africa and elsewhere, small firms are successfully marketing pure banana juice, selling it by the glass in the street or in 500 ml bottles in the shops. Banana wine is very popular throughout East Africa. In Tanzania, bananas are left to ferment between 15 and 60 days to produce a wine of 7 to 9 degrees proof. In Kenya, banana wine is considered a palatable substitute for the much stronger sugar cane-based alcohol. Using banana fibre Although both dessert and plantain bananas lend themselves to a range of processing techniques intended for human consumption, these only generate limited revenues. That is why other parts of the banana tree are also used. Women in Kenya s Maragua district make craft items from banana fibre and sell them on the market. They take the broad base of the leaves which more or less enclose the pseudostem of the banana tree and which conceal fibres roughly 90 cm long, these are then dried, treated and plaited. The women offer tablemats, photograph frames, earrings and boxes as souvenirs, for sale to intermediaries who sell them in the market or on order, mainly to tourists. Each week, the women themselves harvest the leaves to ensure the finest quality, and extract some 50 kg of fibre. In Gabon, Haiti and Uganda, banana fibre is also used to make paper. The fibre is cut into 1 to 2 cm long pieces, mixed with ash and boiled for 8 h. The paste is then spread out as desired and dried, before being pressed to make it more uniform. Sold as sheets of paper, greeting or visiting cards, this paper can be found in craft shops throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world. Finally, the European association for composite materials, the JEC Group, has awarded an innovation prize to a company in the Philippines which is using banana fibre (Musa textilis) as a replacement for glass fibre in the lower bodywork of a top-range European car. According to the manufacturer, using this new fibre in the automobile industry could cut energy costs in production by 60 %. The fibres from this banana tree are more commonly used to make fabric and rope. Products which make use of banana fibre, a part of the banana tree deemed useless in the context of food production, may in future offer quality, economical and ecological alternatives. Photographic credit: R. Faidutti © FAO / 19323 It would be a mistake to let the banana overshadow the banana tree. For while the fruit lends itself to a variety of uses, the pseudostem and leaves can often also be made into innovative products. In the South, a number of countries are doing just that...|$|R
