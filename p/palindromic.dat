These exhibit Messiaen's {{use of his}} modes of limited transposition and <b>palindromic</b> rhythms (Messiaen called these non-retrogradable rhythms). His public début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite Les offrandes oubliées. That year he first heard a gamelan group, sparking {{his interest in the}} use of tuned percussion.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with <b>palindromic</b> structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palindromic</b> {{numbers are}} numbers that {{read the same}} when their digits are reversed. A Lychrel number is a {{positive}} integer that never yields a <b>palindromic</b> number when subjected to the iterative process of being added to itself with digits reversed. The question of whether there are any Lychrel numbers in base10 is an open problem in recreational mathematics; the smallest candidate is 196.|$|E

25|$|In 1902 Webern began {{attending}} {{classes at}} Vienna University. There he studied musicology with Guido Adler, writing his thesis on the Choralis Constantinus of Heinrich Isaac. This interest in early music would greatly influence his compositional technique in later years, especially {{in terms of}} his use of <b>palindromic</b> form on both the micro- and macro-scale and the economical use of musical materials.|$|E
25|$|Like most type II {{restriction}} enzymes, BglII {{consists of}} two identical subunits that form a homodimer around the DNA double helix. Each monomer is 223 amino acids and symmetrically bind {{both sides of the}} unique <b>palindromic</b> nucleotide sequence AGATCT, cleaving the scissile phosphodiester bond between the first Adenine and Guanine nucleotides on both strands of the DNA molecule, creating sticky ends with 5' end overhangs.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} LAGLIDADG endonucleases are homodimers (for example I-CreI, {{composed}} of two copies of the same protein domain) or internally symmetrical monomers (I-SceI). The DNA binding site, which contains the catalytic domain, is {{composed of two}} parts {{on either side of}} the cutting point. The half-binding sites can be extremely similar and bind to a <b>palindromic</b> or semi-palindromic DNA sequence (I-CreI), or they can be non-palindromic (I-SceI).|$|E
25|$|The {{coordinates}} {{of uniform}} 4-polytopes with pentachoric symmetry {{can be generated}} as permutations of simple integers in 5-space, all in hyperplanes with normal vector (1,1,1,1,1). The A4 Coxeter group is <b>palindromic,</b> so repeated polytopes exist in pairs of dual configurations. There are 3 symmetric positions, and 6 pairs making the total 15 permutations {{of one or more}} rings. All 15 are listed here in order of binary arithmetic for clarity of the coordinate generation from the rings in each corresponding Coxeter diagram.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{fractions}} {{can also}} be applied to problems in number theory, and are especially useful {{in the study of}} Diophantine equations. In the late eighteenth century Lagrange used continued fractions to construct the general solution of Pell's equation, thus answering a question that had fascinated mathematicians for more than a thousand years. Amazingly, Lagrange's discovery implies that the canonical continued fraction expansion of the square root of every non-square integer is periodic and that, if the period is of length p > 1, it contains a <b>palindromic</b> string of length p - 1.|$|E
25|$|String Quartet No. 1 (1951–52): is in two {{movement}}s, {{quick and}} slow; the second movement {{is a set}} of variations on a <b>palindromic</b> theme stated by the viola. There is a power-struggle by the opposed tonal centres of E flat and A: E flat is the focus of the first movement and beats off the challenge of A, the second movement theme starts and ends in E flat with a central climax in A; the variations work round to A major, in which key the work ends. The quartet is dedicated to George Enescu.|$|E
25|$|Restriction endonucleases, {{also known}} as {{restriction}} enzymes are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at specific nucleotides sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long. Studies performed by Horton and colleagues {{have shown that the}} mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as bending the DNA and the expansion of the minor groove. In 2006, Horton and colleagues, x-ray crystallography evidence was presented showing that the restriction endonuclease HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This enzyme is known to cleave the DNA at the <b>palindromic</b> tetranucleotide sequence G↓CGC.|$|E
25|$|He {{ordered the}} {{building}} of the New Town (Nové Město) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the <b>palindromic</b> number 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction. In 1347, he founded Charles University, which remains the oldest university in Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short <b>Palindromic</b> Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E
500|$|From his {{earliest}} works, Messiaen used non-retrogradable (<b>palindromic)</b> rhythms (Example 2). He sometimes combined rhythms with harmonic sequences {{in such a}} way that, if the process were repeated indefinitely, the music would eventually run through all possible permutations and return to its starting point. For Messiaen, this represented the [...] "charm of impossibilities" [...] of these processes. He only ever presented a portion of any such process, as if allowing the informed listener a glimpse of something eternal. In the first movement of Quatuor pour la fin du temps the piano and cello together provide an early example.|$|E

At that time the CRISPRs were described as segments of prokaryotic DNA containing short, repetitive base sequences. In a <b>palindromic</b> repeat, the sequence of nucleotides is the same in both directions. Each repetition is followed by short segments of spacer DNA from previous exposures to foreign DNA (e.g., a virus or plasmid). [...] Small clusters of cas (CRISPR-associated system) genes are located next to CRISPR sequences.|$|E

[...] As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid. [...] These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.|$|E

2500|$|Simpson {{composed}} 15 numbered string quartets; {{a quartet}} preceding this sequence was written {{as part of}} his course at Durham University and still exists there. He regarded Quartets Nos. 1-3 as forming a natural sequence, and Nos. 4-6 are a clearly distinct group related to three Beethoven quartets, though they can all be performed as entirely independent compositions. The second movement of No. 8 has the label Eretmapodites gilletti, and the quartet is dedicated to two people including the discoverer of the mosquito with that scientific name; the ninth quartet, from 1982, is a one-movement (but subdivided, with slow and scherzando sections) [...] <b>palindromic</b> 32 Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Haydn; Number 10 is entitled [...] "For Peace".

2500|$|... is subtitled 32 Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Haydn and was {{dedicated}} to the Delmé Quartet, who commissioned it, on their 20th anniversary, which was also the 250th anniversary {{of the birth of}} Haydn. At about 57 minutes' duration, {{it is one of the}} longest continuous movements for string quartet ever written. The theme is the <b>palindromic</b> minuet which Haydn used in his Symphony No. 47 and Piano Sonata No.26. Simpson had already composed a set of piano variations on this minuet in 1948, and three of those variations are transcribed as variations I-III of the quartet. The 32 quartet variations take Simpson's fascination with formal symmetry to a new extreme, though they are grouped to correspond to first movement, scherzo and slow movement. The free-form fugue forms the finale, gaining energy and speed as it proceeds.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, repeats were {{observed}} in the archaeal organisms of Haloferax and Haloarcula species, and their function was studied by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain. [...] Although his hypothesis {{turned out to be}} wrong, Mojica surmised {{at the time that the}} clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii.

[...] In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who was searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short <b>Palindromic</b> Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.|$|E
