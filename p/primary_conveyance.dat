50|$|The Carlton Trail {{was also}} an {{important}} route for the carts, running from the Red River Colony west to Fort Carlton and Fort Edmonton in present-day Saskatchewan and Alberta, with branches such as the Fort à la Corne Trail. The carts were the <b>primary</b> <b>conveyance</b> in the Canadian West from early settlement until {{the coming of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway {{toward the end of the}} century. Carts could not be used west of Fort Edmonton because there were no roads or trails passable by wheeled vehicles over the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses {{on the ability of}} media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together. We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is 1 Carol Saunders was the accepting senior editor for this paper. All authors contributed equally. composed of two <b>primary</b> processes: <b>conveyance</b> and conver-gence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes. Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better com-munication performance. For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance. We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful perfor-mance of conveyance and convergence communication processes. The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium...|$|R
40|$|While the map {{has long}} been the <b>primary</b> means of <b>conveyance</b> for {{geographical}} information, augmented reality is increasingly seen as a viable alternative because of its ability to present information from an intuitive perspective to the user. Within the realm of GIS, several examples of augmented reality apps already exist, but they are typically focused on answering a specific visualisation problem. This dissertation project aimed, instead, to produce a universal visualisation tool for geographical information in augmented reality, similar to how traditional GIS software is used in varying analytical and visualisation roles. A proof of concept android app was written using Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, Scotland as a case study area. This underwent user testing in the field. Results showed great value in computationally re-projecting geographical information onto the landscape in augmented reality versus a user attempting to do so with a 2 D map. Yet user opinion varied on which types of geographical information were most useful to visualise in augmented reality, supporting the need for a universal visualisation tool. Presenting geographical information in augmented reality has the enormous benefit of minimising the effort required to accurately translate information on to the landscape, thereby leaving users free to consider issues of analysis rather than issues of accurate translation...|$|R
