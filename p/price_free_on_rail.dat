40|$|Law of One Price (LOP) is {{important}} in the theory of international trade. It {{is important}} in LOP studies to have data that accurately represents homogeneous products (i. e., the product in one country has the same product characteristics as the product in another country). We present a theoretical model that determines fresh grapefruit <b>prices</b> <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> Board (FOB) at the packinghouse. The first order conditions show that the FOB packinghouse prices are equal for products with the same product characteristics. The theoretical conditions show a difference in FOB prices when the product characteristics are different. The product characteristics that are varied include packing costs and pack-out rates. The results from a nonlinear programming optimization routine demonstrates the importance of using data that accurately represents homogeneous products for LOP studies. Different packing costs and pack-out percentages are shown to cause different FOB packinghouse prices for fresh grapefruit destined for domestic and export markets.

40|$|Tomatoes are a {{high value}} crop in the United States market, {{especially}} {{during the winter months}} when the main suppliers are Florida and Mexico, and this has created conflict within the industry, off and on, for nearly 50 years. Literature points to imported tomatoes as the cause of lower prices in the United States market (ERS-USDA 2016). This thesis analyzes the effects of fresh tomato volumes both imported from Mexico and shipped from Florida on their shipping point prices and on terminal market prices in the United States. It also investigates the influence of the tomato suspension agreement on shipping point prices and on fresh tomato volumes in the United States, and to what extent temperature and precipitation have an impact on fresh tomatoes volumes. This analysis utilizes historical information of 18 years (1998 – 2015) of tomato volumes in the United States market, <b>prices</b> <b>free</b> <b>on</b> board (F. O. B.) for point of origin sales, prices of wholesale market sales at three main terminal markets, gas prices, weather patterns in the main tomato growing regions of Florida and Mexico, and the Tomato Suspension Agreement floor prices for Mexican tomatoes. The findings of this research show that the volume of Mexican tomatoes have no effect on shipping point prices of round tomatoes from Florida, and even more, neither affect the terminal market prices of round tomatoes from Florida at its main markets (New York and Chicago terminal markets). These findings contradict the accusations of Mexican tomatoes being dump in the market and lowering prices. The {{results of this study suggest}} that by utilizing different growing methods (greenhouses) the Mexican tomato industry has been able to control for temperature changes that can decimate tomato production acquiring a competitive advantage over Florida tomato production. Moreover, the findings suggest that the tomato suspension agreement floor prices affect in like manner volumes and prices of tomatoes from both Mexico and from Florida...|$|R

According to the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics [>i>Goskomstat>/i>], the general level of consumer prices rose 11 -fold between February 1991 and February 1992. Many enterprises are taking advantage of their dominant position in the market and are curtailing production, thereby increasing the shortage of products that are in demand. Shortages, in turn, have the property of raising prices on the basis of demand in order to attain equilibrium in the market. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to compare the demand and the price of hard red winter (HRW) wheat and white wheat (WW) to determine the similarities and the differences between these two wheat classes. Using Granger's causality test with average monthly cash <b>prices</b> and daily <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> Board (FOB) <b>prices,</b> it was determined that HRW adjustment instantaneously causes WW adjustment, and the WW instantaneously causes HRW adjustment. Over one-week periods, HRW causes WW adjustment, but not the reverse. The factors affecting domestic demand, foreign demand, and carry-over, for HRW and WW were determined. The coefficients of the three equations were estimated by Three-Stage Least Squares (3 SLS). It was shown that 1) the U.

We also show that the only arbitrage <b>free</b> <b>pricing</b> rules <b>on</b> the set of attainable contingent claims are those that are equal to the sum of an expected value with respect to any absolutely continuous martingale measure and of a bounded fixed cost functional.
