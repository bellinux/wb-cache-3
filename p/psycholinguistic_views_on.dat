40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{multimodal}} {{neural network model}} of child language acquisition at the one-word stage that is inspired by current views on brain processing which suggest that information in the brain is ultimately stored in a common amodal set of conceptual representations. Our model takes into account a child’s perceived communicative intention and simulates both ostensive and non-ostensive utterances using the same unsupervised network. This is contrary to some models of child language acquisition, and in line with current <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>views</b> <b>on</b> child language processing at the oneword stage. When trained on natural child language data, our model learns to categorise the speech utterances and to generalise to new utterances. In addition, our model exhibits a U-shaped learning trajectory {{as well as a}} vocabulary spurt, in agreement with observations made in studies of child language acquisition at the one-word stage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aphasiology {{developed}} in the 19 th century as a primary area of research for the localisatio n of function in the brain. It {{was based on a}} rather primitive notion of language as a psychological function: input and output of words, in particular nouns. Aphasiology turned into neurolinguistics {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, when researchers realised that a linguistically based theory should form the basis of the analysis of language performance deficits. Aims: The current paper argues that in a very early stage of aphasiology the claim was already formulated that a psycholinguistically oriented approach was necessary. This claim was made by Chajim Steinthal (1823 – 1893), but it was completely neglected. Main Contribution: In this paper, I will present Steinthal’s <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>views</b> <b>on</b> aphasia, described in his textbook on psycholinguistics in 1871. Conclusions: Steinthal formulated a psycholinguistically based theory of language disorders, in which a distinction was made between disorders at the word level and at the sentence level. Moreover, the nature of the deficit was a reduction of the capacity to activate representations and not a loss of word forms. Steinthal thus may be considered a founder not only of psycholinguistics, but also of neurolinguistics...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I review {{some of the}} {{theoretical}} issues surrounding metaphor, investigating the understanding of metaphor-based constructions from a developmental <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view.</b> Reviewing the classification of metaphorical expressions, I elaborate on the morphological aspect of idioms; thus on the typology of metaphors, distinguishing them {{on the basis of}} their decomposability and conventionality (Gibbs 1994). I hypothesize a new, mentalistic model of interpretation, in which our mentalizing, intention-reading skills play a key role in deciphering intended (figurative) meaning. Furthermore, I point out the importance of decomposability and conventionality determining our interpretative processes; both factors playing a facilitating role in interpretation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{interaction}} of the reader and the text and to discuss reading exercises which are useful for classroomr reading. For that purpose, the <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view</b> of reading and the theory of textual ties were reviewed. At the same time, EFL students' responses to a gap made in a cohesive chain of a text were analyzed for traces of interaction between the students and the text. The literature review and the analysis of the actual interaction revealed the crucial role of the reader's negotiation with textual constraints. Accordingly, the need for reading excercises focusing on textual constraints were proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I develop a {{protocol}} for processing of and interaction about utterances in conversation. The protocol embodies {{the view of}} communication developed in chapter 7, that the comprehension task an utterance u made by a CP A poses for a CP B involves checking whether she {{in possession of a}} fact that resolves, relative to her mental state, the question content(u,A,(u)) ? ("what did A intend to convey with u whose meaning is ?"). I show how this view of interaction allows to solve a puzzle (the Turn Taking Puzzle) for existing formal semantic and <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>views</b> of the common ground [...] - this is a phenomenon concerning the resolution options in fact-operator ellipsis, which are crucially linked to the issue of who keeps or takes over the turn...|$|R
2500|$|An {{incubation}} {{effect can}} be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. [...] It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do not know. This is why the current debate between the <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view</b> of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — There {{are several}} connectionist systems {{concerning}} natural language computational processing applications in artificial intelligence literature. Some try {{to predict the}} next word in a sentence context. Others attempt to discover grammatical symbolic rules from the neural network architecture, and others deal with semantic relationships between words. Unfortunately, {{very few of them}} employ psycholinguistic theories. Recently, some systems have made use of biologically plausible approaches to connectionist natural language processing, which are computationally as efficient as conventional methods. The system described here, in a way, presents all the properties and characteristics enumerated previously: it is a symbolicconnectionist hybrid system, designed to ”predict ” thematic (semantic) roles assigned to words in a sentence context with a biologically inspired training algorithm and architecture, and adopting a <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view</b> of thematic theory. Its lexicon, which includes lexically ambiguous nouns and ”thematically ambiguous ” verbs, can be increased, provided that semantic ”features ” of words are entered. The system has proven to be even more computationally efficient than conventional connectionist systems. I...|$|R

40|$|In Natural Language Processing (NLP) {{symbolic}} systems, several linguistic phenomena, for instance, {{the thematic}} role relationships between sentence constituents, such as AGENT, PATIENT, and LOCATION, can {{be accounted for}} by the employment of a rule-based grammar. Another approach to NLP concerns the use of the connectionist model, which has the benefits of learning, generalization and fault tolerance, among others. A third option merges the two previous approaches into a hybrid one: a symbolic thematic theory is used to supply the connectionist network with initial knowledge. Inspired on neuroscience, it is proposed a symbolic-connectionist hybrid system called BIO theta PRED (BIOlogically plausible thematic (theta) symbolic-connectionist PREDictor), designed to reveal the thematic grid assigned to a sentence. Its connectionist architecture comprises, as input, a featural representation of the words (based on the verb/noun WordNet classification and on the classical semantic microfeature representation), and, as output, the thematic grid assigned to the sentence. BIO theta PRED is designed to ""predict"" thematic (semantic) roles assigned to words in a sentence context, employing biologically inspired training algorithm and architecture, and adopting a <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view</b> of thematic theory.

40|$|Spoken {{language}} performance {{depends on}} both psycholinguistic processing {{in the individual}} and on communicative uses of language in dialogue or discussion. A social-communication view of language emphasizes that the spoken form of a language is used in social settings to accomplish explicit or implicit tasks of many sorts. In testing, the communicative tradition is associated with oral proficiency interviews. A <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>view</b> of spoken language emphasizes {{that the development of}} component skills forms the basis of real-time performance in a first or a second language. The paper reviews the development and validation of psycholinguistic testing task types (e. g. elicited imitation) that measure performance in spoken language based on empirical models of processes internal to the individual speaker-listener. The design, development, and validation of these task types are presented. Data from a recent set of experiments indicates that the two theoretical approaches to testing do not produce different patterns of proficiency scores for populations of second language speakers. The distributions of paired test scores over several populations and methods are closely aligned and contain no outliers. This pattern of data obviates the need to posit a “communicative” basis for language test design. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how European changes in the <b>view</b> <b>on</b> {{security}} relates to the <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration and vice versa. The answer to that question is based upon collected data from three separate time periods; the 1950 s, 1970 s and 1990 s. These time periods are seen as important historic decades when political changes, assumed to have affected the <b>views</b> <b>on</b> security and immigration, have occurred. According to certain criteria each time period has been labelled in terms of narrowed/widened <b>view</b> <b>on</b> security as well as restrictive/open <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration. The hypothesis of the study is that, when compared, a constant pattern can be seen between the historical labels of each phenomenon, where a narrow <b>view</b> <b>on</b> security goes hand in hand with an open <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration and similarly a wide security view relates to a restrictive <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration. The conclusion of the study gives support to the hypothesis. During all three periods studied a restrictive <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration relates to a wider <b>view</b> <b>on</b> security while an open <b>view</b> <b>on</b> immigration relates to a narrower <b>view</b> <b>on</b> security.

5000|$|Interlanguage can be {{observed}} to be variable across different contexts. For example, {{it may be more}} accurate, complex and fluent in one discourse domain than in another. [...] Variability is observed when comparing the utterances of the learner in conversation to form-focused tasks, such as memory-based oral drills in a classroom. Spontaneous conversation is more likely to involve the use of interlanguage. A learner may produce a target-like variant (e.g. 'I don't') in one context and a non-target like variant (e.g. 'me no') in another. Scholars from different traditions have taken opposing <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the importance of this phenomenon. Those who bring a Chomskyan perspective to second-language acquisition typically regard variability as nothing more than performance errors, and not worthy of systematic inquiry. On the other hand, those who approach it from a sociolinguistic or <b>psycholinguistic</b> orientation <b>view</b> variability as an inherent feature of the learner's interlanguage. In these approaches, a learner's preference for one linguistic variant over another can depend on social (contextual) variables such as the status or role of the person the learner is speaking to. Preference can also be based on linguistic variables such as the phonological environment or neighboring features marked for formality or informality.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science and to investigate the relationship between their <b>views</b> and decision-making <b>on</b> socio-scientific issues (SSI). In this study, 27 university students attending a science course were asked to discuss four controversial issues: the Toyota recall, the green car, the global warming and swine influenza (influenza A (H 1 N 1)). The study was comprised of two stages. At the first stage, we examined students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the nature of science and on the orientation of science with the open-ended questionnaire based on VNOS and VOSTS. While they held relatively similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the nature of science, their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science were distinct as pragmatic, intrinsic, communal and ethical views. At the second stage, to examine the role of their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science in decision-making, we selected four students who had similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> NOS but different <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science. The four students were selected from each group of <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science and their decision-making processes were analyzed following grounded theory. Across SSIs, they relied upon their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science as the strategies for decision, though considered different perception, and causal and contextual conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} paper aims to discover {{to what extent}} Dutch non-hunter's <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature influence <b>views</b> <b>on</b> hunting. Literature suggests that knowledge, individual- and spatial factors influence <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature and possibly also <b>views</b> <b>on</b> hunting. The relationship between the views and these factors have been statistically tested in this research. A statistical relationship was found between <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature and attitudes towards hunting. <b>Views</b> <b>on</b> nature {{seem to be a}} determining factor in attitude towards hunting. Feelings seem {{to play an important role}} in the adoption of attitude towards hunting. Feelings play a lesser role in the acceptance of hunting, where feelings make place for understanding. Respondents with an ecocentric attitude towards nature or with affinity towards the representation of wilderniss are more likely to have a negative attitude towards hunting then respondents with different <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature. Individual factors like age, gender and membership of an environmental organisation do not have a statistical relationship with either <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature or attitudes towards hunting. A small statistical relationship was found between gender and attitude towards hunting, but this relationship was too small to make any statements. <b>Views</b> <b>on</b> nature and hunting could rather be seen as a snapshot in a process of constantly changing wishes and convictions towards nature. Spatial factors, such as origin, work sector and membership of an association with activities in nature also do not have a statistical relationshop with with either <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature or attitudes towards hunting. This does not directly mean that individual and spatial factors do not influence <b>views</b> <b>on</b> nature. <b>Views</b> <b>on</b> nature will always interact with the living and working environment. The role of context plays an important part. A person living in the big city and working in the service sector does not by definition have a different <b>view</b> <b>on</b> nature than a person living in a rural area working in the agricultural sector. A combination of measurable and non-measurable factors complete the puzzle. In order to gain more insights on this matter it is desirable to perform additional qualitative research...|$|R
