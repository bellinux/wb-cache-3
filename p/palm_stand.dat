5000|$|Also during antiquity, the aurochs was {{regarded}} as an animal of cultural value. Aurochs are depicted on the Ishtar Gate. In the Peloponnese there is a 15th-century BC depiction on the so-called violent cup of Vaphio, of hunters trying to capture with nets three wild bulls being probably aurochs, in a possibly Cretan date <b>palm</b> <b>stand.</b> The one of the bulls throws one hunter on the ground while attacking the second with its horns. The cup despite the older perception of being Minoan seems to be Mycenaean. Greeks and Paeonians were hunting aurochs (wild oxen/bulls) and used their huge horns as trophies, cups for wine, and offers to the gods and heroes. For example, as mentioned by Samus, Philippus of Thessalonica and Antipater when Philip V of Macedon killed an aurochs on the foothills of mountain Orvilos, he offered the horns which were 105 cm long and the skin to a temple of Hercules. Aurochs horns were often used by Romans as hunting horns. Aurochs were among those wild animals caught for fights (venationes) in arenas. Julius Caesar wrote about aurochs in Gallic War Commentaries Chapter 6.28:"...those animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, colour, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves {{in this sort of}} hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments." ...|$|E

40|$|Background The African {{oil palm}} (Elaeis guineensis) is a {{monoecious}} {{species of the}} palm subfamily Arecoideae. It may be qualified as 'temporally dioecious' in that it produces functionally unisexual male and female inflorescences in an alternating cycle on the same plant, resulting in an allogamous mode of reproduction. The 'sex ratio' of an oil <b>palm</b> <b>stand</b> is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In particular, the enhancement of male inflorescence production in response to water stress has been well documented. Scope This paper presents a review of our current understanding of the sex determination process in oil palm and discusses possible insights that can be gained from other species. Although some informative phenological studies have been carried out, nothing is as yet known about the genetic basis of sex determination in oil palm, nor the mechanisms by which this process is regulated. Nevertheless new genomics-based techniques, when combined with field studies and biochemical and molecular cytological-based approaches, should provide {{a new understanding of}} the complex processes governing oil palm sex determination in the foreseeable future. Current hypotheses and strategies for future research are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Peat land {{conversion}} into {{oil palm}} plantations {{have an impact}} on changes in physical, chemical and biological soil peat. Ant community is one of the soil biotic components affected on changes in physical and chemical properties of soils. This study aims to analyze the community of ants on peat lands with palm stands from a young age to old age (oil palm stands of 2, 10, 15, 19 and 23 years). In this study, the stand ages of oil palms also represent the reclamation ages of peatland. The study showed peat lands with stands of oil palms from a young age to old age have different physical and chemical properties of soil. Ant communities in the five study sites varied in terms of species richness, density, diversity and similarity index. Species diversity (the number of ant species) on peat land with oil palm stands of a young age (2 years) and old age (19 and 23 years) was higher than in the location of palm stands with age of 10 and 15 years that were periodically flooded. Ant density on land with palm stands of a young age (2 years) was higher and significantly different compared with other stand locations (10, 15, 19 and 23 years). Ant abundance was positively correlated with the thickness of the peat and the levels of N, P, K, Ca and Mg of peat soil. Ant species of Solenopsis sp was the dominant invasive species population in almost all of oil <b>palm</b> <b>stand</b> lands. Diversity index of ant community tended to be higher in land with old palm stands and was an indication that the equilibrium level of the ant community structure in the this location is higher than in the palm land with young age. The similarity level of ant species on lands with palm stands of 2, 19 and 23 years old was higher (similarity index from 81. 5 to 87...|$|E

40|$|Copernicia tectorum is a palm {{that grows}} in large populations on {{seasonally}} flooded savannas in the Caribbean region of Colombia, where its stems and expanded leaves {{are used in}} construction, and its unexpanded leaves are used to make handicrafts. We studied abundance and population structure in 34 plots of 20 × 10 m (0. 68 ha) of three localities (Plato, Córdoba and Magangué) at the Mompox Depression, an inner delta formed by the confluence of four large rivers. We recorded growth and mortality of 164 palms of different size classes over 13 months, and additionally we estimated seedling and juvenile mortality in two 10 x 10 m plots within the same sites. Data analysis using Kolgomorov-Smirnov (KS), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were made on Statgraphics Plus and SPSS. We related the structure and dynamics of the <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> to flood intensity. Copernicia tectorum has the fastest leaf production rate recorded for any palm (19 - 23 leaves/year in subadults and adults), and a short life span of ca. 46 years. The abundance, density and high leaf production rate of this palm offer a great potential for the sustainable use of its unexpanded leaves (especially at Plato, where there are ca. 480 ha of <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> with 300 - 1 000 individuals/ha), as leaf harvest from subadult and adult individuals {{does not appear to}} affect population structure.
