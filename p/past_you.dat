He however noted that the game was creative in its presentation, and offered [...] "clever new twists on the familiar to the knuckle-biting intensity of the final stages." [...] Justin Haywald of GamePro gave the game 5/5, writing that Nintendo successfully captured the nostalgic aesthetic of the series, while still maintaining technical innovation. He reported, [...] "for every familiar bit of music or a level background that reminds you of Mario games <b>past,</b> <b>you</b> have new abilities to use and deviously designed platforming sections that feel completely unique", while stating that the inclusion of 3D was mostly a gimmick.|$|E
500|$|According to Michelle Grobbelaar {{from the}} CGS, [...] "There's {{a rule of}} thumb that if you {{experience}} an earthquake with a certain magnitude in the <b>past,</b> <b>you</b> can always expect an earthquake of a similar magnitude in that same area." [...] Grobbelaar and Denver Birch, also from the CGS, said that the cause of the earthquake was difficult to determine given that it occurred in a mining area and the lack of historical seismic data for the area. Ian Saunders from the CGS confirmed that a team would be sent to the area for further investigation, and Eldridge Kgaswane from the CGS said {{they should be able to}} determine the cause within a month. According to Kgaswane, [...] "The fact that the deepest mine shafts are shallower than the epicentre doesn't mean mining can be ruled out as a cause. Blasting in the vicinity of a big fault could have activated seismic activity." [...] On 18 August 2014 at a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) seminar in Pretoria, the CGS confirmed that the earthquake was caused by mining-related activity, making it the biggest ever mining-related earthquake recorded in South Africa.|$|E

After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg.

[...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?"
