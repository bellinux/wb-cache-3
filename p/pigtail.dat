25|$|A {{precursor}} to the minifigure was released in 1975. These were at the same scale as the current minifigures, but had a different design. They had solid torsos without separate movable arms, solid lower body pieces that were not moveable, and heads without printed features. They had a small variety of headpieces in various colors, including caps, <b>pigtail</b> hair and cowboy hats.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1876 {{the state}} of California passed their own law to Los Angeles's Sanitary Ordinance. The city {{no longer had the}} power to ignore the {{enforcement}} of the law, so the board made a second proposal of the <b>Pigtail</b> Ordinance. This time the law passed with a vote of 10-2, and was approved by mayor Andrew Jackson Bryant.|$|E
25|$|Line 0 was {{terminated}} on 3 August 1915, and the Sagene Line was instead served by lines 7 and 8 in a <b>pigtail</b> loop: Homansbyen–Torshov–Sagene–Stortorvet–Vålerenga. Line 0 resumed on 24 February 1916, although the headway rose to six minutes. It increased further to eight minutes on 25 March 1920. KSS merged in 1924 {{and the service}} {{was taken over by}} Oslo Sporveier. They gradually cut the frequency to twelves minute-headways.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some regions}} of China, {{traditional}} culture related {{the wearing of}} <b>pigtails</b> to a girl's marital status. A young, unmarried, Chinese girl would often wear two buns, or bundles of hair {{on either side of}} the head to display her availability to prospective husbands. This style of <b>pigtails</b> is sometimes referred to as [...] "ox horns." [...] However, when this girl would marry, the two <b>pigtails,</b> or buns, would be replaced with just one, thus indicating her marriage.|$|R
25|$|Almost {{the entire}} 15th Century was a {{confusion}} of estate and family disputes, which considerably weakened {{the political and}} economic importance of the Habsburg lands. It was not until 1453 in the reign of Frederick V the Peaceful (1457–1493) that the country (at least the core territories) would be finally united again. Rudolph IV's brothers Albert III the <b>Pigtail</b> and Leopold III the Just quarreled ceaselessly and eventually agreed to split the realm in the Treaty of Neuberg in 1379, which was to result in further schisms later. Altogether this resulted in three separate jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pigtail</b> Ordinance was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve a week or more in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board was a welcome punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was to stem the tide of willing Chinese convicts.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1805, he received an invitation from Savigny, who had moved to Paris, to help him in his literary work. Grimm passed a very happy time in Paris, strengthening his taste for the literatures of the Middle Ages by his studies in the Paris libraries. Towards {{the close of the}} year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and Wilhelm had settled, the latter having finished his studies. The next year, he obtained a position in the war office with the very small salary of 100 thalers. One of his grievances was that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and <b>pigtail.</b> But he had full leisure for the pursuit of his studies.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the hair}} is divided so that it hangs in two {{sections}} they are called [...] "ponytails" [...] or <b>pigtails</b> (or bunches), if left loose, and <b>pigtails,</b> plaits or braids if plaited. Unbraided ponytails worn above each ear are sometimes called dog-ears.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} styles of <b>pigtails</b> {{in which a}} person may wear their hair. They may be braided, straightened, beaded, ribboned, in buns, fishtailed, and even French braided. <b>Pigtails</b> can be placed on different parts of a person's head: high, low, or to the side.|$|R

500|$|Nearly every Han rebel group {{began by}} {{shearing}} this <b>pigtail</b> (most {{especially in the}} case of the Taiping, who were known in Chinese as the [...] "Longhairs"), but the queue on penalty of death lasted until 1911, when the Chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion. Americans at first judged Chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} {{received}} only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel {{agreed to a}} slight rewording, renaming the character who appears {{near the end of}} the story a [...] "Chinese man" [...] instead of a [...] "Chinaman". He also agreed to remove the character's <b>pigtail</b> and the yellow coloring from the character's skin. However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines [...] "Sayanyone could think of that,/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat/ Say, even Jane could think of that." ...|$|E

Rihanna's dancers had a food fight with cakes and cream while she sang, and the show's producers had only one minute to clear the stage before the weekly elimination results were announced. On November 7 she performed the song at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Madrid, wearing a [...] "fairy tale"-inspired ensemble and walking {{through a set of}} flowers against a sunset. Two days later, Rihanna sang [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] on the Italian version of The X Factor in a floral-print bikini, boots and a red <b>pigtail.</b> The next day she flew to France to sing the song on Le Grand Journal, on a set covered with white balloons.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Pigtail</b> Ordinance was an 1873 law {{intended}} to force prisoners in San Francisco, California {{to have their}} hair cut {{within an inch of}} the scalp. It affected Han Chinese prisoners in particular, as it meant they would have their queue, a waist-long, braided <b>pigtail,</b> cut off. The proposal passed by a narrow margin through the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1873 but was vetoed by the mayor. An identical version of the law, enacted in 1876, was struck down as unconstitutional in 1879.|$|E

Rosenblum's research, and his justifications for it, have also been criticized.|$|E
2500|$|Safety {{regulations}} {{should have}} prevented the Zuni rocket from firing. A triple ejector rack (TER) electrical safety pin prevented any electrical signal from reaching the rockets, but it was known that high winds could sometimes catch the attached tags and blow them free. The backup was the [...] "pigtail" [...] connection of the electrical wiring to the rockets pod. Regulations required they be connected only when the aircraft {{was attached to the}} catapult and ready to launch. The Navy investigation found that four weeks before the fire, Forrestals Weapons Coordination Board had a meeting to discuss the possible problem of a faulty <b>pigtail</b> delaying a mission while the aircraft was removed from the launcher. The board ruled that, in the future, the crew could ignore protocol and connect the pigtails while the aircraft were still queued. Though never made official, the crew immediately acted on the ruling. The inquiry found that the TER pin was likely blown free while the <b>pigtail</b> was connected, and that the missile fired due to a power surge when the pilot transferred his systems from external to internal power. This incident also led the U.S. Navy to implement safety reviews for weapons systems going on board ships (whether for use or for shipping). Today, this evaluation still exists as the Weapon System Explosives Safety Review Board.|$|E

40|$|Two {{juvenile}} <b>pigtailed</b> macaques (animals 1 and 2) received {{total body}} irradiation (TBI) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, by a procedure known to be well tolerated by baboons. In this procedure, the TBI consisted of treatment on two consecutive days with 255 cGy on one side, followed after 1 – 2 min by a similar dose on the other side. The two <b>pigtailed</b> macaques showed rapid haematopoietic engraftment, but succumbed either to systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and necrotising colitis or to haemorrhagic cystitis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. For four further <b>pigtailed</b> macaques (animals 3 – 6) the radiation procedure was changed to four equal doses of 255 cGy, given 6 – 12 h apart. Animals 4 – 6 all showed engraftment and survived for long periods (> 218 days), with no, or only minor treatable, complications. Animal 3 failed to show engraftment and succumbed to radiation-induced vascular lesions and severe multiorgan haemorrhages. The results suggest that <b>pigtailed</b> macaques have a lower tolerance threshold than baboons, rhesus macaques or human beings to TBI, the adverse effects of TBI being indistinguishable from those seen in human patients. The results also suggest that a hyperfractionated radiation procedure can prevent radiation-induced morbidity and mortality in <b>pigtailed</b> macaques...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{members of}} the Asian American {{community}} found the character of Chop-Chop to be highly controversial and offensive. Addressing the disparity of Asian American characters in the comic industry and the stereotypical images of early characters, noted Asian American comics writer Larry Hama said, [...] "Many companies were still coloring Asians bright yellow... In the '40s and '50s, the character Chop Chop in the 'Blackhawks' had big buck teeth, a long <b>pigtail</b> and lots of cleavers. It wasn't until sometime in the '60s that he evolved into a short slim guy who was a jaundiced shade of orange." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Qing Dynasty in 1644, Han men in China had been required to wear the queue as a sign of submission to the ruling Manchu people. The penalty for refusal was death. The majority of Chinese immigrants who moved to America only intended to stay in the United States long enough to make a living and return to China, so they needed to keep their queues to ensure their ability to return. [...] In light of this, the idea behind the institution of the <b>Pigtail</b> Ordinance was that Chinese immigrants {{would be less likely to}} ignore the Sanitary Ordinance if such a heavy penalty was the result.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor made 18 preaching {{tours in}} the {{vicinity}} of Shanghai starting in 1855, and was often poorly received by the people, even though he brought with him medical supplies and skills. He made a decision to adopt the native Chinese clothes and queue (<b>pigtail)</b> with shaven forehead, and was then able to gain an audience without creating a disturbance. Previous to this, Taylor realised that wherever he went he was being referred to as a [...] "black devil" [...] because of the overcoat he wore. He distributed thousands of Chinese Gospel tracts and portions of Scripture in and around Shanghai. During his stay in Shanghai, he also adopted and cared for a Chinese boy named Hanban.|$|E

2500|$|The slang word [...] "flapper", {{describing}} a young woman, is sometimes supposed {{to refer to}} a young bird flapping its wings while learning to fly. [...] However, it may derive from an earlier use in northern England to mean [...] "teenage girl", referring to one whose hair is not yet put up and whose plaited <b>pigtail</b> [...] "flapped" [...] on her back; or from an older word meaning [...] "prostitute". The slang word [...] "flap" [...] was used for a young prostitute as early as 1631. By the 1890s, the word [...] "flapper" [...] was emerging in England as popular slang both for a very young prostitute, and in a more general – and less derogatory sense – of any lively mid-teenage girl.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the new law, a Chinese {{immigrant}} named Ah Kow was arrested for living space violations and had his queue removed at the jail. He sued the sheriff for damages, claiming that the <b>Pigtail</b> Ordinance caused him irreparable harm. On June 14, 1879 United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field, sitting in the local federal courtdespite much criticism from the general publicfound in favor of the plaintiff; his decision held that it was not within the powers of the Board of Supervisors to set such a discriminatory law and that the ordinance was, in fact, unconstitutional. In particular, he cited the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees equal protection under the law to all persons within its jurisdiction. [...] See Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 12 Fed. Cas. 252 (1879).|$|E

But what was singular, it was not the wiry black <b>pigtail</b> of his Mongolian fellows, but soft and silky, and as the firelight played upon it, it seemed of a shining chestnut brown! It was like--like--he stopped--was he dreaming again? A long sigh escaped him.|$|E
