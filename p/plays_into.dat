5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|The Chiefs won the toss and {{deferred}} {{until the}} second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points {{late in the first}} quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17–3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertoire}} of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, {{political and military}} struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as kunqu. Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems {{have been used to}} sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion in this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either daxi (serious) or xiaoxi (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{player has}} a board called a [...] "capital", which {{is divided into}} 3 zones: Battlefield, Quest, and Kingdom. The Battlefield is the area where attacks are launched, Quest determines how many cards are drawn each turn, and Kingdom determines how many {{resources}} are gathered each turn. Resources are spent to play cards. Each unit has a power rating that adds to the zone they are <b>played</b> <b>into.</b> For example, a unit with a power of 2 would add 2 damage to attacks when <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Battlefield, 2 additional resources per turn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Kingdom, or 2 additional cards drawn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Quest zone.|$|R

25|$|With this {{described}} binary logic, the West generally constructs the Orient subconsciously as its alter ego. Therefore, {{descriptions of}} the Orient by the Occident lack material attributes, grounded within land. This inventive, or imaginative interpretation subscribes female characteristics to the Orient and <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> fantasies that are inherent within the West's alter ego. It should be understood that this process draws creativity, amounting an entire domain and discourse.|$|E

On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal. Then after a punt, he carried the ball six times for 22 yards to set up another score on Kasay's 40-yard kick a few <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> the fourth quarter.|$|E

After both teams failed to score in the fourth quarter, the Vikings would get the ball to begin overtime. However, nine <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> their drive, back-up QB Brooks Bollinger would fumble the ball and Detroit would recover it (which would be the game's 10th overall turnover).

25|$|Instead, several {{regional}} written {{varieties of}} Romansh began appearing during the 16th century. Gian Travers {{wrote the first}} surviving work in Romansh, the Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs, in the Putèr dialect. This epic poem, written in 1527, describes the first Musso war, in which Travers himself had taken part. Travers also translated numerous biblical <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> Romansh, though only the titles survive for many of them. Another early writer, Giachem Bifrun, who also wrote in Putèr, penned the first printed book in Romansh, a catechism published in 1552. In 1560 he published a translation of the New Testament: L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ.|$|E
25|$|Cues act {{as guides}} {{to what the}} person is {{supposed}} to remember. A cue can be virtually anything that may act as a reminder, e.g. a smell, song, color, place etc. In contrast to free recall, the subject is prompted to remember a certain item on the list or remember the list in a certain order. Cued recall also <b>plays</b> <b>into</b> free recall because when cues are provided to a subject, they will remember items on the list {{that they did not}} originally recall without a cue. Tulving explained this phenomenon in his research. When he gave participants associative cues to items that they did not originally recall and that were thought to be lost to memory, the participants were able to recall the item.|$|E
