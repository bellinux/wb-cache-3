5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E
500|$|Except for {{drums and}} the folk music {{instrumental}} [...] "Tilflukt", {{the album was}} entirely recorded at Hansen's home in Norway. Drums were recorded by Børven at his home, while [...] "Tilflukt" [...] was recorded and mixed by Erik Normann Aanonsen and James William Makepeace at Salvation Room studios. In an interview with HM, Antestor explained that it had trouble finding a studio that it liked, as well as finding time when all members were available to record. Since Buer and Børven had the necessary equipment to record, the band decided it would take on recording itself. The band stated that Buer [...] "really took {{the brunt of the}} workload and singlehandedly made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to record the album ourselves." [...] Recording began in 2010, and Antestor uploaded a video clip from its recording sessions on September 4. During recording, bassist Thor Georg Buer left Antestor in May 2011 due to commitments to his other band, Grave Declaration, and Aanonsen was recruited as his replacement. A few months later, Buer rejoined, this time on guitar, to replace Robert Bordevik, who had temporarily left the band. On June 23, the Christian music website Indie Vision Music noted a video uploaded by Antestor that contained footage of the band recording. The recording process finished on July 31, 2012. On August 25, Buer announced that he was leaving Antestor again, this time due to upcoming college studies. In September, Erik Tordsson completed the mixing and mastering for Omen at Solid Mix Studios, Teleborg Castle, Växjö, Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a soldier}} his {{standing}} was perfect: {{his name was}} a synonym of bravery, and his patriotism of the highest order. In battle he was apparently lost to fear, and his every action heroic. His acts of heroism on the 20th of September, 1863, that came under my personal observation, I believe are without a parallel of individual bravery of that memorable battle. He with his bugle made it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to check a most disastrous retreat. We were able through the assistance of Carson to rally over 2500 of our division and retake the position we had lost, which was then held by us until night. W. J. Carson, along with 1900 of us, after being completely surrounded by the enemy, and out of all ammunition, were captured at 6:30 P. M. on the original line of battle, the entire army, at that time, having retired several miles toward Chattanooga. He was as brave a man as ever wore the blue, and I deem it a great privilege and honor to be remembered among his friends and acquaintances. As to his simple request, asking the Government to award him the Medal of Honor for gallantry and heroism, I am sure no more patriotic or gallant breast ever merited the distinguishing mark of bravery from the U. S. Government than that of W. J. Carson." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 October 1924, {{just four}} days before the election, the Daily Mail {{reported}} that a letter had come into its possession which purported to be a letter sent from Grigory Zinoviev, the President of the Communist International, to the British representative on the Comintern Executive. The letter was dated 15 September and so before the dissolution of parliament; it stated that it was imperative for the agreed treaties between Britain and the Bolsheviks to be ratified urgently. The letter said that those Labour members who could apply pressure on the government should do so. It {{went on to say that}} a resolution of the relationship between the two countries would [...] "assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat ... make it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to extend and develop the ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies". The government had received the letter before the publication in the newspapers and had protested to the Bolsheviks' London chargé d'affaires and had already decided to make public the contents of the letter with details of the official protest but had not been swift-footed enough. [...] Historians mostly agree the letter was a forgery, but it closely reflected attitudes current in the Comintern. In any case, it had little impact on the Labour vote, which actually increased. It was the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide. However, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the Letter by misunderstanding the political forces at work. Despite all that had gone on, the result of the election was not disastrous for Labour. The Conservatives were returned decisively gaining 155 seats for a total of 413 members of parliament. Labour lost 40 seats but held on to 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats (leaving them with only 40) and their vote fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberals, whom Labour had displaced as the second largest political party in 1922, were now clearly the third party.|$|E
2500|$|Later, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary {{started to}} {{complete}} the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény {{that he was only}} pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported [...] "in order to avoid a misunderstanding" [...] that Jagow had promised him that [...] "the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal , which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency 's notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary decidedly opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request" [...] (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was [...] "absolutely against taking account of the British wish, because [...] "the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [...] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain". Szögyény ended his telegram that [...] "If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [...] might not be achieved." [...] Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July: [...] "As we have already rejected one British proposal for a conference, it is not <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to refuse this suggestion also a limine. If we rejected every attempt at mediation, the whole world would hold us responsible for the conflagration and represent us as the real war-mongers. That would also make our position impossible here in Germany, where we have got to appear as though the war had been forced on us. Our position is the more difficult because Serbia seems to have given way very extensively. We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg." [...] In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: [...] "Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy." [...] In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: [...] "We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey." [...] Jagow sent Grey’s offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey’s offer to Wilhelm.|$|E

2500|$|Cognitive {{control and}} {{stimulus}} control, which {{is associated with}} operant and classical conditioning, represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors. Cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we {{would be at the}} mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.... The subthalamic nucleus appears to {{play a critical role in}} preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}} Working memory is a short-term, capacity-limited cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision-making and behavior....These diverse inputs and back projections to both cortical and subcortical structures put the prefrontal cortex in a position to exert what is often called [...] "top-down" [...] control or cognitive control of behavior.... The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15)....In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior. Subjects with ADHD exhibit less activation of the medial prefrontal cortex than healthy controls even when they succeed in such tasks and utilize different circuits.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Stimulus-driven behavioral responses (i.e., stimulus control) that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.|$|E
