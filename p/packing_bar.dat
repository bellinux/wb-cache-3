40|$|An {{effort was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} the formation of the generally observed layer of large porosity adjacent to the as-nitride surfaces of reaction bonded silicon nitrides could be prevented during processing. Isostatically pressed test bars were prepared from wet vibratory milled Si powder. Sintering and nitriding were each done under three different conditions:(1) bars directly exposed to the furnance atmosphere; (2) <b>bars</b> <b>packed</b> in Si powder; (3) <b>bars</b> <b>packed</b> in Si 3 N 4 powder. <b>Packing</b> the <b>bars</b> in either Si of Si 3 N 4 powder during sintering retarded formation of the layer of large porosity. Only <b>packing</b> the <b>bars</b> in Si prevented formation of the layer during nitridation. The strongest bars (316 MPa) were those sintered in Si and nitrided in Si 3 N 4 despite their having a layer of large surface porosity; failure initiated at very large pores and inclusions. The alpha/beta ratio was found to be directly proportional to the oxygen content; a possible explanation for this relationship is discussed...|$|R

Newspapers, radio stations, and Web sites around the globe featured stories about SPB, often accompanied by not-safe-for-work pictures.

30|$|Finally, {{in order}} to {{construct}} a GMSF, children must first be able to coordinate at least three levels of units at a time. Giving children opportunities to solve tasks that involve multiple levels of units can lead to growth in children’s coordination of units (Norton and Boyce 2015). Norton and Boyce (2015, p. 216) systematically designed scenarios involving four levels: boxes of cups, number of chips in a cup, and a price for a chip, e.g., 2 chips in a cup, 5 cups in a box, and 2 cents per chip. They then asked questions that involved the manipulation of the multiple units: “How much is a box worth?”; “If you have 14 cents, how many more chips {{do you need to}} make a box?” (p. 216). Similar tasks have also been developed as part of an educational video game, CandyDepot (version 2.0), in which children work for a shipping company <b>packing</b> <b>bars</b> in bundles and bundles in boxes in the most efficient way (Aslan et al. 2013; also see Norton et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|The {{consumption}} of Brazilian cassava {{has been reduced}} {{due to a lack}} of adjustment to the modern lifestyle. To reverse this trend, new products could be developed specifically targeted to high-value niche markets. Cereal bars stand out as fast food high in nutritional value. A bar formula mimicking cereal bars was prepared using a mixture of Brazilian cassava flour, hydrogenated vegetable fat, dried bananas, ground cashew nuts, and glucose syrup. After being pressed, the bars were dried for 1 hour at 65 °C, packaged in films, and stored under ambient conditions. Its stability was continuously monitored for 210 days in order to ensure its safety and enable its introduction to the market. Texture loss was observed in the <b>packed</b> <b>bars</b> after 90 days of storage, but the sensory characteristics allowed the testers to perceive this tendency after only 30 days of storage. However, chemical, physical, and microbial analyses confirmed that the bars were safe for consumption for 180 days. The results showed that a 45 g cassava flour-based bar enriched with nuts and dried fruits can meet 6 % of the recommended daily fiber intake with a caloric value between that of the common cereal bar and that of an energy bar. Adapting the formula with ingredients (fruits, nuts) from different regions of Brazil may add value to this traditional product as a fast food...|$|R

40|$|The {{container}} ship stowage planning problem {{was introduced to}} the research group by the container transport company Euroports. The goal of this so called Master Bay Plan Problem (MBPP) is to minimize the total stowage time to transport a given set of cargo. Although the MBPP is a general definition of the problem, it differs in two aspects. First, the MBPP takes into account an individual loading time for each container and aims to minimize the total loading time. Second, containers are located into fixed slots in the cargo space. Our approach aims to minimize the total container operations or shifts consisting of unloading and reloading operations caused by blocking containers. In the first stage an alternative model is developed: the Sliced <b>Bar</b> <b>Packing</b> Model (SBPM). <b>Bars</b> represent containers from the pick up till the destination terminal. These bars can be cut into multiple parts and are packed in a given space, while the total number of cuts should be minimized. In the second stage, a heuristic solves stowage problems represented by the SBPM. The performance of the SBPM heuristic is compared to the Suspensory Heuristic (SH) introduced by Avriel et al. Results show that the SBPM outperforms the SH. In addition, while the SH is limited to a homogeneous set of containers and cannot take into account stability constraints, the SBPM accommodates these needs. status: publishe...|$|R
