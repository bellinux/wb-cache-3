40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of managed health care in the USA — what has been achieved and what has not — and some lessons for policy-makers {{in other parts of the}} world. Although the backlash by consumers and providers makes the future of managed care in the USA uncertain, the evidence shows that it has had a positive effect on stemming the rate of growth of health care spending, without a negative effect on quality. More importantly, it has spawned innovative technologies that are not dependent on the US market environment, but can be applied in public and private systems globally. Active purchasing tools that incorporate disease management <b>programmes,</b> <b>performance</b> measurement report cards, and alignment of incentives between purchasers and providers respond to key issues facing health care reform in many countries. Selective adoption of these tools may be even more relevant in single payer systems than in the fragmented, voluntary US insurance market where they can be applied more systematically with lower transaction costs and where their effects can be measured more precisely...|$|E
40|$|The Botswana Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) {{programme}} {{started in}} 1989. Its aims were to promote sustainable development through sustainable natural resources management and utilisation to improve rural livelihoods. The country CBNRM programme has recorded mixed outcomes {{and this has}} raised questions on the programme performance throughout the country. Since the programme has been recognised {{as one of the}} eight main livelihood strategies for rural communities in Botswana, there was a need to evaluate the programme performance and determine the factors that influence it. This thesis therefore evaluated the performance of CBNRM projects along an aridity gradient in Botswana and by so doing answered the two research questions of: (1) What factors influence the performance of CBNRM? And (2) how does aridity influence the performance of CBNRM <b>programmes?</b> <b>Performance</b> was determined in terms of financial benefits generated by CBNRM projects and the projects adherence to the CBNRM principles. Data were collected from seven selected CBNRM projects covering three aridity zones (wet, medium rainfall and dry areas) in the country. Data were also collected from key informants and community based organisations (CBO) project managers. Research findings have indicated differences in the performance of CBNRM projects across the identified three aridity zones. Factors that influenced the performance of CBNRM projects varied among the three aridity zones. These factors included: existence of complimentary rules and regulations for managing CBNRM projects; literacy levels of communities involved in CBNRM; ethnic composition of the project communities; historic and current socio-economic trends within communities; collaboration between CBNRM institutions and other local level institutes; amount of benefits generated through the projects; ability of institutions to resolve outstanding issues in time and type of CBNRM project. Research results also indicated that there was variation in the performance of CBNRM projects across the three aridity zones. Aridity was found to directly influence the performance of CBNRM projects through its influence on the amount of revenues that projects generated.

40|$|Background: Performance of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) control programme {{depends on the}} functioning of health facilities (HFs). TB control programmes have been evaluated based on the programme indicators of conversion and cure.

Objective: To correlate the performance of HFs to programme indicators, conversion and cure of patients treated under DOTS, in a district of south India. Design: Analysis of the data on new sputum smear-positive cases registered in 17 HFs during 1999 - 2003 was undertaken using TB register. The HFs with a low conversion or cure rates were identified and the reasons for the same were analysed. A scoring system was designed for the functioning of the HFs based on staff availability, supervision and review meetings which was correlated with <b>programme</b> <b>performance.</b> Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: Of 1893 new smear-positive patients registered during the study period, conversion was 1582 (83. 6...|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{a larger}} set of {{instruments}} into Rural Development Programmes implied an increasing focus on monitoring and evaluation. Against the highly diversified experience {{with regard to}} implementation of policy instruments the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework {{has been set up}} by the EU Commission as a strategic and streamlined method of evaluating programmes’ impacts. Its indicator-based approach mainly reflects the concept of a linear, measure-based intervention logic that falls short of the true nature of RDP operation and impact capacity on rural changes. Besides the different phases of the policy process, i. e. policy design, delivery and evaluation, the regional context with its specific set of challenges and opportunities seems critical to the understanding and improvement of <b>programme</b> <b>performance.</b> In particular the role of local actors can hardly be grasped by quantitative indicators alone, but has to be addressed by assessing processes of social innovation. This shift in the evaluation focus underpins the need to take account of regional implementation specificities and processes of social innovation as decisive elements for <b>programme</b> <b>performance.</b> ...|$|R
