40|$|Abstract- A process {{notation}} {{based on}} a functional partitioning of a new system is proposed as a High-Level CoDesign Model for speci-fication, evaluation, and implementation purposes. A well-defined computational model allows the synchronization and activation of concurrent processes. The design environment includes the refine-ment steps from scheduling with dynamic processes via simplified scheduling/execution methods to the complete implementation. The relationship between specified behavioral classes and implemented states in the final core programs is the key issue in this development flow. Time uncritical parts are implemented in a heterogeneous en-vironment communicating via a standard communication protocol. On the other hand, time critical processes and <b>process</b> <b>connections</b> can be implemented in C using SystemC, thus forming core pro-grams encapsulated in a shell to fit the introduced and implemented activation rules.

Aggressive marketing in a weak regulatory environment and strategies to influence tobacco control policy have contributed to an emerging tobacco-related public health crisis.

40|$|Although the Arctic {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} regions to climate change, links between hydrology and ecology in high-latitude northern river basins are not well understood. Interdisciplinary research over three summer melt seasons (2010 to 2012) in the Kongsfjorden area of northwest Svalbard identified <b>process</b> <b>connections</b> between conceptual water sources, physicochemical habitat, and ecological structure and functioning in river basins. Water source dynamics determined from hydrochemical and isotopic data indicated differences in meltwater and groundwater contributions to river flow which varied both spatially and temporally at seasonal and year-to-year timescales. Non-glacier-fed rivers were characterised by less variable flow regimes, warmer water temperature, lower suspended sediment concentration and more stable channel morphologies. Several physicochemical habitat variables, notably water temperature and channel stability, were related significantly to rates of nutrient uptake and macroinvertebrate community structure. These data suggest that a future shift towards groundwater-dominated flow regimes may increase biotic diversity and rates of nutrient cycling in some high-latitude rivers. Key research findings are synthesised in conceptual models and provide a framework to understand the hydroecological response of these Arctic river systems to climate change...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the nature of {{cognitive}} and emotional processes during the three reflective stages of the experiential learning cycle of experiential activities using written debriefings. The study examined three written debriefings from five senior-level undergraduate management students enrolled in a business management course. The debriefings consisted of four to five free-response questions modeled after Kolb 2 ̆ 7 s experiential learning cycle: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. The study triangulated results using two qualitative methods, a grounded theory analysis and a content analysis. In the grounded theory analysis, two process maps were developed from the debriefings. A learning process map identified four stages of learning: introduction, mental rehearsal, abstraction, and priming. A group process map identified four stages of group experiential activities: problem-solving, consensus building, reactions, and resolution. The group decision-making process was seen to follow four paths: agreement, teamwork, conflict or confusion. A possible moderating variable, prior group affiliation, affected the persistence of the groups in finding satisfactory solutions when encountering conflict, or confusion. Six themes emerged from the grounded analysis: iterative reflection, richness of connections, attachment of personal reactions, role of writing in debriefings, fluid group development, and the role of affiliation. In the content analysis, three raters coded the debriefings using seven variables: content, <b>process,</b> <b>connections,</b> context, affect, relevance, and intent...|$|E

Seven participants were selected using purposive sampling, of which four were parents and three were young people with HFAlAS. The young people were aged between 17 - 18 years old and for each young person at least one of their parents was interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants ind ividually. These were recorded and transcribed. This enabled participants to share the aspects of their experiences that were most important to them. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the interview t ranscripts to produce a deep level of understanding of the transition experiences.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis is {{to show how the}} Jungian process of individuation — the psychological development of a unique individual — is depicted in the fairy tales of the twentieth-century Spanish writer, Carmen Martín Gaite. The three shorter tales — El castillo de las tres murallas, El pastel del diablo and Caperucita en Manhattan — are explored here along with the novel, La reina de las nieves. Individuation, as well as being the means by which an individual person develops, also implies a new way of relating between human beings. Jung described the outcome of individuation as ‘objective cognition’ which, this thesis argues, is equivalent to love and conscious relatedness between persons. Dreams {{play a crucial role in}} the individuation process — as they do in the work of Martín Gaite — guiding the dreamer on his/her journey. Dreams facilitate encounters with aspects of the personal and collective unconscious, which appear in symbolic form. The protagonist of the story by Martín Gaite which is closest to a traditional fairy tale (El castillo de las tres murallas) and the novel which takes a traditional tale as its reference point (La reina de las nieves) illustrate the importance of dreams in the development of the protagonists. At the heart of each of the other two tales — El pastel del diablo and Caperucita en Manhattan — is an imagined text which illustrates, in symbolic form, aspects of the individuation <b>process.</b> <b>Connections</b> have been made in Jungian thinking between individuation and the development of Christianity into a third age, the Age of the Holy Spirit, because of the major shift in consciousness (akin to the change which occurred 2000 years ago with the birth of Christ).

40|$|Static {{speed limits}} {{are the norm}} across the world’s roadway networks. However, {{advances}} in technology and increased applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide a mechanism for upgrading traditional speed limits into an active traffic management system. More specifically, variable speed limits (VSLs) {{can be used in}} high crash severity locations and in real-time congestion and weather events to increase traffic safety and operations. Much of the available literature on VSLs focuses upon crash prediction algorithms for VSLs, simulations, and effectiveness of real-world VSL implementations. One noticeable gap in the existing literature is related to driver compliance under varied configurations of alerting drivers of the variable speeds. An additional gap in literature is related to existence of a conceptual framework for identifying optimal corridors for potential VSL implementation. Within this thesis drivers’ willingness to comply with VSLs was investigated via focus groups and static surveys during the experimental <b>process.</b> <b>Connections</b> are made between driver speed choice and type of speed limit condition including uniform speed vi limit (USL) versus VSL, overhead mount versus side mount, presence of an explanatory message, and the numerical speed limit value. An analysis of the survey results was completed to isolate critical factors in VSL compliance. Opinions and perspectives on VSLs are derived through the focus group sessions Lastly, a case study approach is presented in which a region is chosen, and implementation metrics are analyzed on the major roadway networks using a GIS platform to create a composite ranking system for potential optimal VSL corridors.
