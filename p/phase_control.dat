5|$|Continuously {{variable}} <b>phase</b> <b>control</b> circuits {{are common}} in subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer <b>phase</b> <b>control</b> found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

2500|$|A {{commonly}} proposed {{approach to}} ensuring fail-safe beam targeting {{is to use}} a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the <b>phase</b> <b>control</b> value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from <b>phase</b> <b>control</b> in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E

40|$|Pulse width {{modulated}} rectifier is a {{very popular}} topic nowadays. The modern industrial production demands continuous and lossless conversion of electrical energy parameters. This need leads to wide spread of power semiconductor converters. The rapid development in power electronics and microprocessor technology enables to apply sophisticated control methods that eliminate negative side effects of the power converters on the supply network. The <b>phase</b> <b>controlled</b> thyristor rectifiers overload the supply network with higher harmonics and reactive power consumption. That is why the PWM rectifier is being examined.

The PWM rectifier can assert itself for its good behavior in many applications, for example as an input rectifier in indirect frequency converter, or in traction. Traction vehicles equipped with PWM rectifier do not consume reactive power, do not load the supply network with higher harmonics, and the recuperation is possible.
