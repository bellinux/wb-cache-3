The 20 million subsidy is a transfer {{from the government}} to the firm hence it {{has no effect on}} national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

5|$|The Tlaxcalan {{allies of}} the Spanish wrote their own {{accounts}} of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala. Accounts of the conquest as seen from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels.

5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

For much of Halo 3, the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John-117. After the Flood arrive on Earth, the Arbiter persuades Rtas 'Vadum not to glass the entire planet to quell the infestation. Along {{with a group of}} humans and Elites, the Arbiter follows the Prophet of Truth's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark, where he kills the Prophet. The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large; the Arbiter helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence Cortana so that the installation can be fired. During the escape, the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two; while the Master Chief is presumed lost, the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth. After attending a ceremony honoring the dead, the Arbiter {{and the rest of the}} Elites leave for their homeworld.|$|E

The decision on the location and construction of the port was preceded by a maritime and climatic survey which confirmed the engineering feasibility of its construction.

25|$|As {{is shown}} in Figure 2, in general, the torpedo does not {{actually}} move in a straight path immediately after launch {{and it does not}} instantly accelerate to full speed, which are referred to as torpedo ballistic characteristics. The ballistic characteristics are described by three parameters: reach, turning radius, and corrected torpedo speed. Also, the target bearing angle is different from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periscope versus the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torpedo, which is referred to as torpedo tube parallax. These factors are a significant complication in the calculation of the gyro angle and the TDC must compensate for their effects.|$|E
