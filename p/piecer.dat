All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The <b>piecer</b> would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the <b>piecer</b> was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spinning}} mule is {{a machine}} used to spin cotton and other fibres.

5000|$|The highest wages were {{earned by}} mule-spinners (who were all males); their assistants, known as <b>piecers,</b> were more poorly paid. <b>Piecers,</b> hoped {{ultimately}} to become [...] "minders", i.e. mule-spinners {{in charge of}} mules. The division of the total wage paid {{on a pair of}} mules between the minder and the <b>piecers</b> was largely the result of the policy of the spinners' trade union. Almost without exception in Lancashire one minder took charge of a pair of mules with two or three <b>piecers</b> assisting. The wage of fine spinners about 25 to 35 above that of a coarse weaver.|$|R

2500|$|Livingstone's {{experiences}} in H. Monteith's Blantyre cotton mill were also important from ages 10 to 26, {{first as a}} <b>piecer</b> and later as a spinner.

6000|$|Let me {{endeavour}} to recall, {{as well as}} {{my memory}} will serve me, from among the most interesting cases of prize-holders and certificate-gainers who will appear before you, some two or three of the most conspicuous examples. There are two poor brothers from near Chorley, who work from morning to night in a coal-pit, and who, in all weathers, have walked eight miles a-night, three nights a-week, to attend the classes in which they have gained distinction. There are two poor boys from Bollington, who begin life as piecers at one shilling or eighteen-pence a-week, and the father of one of whom was cut to pieces by the machinery at which he worked, but not before he had himself founded the institution in which this son has since come to be taught. These two poor boys will appear before you to-night, to take the second-class prize in chemistry. There is a plasterer from Bury, sixteen years of age, who took a third-class certificate last year at the hands of Lord Brougham; he is this year again successful in a competition three times as severe. There is a wagon-maker from the same place, who knew little or absolutely nothing until he was a grown man, and who has learned all he knows, which is a great deal, in the local institution. There is a chain-maker, in very humble circumstances, and working hard all day, who walks six miles a-night, three nights a-week, to attend the classes in which he has won so famous a place. There is a moulder in an iron foundry, who, whilst he was working twelve hours a day before the furnace, got up at four o'clock in the morning to learn drawing. [...] "The thought of my lads," [...] he writes in his modest account of himself, [...] "in their peaceful slumbers above me, gave me fresh courage, and I used to think that if I should never receive any personal benefit, I might instruct them when they came to be of an age to understand the mighty machines and engines which have made our country, England, pre- eminent in the world's history." [...] There is a <b>piecer</b> at mule-frames, who could not read at eighteen, who is now a man of little more than thirty, who is the sole support of an aged mother, who is arithmetical teacher in the institution in which he himself was taught, who writes of himself that he made the resolution never to take up a subject without keeping to it, and who has kept to it with such an astonishing will, that he is now well versed in Euclid and Algebra, and is the best French scholar in Stockport. The drawing-classes in that same Stockport are taught by a working blacksmith; and the pupils of that working blacksmith will receive the highest honours of to-night. Well may it be said of that good blacksmith, as it was written of another of his trade, by the American poet: ...|$|E
50|$|Benjamin {{started work}} {{at the age of}} seven 1845. His first job was as a little <b>piecer</b> in Henry Atherton's Woodend Cotton Mill on Woodend Street in Lees. This {{involved}} fetching and carrying for the spinner and <b>piecer</b> as well as keeping the mules clean by sweeping behind the carriages. He worked his way through the usual progression from little <b>piecer</b> to <b>piecer</b> and, sometime around the age of 20, was working as a qualified spinner. He moved to work for Daniel Collinge and Sons at Moorhey Mills (known locally as Dan Coll's factory) on Moorhey Street, Glodwick, and must have impressed, because he was given the position of 'Outlooker' at Dan Coll's and subsequent to that became manager of the mill.|$|E
50|$|For the {{calculation}} of wages piece-rate lists were universally employed as regards the payment of full weavers and mule-spinners; some <b>piecers</b> got a definite share of the total wage thus assigned {{to a pair of}} mules, while others are paid a fixed weekly amount. Many ring-spinners were mainly paid an hour-wage. Other operatives are almost universally so paid by list, {{with the exception of the}} hands in the blowing-room and on the carding-machines.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{they fight}} with emei <b>piecers</b> against shark tooth and mere clubs. The Maori attacks the Monk, who grabs {{his arm and}} pulls the mere club from his hand. The Maori swings his shark tooth club and hits the Monk. The Monk spins an emei piercer, {{momentarily}} distracting the Maori and allowing the Monk to punch him in the gut. The Monk tries to stab the Maori, but is blocked by the shark tooth club. He spins and elbows the Maori, then stabs him in both the neck and temple with his emei piercers. The Maori falls and the Monk bows his head in respect for the dead Maori Warrior.|$|R
5000|$|Doffing is {{performed}} by the piercers thrutching, that is raising, the cops partially up the spindles, whilst the carriage is out. The minder then depressing the faller, {{so far as to}} guide the threads upon the bare spindle below. A few turns are wound onto the spindle, to fix the threads to the bare spindles for a new set. The cops are removed and collected into cans or baskets, and subsequently delivered to the warehouse. The remainder of the [...] "draw" [...] or [...] "stretch," [...] as the length of spun yarn is called when the carriage is out, is then wound upon the spindles as the carriage is run up to the roller beam.

50|$|The {{speed and}} {{ease with which}} a quilter can have a quilt top {{finished}} by a longarm quilter has caused an increase in recent years for quilting. These machines allow quilters to have their quilts finished without going through the time-consuming process associated with normal machine quilting or hand quilting. Sewers (or sewists, <b>piecers,</b> or quilters) can now take their finished quilt tops to professional longarm quilting businesses and pay a fee to have their quilting done by a longarm quilter. The availability of relatively quick and reasonably affordable quilting services has helped to cause a surge in the quilting business and an overall growth in interest in quilting as an art form.|$|R
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages.

The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two <b>piecers</b> would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, doffers in the Netherlands {{were mostly}} boys of about 12 years of age, who in 1890 had to go to school for a few hours each day.

50|$|Francis James Sumner {{was the son}} of Robert and Ann Sumner. His {{mother died}} young and his father {{remarried}} to the daughter of the agent of the Duke of Norfolk. When Sumner's father also died in 1817 he ended up living with his stepmother and her father at Glossop Hall. After his mother remarried to John Hardman, Sumner started working as <b>piecer</b> at Grove Mill (aka Old Silk Mill) and then at Wrens Nest. In 1827 he bought Wren Nest Mill from his uncle Thomas Ellison, for 10,000 pounds. He was 22. He had inherited the money from his father's will. The mill had a rateable value of £91 and had 7000 spindles.Catholicism was strong in Glossop because of the influence of the Howards and their estate staff, the Ellisons, Francis Hawke and John le Jardins. Sumner was a Whig and thus Liberal. Sumner moved to Glossop in October 1822.|$|E
50|$|Doffers in 1887 {{in a large}} mill in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, {{both boys}} and girls, earned 40 cents a day. In New England in the 1890s, the doffers, <b>piecers</b> and back boys had their own union, and were not {{admitted}} to the mule spinners' union, even though they often aspired to become mule spinners. Many left the industry rather than tolerate the conditions. William Madison Wood, the manager at the Washington Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts instituted a system in 1895 where employees gained bonuses for meeting production quotas, {{as long as they}} missed no more than one day per month. The effect was that weavers drove spinners to produce, spinners drove doffers and so on, and that workers came in even when sick or injured. Wood then used the increased pay to justify running the looms at ever faster speeds.|$|R

They were employed to work under the machinery {{to clean up the}} dust and oil and to gather the cotton that had been thrown off the mule by its intense vibrations. The tenters would not stop to allow the scavenger to work because they were paid by how much they could produce. As the mule moved forwards the children were sent under the machine, sweeping and gathering the cotton. They had to then time their retreat so as to not become entangled within the many moving parts. [...] These children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as scavengers until they were eight before progressing to the role of <b>piecers.</b> They worked 14 to 16 hours a day, beaten if they fell asleep, until they were 15.|$|R
50|$|Benjamin Wright and Ralph Bagley {{were born}} in 1837 and 1839 respectively. Wright was born into poverty in Ashton-under-Lyne (also known as Ashton). His father William and mother Mary were both born in 1803 in Ashton and, by 1841, {{were living in the}} village of Lees, on the border with Oldham, with their nine {{children}}; Hannah 17-years, John 15, James 14, Sarah 11, Nancy 9, Eliza 7, Betty 5, Benjamin 3 and William aged 1. http://www.thewrightsite.info The three oldest children were working as cotton <b>piecers,</b> the middle three were at school and Benjamin and William junior were of pre-school age. Father William was an operative cotton spinner but Mary was not employed. Despite three of the children being employed, the family was poor. The father would command a 'reasonable' wage but the children would contribute little to family income. With six dependent mouths to feed, the family would have found life a struggle and the fact that Sarah at age 11 was still at school suggests that the parents were committed to their children's betterment. Financial pressure increased in 1843 with the birth of Joseph who was to play a major part in the business.|$|R
2500|$|Cleaning was {{important}} and until a formal ritual had been devised {{it was a}} dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and {{in the region of}} the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the 1 ¼ in gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The <b>piecers</b> would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage spindle rail and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double {{the entire length of the}} mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would unclip the stang and start the mule. Before this ritual was devised, boys had been crushed. The mule was [...] long, the minder's eyesight might not have been good, the air in the mill was clouded with fly and another minder's boys might have been mistaken for his. The ritual became encoded in law.|$|R
2500|$|The early textile {{factories}} {{employed a}} large share of children, but the share declined over time. [...] In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. Sir Robert Peel, a mill owner turned reformer, promoted the 1802 Health and Morals of Apprentices Act, which was intended to prevent pauper children from working more than 12 hours a day in mills. Children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as mule scavengers under the working machinery until they were eight, they progressed to working as little <b>piecers</b> which they did until they were 15. During this time they worked 14 to 16 hours a day, being beaten if they fell asleep. The children were sent to the mills of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire from the workhouses in London and other towns in the south of England. A well-documented example was that of Litton Mill. [...] Further legislation followed. By 1835, the share of the workforce under 18 years of age in cotton mills in England and Scotland had fallen to 43%. [...] About half of workers in Manchester and Stockport cotton factories surveyed in 1818 and 1819 had begun work at under ten years of age. [...] Most of the adult workers in cotton factories in mid-19th-century Britain were workers who had begun work as child labourers. [...] The growth of this experienced adult factory workforce helps to account for the shift away from child labour in textile factories.|$|R

In a hot room the spinners in vest and overalls only perspire freely, and this must tend to wash off the natural grease on the skin and allow the oil to get onto it. In over 80% of the cases occur on the left side, this may be due to one or more of the following causes: firstly the left side hangs anatomically lower than the right, this will be more pronounced when the spinner is bending forward to piece with his left hand;perspiration from the lower part of the abdomen will then tend to run down the left side and the left side and less often the middle of the scrotum will come into contact with the left thigh and the oily trousers some hundreds of times a day.|$|R
