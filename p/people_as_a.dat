5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed {{every aspect of}} daily life, guiding the Roman <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cultural and moral authority.

5|$|Marks of cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated <b>people.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier <b>people,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E

5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday <b>people.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the Welsh. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He also found the Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{is widely}} {{regarded}} by Vietnamese <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary hero. Phan Bội Châu, regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan in his writing, with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai. During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students. In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the Marxist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, then using the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing {{to the public for}} support for his independence movement. Like Phan, Ho was a native of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh. In the 1940s, Ho's Vietminh named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan. Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, Trương Định and Emperors Lê Lợi and Quang Trung, who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam. Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities (Hanoi and Saigon, respectively) named in Phan's honour.|$|E

5|$|The lower magistrates {{included}} the tribune of the plebs, {{who was elected}} by the Plebeian Council, and the aediles and quaestors, elected by the Tribal Assembly. The tribune was sacrosanct, i.e. declared inviolable, with summary execution for violators of his sanctity. It was on this basis that the tribune could veto any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate, known as intercessio and auxilium, respectively. This power was used increasingly to block public business in the later republic, and was only limited in that a tribune could not oppose {{the will of the}} <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E

5|$|Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, later President of the World Zionist Organisation, {{moved from}} Switzerland to the UK in 1904 and met Arthur Balfour – {{who had just}} {{launched}} his 1905–1906 election campaign after resigning as Prime Minister – in a session arranged by Charles Dreyfus, his Jewish constituency representative. Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the Aliens Act through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict the wave of immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire. During this meeting, he asked what Weizmann's objections {{had been to the}} 1903 Uganda Scheme that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary in Balfour's Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as the Jews are to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Leopold spent vast sums {{of money}} on gifts and estates for his young mistress, {{presenting}} for instance the Villa Leopolda to Caroline in 1902. She frequently traveled to Paris to visit her dress- and hat-maker, once bragging that she spent three million francs on dresses at a single store on one occasion. Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop, causing Leopold to arrange {{it so that the}} train would leave an hour later. When pregnant with their first child, the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable. Taking Caroline with him everywhere, the king spent much of his time outside Belgium on his various properties throughout Western Europe, and was much resented by the Belgian <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. Much of this time was spent with Caroline and their two sons at his estate at Cap Ferrat in southern France. Caroline also stayed at Chateau de Larmoy, which Leopold had rented for her; he acquired the French Chateau de Balaincourt as well as a villa in Brussels, where Caroline had no scruples in appearing in public. Though typically traveling incognito, she accompanied Leopold to the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, causing a great scandal. Her unpopularity in Belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of Leopold's riches from the Congo were not benefiting his country, but rather himself and his young mistress.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft begins {{just days}} after the first of these attacks, where the {{predominant}} Terran government, the Confederacy of Man, falls into a state of panic as it comes under attack by both the Zerg and the Protoss, in addition to increasing rebel activity led by Arcturus Mengsk against its rule. The Confederacy eventually succumbs to Mengsk's rebels when they use Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into attacking the Confederate capital, Tarsonis. In the consequent power vacuum, Mengsk crowns himself emperor of a new Terran Dominion. During the assault on Tarsonis, Mengsk allows the Zerg to capture and infest his psychic second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan. This betrayal prompts Mengsk's other commander, Jim Raynor, to desert him with a small army. Having retreated with Kerrigan to their primary hive clusters, the Zerg are assaulted by Protoss forces commanded by Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul. Through assassinating a Zerg cerebrate, Zeratul inadvertently allows the Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion to assimilate the Protoss and gain genetic perfection. Pursued by his own <b>people</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heretic for siding with the dark templar, Tassadar returns with Zeratul to Aiur and with the assistance of Raynor and the templar Fenix, Tassadar launches an attack on the Overmind and ultimately sacrifices himself to kill the creature.|$|E
