5|$|In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, {{representing}} 17religious denominations, unanimously {{approved a}} resolution asking {{the university to}} change Bonfire {{because of concerns about}} safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> explore alternatives to Bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E

5|$|Olympus {{delegated}} {{the task}} of selecting members of its third-party <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> investigate the allegations to two men who were appointed to the board in June: Yasuo Hayashida, a physician and visiting professor at Juntendo University, and Hiroshi Kuruma, a former executive at Nikkei Business. On 1 November, Olympus announced the composition of its third-party panel, headed by lawyer and former Supreme Court justice, Tatsuo Kainaka. The panel would include four lawyers and one certified public accountant.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the Voron (Raven), but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E

5|$|A {{panel of}} MPs began {{the task of}} going through over 40,000 {{documents}} related to Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010. The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> determine whether to allow the MPs to see them.|$|E
5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, {{he said that}} one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of No.1 FTS in 1947, no flying was conducted at Uranquinty until 1951, when the newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) inherited the base facilities. No.1 BFTS transferred to Point Cook in 1958, at which point Uranquinty was closed. The RAAF units that operated at the base formed a close connection with the local community. In 1999, a memorial to No.5 SFTS was erected at Wirraway Park, Uranquinty. An additional <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> the memorial was unveiled in September 2002 by the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Hollingworth; the proceedings included an aerial display by a Pilatus PC-9 of the Roulettes aerobatic team, {{and the arrival of}} a Wirraway from Temora Aviation Museum, the first time in 45 years that one of these trainers had landed at Uranquinty.|$|E

5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production. He also coordinated {{development of}} techniques to industrially refine polonium {{for use with}} beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, part of which {{was conducted on the}} estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council, and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Denver {{became the}} first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent {{in favor of the}} marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession {{in much the same way}} as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado {{became the first}} state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use.|$|E

The event {{was hailed as}} flawlessly conducted salvaging some of India's prestige when compared to minor embarrassments in 2010 Commonwealth Games (Before opening ceremony) conducted in Delhi. Mayawati presented the winning trophy to winner Sebastian Vettel. Foreigners found the track as 'impressive' and 3 Indian teenagers picked by a F1 <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> train them as future Formula One drivers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> investigate {{the cause of}} the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more advanced than Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E

5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system.

5|$|The {{crucifix}} {{was installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.|$|E
