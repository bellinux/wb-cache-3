40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in research on}} sustainable fishery management is to understand the effects of fisheries on the resources and predict the Maximal Sustainable Yield. The von Bertalanffy growth model, commonly used in stock assessment, is suboptimal for the calculation of yield, because it cannot be integrated to omit time from the equation. Here, we present a new model {{to be used as}} the scientific basis to calculate yield and <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> optimal ecological harvesting strategies. The model builds on the principle of exact science and utilizes population measurements from scientific acoustic trawl surveys as input in a real population dynamical model. The model expands the theory of relativity to include the transition of biomass into energy and will improve simulation models used in fisheries science...|$|E

China Communications and Transportation Association; Transportation and Development Institute of ASCE; Mao Yisheng Science and Technology Education FundThe {{maritime}} traffic situation {{is very important}} for the maritime safety authority to make appropriate and practical decisions. The method to appraise the {{maritime traffic}} situation affects greatly the appraisal results of real maritime traffic situation. Vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) contained rich ship movement information. Huge AIS within the port limit contains rich information of the real-time maritime traffic situation. Using the huge and real-time AIS information, this paper probed into the novel and practical method to appraise the maritime traffic situation. The comprehensive spatial and temporal distributions of change rate of ship's course and speed and ship encounter indicated the real-time maritime traffic situation area and their development trend in the given water. This method was applied to analyze of marine traffic situations of Xiamen bay and proved to be practical and useful to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> marine traffic decision-making and management of marine authorities. ? 2011 ASCE...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: On-the-job {{training}} {{is an important}} strategy for general practitioners to deliver appropriately community health services in China. The development of basic professional competence for general practitioners is the main goal of on-the-job training program. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the needs of and the challenges to on-the-job training for general practitioners, and to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> policy-makers to carry out this program more effectively. METHODS: We conducted 3 nominal group techniques, 17 in-depth interviews and 3 focus groups to identify the status of, needs of and challenges to on-the-job training for general practitioners in Liaoning, Ningxia, and Fujian provinces from September 2011 until December 2011. Audiotapes and transcripts were analyzed to identify major themes. Content analysis of the data was completed from January 2012 to March 2012. RESULTS: Basic theoretical knowledge and clinical skills were the main needs for general practitioners during on-the-job training. The challenges during training included the time contradiction between work and training, deficiencies of qualified preceptors, and lack of training funds. Participants gave recommendations how to resolve the above problems. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the outcomes of general practice on-the-job training, it is necessary for government officials to resolve the contradiction between work and training, train preceptors continuously, and increase financial support in the training program...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAdvanced process-based {{applications}} such as crisis and risk management require Emergent, Collaborative and Flexible (ECF) processes. These three features correspond to specific real-world requirements. Firstly, to face unpredictable situations, emergent processes are needed, i. e. processes whose model/schema is (partially) unknown at design-time and gradually defined/refined at run-time. Secondly, {{the complexity of the}} application domain being addressed requires collaborative processes, i. e. processes whose definition and enactment require interactions between groups of actors using their skills and experiences to make the process convergence towards their common goal. Thirdly, to adapt to the frequent changes that occur in their operating environment, flexible processes are needed, i. e. processes whose model/schema can be modified in real time. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a literature review to study the state of the art of process-based systems with a focus on the three above mentioned properties. Our approach is to specify real world requirements, then to discuss the adequacy of current systems to these requirements and finally to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> their improvement. Examined systems fall within the following areas: Business Process Management (BPM), Adaptive Case Management (ACM), Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and Knowledge Management (KM). The paper concludes on the insufficiency of existing systems and the need for designing and implementing a specific process-based system that integrates these three properties in a coherent framework...|$|E
40|$|Residential energy {{consumption}} (REC) {{is the second}} largest energy use category (10 %) in China and urban residents account {{for most of the}} REC. Understanding the underlying drivers of variations of urban REC thus helps to identify challenges and opportunities and <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> future policy measures. This paper applies the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to a decomposition of China’s urban REC during the period of 1998 - 2007 at disaggregated product/activity level using data collected {{from a wide range of}} sources. Our results have shown an extensive structure change towards a more energy-intensive household consumption structure as well as an intensive structure change towards high-quality and cleaner energy such as electricity, oil, and natural gas, which reflects a changing life style and consumption mode in pursuit of a higher level of comfort, convenience and environmental protection. We have also found that China’s price reforms in the energy sector have contributed to a reduction of REC while scale factors including increased urban population and income levels have played a key role in the rapid growth of REC. We suggest that further deregulation in energy prices and regulatory as well as voluntary energy efficiency and conservation policies in the residential sector should be promoted.

40|$|How {{to design}} {{automated}} procedures which (i) accurately assess {{the knowledge of}} a student, and (ii) efficiently <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> further study? To produce well-founded answers, Knowledge Space Theory relies on a combinatorial viewpoint on the assessment of knowledge, and thus departs from common, numerical evaluation. Its assessment procedures fundamentally differ from other current ones (such as those of S. A. T. and A. C. T.). They are adaptative (taking into account the possible correctness of previous answers from the student) and they produce an outcome which is far more informative than a crude numerical mark. This chapter recapitulates the main concepts underlying Knowledge Space Theory and its special case, Learning Space Theory. We begin by describing the combinatorial core of the theory, {{in the form of}} two basic axioms and the main ensuing results (most of which we give without proofs). In practical applications, learning spaces are huge combinatorial structures which may be difficult to manage. We outline methods providing efficient and comprehensive summaries of such large structures. We then describe the probabilistic part of the theory, especially the Markovian type processes which are instrumental in uncovering the knowledge states of individuals. In the guise of the ALEKS system, which includes a teaching component, these methods have been used by millions of students in schools and colleges, and by home schooled students. We summarize some of the results of these applications...|$|E
40|$|Background: Improving and {{sustaining}} {{the quality of}} nursing care is an intractable and persistent challenge. The patient experience of nursing care can give a different perspective on nursing quality and help clinical nursing staff to direct quality improvement. Attempts to identify what is patient experience, the relationship with nursing care, {{and the application of}} patient experience in nursing quality improvement practice, in order to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> constructing the quality standards and quality improvement strategies of nursing care. Methods: We conducted a literature review of original research publications. The database platforms Pubmed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang were searched from inception until end of August 2015. After screening retrieved articles, 40 sources (articles and organizational websites) were selected for analysis for the connotation, development and application of patient experience in nursing quality researches. Results: Our study identified several concepts about patient experience, roughly sorted out the development path of patient experience in worldwide and the application of patient experience in nursing quality improvement. It points out four precautions when applying patient experience in nursing quality improvement, which are differentiating patient satisfaction and patient experience, choosing appropriate data collection method and appropriate feedback time, and the last but the most important, applying theories to actual clinical practice. Conclusions: Professional indexes are important to maintain the care quality, but it cannot fully reflect quality of nursing care, which needs patient experience as the supplement. Nursing staffs need to make more efforts to enhance patient's nursing care experience, and apply the research results to clinical practice, and finally make patient-centered care come true. For future study, the evaluation system and management strategies about patient experience need to be developed to guide nursing quality improvement...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectivePhysiotherapists are {{demanding}} of valid outcome measures {{to assess the}} evolution of their patient's motor functions in order to precisely describe the effects of treatments and the progress of diseases. Hence, several scales such as the motor function measure (MFM) have been developed with the aim to measure, with validity and reproducibility and sensitivity, the motor functions of patients with neuromuscular disease. The originality of our approach is to quantitatively measure the children's motor functions with a low-cost, non-invasive and plug and play technological tool that avoid the uncertain characteristic of human evaluation and increase children's involvement. This project aims to propose a precise and reproducible tool {{to be used as}} an outcome measure for the MFM protocol in clinical trials. Materials/patients and methodsThis study focus on children from 6 to 18 years old with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 or 3 (SMA). The MFM protocol and its 32 items were selected. Firstly, to analyze the relevance of the 32 items in our context (MFM for SMA), the MFM's items were subjected to experts through a Delphi process. This process has enabled the extraction of specific items for SMA patients. Secondly, for each specified items, the technological needs in terms of detection and analysis were identified leading to the Microsoft Kinect as a preferential sensor which presents interesting measurements and advantageous usages. This sensor associated with a software developed by our research team, KiMe 2 (Kinetic Medical Measurement), permits to automatically score and <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> MFM's items. ResultsExperiments were proposed to adjust and validate the relevance of the KiMe 2 's score and advices. The first experiments made on selected items from the MFM with 5 volunteer patients showed good correlation between the score and opinions generated by our tool and the practicians’ evaluation. Discussion/ConclusionThe current tool may lack precision and ability to score specific cases. This project's future is to improve this tool in a twofold perspective:– to be able to fully deal all MFM's items and;– {{to take advantage of the}} Kinect's gaming features in order to develop entertaining activities for the MFM's practice...|$|E

40|$|Colours {{and lights}} have an {{influence}} on humans, mood and performance. In an indoor environment, walls and furniture colours affect {{the perception of the}} space and induce different emotions and psychological states. In the scientific literature several experiments have been addressed to study color preferences and emotional effects, also looking at different applications. Despite different adopted methods and visual tasks, findings are in quite agreement in asserting that "cool colours" as blue and green are relaxing, calming and peaceful, whereas "warm colours" as red and yellow result activating and arousing. On the other side "neutral colours" have less impact on emotions. As it is well known, white light emitted by lamps and luminaires is characterized by a colour tone, expressed by means of the correlated colour temperature(CCT). All experimental researches performed on circadian effects of light demonstrate that cool light, rich in short wavelengths, has a greater effect in terms of melatonin suppression rather than warm light, assuming the same illuminance value at the eye's level. CCT is not a synthetic parameter able to accurately quantify melatonin suppression, for example it roughly indicates that when very high values are attained, corresponding to a bluish white, circadian stimulus is high as well, once fixed the illuminance values. On the contrary warm light, characterized by low CCT values and corresponding to a reddish white has a lower impact, all other conditions being equal. Furthermore, researches confirmed that blue enriched light, i. e. light with a great amount of short‐wavelength radiations and CCT greater than 10000 K has a positive effect both on seasonal affective disorder (bright light reduces SAD symptoms) and on cognitive performance in educational and office environments, stimulating attention and alertness. As a consequence of the above reported statements, some contradictions seem to appear: in order to obtain relaxing environments cool colours for furniture are recommended, whereas red objects or walls can induce arousal or sense of danger or of alert. At the same time, warmer lights (i. e. reddish lights) are more relaxing and cooler lights (bluish) have a greater effect on melatonin suppression and alertness. As the colour of light is concerned, other parameters have an impact on environmental perception, as illuminances, {{as well as for the}} objects colours, not only hue, but also chroma and value are involved. In order to better understand and overcome these contradictions, we first provide a critical analysis of the current literature and present a preliminary analysis of comparisons between different spectral irradiances at the eye, troughout combined effects of light sources SPDs and objects spectral reflectances. This could be a first step of a wider research aimed to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> <b>for</b> interior and lighting designers on proper colour choices of either light and furniture for different applications...|$|E
