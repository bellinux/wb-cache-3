40|$|It is well {{established}} that interactions between tumor cells and the host tissue stroma {{play a key role}} in determining whether and how any given solid malignancy will develop. In most cases, tumor cells hijack stromal cell functions for their own benefit and ultimately dictate the rules of engagement to the host tissue microenvironment. However, the contribution of the different stromal cell components to tumor growth remains to be clarified. Because most solid tumors are accompanied by a local inflammatory response, it has long been thought that inflammation and carcinogenesis are related. If formal proof that cancer can be initiated by inflammation in the absence of <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> is still lacking, there is abundant evidence that the inflammatory response can play a central role in modulating tumor growth and progression.

We tested whether APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is particularly important in HPV-associated tumors by comparing the exomes of HPV+ and HPV− head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) sequenced by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. As expected, HPV− HNSCC displays a smoking-associated mutational signature, whereas our data suggest that reduced exposure to <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> in HPV+ HNSCC creates a selective pressure that favors emergence of tumors with APOBEC-mediated driver mutations.

In this study, we have analysed the pattern of point mutations in several tumour genes in 21 cases of bladder cancer arising among western European workers exposed to {{aromatic amines}} in an attempt to determine whether this exposure may be associated with a unique spectrum of mutations. Of the four genes analysed (p 53, p 16 MTS 1, p 21 WAF 1 and H-ras), only p 53 showed a high frequency of mutations (in 8 out of 21 cases, 38 %). Two mutations were found in p 16, one in H-ras and none in p 21 exon 3. All mutations were at G:C base pairs, mostly at non-CpG residues. This spectrum of mutations, which is highly suggestive of an involvement of <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> is however identical to the spectrum of p 53 mutations detected in bladder cancers of the general population. In exposed workers, p 53 mutations were associated with tumour grade and with high occupational and tobacco exposure.

40|$|DNA repair is {{essential}} for routine monitoring and repair of damage imparted to our genetic material by exposure to endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> including reactive oxygen species, UV light, and chemicals such as those found in cigarette smoke. Without DNA repair pathways, the continual assault on our DNA would be highly mutagenic {{and the risk of}} cancer increased. Paradoxically, the same pathways that help prevent cancer development are detrimental to the efficacy of DNA-damaging cancer therapeutics such as cisplatin. Recent studies demonstrate the inverse relationship between DNA repair capacity and efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapeutics: increased DNA repair capacity leads to resistance, while decreased capacity leads to increased sensitivities. Cisplatin's cytotoxic effects are mediated by formation of intrastrand DNA crosslinks, which are predominantly repaired via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. In an effort to personalize the treatment of cancers based on DNA repair capacity, we developed an ELISA-based assay to measure NER activity accurately and reproducibly as a prognostic for platinum-based treatments. Here we present an overview of DNA repair and its link to cancer and therapeutics. We also present data demonstrating the ability to detect the proteins of the pre-incision complex within the NER pathway from cell and tissue extracts. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 14, 2465 – 2477...|$|R

To test if TT mice are predisposed to liver carcinogenesis, we treated them with diethylnitrosamine, a hepatotropic carcinogen. Diethylnitrosamine-treated TT mice developed both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver. They showed an enhancement of LCD and developed basophilic liver cell nodules (BLCN), hepatocellular adenomas (HA), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HC). Both preneoplastic (LCD and BLCN) and neoplastic (HA and HC) lesions were significantly more frequent in TT than in control mice: 29. 7 % versus 12. 7 % for LCD, 57. 9 % versus 23. 3 % for BLCN, 40. 6 % versus 10. 0 % for HA, and 50. 0 % versus 12. 7 % for HC.

Recently some studies have explored the association between risk for cutaneous melanoma and non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in DNA-repair genes, although with contradictory results. We hypothesized that common nsSNPs of BER genes, specifically ADPRT rs 1136410, XRCC 1 rs 25487, rs 25489, rs 1799782, APEX 1 rs 1130409, OGG 1 rs 1052133, LIG 3 rs 3136025 and MUTYH rs 3219466, may contribute to risk of melanoma. The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not a correlation between these nsSNPs and melanoma risk and/or aggressiveness is present. 167 melanoma patients and 186 healthy control subjects were analysed. By multivariate statistical analysis no association was found between nsSNP and melanoma aggressiveness, while only the two XRCC 1 (rs 25487 and rs 25489) nsSNPs showed a strong correlation (p< 0. 001) with melanoma risk. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting an association between BER nsSNPs and melanoma risk in Central-South Italian individuals. Our findings, if confirmed in larger population studies, will allow the inclusion of these XRCC 1 nsSNPs in a screening panel for those individuals at higher risk for melanoma...|$|R

Gastroesophageal reflux disease induces regurgitant esophagitis, and esophageal mucosa is usually regenerated by squamous epithelium, but sometimes and somewhere replaced with metaplastic columnar epithelium. Specialized columnar epithelium, so-called Barrett’s epithelium (BE), is a risk factor for dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in esophagus. Several experiments using rodent model inducing duodenogastroesophageal reflux or duodenoesophageal reflux revealed that columnar epithelium, first emerging at the proliferative zone, progresses to dysplasia and finally adenocarcinoma, and <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogen</b> is not necessary for cancer development. It is demonstrated that duodenal juice rather than gastric juice is essential to develop esophageal adenocarcinoma in not only rodent experiments, but also clinical studies. Antireflux surgery and chemoprevention by proton pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors, green tea, retinoic acid and thioproline showed preventive effects on the development of Barrett’s adenocarcinoma in rodent models, but it remains controversial whether antireflux surgery could regress BE and prevent esophageal cancer in clinical observation.

40|$|Mitotic {{homologous}} recombination {{is a critical}} pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although {{homologous recombination}} is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate homologous recombination are {{associated with an increased}} risk of cancer. To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. (cont.) Results show that exposure to these DNA damaging agents causes an induction of recombinant pancreatic cells in vivo, indicating that homologous recombination is an active repair pathway in adult pancreatic cells and that exposure to certain carcinogens stimulates recombinational repair. As a first step towards exploring the effect of genetic predisposition to genomic instability on homologous recombination in vivo, FYDR mice were crossed with mice carrying a defect in p 53, a critical tumor suppressor that is mutated in almost 50 % of all human tumors. Although loss of p 53 is known to promote genomic instability, results show that p 53 status does not significantly affect the spontaneous recombinant cell frequency in the pancreas in vivo or the rate of homologous recombination in cultured fibroblasts in vitro. Age is a risk factor for many types of cancers. Here we examined the effect of age on homologous recombination in two tissues of FYDR mice, pancreas and skin. In the pancreas, a dramatic accumulation of recombinant cells is seen with age, resulting from both de novo recombination events and clonal expansion of recombinant cells. In contrast, the skin shows no increase in recombinant cell frequency with age. (cont.) In vitro studies using primary fibroblasts indicate that the ability to undergo homologous recombination in response to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage does not significantly change with age, suggesting that these skin cells are able to undergo de novo homologous recombination events in aged mice. Thus, we propose that tissue-specific differences in the accumulation of recombinant cells with age result from differences in the ability of these cells to persist and clonally expand within the tissue. To further characterize the FYDR mice as a tool for studying homologous recombination, we exploited positive control FYDR-Recombined mice in which all cells carry the full-length coding sequence for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Studies show that expression of the FYDR transgene varies among mice, among tissues, and even among cells within a tissue. However, the variation in FYDR expression does not significantly change with age or exposure to <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> Furthermore, positive control mice reveal that several tissues, in addition to the pancreas and skin, may be amenable for studying homologous recombination in the FYDR mice. (cont.) Thus, our studies demonstrate that FYDR mice combined with in situ imaging technology provide powerful tools to study the effects of cancer risk factors on homologous recombination in vivo. Ultimately, by applying these techniques to study additional cancer risk factors, we may better understand the relationship between DNA damage, homologous recombination and cancer. by Dominika M.

The macro model embodies new ideas about the labor market, all based on equilibrium %u 2013 the models I consider do not rest on inefficiency in the use of labor caused by an inappropriate wage. I find that non-standard features of the labor market are essential for understanding the volatility of unemployment. These models include simple equilibrium wage stickiness, where the sticky wage is an equilibrium selection rule. A second model based on modern bargaining theory delivers a different kind of stickiness and has a unique equilibrium. A third model posits fluctuations in matching efficiency that may arise from variations over time in the information about prospective jobs among job-seekers. Reasonable calibrations of each of the three models match the observed volatility of unemployment. ...|$|R
40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are {{a family}} of transmembrane pattern {{recognition}} receptors (PRR) that {{play a key role}} in innate and adaptive immunity by recognizing structural components unique to bacteria, fungi and viruses. TLR 4 is the most studied of the TLRs, and its <b>primary</b> <b>exogenous</b> ligand is lipopolysaccharide, a component of Gram-negative bacterial walls. In the absence of exogenous microbes, endogenous ligands including damage-associated molecular pattern molecules from damaged matrix and injured cells can also activate TLR 4 signaling. In humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TLR 4 gene have an effect on its signal transduction and on associated risks of specific diseases, including cirrhosis. In liver, TLR 4 is expressed by all parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell types, and contributes to tissue damage caused by a variety of etiologies. Intact TLR 4 signaling was identified in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the major fibrogenic cell type in injured liver, and mediates key responses including an inflammatory phenotype, fibrogenesis and anti-apoptotic properties. Further clarification of the function and endogenous ligands of TLR 4 signaling in HSCs and other liver cells could uncover novel mechanisms of fibrogenesis and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{malignant}} tumors have different {{internal and external}} factors and also have been shown that, for majority of <b>exogenous</b> chemical <b>carcinogens,</b> the genotoxicity depends on metabolic activation through enzymes. Members of the subfamilies CYP 1 A are involved in activation of precarcinogens, for example the heterocyclic amine PhIP. One of the main approaches to achieve a reduction in a cancer risk is prevention. Recently, the consumption of dietary supplements containing various chemopreventive substances, such as flavonoids, has expanded. On the other hand, some negative effects of these compounds were also confirmed, especially their ability to induce cytochrome P 450 and thus {{increase the risk of}} activating precarcinogens. In this study, the inductive effect of a single administration of chemopreventive compounds, namely the effect of -naphtoflavon to cytochrome P 450, had been investigated. Furthermore, a sequential study was carried out. In this study rats were first given an inducer, the -naphtoflavon, and after a passed interval they were given the carcinogen PhIP. Finally, the effect of PhIP on the activity of cytochrome P 450 has been studied in vitro. KEY WORDS: cytochrome P 450, carcinogens, chemopreventive compound...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are an {{important}} part of the cellular detoxification system and, perhaps, evolved to protect cells against reactive oxygen metabolites. Theta is considered the most ancient among the GSTs and theta-like GSTs are found in mammals, fish, insects, plants, unicellular algae, and bacteria. It is thought that an ancestral theta-gene underwent an early duplication before the divergence of fungi and animals and further duplications generated the variety of the other classes of GSTs (alpha, mu, phi, etc.). The comparison of the aminoacidic homologies among mammals suggests that a duplication of an ancient GST theta occurred before the speciation of mammals and resulted in the subunits GSTT 1 and GSTT 2. The ancestral GST theta has a dehalogenase activity towards several halogenated compounds, such as the dichloromethane. In fact, some aerobic and anaerobic methylotrophic bacteria can use these molecules as the sole carbon and energy source. The mammalian GST theta cannot sustain the growth of bacteria but still retains the dehalogenating activity. Therefore, although mammalian GST theta behaves as a scavenger towards electrophiles, such as epoxides, it acts also as metabolic activator for halogenated compounds, producing a variety of intermediates potentially dangerous for DNA and cells. For example, mice exposed to dichloromethane show a dose-dependent incidence of cancer via the GSTT 1 - 1 pathway. Because GSTT 1 - 1 is polymorphic in humans, with about 20 % of Caucasians and 80 % of Asians lacking the enzyme, the relationship between the phenotype and the incidence of cancer has been investigated extensively in order to detect GSTT 1 - 1 -associated differential susceptibility towards endogenous or <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> The lack of the enzyme is related to a slightly increased risk of cancer of the bladder, gastro-intestinal tract, and for tobacco-related tumors (lung or oral cavity). More pronounced risks were found in males with the GSTT 1 -null genotype for brain diseases and skin basal cell carcinomas not related to sunlight exposures. Moreover, there was an increased risk of kidney and liver tumors in humans with the GSTT 1 - 1 positive genotype following exposures to halogenated solvents. Interestingly, the liver and kidney are two organs that express the highest level of GST theta in the human body. Thus, the GSTT 1 - 1 genotype is suspected to confer decreased or increased risk of cancer in relation to the source of exposure; in vitro studies, mostly conducted on metabolites of butadiene, confirm the protective action of GSTT 1 - 1, whereas, thus far, experimental studies prove that the increasing risk is limited...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Barrett's {{esophagus}} and adenocarcinoma of {{the esophagus}} {{are related to}} long-standing duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux. The development of an animal model in which Barrett's esophagus and/or carcinoma is induced by duodeno-(gastro-) esophageal reflux could provide {{better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence and would create the possibility of investigating new treatment strategies for this aggressive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two rat models were analyzed. In the first experiment, 44 male Sprague Dawley rats underwent end-to-side esophagojejunostomy with gastric resection, to ensure duodenoesophageal reflux without gastric acid. In the second experiment a side-to-side esophago-gastrojejunostomy was performed in 30 rats, ensuring duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux. In both experiments animals were not exposed to any <b>exogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> during the experiment. Sequential morphological changes (i. e., esophagitis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma) were studied after 4, 6, and 12 months. To analyze histopathologic characteristics, evaluation of the hematoxylin and eosin specimens was combined with immunohistochemical stainings for high-iron diamine-alcian blue, alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff, the proliferation marker PCNA, and mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p 53. RESULTS: In the first experiment, only 11 animals survived the postoperative period. These animals had to be sacrificed at a median of 11 weeks due to persistent weight loss and failure to thrive. Severe ulcerative esophagitis was seen in all animals, with a 2 -mm segment of metaplastic epithelium found at the anastomosis. In four animals a large, well-differentiated, mucinous tumor without malignant characteristics was observed. In the second experiment, eight animals died postoperatively. Twelve animals were sacrificed according to protocol at 4 or 6 months. In these animals, extensive esophagitis with squamous cell hyperplasia was found. In addition, a short (2 mm) segment of metaplastic epithelium was observed, without dysplasia. The remaining animals survived 1 year. After 1 year, 9 of the 10 animals had developed a glandular metaplastic segment (median length, 10 mm), which was histologically and immunohistologically characteristic for the specialized columnar epithelium of Barrett's esophagus without signs of dysplasia. Finally, in seven animals a mucinous tumor with cytologic characteristics of a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma was found without infiltrative growth. These tumors were always found {{at the site of the}} anastomosis, originated in the submucosa, and did not reach either the luminal surface or the muscular layer. The mucinous lesions were not positive for p 53, and PCNA was only slightly increased. Although they showed cytological characteristics of malignancy, histopathologic evaluation was more suggestive of a reactive mucous producing lesion fitting the diagnosis "esophagitis cystica profunda. " CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the development of a long Barrett's segment in an animal duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux model. Although mucinous tumors resembling adenocarcinomas develop around the anastomosis, these are probably not reflux induced and are more likely to be reactive lesions. However, the true nature of these tumors remains to be elucidate...|$|R

Serum IgA-antibodies specific to benzo[a]pyrene, estradiol and progesterone were studied in 203 non-smoking healthy women and 469 non-smoking breast cancer patients (125 with ER– and 344 with ER+) using semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay. results. The low levels of all three antibodies were revealed in 53. 2 % of healthy donors, in 47. 2 % of breast cancer patients with ER– and in 40. 7 % of patients with ER+. The high levels of all three antibodies were found in 12. 3 %, 18. 4 % and 26. 5 % of cases, respectively. In the studied groups, the levels of antibodies to estradiol and progesterone were correlated with the levels of antibodies to benzo[a]pyrene (rs= 0. 54 – 0. 7, p< 0. 0001). Conclusion. Immunoassay of antibodies to exogenous and endogenous antigens could be useful for determining risk of developing ER+ breast cancer and preventing administration of tamoxifen and others selective modulators of estrogen receptors.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that there is a 90 % overlap between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of environmental chemicals (1) and that environmental exposure to carcinogens contributes to the development of more than 80 % of human cancers (2). Cancer is also considered to be a genetic disease because genetic alterations at either chromosomal or gene levels have been iden-tified in most cancers. In multistep carcinogenesis (3), initial damage to DNA may lead to tumorigenesis and/or carcinogen-esis due to functional imbalance between oncogenes (4), tumor suppressor genes (5), and DNA repair genes (6), perhaps as a result of mutation fixation of the damage.
