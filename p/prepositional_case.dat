40|$|Researchers {{have long}} debated the {{meanings}} of morphological cases, as markers of core arguments as well as adjunct phrases. However, the proposed semantic paraphrases have traditionally mainly relied on introspection and usually prove problematic from an observational standpoint. This article explores the semantics of variable case marking {{by focusing on the}} distribution of the Accusative and Dative in phrases with two-way prepositions in present-day German. The empirical aim of the article is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the conditions under which the variation between Accusative and Dative occurs in German locative constructions with prepositional verbs. To this end, a classification of four subclasses of prepositional verbs is presented and discussed. The theoretical aim of the article is to confront current cognitive claims about case meanings in German with observations that Hermann Paul made about a century ago in his Deutsche Grammatik (1916 - 1920). It is concluded, firstly, that cognitive-semantic explanations tend to overspecify the semantic content encoded in the case morphemes while at the same time underestimating the importance of inference and psychological associations of all kind. Secondly, an alternative approach is presented which emphasises the role of syntactic constructions in the case alternation. It is shown that Paul's account is valuable because of the way it combines a balanced view of the relative semantic homogeneity of <b>prepositional</b> <b>cases</b> with instructive corpus findings on variable case marking. Furthermore, Paul's account contains several aspects that characterise it as a "constructionist" analysis avant la lettre. It is argued that this kind of analysis is superior to the currently dominant projectionist approach for a number of reasons...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are often}} {{similarities}} in form between adpositions and adverbs. Some adverbs {{are derived from}} the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as downstairs, from down (the) stairs, and underground, from under (the) ground). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as inside, aboard, underneath (for instance, one can say [...] "go inside", with adverbial use, or [...] "go inside the house", with <b>prepositional</b> use). Such <b>cases</b> are analogous to verbs {{that can be used}} either transitively or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as [...] "intransitive prepositions". This analysis could also be extended to other adverbs, such as here, there, afterwards, etc., even though these never take complements.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present a}} method for {{aligning}} English and Italian parallel verb phrases which have pronominal subjects. The phrases contain the pronominal subject, the verbal elements of a verb phrase (VP) and the negation. I use English parse trees and part of speech tagged Italian sentences. The process of aligning parallel phrases consists of several steps. An Italian sentence is searched in order to nd all Italian VPs. In the parallel English sentence, the clauses with pronominal subjects are detected. Base word alignment (created by GIZA++) {{of the elements of}} an English VP is used to identify the matching Italian VP. The alignment of parallel phrases is computed by applying alignment rules which de ne the alignment between words with a speci c part of speech tag. The rule-based VP alignment reaches f-score of 81 % whereas f-score of the base word alignment is 64 %. The rules compute correct alignments for most parallel VPs. However, they produce erroneous alignments if false parallel phrases are identi ed. This is the case when the English VP is not translated, or when it corresponds to an Italian phrase of an arbitrary type (e. g. <b>prepositional</b> phrase).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} new approach to case. It unifies its syntax, morphology and semantics in a simple, fine-grained and restrictive picture. One of the assumptions frequently made in works on case is that cases such as nominative and accusative are not primitive entities, but they are each composed of various features. The central hypothesis of this dissertation is that these features are universal, and each of them is its own terminal node in the syntactic tree. Individual cases thus correspond to phrasal constituents built out of these terminals. The idea that syntactic trees are built by Merge from individual atomic features is one of the core principles of a cartographic approach to syntax pursued by M. Starke: Nanosyntax. Hence “The nanosyntax of case. ” I motivate the approach on the material of case syncretism. I propose a hypothesis according to which case syncretism across various languages obeys a single restrictive template. The template corresponds to a cross-linguistically fixed sequence of cases, in which only adjacent cases show syncretism. In order to derive this, I argue that case features are syntactic heads, ordered in a universal functional sequence. If this is so, it follows that these sub-morphemic features interact with core syntactic processes, such as movement. The prediction is borne out: the interaction of (phrasal) movement and the fine-grained syntactic representation derives a typological generalization concerning cross-linguistic variation in the amount of case marking (Blake’s hierarchy). Additional facts fall out from the picture: the role of functional prepositions, <b>prepositional</b> syncretism, <b>case</b> compounding, and preposition stacking. I further investigate in detail the spell out of these highly articulate structures. I follow Starke (2005) and propose that individual morphemes spell out phrasal constituents of varying size, and that their insertion is governed by the Superset Principle. I argue that phrasal spell out is both empirically required, and theoretically beneficial: it simplifies the overall architecture of grammar. In particular, there is no part left to play for a separate morphological structure. With the proposal in place, I observe that there are generalizations which connect the proposed representation and the DP external syntax. To account for this, I adopt the Peeling theory of movement (Starke 2005). The theory says that arguments are base-generated with a number of case projections on top of them, and they strand these projections when they move up in the tree. The theory is shown to capture the initial observations, as well as additional generalizations: Burzio’s generalization among them. The resulting theory does not introduce any domain specific tools to account for case: its representation corresponds to a binary syntactic structure, its computation corresponds to syntactic movement...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new description and theoretical {{analysis of the}} nominal system of Katcha (Nilo-Saharan, Kadu), spoken in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. The description and analysis {{are based on a}} synthesis of data from several sources, including unpublished archive material and original fieldwork. The study is placed in context with a discussion of the demographic, cultural and political background affecting the Katcha linguistic community, a review of the current state of linguistic research on Katcha and a discussion of the ongoing controversy over the place of the Kadu languages within the language phyla of Africa. The morphosyntactic descriptions first focus on the role of nominals as heads, considering phenomena such as classification, agreement and modification. It is shown that Katcha has a unusual system of gender agreement with three agreement classes based on the concepts of Masculine, Feminine and Plural and that the gender of a noun may change between its singular and plural forms. Surprisingly, these phenomena are both most commonly found in Afro-Asiatic, which is not a phylum to which Kadu has previously been ascribed. The gender changes are shown to be predictable, determined by number-marking affixes. The study then gives a unified analysis of various types of nominal modifiers; relative clauses, possessives, demonstratives and adjectives all display similar morphological properties and this is accounted for by analysing all modfiers as appositional, headed by a demonstrative pronoun. This analysis of modifiers shows them to be related to, though not the same as, the notions of relative markers and construct state found widely in African languages. The role of nominals within sentential argument structure is then considered, with discussion of phenomena such as <b>prepositional</b> phrases, <b>case</b> and verbal valency. From the interaction of prepositions and pronouns, it is tentatively concluded that Katcha has three cases: Nominative, Accusative and Oblique. From the interaction of verbs and nouns, it is demonstrated that the verbal suffixes known as ‘verb extensions’ primarily serve to license the absence of otherwise mandatory core arguments. The second part of the thesis provides a theoretical analysis of the nominal system within the framework of Dynamic Syntax (DS). Two key features of the DS formalism come into play. Firstly, DS construes semantic individuals as terms of the epsilon calculus. Verb extensions are analysed as projecting context-dependent epsilon terms, providing a value for the ‘missing’ argument. Secondly, DS allows information sharing between propositions by means of a ‘LINK’ relation. Prepositional phrases are analysed as projecting a subordinate proposition which shares an argument with the matrix tree. These two formal tools come together in the analysis of nominal modifiers, which are construed as projecting an arbitrarily complex epsilon term LINKed to some term in the matrix tree, directly reflecting their descriptive analysis as appositional nominals. In presenting new data for a little studied language, this thesis adds to our knowledge and understanding of Nuba Mountain languages. In describing and analysing some of the typologically unsual features of Katcha’s nominal system, it challenges some standard assumptions about these constructions and about the genetic affiliation of the Kadu family. And in the theoretical analysis it demonstrates the suitability of Dynamic Syntax to model some of the key insights of the descriptive analysis...|$|R
