40|$|This paper {{describes}} a concept for active pantograph control, {{aimed at reducing}} contact force fluctuation in the low frequency range related to the span-passing frequency. This is based on measuring <b>pantograph</b> <b>frame</b> acceleration and compensating its inertia {{by means of a}} control force exerted by the pneumatic spring placed {{at the bottom of the}} articulated frame. The use of devices currently equipping the pantograph, such as the air spring to raise/lower the pantograph and a servo-valve to regulate the preload, makes the system cheap and feasibly installable on service trains...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend our {{previous}} work concerning {{the regulation of}} the contact force in active train pantographs with wire-actuators. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the contact force, instead of measuring it, {{by means of the}} measured displacements of the upper and lower <b>pantograph</b> <b>frames.</b> The estimation method, based on the algebraic observability theory, entails the use of real-time sliding-mode differentiators. It makes use explicitly of the upper frame mechanical characteristics, but does not require any other information concerning the system model. We consider our previously proposed second-order sliding mode control scheme, which also includes proper linear compensating cascade filters devoted to cope with the de-stabilizing effects of the resonant wire actuator. We show that such a control scheme can be effectively combined with the given contact force estimation method...|$|R

To give a proper un-derstanding of dynamic characteristics, the paper uses a combination of mass drop tests on a catenary, analytic models and parametric _nite element model simulations allowing a ne analysis of the inuence of train speed. The _rst contributor to contact force variations is the geometry of the catenary under gravity loading. This parameter is however shown to be insu_cient to explain higher frequency e_ects. The second contributor is the propagation of waves in the contact and messenger wires. The inuence of wave dis-persion is _rst demonstrated, which {{emphasizes the importance of}} considering the bending sti_ness. Wave compensation by droppers and reections at the mast are then shown to be important. Characteristic times associated with wave group velocities are _nally used to explain the series of harmonic contributions visible in spectra in the catenary and <b>pantograph</b> <b>frames.</b> Finally, modes are shown to play a role particularly when their frequencies coincide with other contributions. The notion of mode groups, associated wave velocities and relevant design variables are discussed. Several observations pave the way for future work on catenarydesign...|$|R
30|$|Actually, {{both the}} {{pantograph}} and the catenary could be damaged if the contact force {{is too large}} as this could cause a contact wire breaking and stop the current collection. On the other hand, the pantograph and the catenary could lose their contact if the contact force is too small, which could cause an electric arc and accelerate the degradation of the contact wire. Therefore, considering at least these effects, many researchers have tried to design active controllers {{in order to ensure}} that the contact force remains as constant as possible [2]. Thus, to deal with this problem, the catenary device was first modeled with a constant stiffness. Then, optimal control strategies have been proposed [3]. This solution was sufficiently effective to reject external disturbances, but finding the optimal control gains while satisfying simultaneous objectives and hard constraints was beyond the adopted strategy. Thereafter, in order to improve the active control system performances, approximate models of the pantographâ€“catenary (PAC) system were considered [4, 5]. Accordingly, many researchers assumed that the complex dynamics of the catenary might be well approximated by a linear mechanical system with space-varying lumped parameters. In this sense, the catenary parameters could be considered time-varying with a rate determined by the train speed [6]. Then, as uncertainties are present in almost all designed models, use of robust control techniques was proposed [7], while sometimes the problem was solved by tuning standard PID controllers [6]. More recently, a second-order sliding mode-based control scheme [8, 9] that estimates the contact force using the measured displacements of the upper and lower <b>pantograph</b> <b>frames</b> was formally presented using the algebraic observability theory [10]. Nonetheless, this approach turns out to require more knowledge, as it requires the value of the control force applied to the upper frame, the velocity and the acceleration of the upper and lower frames, which could render the control system complex and expensive. Alternately, in other works, to perform output feedback, the contact force is evaluated by means of load cells whose measurements are compensated by accelerometers [11], which could also be very expensive mainly for their quick deterioration during the runs of the train.|$|R
