Because solution space of elevator scheduling is enormous, to solve RO certain model in short time, ant colony solving algorithm for elevator scheduling is proposed. Based on the algorithm, optimal scheduling solutions are found quickly, and group elevators are scheduled according to the solutions.

40|$|AbstractWork zones on freeways usually {{affect the}} quality of service for road users. Aiming to reduce traffic flow {{disruptions}} to a minimum, Hessen Mobil – Road and Traffic Management installed an innovative reversible lane system in a work zone on Autobahn A 3 south-east of Frankfurt, Germany. The section with three lanes and temporary hard shoulder running in both directions carries a high amount of commuter traffic with considerable fluctuations in <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> direction. During road works, four lanes in the peak direction and three lanes in the non-peak direction could be maintained {{through the use of a}} reversible lane system. The paper discusses the effects of the reversible lane system on traffic flow and road safety. Radar measurements revealed a maximum traffic volume of roughly 1500 veh/h on the reversible lane, which is around 25 % of the total traffic volume during peak hours. The capacity of the work zone was estimated with the stochastic capacity estimation technique based on models for censored data. Compared with the capacity of the unaffected three-lane carriageway with temporary hard shoulder running, a decrease of the capacity by 14 % to 17 % was estimated for the four-lane work zone configuration including the reversible lane, depending on the direction. The difference between the capacities in both directions can be explained by the different lane geometries at the respective beginning of the work zone, leading to a higher number of lane changing manoeuvers directly upstream of the lane diverge in one direction. The traffic flow analysis also yielded a considerable impact of the work zone on peak hour traffic demand volumes, which were reduced by approximately 1000 veh/h. Similar to other freeway work zones, the road safety analysis revealed an increase of accident rates during road works. However, based on police accident reports only 10 % of the total number of accidents and none of the severe accidents could be linked to particular features of the reversible lane system. Altogether, the investigation shows that a reversible lane system is a useful, safe and accepted instrument of intelligent traffic management for freeway work zones with high fluctuations in <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> direction. At the analyzed work zone, estimated travel time losses of 400000 veh*h could be saved during two months of road works by the application of the reversible lane compared with a permanent lane reduction in one direction...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a field {{study focused on}} the dispersion of a traffic-related pollutant within an area close to a busy intersection between two street canyons in Central London. Simultaneous measurements of airflow, traffic flow and carbon monoxide concentrations ([CO]) are used to explore the causes of spatial variability in [CO] over {{a full range of}} background wind directions. Depending on the roof-top wind direction, evidence of both flow channelling and recirculation regimes were identified from data collected within the main canyon and the intersection. However, at the intersection, the merging of channelled flows from the canyons increased the flow complexity and turbulence intensity. These features, coupled with the close proximity of nearby queuing traffic in several directions, led to the highest overall time-average measured [CO] occurring at the intersection. Within the main street canyon, the data supported the presence of a helical flow regime for oblique roof-top flows, leading to increased [CO] on the canyon leeward side. Predominant wind directions led to some locations having significantly higher diurnal average [CO] due to being mostly on the canyon leeward side during the study period. For all locations, small changes in the background wind direction could cause large changes in the in-street mean wind angle and local turbulence intensity, implying that dispersion mechanisms would be highly sensitive to small changes in above roof flows. During <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> periods, concentrations within parallel side streets were approximately four times lower than within the main canyon and intersection which has implications for controlling personal exposure. Overall, the results illustrate that pollutant concentrations can be highly spatially variable over even short distances within complex urban geometries, and that synoptic wind patterns, traffic queue location and building topologies all play a role in determining where pollutant hot spots occur. ...|$|E

The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize short-term temporal variation of vehicular pollutant gradients within 200 – 400 m of a major highway (&gt; 150 000 vehicles/d). Monitoring was done near Interstate 93 in Somerville (Massachusetts) from 06 : 00 to 11 : 00 on 16 January 2008 using a mobile monitoring platform equipped with instruments that measured ultrafine and fine particles (6 – 1000 nm, particle number concentration (PNC)); particle-phase (&gt; 30 nm) NO 3 &minus;, SO 4 2 &minus;, and organic compounds; volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and CO 2 , NO, NO 2 , and O 3 . We observed rapid changes in pollutant gradients due to variations in highway traffic flow rate, wind speed, and surface boundary layer height. Before sunrise and <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> rates, downwind concentrations of particles, CO 2 , NO, and NO 2 were highest within 100 - 250 m of the highway. After sunrise pollutant levels declined sharply (e. g., PNC and NO were more than halved) and the gradients became less pronounced as wind speed increased and the surface boundary layer rose allowing mixing with cleaner air aloft. The levels of aromatic VOCs and NO 3 &minus;, SO 4 2 &minus; and organic aerosols were generally low throughout the morning, and their spatial and temporal variations were less pronounced compared to PNC and NO. O 3 levels increased throughout the morning due to mixing with O 3 -enriched air aloft and were generally lowest near the highway reflecting reaction with NO. There was little if any evolution in the size distribution of 6 – 225 nm particles with distance from the highway.

Quantification of kerb and urban increments (defined as kerb-to-urban and urban-to-rural concentration ratios, respectively), {{and assessment of}} diurnal and weekly variability provided insight into sources governing urban air quality {{and the effects of}} urban micro-environments on human exposure. Traffic-related elements yielded the highest kerb increments, with values in the range of 10. 4 to 16. 6 for SW winds (3. 3 – 6. 9 for NE) observed for elements influenced by brake wear (e. g. Cu, Sb, Ba) and 5. 7 to 8. 2 for SW (2. 6 – 3. 0 for NE) for other traffic-related processes (e. g. Cr, Fe, Zn). Kerb increments for these elements were highest in the PM 10 – 2. 5 mass fraction, roughly twice that of the PM 1. 0 – 0. 3 fraction. These elements also showed the highest urban increments (~ 3. 0), although no difference was observed between brake wear and other traffic-related elements. All elements influenced by traffic exhibited higher concentrations during morning and evening rush hours, and on weekdays compared to weekends, with the strongest trends observed at the kerbside site, and additionally enhanced by winds coming directly from the road, consistent with street canyon effects. Elements related to mineral dust (e. g.

To solve the above problems, it is planned to build toll roads Benoa-Bandara-Nusa Dua. The objectives of this study were to analyze the performance of existing roads with and without the toll road, the rates applicable to service users and to analyze the financial feasibility of the investment of the project.   Analysis was performed for several scenarios, including the scenario- 1, assuming traffic growth factor of i = 9. 96 % / year, the interest rate 16 % / year, inflation accounted for 8. 506 % / year and the toll rates using rates set by the Jasa Marga. All of the cost including land acquisition and construction costs were provided by investors. It was found that for the scenario- 1, the  NPV is Rp 1, 586, 137, 984, 347, -, BCR: 0. 4754 and IRR 3, 8676 %. The results of the financial analysis indicated that investment of the toll roads Benoa-Bandara-Nusa Dua is not financially feasible. In order for this project to be financially feasible, the growth rate of vehicles should be at least i = 14. 7 % / year. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>flow</b> {{in cities}} is usually {{examined}} locally. This method is not effective for through traffic analysis. The paper discusses {{the problem of}} determining <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> hours taking into account vehicle distributions. Peak hours represent time periods of <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> which demand special treatment by traffic control systems. This is particularly important {{in the case of}} ITS. High values of <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> require relieving actions not only at the junctions but preferably along the transit routes. The north-south transit route in Bielsko-Biała was chosen for analysis. Instead of the usual two distinct peaks it is determined that the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> is characterised by five peaks. This pattern is the result of specific location of the route, which links residential areas, industrial zones and shopping centres besides carrying through <b>traffic.</b> This multi <b>peak</b> graph more accurately models the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of heterogeneous traffic on the temporal variation of ambient PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1 concentrations at a busy arterial route (Sardar Patel Road) in the Chennai city has been analyzed. The hourly PM concentration, traffic counts and average speed of the vehicles have been monitored at the study site for one week (19 th- 25 th January 2009). Results indicated that the concentrations of coarse (PM 10) and fine PM (PM 2. 5 and PM 1) concentrations at SP road are having similar trend during peak and non-peak hours, irrespective of the days. The PM concentrations showed daily two peaks corresponding to morning (8 to 10 am) and evening (7 to 9 pm) <b>peak</b> hour <b>traffic</b> <b>flow.</b> The PM 10 concentration is dominated by fine particles (53 % of PM 2. 5 and 45 % of PM 1). The high PM 2. 5 /PM 10 ratio indicates {{that the majority of}} PM 10 particles originate from re-suspension of road dust. The analysis of <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> at the study site showed that 2 W, 3 W and 4 W are having similar diurnal trend as PM concentrations. This confirms that the 2 W, 3 W and 4 W are the main emission source contributing to ambient PM concentration at SP road. The speed measurement at SP road showed that the average speed of 2 W, 3 W, 4 W, LCV and HCV are 38, 40...|$|R
