5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during <b>perimenopause</b> (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{menopause}} transition typically begins between 40 and 50 {{years of}} age (average 47.5). The duration of <b>perimenopause</b> may be for up to eight years. Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (<b>perimenopause</b> and menopause) {{about the same time}} as their mother did.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perimenopause</b> is {{a natural}} stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not {{automatically}} require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of <b>perimenopause</b> are strong enough that they significantly disrupt {{the life of the}} woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|During <b>perimenopause,</b> {{estrogen}} levels {{average about}} 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause {{many of the}} physical changes during <b>perimenopause</b> as well as menopause. Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease. During this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{considered}} to {{play a significant role}} in women’s mental health. Sudden estrogen withdrawal, fluctuating estrogen, and periods of sustained estrogen low levels correlate with significant mood lowering. Clinical recovery from postpartum, <b>perimenopause,</b> and postmenopause depression has been shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{considered}} to {{play a significant role}} in women’s mental health, with links suggested between the hormone level, mood and well-being. Sudden drops or fluctuations in, or long periods of sustained low levels of estrogen may be correlated with significant mood-lowering. Clinical recovery from depression postpartum, <b>perimenopause,</b> and postmenopause was shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{beneficial}} {{potential of}} HRT was bolstered in a consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society, which stated that when taken during <b>perimenopause</b> or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT {{in the appropriate}} clinical scenario.|$|E
25|$|A symptohormonal {{method of}} FAM {{developed}} at Marquette University uses the ClearBlue Easy fertility monitor {{to determine the}} fertile window. The monitor measures estrogen and LH to determine the peak day. This method is also applicable during postpartum, breastfeeding, and <b>perimenopause,</b> and requires less abstinence than other FAM methods. Some couples prefer this method because the monitor reading is objective and is not affected by sleep quality as BBT can be.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{a barrier}} or other backup method is {{required}} on fertile days; otherwise the couple must abstain. To reduce pregnancy risk to below 1% per year, {{there are an}} average of 13 days where abstinence or backup must be used during each cycle. For women with very irregular cycles—such as those common during breastfeeding, <b>perimenopause,</b> or with hormonal diseases such as PCOS—abstinence {{or the use of}} barriers may be required for months at a time.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{lubrication}} is {{a common}} problem during and after <b>perimenopause.</b> Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.|$|E
25|$|In younger women, {{during a}} normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, {{testosterone}} and progesterone in a cyclical pattern {{under the control}} of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During <b>perimenopause</b> (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin. Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{flashes and}} other vasomotor {{symptoms}} accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue {{to claim that}} hot flashes during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935 and, in most cases, hot flashes are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate hypothalamic dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early <b>perimenopause</b> and late menopausal transition {{and it is possible}} that they are caused by a different mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The current {{indications}} for {{use from}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor hot flashes or urogenital atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis. In 2012, the United States Preventive Task Force concluded that {{the harmful effects of}} combined estrogen and progestin are likely to exceed the chronic disease prevention benefits in most women. A consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during <b>perimenopause,</b> or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology also released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in appropriate clinical scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Menopause is the {{permanent}} cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity. Menopause {{can be divided}} into early and late transition periods, also known as <b>perimenopause</b> and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms. It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness. The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.|$|E
500|$|Infrequent or {{irregular}} ovulation {{is called}} oligoovulation. The absence of ovulation is called anovulation. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and [...] stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow {{resulting from a}} very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (<b>perimenopause)</b> and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E

[...] Some couples prefer this method because the monitor reading is objective and is not affected by sleep quality as BBT can be.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{conditions}} that may better explain symptoms must be excluded. [...] A number of medical conditions {{are subject to}} exacerbation at menstruation, a process called menstrual magnification. These conditions may lead the woman {{to believe that she}} has PMS, when the underlying disorder may be some other problem, such as anemia, hypothyroidism, eating disorders and substance abuse. [...] A key feature is that these conditions may also be present outside of the luteal phase. Conditions that can be magnified perimenstrually include depression or other affective disorders, migraine, seizure disorders, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and allergies. Problems with other aspects of the female reproductive system must be excluded, including dysmenorrhea (pain during the menstrual period, rather than before it), endometriosis, <b>perimenopause,</b> and adverse effects produced by oral contraceptive pills.|$|E

50|$|Houston's {{inspiration}} for the film came {{after three years of}} battling a range of health issues related to menopause and its precursor, <b>perimenopause.</b> There are currently over 1 billion women in menopause and over 1.5 billion women in <b>perimenopause.</b> The women interviewed in the documentary talk about their sex lives with candor and humor. The film addresses the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause and confronts the 2002 Women's Health Initiative study that led women to forgo estrogen-replacement medications and, in some cases, jeopardize their health.|$|E

5000|$|During menopause, {{there are}} drastic {{changes in the}} {{production}} of gonadal hormones. Most of the reproductive hormones, including the estrogens, progesterone and testosterone, diminish initially (<b>perimenopause),</b> becoming irregular, often showing wide and unpredictable fluctuations. As menopause progresses, there is cessation of estrogen production by the ovaries. Rosciszewska {{was one of the first}} researchers to report an increased risk of seizures during <b>perimenopause,</b> but found a marked decreased risk of seizures during menopause if there was a catamenial relationship. [...] This difference may be associated with the radical fluctuations of estradiol and progesterone during the perimenopausal period than what is experienced during the menopausal period and menstrual cycles of reproductive years. Recall that estrone is the predominant estrogen present during menopause (from subcutaneous fat), and little is known about the effect of estrone specifically on epilepsy. Women with epilepsy who do not follow a catamenial pattern may have an unpredictable increase or decrease in seizure activity in <b>perimenopause</b> and menopause, but women with catamenial epilepsy typically follow a more predictable pattern.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of vaginal atrophy is the {{decrease}} in estrogen which happens naturally during <b>perimenopause,</b> and increasingly so in post-menopause.

50|$|<b>Perimenopause</b> is when {{fertility}} in {{a female}} declines, and menstruation occurs less {{regularly in the}} {{years leading up to}} the final menstrual period, when a female stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile.
