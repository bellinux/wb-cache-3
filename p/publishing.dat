40|$|Current <b>publish</b> / {{subscribe}} systems offer a {{range of}} expressive subscription languages for constraints. However, classical systems restrict the <b>publish</b> operation to be a single <b>published</b> object that contains only constants and no constraints. We introduce symmetric <b>publish</b> / subscribe, a novel generalization of <b>publish</b> / subscribe where both publications and subscriptions contain constraints in addition to constants. <b>Published</b> objects are matched to subscriptions by computing the intersection of their constraints. This generalization improves the performance of classical <b>publish</b> / subscribe systems and introduces {{a new class of}} applications for <b>publish</b> / subscribe. This paper describes the core algorithms of our <b>publish</b> / subscribe implementation, evaluates the performance of these algorithms both analytically and empirically, and documents cases where the additional expressive power of symmetric <b>publish</b> / subscribe can be gained with minimal additional Current <b>publish</b> / subscribe systems support two key operations. The subscribe operation allows a client to register a subscription that contains a constraint. The <b>publish</b> operation allows a client {{to send a message to}} all clients whose constraints matches a <b>published</b> object. Constraint languages fo...|$|R
