Protection Factor - a random variable, which depends on many factors and it is not predictable; however respirator masks that conform to the workers' faces, provide better protection on average. Similar results were also obtained in the laboratories. These results became the basis of the legal requirements: the employer is obliged to pick up the mask to the face of each employee individually, and to check compliance (with the form and size) with the instruments. One of the measurements showed that ordinary low-cost half mask can provide very high protection factor (230,000) sometimes. However, this protection is unreliable: the next measurement in the same working (which used the same mask) showed that the protection factor of only 19. The average value of the <b>protection</b> <b>ratio</b> for these two measurements was ~ 38. Other workers also meet any strong volatility of efficiency (for example, the protection factor of 51 000 and 13 for the same worker).|$|E

Methods: Ischemia-reperfusion mediated neuronal cell injury model {{was constructed in}} cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) by deprivation of glucose, serum and oxygen in media. After ischemia, melatonin {{was added to the}} test groups to reach differential concentration during reperfusion. DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase- 3 activity were observed after subjecting cerebellar granule neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Results: The results showed that OGD induced typical cell apoptosis change, DNA ladder and apoptosis-related alterations in mitochondrial functions including depression of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (its maximal <b>protection</b> <b>ratio</b> was 73. 26 %) and release of cytochrome c (its maximal inhibition ratio was 42. 52 %) and the subsequent activation of caspase- 3 (its maximal <b>protection</b> <b>ratio</b> was 59. 32 %) in cytoplasm. Melatonin reduced DNA damage and inhibited release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspase- 3.

40|$|Background: The Gram-negative {{pathogen}} Bordetella bronchiseptica causes {{acute and}} chronic respiratory infection {{in a variety}} of animals. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent these infections. To identify useful candidate antigens for such a vaccine, five B. bronchiseptica genes including amino acid ATP-binding cassette transporter substrate-binding protein (ABC), lipoprotein (PL), outer membrane porin protein (PPP), leu/ile/val-binding protein (BPP), and conserved hypothetical protein (CHP) were cloned and the recombinant proteins were expressed. The immune responses of mice to vaccination with individual recombinant proteins were measured. Results: Each of the tested recombinant proteins induced a high antibody titer. PPP and PL showed protective indices against challenges with B. bronchiseptica. The <b>protection</b> <b>ratios</b> were 62. 5 and 50 %, respectively, compared with 12. 5 % for control vaccinations. The <b>protection</b> <b>ratios</b> of ABC, BPP, and CHP were not significantly different from the controls.
