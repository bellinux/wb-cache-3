25|$|Essentially all ciphers {{remained}} {{vulnerable to}} cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until {{the development of}} the <b>polyalphabetic</b> cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the <b>polyalphabetic</b> Vigenère cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.|$|E
25|$|The first {{well-documented}} {{description of}} a <b>polyalphabetic</b> cipher was formulated by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets. Alberti's system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing {{the letter of the}} corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, in 1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, a critical component of the Vigenère cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, only provided a progressive, rigid, and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} the Vigenère cipher, like all <b>polyalphabetic</b> ciphers, is to {{disguise}} plaintext letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward application of frequency analysis. For instance, if P is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English, one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is {{the most frequently used}} letter in English. However, using the Vigenère cipher, E can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points in the message, thus defeating simple frequency analysis.|$|E
25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a <b>polyalphabetic</b> substitution cipher, which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E
25|$|Different {{physical}} {{devices and}} aids {{have been used}} to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of <b>polyalphabetic</b> ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{groundbreaking}} 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed {{the notion of}} public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), {{even though they are}} necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as [...] "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since <b>polyalphabetic</b> substitution emerged in the Renaissance".|$|E
2500|$|Although 105,456 {{is a large}} number, it {{does not}} {{guarantee}} security. A brute-force attack is possible: one could imagine using 100 code clerks who each tried to decode a message using 1000 distinct rotor settings. The Poles developed card catalogs so they could easily find rotor positions; Britain built [...] "EINS" [...] (a common German word) catalogs. Less intensive methods were also possible. If all message traffic for a day used the same rotor starting position, then frequency analysis for each position could recover the <b>polyalphabetic</b> substitutions. If different rotor starting positions were used, then overlapping portions of a message could be found using the index of coincidence. Many major powers (including the Germans) could break Enigma traffic if they knew the rotor wiring. The German military knew the Enigma was weak.|$|E
2500|$|Intercepted Morse coded {{messages}} {{had been}} enciphered by the Germans’ Enigma, an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine that implemented a <b>polyalphabetic</b> cipher. The main model {{in use in}} 1940 had three rotors that set an electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard. Pressing a key caused one lamp to light and the right-most rotor to advance by one letter position. This changed the electrical pathway so that pressing the same key again caused a different letter to light up. At one of the 26 positions, a notch on the right-most rotor engaged with the middle rotor so that the two rotors advanced together, and similarly the middle rotor would engage with the left-most rotor, giving a very long period before the sequence repeated (26 [...] 26 [...] 26 = 17,576). The ring on the rotor that contained the notch and so caused the next rotor to advance, could be set {{to any one of}} the 26 positions. The three rotors were selected from a set of five, giving 60 different ways of mounting rotors in the machine. However, because the Germans laid down the rule that no rotor should be in the same position on successive days, if the previous days's rotors and their positions were known, this number was reduced to 32.|$|E

As millions of Frenchmen serving in the French Army had been taken prisoner by the Germans in 1940, there was a shortage of men in France during the Occupation, which explains why Frenchwomen played so a prominent role in the Resistance, with the résistante Germaine Tillon later writing: [...] "It was women who kick-started the Resistance." [...] In May 1942, speaking before a military court in Lyon, the résistante Marguerite Gonnet, when asked about why she had taken up arms against the Reich, replied: [...] "Quite simply, colonel, because the men had dropped them." [...] In 1942, the Royal Air Force (RAF) attempted to bomb the Schneider-Creusot works at Lyon, which was one of France's largest arms factories. The RAF missed the factory and instead killed around 1,000 French civilians. Two Frenchmen serving in the SOE, Raymond Basset (codename Mary) and André Jarrot (codename Goujean), were parachuted in and were able to repeatedly sabotage the local power grid to sharply lower production at the Schneider-Creusot works. Freney, who had emerged as a leading résistant, recruited the engineer Henri Garnier living in Toulouse to teach French workers at factories producing weapons for the Wehrmacht how best to drastically shorten the lifespan of the Wehrmacht's weapons, usually by making deviations of a few millimetres; such acts of quiet sabotage were almost impossible to detect, which meant no French people would be shot in reprisal. To maintain contact with Britain, Resistance leaders would sometimes go directly to the United Kingdom by crossing the English Channel at night on a boat, making their way to Britain via Spain and Portugal, or taking a [...] "spy taxi", as the British Lysander aircraft were known in France, which landed on secret airfields at night. More commonly, contact with Britain was maintained via radio. The Germans had powerful radio detection stations based in Paris, Brittany, Augsburg, and Nürnberg that could and would trace an unauthorized radio broadcast to within ten miles of its location. Afterwards, the Germans would send a van with a radio detection equipment to find the radio operator. For this reason, radio operators in the Resistance were advised not to keep broadcasting from the same location for long. To maintain secrecy, radio operators encrypted their messages using <b>polyalphabetic</b> ciphers. Finally, radio operators had a security key which to begin their messages; if captured and forced to radio Britain under duress, the radio operator would not use the key, which tipped off London that they had been captured.|$|E

This is just a code version of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> substitution cipher. <b>Polyalphabetic</b> ciphers use several different enciphering alphabets and change between them at some interval, usually after every letter. The strength of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> cipher comes from how many alphabets it uses to encipher, how often it switches between them, and how it switches between them (at random or following some pattern for example). The Vigenere is probably the most famous example of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> substitution cipher. The famous cipher machines of World War II encipher in a <b>polyalphabetic</b> system. Their strength came from the enormous number of well-mixed alphabets that they used and the fairly random way of switching between them.|$|E

50|$|The Alberti cipher by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 is {{believed}} to be the first <b>polyalphabetic</b> cipher.
