25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory</b> solution, as it would just move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E

25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory</b> match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane and other hydrocarbons requires better infrared spectra.|$|E
25|$|A {{tax haven}} is a state, country or {{territory}} where certain taxes are levied {{at a low}} rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Individuals and/or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions. Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory</b> definition of a tax haven, but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.|$|E
25|$|Pink balls were {{developed}} in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The red ball is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the white ball is unsuited to first-class cricket because its rapid deterioration makes it unable {{to be used for}} eighty overs as specified in the rules, so the pink ball was designed to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory</b> compromise on both issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than in a red ball, which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket. A pink ball was used {{for the first time in}} an international match in July 2009 when the England Woman's team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley, and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Paratheria" [...] {{was coined}} by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 {{in a review}} of tooth {{development}} in mammals. He found that the [...] "Edentata" [...] were especially distinctive. In this group, he included the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, which are still placed together as Xenarthra, as well as the pangolins and the aardvark. According to Thomas, edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution. Consequently, he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals, for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley: Eutheria (placentals) and Metatheria (marsupials). For this new grouping, he suggested the name Paratheria [...] "to indicate their position by the side of, but separate from, the other Mammals" [...] (the Greek παρά para means [...] "beside"). Thomas had included one other mammal among the edentates, the aardvark; however, he was unable to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory</b> scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition, which he could only compare with that of some fish. Thomas's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville's 1839 classification; he placed edentates (except the sloth Bradypus, which he considered to be a primate) as a major division, the Maldentés ("poorly toothed"). This group was considered to be distinct from the other monodelphes (placentals), the Bien dentés ("well-toothed"). Similarly, Paul Gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals.|$|E
