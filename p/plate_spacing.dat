The study {{is aimed at}} {{the use of the}} PSPC as a new type of oscillatory-flow tubular reactor for emulsion polymerization processes. The effects of pulsation frequency and amplitude, flow rate, <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> and fluid viscosity were studied. Axial dispersion coefficients were determined by fitting the axial dispersion model to the measurements of residence time distribution. A total of 213 runs were carried out with water at 20 ◦C, covering the range of pulsation frequency from 0 to 4. 5 s− 1, amplitude of pulsation from 5 to 25 mm, <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> 25, 50 and 100 mm, and water flow rate from 3. 8 to 11. 8 l/h.

Additional 39 experiments for pulsed flow were performed with aqueous solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) with viscosity varying in the range 1. 4 – 10. 0 cP.

40|$|The {{flow field}} and the energy {{transport}} near thermoacoustic couples are simulated using a 2 D full Navier-Stokes solver. The thermoacoustic couple plate is maintained at a constant temperature; plate lengths, which are short and long compared with the particle displacement lengths of the acoustic standing waves, are tested. Also investigated are the effects of <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> and the amplitude of the standing wave. Results are examined {{in the form of}} energy vectors, particle paths, and overall entropy generation rates. These show that a net heat-pumping effect appears only near the edges of thermoacoustic couple plates, within about a particle displacement distance from the ends. A heat-pumping effect can be seen even on the shortest plates tested when the <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> exceeds the thermal penetration depth. It is observed that energy dissipation near the plate increases quadratically as the <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> is reduced.

40|$|AbstractPlate spacing {{is one of}} {{variable}} that influences plate heat exchanger (PHE) design as a condenser in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system. The rises of <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> have effects to channel cross sectional area, channel velocity, equivalent diameter, and Reynold number at hot and cold fluid sides in PHE. Those parameters affect the total heat transfer area and total pressure drop that influence the PHE condenser performance. This paper investigated the detail effect of the <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> increments in the final total heat transfer area and total pressure drop design result. The <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> in design calculation method is varied and the other independent variables {{are assumed to be}} constant. The design was conducted by calculating condenser capacity at both sides and both zones, estimating overall heat transfer coefficient, and calculating heat transfer area and plate film coefficient. Analysis continued by calculating overall heat transfer coefficient that has small percent of error with the estimated overall heat transfer coefficient, calculating pressure drop, total plate number and total heat transfer area. The result of calculation shows that the rises of <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> increase the total heat transfer area and decrease the cold and hot fluid total pressure drop. The rises of <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> increase channel cross sectional area and equivalent diameter, and decrease channel velocity and Reynold number at zone 1 (without phase change) and zone 2 (with phase change). Therefore, the increment of heat transfer areas is unpreferable and the decrement of pressure drops is preferable...|$|E

A quantitative experimental investigation into the effect of the pore dimensions on the performance of thermoacoustic devices is reported.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of an isolated, spherical, Brownian particle {{immersed in a}} Newtonian fluid between infinite parallel plates is investigated. Expressions are developed for both a 'molecular' contribution to dispersion, which arises from random thermal fluctuations, and a 'convective' contribution, arising when a shear flow is applied between the plates. These expressions are evaluated numerically for all sizes of the particle relative to the bounding plates, and the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to develop analytical expressions for the dispersion coefficients {{as a function of}} particle size to <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> ratio for small values of this parameter. It is shown that both the molecular and convective dispersion coefficients decrease as the size of the particle relative to the bounding plates increase. When the particle is small compared to the <b>plate</b> <b>spacing,</b> the coefficients decrease roughly proportional to the particle size to <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> ratio. When the particle closely fills the space between the plates, the molecular dispersion coefficient approaches zero slowly as an inverse logarithmic function of the particle size to <b>plate</b> <b>spacing</b> ratio, and the convective dispersion coefficent approaches zero approximately proportional to the width of the gap between the edges of the sphere and the bounding plates. ...|$|E
