50|$|Under {{the long-standing}} {{editorial}} leadership of Perry Anderson, the New Left Review popularised the Frankfurt School, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser {{and other forms}} of Marxism. Other <b>periodicals</b> like Socialist <b>Register,</b> started in 1964, and Radical Philosophy, started in 1972, have also been associated with the New Left, and published a range of important writings in this field.|$|R
50|$|Some {{government}} officials have used their positions to maintain their own communications facilities, as national and local governments own or control several dozen newspapers and many electronic media outlets. A 2004 media law prohibits censorship, but requires registration of periodicals with the Ministry of Information and Culture; in 2005 some 250 <b>periodicals</b> were <b>registered.</b> International organisations have been training new journalists {{since the fall of}} the Taliban. However, due to instability in Afghanistan, journalists have been as highly targeted as soldiers, as shown by instances of kidnapping and death threats. An NGO named Nai (meaning flute, an important symbolic instrument for broadcasting) tracks violence against journalists with its Media Watch Data. More than 100 journalists also protested a raid on a private TV station which drew concern of further government interference in reporting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} using herring for distracting hounds is {{an article published}} on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist William Cobbett in his polemical <b>periodical</b> Political <b>Register.</b> According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is {{the origin of the}} figurative meaning of red herring. In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding [...] "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone." [...] Quinion concludes: [...] "This story, and Cobbett's extended repetition of it in 1833, was enough to get the figurative sense of red herring into the minds of his readers, unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen." ...|$|R

50|$|The system {{followed}} in government office is called “ Tottanham’s System”. There {{will be an}} office Manager who is otherwise called as “The Sarishtadar” will exercise supervision and control over all sections and the heads of sections. He must periodically inspect the Personal Registers and {{see that they are}} punctually, neatly and properly maintained. The Office Manager must check any tendency to delay and bring it to the notice of superior officer. He must also find out whether there is any indication that any member of the establishment is obviously unsuited for his work. If any serious delay or other irregularity comes to light, it is not a sufficient excuse for the supervisor to say that he repeatedly warned the offender or urged to deal promptly with the file that has been delayed. The supervisor's duty in such cases is to report immediately to superior officer as soon as he found that his own admonitions are not proving effective. Should he fail to do so, he cannot be held to have discharged his responsibility.The office system {{followed in}} government offices is called “ Tottanham’s System” It deals with all arrangements with regard to “routine work” i.e., to such branches of work as the opening letters, registering, indexing, fair copying and dispatching of correspondence, the receipt of papers into the record room, their arrangement in the record room to store in safe custody, retrieval when required and destruction when no longer required and so on. The manual describes various registers to be maintained in government offices. Some of the important registers are : Distribution Register, Personal Register, New Case Register, Fair copy Register, Special registers etc. All letters received in any government office are serially numbered and they are registered in the distribution register, duly indicating to whom and to which staff members such a letter is assigned for initiating action. Personal Register is to be maintained by every staff member, which will have complete details of all the letters he has received and the dates of action taken by him. Finally how this letter is disposed off is also indicated in the personal register. This is an important register to assess the performance of every staff member. <b>Periodical</b> <b>Register</b> is another register which is helpful in monitoring whether the reports to be sent to various superior officers are promptly sent. This register has the details of the periodical reports, their subjects, the periodicity and to whom they are to be sent. The special register will have details of important references marked as Special by Head of Office and to be dealt with separately.|$|R
40|$|Quenched and {{tempered}} AISI 410 martensitic {{stainless steel}} specimens were active screen plasma nitrided {{in a mixture of}} 75 % of nitrogen and 25 % of hydrogen during 20 h at 400 °C. The microstructure of the nitrided case was characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. The phases were identified by X-ray diffraction and the nitrogen content as a function of depth was measured using wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometer coupled to SEM. Nanoindentation tests were carried out in order to assess hardness (H), Young modulus (E), H/E and H 3 /E 2 ratios and the elastic recovery (We) of the nitrided layer. Cavitation erosion tests were carried out according to ASTM G 32 standard during 20 h, with <b>periodical</b> interruptions for <b>registering</b> the mass losses. Additional cavitation erosion tests were performed to identify the wear mechanisms in both specimens, through assessment of the evolution of the damage on the surface, in a scanning electron microscope. A ~ 28 µm thick, 1275 HV hard nitrided case formed at the surface of the {{martensitic stainless steel}}, composed of nitrogen supersaturated expanded martensite and hexagonal ε-Fe 24 N 10 iron nitrides. The expanded martensite decreased 27 times the mass loss shown by the non-nitrided stainless steel and the erosion rate decreased from 2. 56 mg/h to 0. 085 mg/h. The increase in cavitation erosion resistance can be mainly attributed to the increase in hardness and to the elastic response of the expanded martensite. The non-nitrided specimen changed from initially ductile to brittle behavior, exhibiting two different modes of material detachment. The first mode was characterized by a great degree of plastic deformation, fatigue and ductile fracture. The second failure mode could be associated to brittle fracture by cleavage mechanisms. In contrast, the wear mechanism observed in the nitrided specimen was brittle fracture without evident plastic deformatio...|$|R
