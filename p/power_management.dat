5|$|Specific design {{elements}} of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former FCS manned ground vehicles program where contractors had {{more control over the}} design. The GCV was to be networked and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and <b>power</b> <b>management</b> functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested contractors to be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be built around a common chassis.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact that <b>power</b> quality <b>management</b> can have on the intermediate level of maintenance. <b>Power</b> quality <b>management</b> is a preventative process that focuses on identifying and correcting problems that cause bad power. Using cost-benefit analysis we compare the effects of implementing a <b>power</b> quality <b>management</b> program at AIMD Lemoore and AIMD Fallon. The implementation of <b>power</b> quality <b>management</b> can result in wide scale logistical support changes in regards to the life cycle costs of maintaining the DoD's current inventory of sensitive electronic equipment. <b>Power</b> quality <b>management</b> provides logisticians the opportunity to reduce maintenance costs, reduce maintenance cycle times, and improve fleet operational availability. Our research identifies potential savings of $ 1. 5 million from reduced test bench maintenance costs and productivity increases, and recommends the DoD institutionalize the use of <b>power</b> quality <b>management.</b> NAU.

5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide <b>power</b> <b>management</b> outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E

5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the <b>power</b> <b>management</b> of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Windows, has {{included}} limited PC <b>power</b> <b>management</b> features since Windows 95. These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) {{and support for}} the ACPI standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include <b>power</b> <b>management.</b> This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced Group Policy, a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, <b>power</b> <b>management</b> was not one of those features. This is probably because the <b>power</b> <b>management</b> settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values, effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own <b>power</b> <b>management</b> settings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—WiFi {{transmission}} can consume much energy on energy-constrained mobile devices. To improve energy efficiency, the <b>Power</b> Saving <b>Management</b> (PSM) has been standardized and applied. The standard PSM, however, may not deliver satisfactory energy efficiency {{in many cases}} as the wakeup strategy adopted by it cannot adapt dynamically to traffic pattern changes. Motivated {{by the fact that}} it has been more and more popular for a mobile device to have both WiFi and other low-power wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, we propose a ZigBee-assisted <b>Power</b> Saving <b>Management</b> (ZPSM) scheme, leveraging the ZigBee interface to wake up WiFi interface on demand to improve energy efficiency without violating delay requirements. The simulation results have shown that ZPSM can save energy significantly without violating delay requirements in various scenarios.
