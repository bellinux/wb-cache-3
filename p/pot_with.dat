5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a <b>pot,</b> <b>with</b> its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> a pair of 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise {{as well as the}} $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E

25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} the form of the cooking vessel to the heat transfer efficiency of the stove/pot system. A rounded (convex) pot bottom increases the surface available for heat transfer and, hence, heat transfer efficiency. We suggest that combustion-efficient stoves combined with rounded-bottom vessels compare favourably to the same stoves in combination with flat-bottom stoves. Clay <b>pots</b> <b>with</b> a rounded bottom correspond to African traditions. Nowadays metal <b>pots</b> <b>with</b> rounded bottoms are locally produced in some areas. Implications of pot forms for the outcome of Water Boiling Tests are also discussed...|$|R

Kedjenou is a dish consisting of chicken and vegetables that are slow-cooked {{in a sealed}} <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> little or no added liquid, which concentrates the flavors of the chicken and vegetables and tenderizes the chicken. It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a canary, over a slight fire, or cooked in an oven. Bangui is a local palm wine.|$|E
25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through the holes of the other sides. This {{was done by the}} suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added to the pot to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E
25|$|A common {{dry cell}} is the zinc–carbon battery, {{sometimes}} called the dry Leclanché cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, {{the same as the}} alkaline battery (since both use the same zinc–manganese dioxide combination). A standard dry cell comprises a zinc anode, usually {{in the form of a}} cylindrical <b>pot,</b> <b>with</b> a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a depolariser. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by zinc chloride.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop three {{different}} models of aquaponic systems for the culture of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and growing vegetables and verify their functionality in practice. Following systems were developed: Media system, which used gravel and expanded clay as a substrate for plants (modified version of Barrelponics by Hughey, 2005); NFT (pipe) system, which used a flow of thin film of nutrient-rich water under the <b>pots</b> <b>with</b> plants; Raft system, which used styrofoam rafts keeping the <b>pots</b> <b>with</b> plants flowing on the water (a {{modified version of the}} UVI system by Rakocy et al., 2004) ...|$|R

25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|In extrapulmonary TB, {{surgery is}} often {{needed to make}} a {{diagnosis}} (rather than to effect a cure): surgical excision of lymph nodes, drainage of abscesses, tissue biopsy, etc. are all examples of this. Samples taken for TB culture should be sent to the laboratory in a sterile <b>pot</b> <b>with</b> no additive (not even water or saline) and must arrive in the laboratory as soon as possible. Where facilities for liquid culture are available, specimens from sterile sites may be inoculated directly following the procedure: this may improve the yield. In spinal TB, surgery is indicated for spinal instability (when there is extensive bony destriction) or when the spinal cord is threatened. Therapeutic drainage of tuberculous abscesses or collections is not routinely indicated and will resolve with adequate treatment. In TB meningitis, hydrocephalus is a potential complication and may necessitate the insertion of a ventricular shunt or drain.|$|E
25|$|The end of Philippine {{prehistory}} is 900, {{the date}} {{inscribed in the}} oldest Philippine document found so far, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. From {{the details of the}} document, written in Kawi script, the bearer of a debt, Namwaran, along with his children Lady Angkatan and Bukah, are cleared of a debt by the ruler of Tondo. From the various Sanskrit terms and titles seen in the document, the culture and society of Manila Bay was that of a Hindu–Old Malay amalgamation, similar to the cultures of Java, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra at the time. There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the Doctrina Christiana of the late 16th century, written {{at the start of the}} Spanish period in both native Baybayin script and Spanish.
