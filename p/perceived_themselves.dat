25|$|VIDA: Women in Literary Arts was co-founded in 2009 by poets Erin Belieu and Cate Marvin.

[...] Baillet-Latour died in 1942; Edström took on the duties of president, although he continued to style himself vice-president. Edström and Brundage did not await the end of war to rebuild the Olympic movement; Brundage even sent parcels to Europe in aid of IOC members and others in places where food was scarce. With Edström turning 74 in 1944, the Swede expressed concern as to who would lead the IOC if he should die, and suggested that Brundage become second vice-president, a newly created position. A mail ballot of IOC members who could be reached confirmed the choice the following year. When Edström was made president by the first postwar IOC session at Lausanne in September 1946, Brundage was elected first vice-president.|$|E
500|$|The {{defining}} {{traits of}} being {{considered one of}} the Rhomaioi were being an Orthodox Christian and more importantly speaking Greek, characteristics which had to be acquired by birth if one was not to be considered an allogenes or even a barbarian. The term mostly used to describe someone who was a foreigner to both the Byzantines and their state was ethnikós (Greek: [...] ), a term which originally described non-Jews or non-Christians, but had lost its religious meaning. In a classicizing vein usually applied to other peoples, Byzantine authors regularly referred to their own people as [...] "Ausones", an ancient name for the inhabitants of Italy. Most historians agree that the defining features of their civilization were: 1) Greek language, culture, literature, and science, 2) Roman law and tradition, 3) Christian faith. The Byzantine Greeks were, and <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as, heirs to the culture of ancient Greece, the political heirs of imperial Rome, and followers of the Apostles. Thus, their sense of [...] "Romanity" [...] was different from that of their contemporaries in the West. [...] "Romaic" [...] {{was the name of the}} vulgar Greek language, as opposed to [...] "Hellenic" [...] which was its literary or doctrinal form. Byzantine elites and common people nurtured a high self-esteem based on their perceived cultural superiority towards foreigners, whom they viewed with contempt, despite the frequent occurrence of compliments to an individual foreigner as an andreîos Rhōmaióphrōn ( [...] , roughly [...] "a brave Roman-minded fellow").

2500|$|The British Indian Army {{organised}} regiments and {{units on}} the basis of religion and regional or caste identity. Bose sought to end this practice and build up one unified Indian identity among the men who would fight for independence. Consequently, the Indian Legion was organised as mixed units so that Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs all served side-by-side. Around the time of its formation in late 1942, 59% of the legion's men were Hindus, 25% were Muslims, 14% were Sikhs and 2% other religions. Relative to the British Indian Army, there were more Hindus and Sikhs, and fewer Muslims. The success of Bose's idea of developing a unified national identity was evident when Heinrich Himmler proposed in late 1943 (after Bose's departure) that the Muslim soldiers of the I.R. 950 be recruited into the new Handschar Division. The commander of the SS Head Office, Gottlob Berger, was obliged to point out that while the Bosnians of the [...] "Handschar" [...] <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as people of a European identity, Indian Muslims <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as Indians.

40|$|Background: Mental illness has {{increased}} in Sweden and the individuals seeking care expect to be met with respect. The way patients <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> to be treated by health care professionals plays a central part to care and treatment of patients, and the patients experience will decide how future care will proceed. The majority of complaints from patients with mental illness suggest that {{the way they are}} treated in health care is inadequate. For people with mental illness it is crucial how they <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> to be treated since poor treatment can lead to reluctance in seeking future help. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe how people with mental illness <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> to be treated in primary health care. Method: A literature review was chosen as a method and data was collected from seven articles, both qualitative and quantitative. Results: The results were analyzed and compiled into three main themes; (1) To feel exposed to generalization, (2) To feel respected and (3) To feel involved. The subthemes describe experiences of; focus on medicine, one size fits all, lack of knowledge, to be listened to, humanity, attitudes, time, information and dialogue. Conclusion: There are both positive and negative experiences of how patients <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> to be treated in primary health care but the negative experiences are predominant. This study can lead to an increased understanding and knowledge of how the primary care professionals should treat people with mental illness and which actions should be avoided...|$|R
2500|$|The {{secondary}} {{function of}} medieval hospitals was charity to the poor, sick, and travellers. Charity provided by hospitals surfaced in different ways, including long-term {{maintenance of the}} infirm, medium-term care of the sick, short-term hospitality to travellers, and regular distribution of alms to the poor. Though these were general acts of charity among medieval hospitals, the degree of charity was variable. For example, some institutions that <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> mainly as a religious house or place of hospitality turned away the sick or dying in fear that difficult healthcare will distract from worship. Others, however, such as St. James of Northallerton, St. Giles of Norwich, and St. Leonard of York, contained specific ordinances stating they must cater to the sick and that [...] "all who entered with ill health {{should be allowed to}} stay until they recovered or died".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} step towards {{nationhood}} {{on the international}} stage came in 1919 when New Zealand was given a seat in the newly founded League of Nations. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration declared Britain's Dominions as [...] "equal in status", followed by the creation of the legal basis of independence, established by the Statute of Westminster 1931 which came about mainly at the behest of nationalist elements in South Africa and the Irish Free State. However, Australia, New Zealand, and Newfoundland were hostile towards this development, and the statute was not adopted in New Zealand until 1947. Irrespective of any legal developments, some New Zealanders still <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as a distinctive outlying branch of the United Kingdom until at least the 1970s. This attitude began to change when the United Kingdom joined the European Community in 1973 and abrogated its preferential trade agreements with New Zealand, and gradual nationality and societial changes further eroded the relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The Normans and French {{who arrived}} after the conquest saw {{themselves}} as different from the English. They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy, spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture. For many years, to be English was {{to be associated with}} military failure and serfdom. During the twelfth century, the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and cohabitation. [...] By the end of the twelfth century, and possibly as early as the 1150s, contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending, and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend. The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values, however, and French remained the language of the court, business and international affairs, even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the English began to consider themselves superior to the Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late twelfth century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish.|$|E

Practical implications regarding use of cognitive age as a basis for customer segmentation in IT industries as well as theoretical implications about meaningful age in human computer interaction research are offered and discussed...|$|R

A new interpersonal approach to self-enhancement decomposes self-perception into 3 components: perceiver effect, target effect, and unique self-perception. Both theoretical derivations and an illustrative study suggest that this resulting measure of self-enhancement is less confounded by unwanted components of interpersonal perception than previous social comparison and self-insight measures. Findings help reconcile conflicting views about whether self-enhancement is adaptive or maladaptive. Is self-evaluation inherently biased and, if so, does this bias promote adjustment?
