5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
5|$|In the Klondike stampede, an {{estimated}} 100,000 <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reach the Klondike goldfields, of whom only around 30,000 to 40,000 eventually did. It formed {{the height of}} the Klondike gold rush from the summer of 1897 until the summer of 1898. It began on July 15, 1897 in San Francisco and was spurred further two days later in Seattle, when the first of the early prospectors returned from the Klondike, bringing with them large amounts of gold on the ships Excelsior and Portland. The press reported that a total of $1,139,000 (equivalent to $1,000 million at 2010 prices) had been brought in by these ships, although this proved to be an underestimate. The migration of prospectors caught so much attention that it was joined by outfitters, writers and photographers.|$|E
5|$|Strong waves caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two <b>people,</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped several feet {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop the South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle}} of the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E

25|$|The Singsaker Line {{had always}} had the lowest {{ridership}} of the three tram lines, and therefore it had been served using the oldest material—narrow cars with only wooden benches. The first Class 4 tram—no. 35—was put into service on 12 September 1952. Many <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> time their trips into town to catch it; this could be quite difficult since {{there was only a}} one seventh chance. From December, the tram was taken out of service due to the amount of snow. This resulted in protest meetings, but the company did not have enough trams to use them on Line 3.|$|E
25|$|Asher {{approached}} several Californian growers {{with this}} idea, {{but most were}} hesitant to take part. The idea became more real when the winemakers Karl Wente and Robert Mondavi agreed to participate. Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of the prestigious Four Seasons Restaurant in Manhattan agreed to organise the practicalities of such an event in return for Asher's coordination of the California wineries' contributions. The first annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner was held at The Four Seasons in 1976, and soon became hugely popular; though there were only 228 places available for the 1978 tasting, over 2,000 <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> buy tickets.|$|E
