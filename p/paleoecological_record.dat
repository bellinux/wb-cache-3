40|$|The {{formation}} of many arctic wetlands {{is associated with}} the occurrence of polygon-patterned permafrost. Existing scenarios to describe and explain surface landforms in arctic wetlands (low-center and high-center polygons and polygon ponds) invoke competing hypotheses: a cyclic succession (the thaw-lake hypothesis) or a linear succession (terrestrialization). Both hypotheses infer the predictable development of polygon-patterned wetlands over millennia. However, very few studies have applied paleoecological techniques to reconstruct long-term succession in tundra wetlands and thereby test the validity of existing hypotheses. This paper uses the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> of diatoms to investigate long-term development of individual polygons in a High Arctic wetland. Two landform processes were examined: (1) the millennial-scale development of a polygon-pond, and (2) the transition from low-center to erosive high-center polygons. Diatom assemblages were quantified from habitats associated with contrasting landforms in the present-day landscape, and used as an analog to reconstruct past transitions between polygon types. On the basis of this evidence, the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> does not support either of the existing models describing the predictable succession of polygon landforms in an arctic wetland. Our results indicate a need for greater paleoecological understanding, in combination with in situ observations in present-day geomorphology, in order to identify patterns of polygon wetland development and elucidate the long-term drivers of these landform transitions...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to better understand the changes in fire history during the past 6, 000 years in Mt. Rainier National Park in order to better inform fire management planners. Reflection Lake is located on the southwest face of Mt. Rainier at an altitude of 1, 481 meters, and is surrounded by a mid- to high-elevation forest consisting mainly of sub alpine fir, mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and noble fir. In summer 2012, a 2. 6 -meter long sediment core was recovered from the lake representing approximately the last 6, 000 years (the lake sits on a lahar of known age). Loss-on-ignition, magnetic-susceptibility, high resolution macroscopic charcoal, and pollen analysis will be used to reconstruct the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> from Reflection Lake. The frequency and intensity of fire events is currently being determined using macroscopic charcoal analysis. Preliminary results show a significant change in fire regimes during the last 6, 000 years due to both climatic and human influences. Several tephra layers from eruptions of Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens also precede shifts in fire activity. This core is one of seven from Mt.

40|$|<b>Paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> are {{replete with}} {{examples}} of biotic responses to past climate change and human impact but how can we use these records in the conservation of current and future biodiversity? A recently published list of One Hundred Questions of Importance to the Conservation of Global Biological Diversity (Sutherland et al., 2009) highlights {{a number of key}} research questions that need a temporal perspective. Many of these questions are related to the determination of ecological processes in order to assess ecosystem function and services, climate change-integrated conservation strategies, and ecosystem management and restoration. However, it is noticeable that not a single contributor to this list was from the paleo-research community and that extremely few paleo-records are ever used in the development of terrestrial conservation management plans. This lack of dialogue between conservationists and the paleo-community is partially driven by a perception that the data provided by <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> are purely descriptive and not of relevance to the day-to-day management and conservation of biological diversity. This paper illustrates, through a series of case-studies, how long-term ecological records (> 50 years) can provide a test of predictions and assumptions of ecological processes that are directly relevant to management strategies necessary in order to retain biological diversity in a changing climate. This includes information on diversity baselines, thresholds, resilience, and restoration of ecological processes...|$|R
40|$|Fire is an {{important}} part of the disturbance regimes of northwestern U. S. forests and its role in maintaining and altering forest vegetation is evident in the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> of the region. Long-term reconstructions of Holocene fire regimes, provided by the analysis of charcoal, pollen, and other fire proxies in a network of lake records, indicate that the Pacific Northwest and summer-dry regions of the northern Rocky Mountains experienced their highest fire activity in the early Holocene (11, 000 - 7, 000 years ago) and during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1, 000 years ago) when drought conditions were more severe than today. In contrast, in summer-wet areas of the northern Rocky Mountains, the period of highest fire activity was registered in the last 7, 000 years when dry woodland vegetation developed. When synthesized across the entire northwestern U. S., the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> reveals that past and present fire regimes are strongly controlled by climate changes occurring on multiple time scales. The scarcity of fires in the 20 th century in some northwestern U. S. ecosystems may be the result of successful fire suppression policies, but in wetter forests this absence is consistent with long-term fire regime patterns. In addition, simulations of potential future climate and vegetation indicate that future fire conditions in some parts of the northwestern U. S. could be more severe than they are today. The Holocene record of periods of intensified summer drought is used to assess the nature of future fire-climate-vegetation linkages in the region...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePeatland testate amoebae {{are widely}} used to {{reconstruct}} paleohydrological/climatic changes, but many species are also known to respond to pollutants.

To address this issue we applied testate amoeba transfer functions to the results of experiments adding pollutants (N, P, S, Pb, O 3) to peatlands and similar ecosystems.

40|$|The present work {{supports}} {{the idea that the}} archaeological record constitutes a valid approach to understand the relationship between humans and environment. It not only constitutes a <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> because of the recovery of biological evidences associated to human occupations but {{due to the fact that}} humans themselves are significant components of past ecosystems. In other words, the understanding of human occupations implies the comprehension of making decisions within a particular environmental context[1, 2]. If we accept humans as components of the ecosystem, there are several available theoretical and methodological backgrounds that allow the understanding of past systems, which range from ecological evolutionary approaches to landscape archaeology. Human paleoecology allows to explore and comprehend the variability of the archaeological record in terms of human strategies as well as to offer perspectives for the understanding of past processes. These approaches have also been denominated environmental archaeology[2].

40|$|With {{a warmer}} climate, the {{wetlands}} of Interior Alaska may experience more frequent or extensive stand-replacing fires and permafrost degradation. This, in turn {{may change the}} primary factors controlling carbon emissions. I measured carbon exchange along a moisture transect {{from the center of}} a Sphagnum-dominated bog into a burned forest (2001 Survey Line Fire) on the Tanana River Floodplain. Both the bog and the surrounding burn were sinks for CO 2, and the bog was a CH 4 source in the abnormally dry summer of 2004. Thermokarst and subsiding soils were observed on the margin of the bog in the three years since the fire, increasing the anaerobic portion of the soil landscape. I observed the greatest variation in carbon fluxes in this portion of the transect. I conclude that permafrost collapse is altering the pattern of emissions from this landscape. I tracked historical changes in vegetation, hydrology and fire at this site through macrofossil, charcoal and diatom analysis of peat cores.

40|$|Models {{based on}} the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> predict that animals in {{temperate}} regions will respond to global warming by migrating poleward to remain within their temperature tolerance ranges. The effect of global warming on invertebrates is of great concern because of their critical role in ecosystem structure and function. Migration poses a problem for many species because of their limited dispersal abilities. The life cycle of a typical temperate zone univoltine insect, Tenodera sinensis (Mantodea: Mantidae) is constrained by degree-days per season: too few prevent maturation before the killing frost in the autumn; too many allow egg hatch before a killing frost. We used field and laboratory observations on the life history and ecology of this species to predict the effect of global warming on the regional distribution of this insect {{by the end of}} the next century. Based on the simplified, best-case, biological assumptions of our model, the geographical range of T. sinensis in eastern North America would be compressed toward the northern part of its present contiguous regional distribution. This and other univoltine temperate species with long maturation periods and low vagility could face regional extinction if global warming predictions are accurate...|$|E
40|$|Explanations {{for areas}} of {{endemism}} often involve relative climatic stability, or low climate velocity, over time scales {{ranging from the}} Pleistocene to the late Cenozoic. Given that many narrowly endemic taxa in forested landscapes display discrete habitat associations, habitat stability should be similarly important for endemic persistence. Furthermore, while past climate variability is exceedingly difficult to quantify on millennial time scales, past distributions of habitats may be robustly inferred from <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records.</b> The Olympic Peninsula, Washington, supports a biota with several insular features including 29 endemic plant and animal taxa. Here I present the geographic distribution and habitat of the endemic taxa, and then examine the vegetation stability of the past 14, 300 years from five pollen records associated with discrete vegetation zones on the peninsula. I show that 11 endemics have distributions centered on dry alpine scree and rock in the northeastern quadrant of the peninsula, and nine occur in shaded riparian forests in the southwest. Vegetation turnover during the post-glacial period was smallest in these areas. However, another long pollen record from the western peninsula reveals existence of shrub tundra and greatly reduced forest cover, indicating southward displacement of shaded riparian habitats by {{perhaps as much as}} 100 km. Although this study supports an association of post-glacial vegetation stability with endemism, records spanning the glacial maximum indicate widespread tundra during long periods of the late Pleistocene and therefore suggest southern displacement of forest-associated endemics. While some of the alpine scree-associated endemics may have persisted in situ, many others likely arrived via a variety of dispersal trajectories. These histories include dispersal from southern refugia towards ocean barriers preventing further northward dispersal, contraction from more widespread distributions, and recent divergence from sister taxa. This study shows that <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> can cast strong doubt on the inference that areas of endemism necessarily imply in situ glacial survival. <br /...|$|R

In Roskilde Fjord, Denmark, total nitrogen (TN) increased 85 % during the last century, with the most rapid increase occurring after the 1950 s, corresponding to the postwar increase in N fertilizer use. In LaaJalahti Bay, an urban embayment near Helsinki, Finland, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) increased with growing wastewater inputs and decreased with the remedial actions taken to reduce these discharges.

Nine tree species and a grass type were parameterized, with special attention to species requirements for establishment as limited by snowpack. Simulations produced realistic present-day species composition in five forest zones and captured late-Glacial to late Holocene transitions in forest communities. Early Holocene fire-adapted communities were not simulated well by LPJ-GUESS. Scenarios with varying amounts of snow relative to rain showed the influence of snowpack on key bioclimatic variables and on species composition at a subalpine location.

We observe that as water levels in the lake are drawn down due to warm, dry, interglacial conditions, there is a possible regional cooling as the lake effect on local microclimates diminishes. Positive feedback mechanisms promote drying until much of the lake basin is reduced to salt marsh. Consequently, the usual concept of upslope migration of species with warming would not be applicable in the Altiplano. If, as projected, the next century brings warmer and drier conditions than those of today, a tipping point appears to exist within ca. 1 – 2 °C of current temperatures, where the relatively benign agricultural conditions of the northern Altiplano would be replaced by inhospitable arid climates.

Extremely sparse and open vegetation composed of steppic grasslands and heathlands with scattered pioneer trees suggests very cold and dry conditions during the Oldest Dryas, unsuitable for tree survival in the surroundings of the study site. Slight woodland expansion during the Bolling/Allerod was interrupted by the Younger Dryas cooling. Pinewoods dominated {{for most of the}} early Holocene, when a marked increase in fire activity occurred. Deciduous trees expanded later reaching their maximum representation during the mid-Holocene.

Fossil and sedimentological data show that Lake Malawi itself, currently 706 m deep, was reduced to an 125 m deep saline, alkaline, well mixed lake. This episode of aridity was far more extreme than any experienced in the Afrotropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (35 – 15 ka).

40|$|Wildfire is a {{dominant}} disturbance agent in forest ecosystems, shaping important biogeochemical processes including net carbon (C) balance. Long-term monitoring and chronosequence studies highlight a resilience of biogeochemical properties to large, stand-replacing, high-severity fire events. In contrast, {{the consequences of}} repeated fires or temporal variability in a fire regime (e. g., the characteristic timing or severity of fire) are largely unknown, yet theory suggests that such variability could strongly influence forest C trajectories (i. e., future states or directions) for millennia. Here we combine a 4500 -year <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> of fire activity with ecosystem modeling to investigate how fire-regime variability impacts soil C and net ecosystem carbon balance. We found that C trajectories in a paleo-informed scenario differed significantly from an equilibrium scenario (with a constant fire return interval), largely due to variability in the timing and severity of past fires. Paleo-informed scenarios contained multi-century periods {{of positive and negative}} net ecosystem C balance, with magnitudes significantly larger than observed under the equilibrium scenario. Further, this variability created legacies in soil C trajectories that lasted for millennia. Our results imply that fire-regime variability is a major driver of C trajectories in stand-replacing fire regimes. Predicting carbon balance in these systems, therefore, will depend strongly on the ability of ecosystem models to represent a realistic range of fire-regime variability over the past several centuries to millennia...|$|E

How has this large-scale removal of large herbivores affected landscape structure and ecosystem functioning? In this review, we combine paleo-data with information from modern exclosure experiments {{to assess the impact of}} large herbivores (and their disappearance) on woody species, landscape structure, and ecosystem functions. In modern landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, woody plants can persist by defending themselves or by association with defended species, can persist by growing in places that are physically inaccessible to herbivores, or can persist where high predator activity limits foraging by herbivores. At the landscape scale, different herbivore densities and assemblages may result in dynamic gradients in woody cover. The late-Quaternary extinctions were natural experiments in large-herbivore removal; the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> shows evidence of widespread changes in community composition and ecosystem structure and function, consistent with modern exclosure experiments.

Numerous <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> from around the world have demonstrated that vegetation has changed, often dramatically, since the last glacial maximum (LGM).

A suite of 20 AMS ��C dates suggests {{that much of the}} post-OIS 5 paleoenvironmental record is characterized by either extremely low continuous sediment accumulation, or by one or more episodes of more rapid sedimentation. Diverse pollen and spore assemblages have concentrations that are unexpectedly high throughout the pre-Holocene sediments (' 10, 000 grains cm��), by comparison to the Holocene (& 5000 grains cm��). Exceedingly low sediment accumulation rates appear to have resulted in the concentration of atmospherically derived pollen and spores. Diatom assemblages record the evolution of the lake’s chemistry and past algal production. Several abrupt changes occurred synchronously in both the terrestrial and aquatic components of the system, and these appear to represent ecological responses to pre-Holocene climatic variability. The sediments of Fog Lake provide the first integrated <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> older than Holocene for a vast region of the Canadian Arctic, thereby refining our understanding of long-term arctic ecosystem ontogeny. � 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Viable diapausing eggs of Daphnia exilis, {{a species}} within the Daphnia similis species complex, occur in sediments of Onondaga Lake, New York. The {{discovery}} of this species, which otherwise occurs exclusively in temporary saline ponds in southwestern North America, represents a range extension of 1, 000 km. 210 Pb-dating of the sediments containing diapausing eggs indicates that D. exilis {{was present in}} Onondaga Lake between the mid- 1920 s and the early 1980 s. The species ’ introduction, successful colonization, and subsequent disappearance from the water column correspond temporally with distinct events {{in the history of}} industrial activity along the shores of the lake and with the <b>paleoecological</b> <b>record</b> of this activity deposited in Onondaga Lake sediments. Only the most recently deposited diapausing eggs (late 1970 s to early 1980 s) hatch during laboratory incubation; older eggs may not be viable because of toxic concentrations of mercury pollution in older sediments. The D. exilis eggs that have hatched have had strikingly low genetic (allozyme) variation in comparison with the variation documented for populations in the southwestern United States by Hebert and Finston (1993). Exploration of various invasion scenarios through simulated introduction of genotypes from the southwestern United States suggests that a single genotype established the D. exilis population in Onondaga Lake. These observations document the ecological and microevolutionary patterns associated with an invasion by an exotic crustacean that currently persists only in the sediment egg bank...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Advances in fire {{climatology}} have {{derived from}} {{recent studies of}} modern and <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records.</b> We convened a series of workshops and a conference session to report and review regional-scale findings, and these meetings led to the 10 papers in this special issue. Two papers focus on fire and climate patterns {{in the modern era}} using documentary records, four papers utilise tree rings to evaluate recent centuries of change, and four papers evaluate charcoal and pollen in lake, bog, and alluvial sediments over the Holocene. Here we summarise some of the key findings from these papers in the context of other recent fire climatology literature. These studies illustrate the value of long-term perspectives and spatial networks of fire and climate data in discovering the patterns and modes of past fire regime and climate variations. Warming temperatures and increasing drought occurrence in many regions of the world are resulting in widespread ecosys-tem impacts (ACIA 2005; IPCC 2007). One of the most dramatic ecological responses to climate change is wildfire. The impor-tance of climate in driving past, present, and future fire regimes has greatly increased the need for better understanding of fire climatology. As distinct from fire meteorology, which addresses relatively fine-scale spatial processes over short time periods (i. e...|$|R
40|$|<b>Paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> {{from two}} Holocene peat bogs in {{northern}} Germany are linked by two microscopic volcanic ash layers, correlated by petrology and geochemistry to explosive volcanism on Iceland. The younger “Microlite tephra” cannot be correlated to any known eruption, while the older tephra layer {{is identified as}} a deposit of the Hekla 3 eruption. The tephra layers are dated by an age–depth regression of accelerator mass spectrometry 14 C ages that have been calibrated and combined in probability distributions. This procedure gives an age of 730 – 664 cal yr B. C. for the “Microlite tephra” event and 1087 – 1006 cal yr B. C. for the Hekla 3 event. Accordingly, the tephra layers were deposited during the late Bronze Age. At this time, human settlement slowly increased pressure on the environment, as indicated by changes in woodland pollen composition at the two bogs. The tephra-marker horizons further show that the palynologically defined transition from the Subboreal to the Subatlantic Period is synchronous in the investigated area. However, the macroscopic visible marker in peat, the change from fibrous to sapric peat, the “Schwarztorf-Weißtorf-Kontakt,” is asynchronous. Bog vegetation did not immediately react in unison to a climatic change at this pollen zone boundary; instead, the timing of vegetation change depended on the location within the bog...|$|R

The Amazonian Slash-and-Burn Model and the Succession Model, both agentbased models, were developed to help address how much influence prehistoric Amazonian populations practicing slash-and-burn cultivation had on their surrounding environment and if different slash-and-burn cultivation strategies, i. e. short-fallow, bush-fallow, and long-fallow, could be identified based on the signatures left behind by these cultivation practices in subsequent forest composition and patterning. Both models were sensitivity tested to determine the validity and predictability of the parameters generated from ethnographic data. The outcome of this testing indicates that varying cultivation and fallow cycle lengths create different proportions of forest land, fallow land, and cultivation land on the total landscape through time. These results suggest that different prehistoric Amazonian slash-and-burn cultivation strategies could potentially be identified in <b>paleoecological</b> <b>records</b> based on the proportional signatures...|$|R
