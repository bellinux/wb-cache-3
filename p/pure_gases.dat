25|$|In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro {{verified}} that equal {{volumes of}} <b>pure</b> <b>gases</b> contain {{the same number}} of particles. His theory was not generally accepted until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name Avogadro's constant represents the number of atoms found in 12grams of elemental carbon-12 (6.022×1023 mol−1). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) occupies 22.40 liters, which {{is referred to as the}} molar volume.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{fundamental}} states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of <b>pure</b> <b>gases</b> much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.|$|E
2500|$|A {{breathing}} gas is {{a mixture}} of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common, and only natural, breathing gas. [...] But other mixtures of gases, or <b>pure</b> <b>gases,</b> are also used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats such as scuba equipment, surface supplied diving equipment, recompression chambers, submarines, space suits, spacecraft, medical life support and first aid equipment, high-altitude mountaineering and anaesthetic machines.|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{absorption}} behaviour of four {{commonly used}} cement based building products: cement paste, concrete block, expanded polystyrene bead (EPB) and cement-bonded cellulose fiberboard are studied. Cement products are manufactured following industry formulation and process, and carbonation curing {{takes place in}} a chamber under a pressure of 0. 5 MPa, at ambient temperature, for durations of mostly 2 to 8 hours with both <b>pure</b> carbon dioxide <b>gas</b> and flue gas. The flue gas of 13. 8 % CO 2 content is collected from a typical cement kiln without separation. Influencing factors on carbon uptake, long-term strength as well as microstructure development are studied. It is found that the CO 2 uptake ability of those cement-based products follows the same order when exposed to either <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> or flue gas: fiberboard has the highest uptake capacity, followed by cement paste, bead board and concrete. For fiberboard, the best CO 2 uptake in flue gas is 8. 1 %, it reaches 23. 6 % if <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> used. Introduction of cellulose fiber in the fiberboard significantly increases voids volume and cement paste surface area through dispersing the paste onto fiber surface, effectively increasing carbonation reaction sites and thus CO 2 uptake. For <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> carbonation with high reaction rate, it takes longer time for carbonated products to further develop strength from subsequent hydration, due to the high water loss during carbonation, the densified cement matrix structures and even fast decalcified cement minerals. Fast carbonation with <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> is detrimental to cement paste in its long-term strength. For flue gas carbonation, both immediate strengths and long-term strength of the products are comparable with those by <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> carbonation, although with less CO 2 uptake ability. Five CO 2 uptake determination methods are evaluated. Weight gain method is suitable for both <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> and flue gas carbonation systems. Mass curve method is more suited for <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> carbonation. For flue gas carbonation, CO 2 concentration method agreed well with the weight gain method. Pressure drop method is relatively less accurate because of water vapor generation during carbonation...|$|R

40|$|In nonequilibrium gas-particle nozzle flows, new {{definitions}} for {{the effective}} nozzle area ratio and effective Mach number, {{which can be}} called virtual area and virtual Mach number, are proposed.

This `pseudo pure gas' resembles that of real diatomic gas with vibrational mode relaxation.

50|$|<b>Pure</b> <b>gases</b> can be {{separated}} from air by first cooling it until it liquefies, then selectively distilling the components at their various boiling temperatures. The process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive. This process was pioneered by Dr. Carl von Linde in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of the viscosity and phase behavior of <b>pure</b> hydrocarbon <b>gases</b> and hydrocarbon gas mixtures is essential for reliable reservoir characterization and simulation and, hence, for optimum usage and exploitation. The variety of possible hydrocarbon gas mixtures at different conditions of interest preclude obtaining the relevant data by experimental means alone; thus, the development of prediction methods is required. Many <b>pure</b> hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> viscosity correlations are available. However, a wide-ranging and accurate viscosity correlation of gas mixtures associated with heavier hydrocarbon components and impurity components, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen sulphide, is not available. Therefore, this paper presents a new <b>pure</b> hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> and gas mixture viscosity model {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and pressures as a function of gas density, pseudo-reduced temperature, pseudo-reduced pressure, and the molecular weight of <b>pure</b> and hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> mixtures. The new model is designed to be simpler and eliminate the numerous computations involved in any equation of state(EOS) calculation. The developed new model yields a more accurate prediction of the <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> and gas mixture viscosity compared to the commonly used correlations. King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a leak in a vessel containing <b>pure</b> <b>gas</b> can induce the contamination by atmospheric gas diffusing into the vessel. In order to avoid this, a gas which {{has to be kept}} pure also in presen ce of a leak is usually pressurized, to reduce the flow of contaminating gas through the leak owing to the molecular drag by the outstreaming <b>pure</b> <b>gas.</b> In this paper, a simple model calculation of ba ckstreaming based on the solution of the diffusion + drag equation in cylindrical coordinates is presented. It is shown that both the pressure difference and the dimension of the leak are critical in determining the contaminating flow, a maximum in the backstreaming flow appearing when the drag velocity of the outstreaming gas equals the diffusion velocity...|$|R
