40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> in EU law’ explores {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> {{obligations}} in European law, {{and offers a}} comprehensive framework to classify and understand those obligations. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is ubiquitous and multifaceted. The obligations derived from it range from a duty to allow access to documents held by the EU-institutions to a prohibition to change {{the terms of a}} contract concluded after a procurement procedure. But although transparency is a diffuse concept, it has a distinct core: the concept refers to the availability, accessibility and clarity of information. However, the concept <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> does not in itself determine the target and the timing <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> obligations, nor does it tell us much about the acceptability of exceptions, and whether information should be provided pro-actively or on request. The author provides a method to determine the exact nature <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> obligations that can be derived from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> in concrete situations. She explains how the application <b>of</b> the EU <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is affected by the manner in which transparency contributes to the realisation of a variety of goals, the context in which it is applied, and the presence of conflicting interests. The key to understanding the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is appreciating its instrumental value. By being transparent, governments can promote democracy and individual rights, and improve economic performance. These goals are realised by means of two related but distinct mechanisms. First, transparency aids people in decision-making. Second, it allows them to see what is going on inside government. As such it is a precondition for any attempt to affect what is going on inside that government. Understanding how transparency functions is insufficient though: whether there is an obligation to be transparent is determined by the normative framework that governs the relation between the government and its citizens. This framework differs depending on whether this relation is perceived as one involving the citoyen, homo economicus, or homo dignus. For the citoyen, the overarching principle governing its relation with the government is democracy. For homo economicus, it is the promotion of the internal market and the Treaty freedoms. For homo dignus, it is the respect for human rights. The contents <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> are determined by these higher-order <b>principles.</b> Because <b>of</b> that, we can only derive those particular transparency obligations from it that do in fact contribute to the realisation of the state that is embodied in those higher order principles. Because transparency always functions in the same two distinct ways to bring about its positive effects – it facilitates decision-making and allows outsiders to see what public authorities are doing – our understanding of {{the manner in which it}} functions provides us with a way to determine what concrete transparency obligations we can derive from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency,</b> provided we know what effects the law requires us to achieve by its observance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is {{something}} <b>of</b> an oddity in EU law. Indeed, some {{doubt that there}} is one general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency.</b> The importance <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> within the EU can be established beyond a doubt, and it is prevalent in numerous fields of EU law, but the obligations that are derived therefrom vary wildly. This makes it hard to get a good grasp <b>of</b> what the <b>principle</b> requires. It is possible to bring some system into this chaos, though. The author identifies two mechanisms by which transparency brings about the many positive consequences that have been attributed to it and combines them with the normative frameworks that guide the relation between public authorities and EU citizens into six categories <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> obligations. Each <b>of</b> these categories has a distinct goal, and suggests a different answer to the questions one is faced with when confronted with a demand to be ‘transparent. ...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to a deep-rooted belief, it {{is argued}} in this article that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> as {{promoted}} at the European level needs to be extended beyond merely the right of access to documents.

A broader definition is therefore proposed and appropriate standards are generated to assess whether the EU institutions engaged in law-making are actually transparent. Empirical evidence shows that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is inconsistently respected by the EU legislator. Whilst the Commission meets the expected levels of compliance, practice in the Council turns out to be increasingly but not yet sufficiently satisfactory.
