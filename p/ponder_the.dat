5|$|Mindful of {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. As of February 2015, the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the time}} that Phillips was eleven, she heard a sermon given {{by a member of}} the London Missionary Society. After hearing the sermon, Phillips began to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{becoming}} a missionary in the future. After she decided that she was too shy to preach, though, Phillips abandoned the idea. As a young woman, Phillips also developed many different medical conditions, including haemorrhages and fibroids, eventually needing a hysterectomy. Due to her frequent visits to the hospital, Phillips then developed the ambition to become a doctor. Both of Phillips aspirations came together when Phillips was short on money. A friend of Phillips advised her to apply to receive a scholarship from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to help to pay for her school tuition. To qualify for the scholarship, Phillips needed to go abroad as a missionary doctor and apply to a specific mission. Phillips decided to take the offer and applied to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel (SPG). Originally wishing to go to India, Phillips instead got assigned to do her mission trip in China and arrived in China on 23 October 1905.|$|E

He notes {{that the development of}} a [...] "collective prejudice" [...] against a foreign entity provides meaning for the group by conjuring up an opposite who commit social taboos. He also suggests that one society's belief that a foreign society is cannibalistic might arise from an inability to differentiate between the latter's conceptions of the natural and the supernatural. As evidence, he asserts that rumors that the Indigenous Americans of Northeastern Canada were cannibals arose when foreign societies learned of their folkloric beliefs in man-eating giants who lived in the wilderness and conflated this fantasy with reality.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Gill Gregory, Procter [...] "does not overtly <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> vexed {{question}} of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame", unlike many other women poets of the time, such as Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with [...] "emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression". Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality, but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with [...] "peculiar strength"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding [...] "emotional energy ... against complications and nuances." [...] Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a [...] "morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted", and her poetry is marked by [...] "simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{critic of}} the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: [...] "it is a play of itself the worst that I ever heard in my life." [...] Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: [...] "Shakespear show'd {{the best of his}} skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him." [...] Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's [...] "most pleasing" [...] plays.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{figures are}} pierced in a {{conventional}} manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with Barbara Hepworth's sculptures. Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The [...] plaster [...] (1951) in the Tate, is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. As {{with much of the}} post-War work, there are several bronze casts of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, [...] "All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> meaning of what he has just seen.

[...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|When public {{relations}} specialist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life but he causes {{the train to}} derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray invites him home for dinner with his wife, Mary ( [...] Charlize Theron), and their son, Aaron, during which Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image. Hancock goes back home to <b>ponder</b> <b>the</b> offer and returns to his house {{the next day and}} grudgingly accepts.
