40|$|AbstractNatural {{ventilation}} {{is applied}} to realise the hygienic minimum air exchange, to <b>protect</b> <b>from</b> <b>moisture</b> damages and to provide good thermal comfort by intensive summer ventilation. Considering energy efficient buildings without mechanical cooling and ventilation, the air exchange rate provided by window ventilation is a crucial design variable. Simple analytical volume flow calculation allows the determination of air change rates for various window opening configurations and types under static conditions. This work first introduces the calculation method of a planning tool developed {{in the context of}} the ‘KonLuft’ project. With that tool common opening geometries and natural ventilation flow path configurations can be planned for residential and non-residential buildings. The very focus is on the validation of the analytical calculation method via full-scale traces-gas (TG) measurements for different window configurations. The investigations were carried out with a comprehensive monitoring system in one corner room of a historical office building in the city center of Stuttgart. The window types examined are bottom-hung and side-hung windows. A mismatch factor of approximately 1. 6 between the field experiment and the calculation is in common with a literature reference performing laboratory measurements. Hence it is advisable to take the local prevalent flow situation into account for calculations of volume flow...|$|E
40|$|Storage Conditions: 4 °C (<b>Protect</b> <b>from</b> <b>moisture,</b> allow {{sample to}} warm to room {{temperature}} before opening; ships at ambient temperature.) Background Information Zero-length crosslinking allows scientists to immobilize protein-protein interactions without introducing a spacer arm. The EDC / Sulfo-NHS system has been perhaps the most successful way of creating zero-length crosslinks for decades. Facilitated through a reactive carbodiimide (EDC) and Sulfo-NHS as a catalyst, this coupling procedure is a highly efficient choice for crosslinking proteins or immobilizing proteins to a support. This procedure is designed to assist the scientist in crosslinking proteins or creating protein:protein conjugates. Immobilization techniques and other uses for this set of reagents can be obtained by contacting ProteoChem’s technical support. General Sulfo-NHS Protein Crosslinking Protocol Important Notes: • Except as indicated in this protocol, avoid using buffers that contain DTT, EDTA, or β-Mercaptoethanol, as these can interfere with conjugation reaction. • It is recommended that the incubation steps of this procedure be done using a rotary stirring device, although intermittent light vortexing is also acceptable. • When choosing Protein # 1 (P 1) and Protein # 2 (P 2), ensure that P 1 has free carboxyl groups available (COOH) and P 2 has free amine groups available (NH 2) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{second phase}} is gelation, where as the pH {{continues}} to rise and the concentration of the ions in solution to increase, a critical point is reached and insoluble polyacrylates begin to precipitate. These polyanions have carboxylate groups whereby cations bind them, especially Ca2+ in this early phase, {{as it is the}} most readily available ion, crosslinking into calcium polyacrylate chains that begin to form a gel matrix, resulting in the initial hard set, within five minutes. Crosslinking, H bonds and physical entanglement of the chains are responsible for gelation. During this phase, the GIC is still vulnerable and must be <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> <b>moisture.</b> If contamination occurs, the chains will degrade and the GIC lose its strength and optical properties. Conversely, dehydration early on will crack the cement and make the surface porous.|$|R
40|$|Polymer Multi-Layer (PML) {{capacitors}} {{have demonstrated}} excellent performance for numerous power electronics applications, particularly where high temperature stability is required.

Conventional protective coatings, such as epoxies and polyurethanes, are extremely thick [...] usually over 1 mm. Previous work has shown that a thick coating leads to a large equivalent series inductance (ESL) of the capacitor, and negatively affects the capacitor performance. An ultra-thin moisture barrier coating is desirable to improve both electrical performance and capacitance density.

Based upon the several studies conducted, it is predicted that localized compressive stresses, on the order of the material strength will be achieved in a small region near the corner of the instrumentation pack, and are likely to cause some localized crushing under repetitive loading. Moreover, tensile stresses on the mid side of the instrumentation pack transverse to the direction of applied compressive stress exceed the modulus of rupture, and are likely to cause localized cracking of the concrete.

40|$|We {{fabricated}} crack self-healing capsules using {{cement powder}} for mixing into cement composites and evaluated {{the properties of}} the capsule manufacturing process in this study. The manufacture of the self-healing capsules is divided into core production processing of granulating cement in powder form and a coating process for creating a wall on the surfaces of the granulated cement particles. The produced capsules contain unhardened cement and can be mixed directly with the cement composite materials because they are <b>protected</b> <b>from</b> <b>moisture</b> by the wall material. Therefore, the untreated cement is present {{in the form of a}} capsule within the cement composite, and hydration can be induced by moisture penetrating the crack surface in the event of cracking. In the process of granulating the cement, it is important to obtain a suitable consistency through the kneading agent and to maintain the moisture barrier performance of the wall material. We can utilize the results of this study as a basis for advanced self-healing capsule technology for cement composites...|$|R
