40|$|International audienceThe {{heterogeneous}} oxidation of SO 2 by NO 2 on mineral dust was studied using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and a Knudsen cell.

The gas <b>phase</b> <b>loss</b> rate was determined to be first order in both SO 2 and NO 2. From the DRIFTS experiment the uptake coefficient, ?, for the formation of sulfate was determined to be of the order of 10 ? 10 using the BET area as the reactive surface area. No significant formation of sulfate was seen in the absence of NO 2. The Knudsen cell study gave uptake coefficients of the order of 10 ? 6 and 10 - 7 for SO 2 and NO 2, respectively.

40|$|It is {{documented}} that almost 98 % of all voltage generated by electric utilities has up to 3 % unbalance. Single phasing fault deserves special attention since <b>phase</b> <b>loss</b> {{is considered the}} worst case of unbalanced supply voltage. This paper focuses on unbalanced supply condition diagnosis and discrimination between an unbalance in the supply and <b>phase</b> <b>loss</b> fault. The discrimination {{will be based on}} the ratio of third harmonic to fundamental Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude components (RTHF-FFT) of the three-phase stator line currents and supply voltages under different load conditions and using artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed approach achieves high accuracy in detecting the unbalanced supply voltage condition in induction motor and identifying the level of severity of the fault. In addition, the proposed algorithm will discriminate between the effects of unbalanced supply voltage and those due to phase losses fault. The paper proposed a reliable approach for detection and diagnosis of unbalanced supply voltage condition. Possible loss of winding insulation under different percentages of unbalanced supply voltages will be predicted which could help preventing sudden failure of the motor during operation.

40|$|In {{order to}} test whether it is {{possible}} to increase the performance of a given linear tape-open (LTO) drive, a test setup is developed. This setup consists of an external LTO-drive and a data acquisition board in combination with the Matlab Simulink real time windows target. This soft-ware environment is used to implement the external controllers that will operate parallel to the internal controller that already is implemented in the external drive. The control gain of this internal controller can be set to zero in order to let the external controllers take over the control loop. To be able to design the new controllers, the dynamics of the LTO-tape are modeled. The frequency response of the plant is obtained by dividing the process sensitivity by the sensitivity. The offset gain of these dynamics is determined by looking at the sensitivity at high frequen-cies as the amplitude of the sensitivity will go to this offset gain at infinity. This data is used to fit a ninth order model on it. This model however does not represent the proposed setup com-pletely, since another setup is used for identifying.

Investigations show {{the sensitivity of}} these concepts to differing controlled-structures variables, and to rational system modeling effects. An evolutionary controls/structures design method is developed.

One and three dimensional examples from the literature are used to validate the method. Frequency domain interpretation of these controlled structure systems provide physical insight {{as to how the}} objective is optimized and consequently what is important in the objective. Several disturbance rejection type controls-structures systems are optimized for a stellar interferometer spacecraft application. The interferometric designs include closed loop tracking optics.

We evaluated the colonization time required for the developmental phase to change, as well as related limnological variables. Methods Samplings were carried out weekly, totaling 98 days of substrates exposure. We analyzed the limnological and periphyton variables (chlorophyll a, ash free dry mass, net and gross accrual rate). Results Maximum biomass occurred on the 42 nd day in rainy season and on the 98 th day in dry season. In the rainy season, the exponential phase of biomass accrual continued until the 28 th day of colonization, followed by a fluctuation phase (35 th to 77 th day) and then a <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> (84 th to 98 th days). In the dry season, the exponential phase continued until the 35 th day, followed by a <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> (42 th to 63 rd day) and then a fluctuation phase (70 th and 77 th day). In the same season, we observed {{the beginning of a}} new exponential phase (84 th to 98 th day).

Within the germinal center, however, Tfr cells potently suppress B cells through CTLA- 4, but with a mechanism independent of altering B 7 - 1 or B 7 - 2.
