5|$|Dallas {{was elected}} {{as part of}} a {{coalition}} between the Democratic Party organization and reforming independents who wished to challenge the Republican city government. The reforms in question focused many on shifting <b>power</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city council to the mayor and in converting the longstanding patronage system to convert to a merit system of city employment. Her reformist tendencies clashed with some of the party organization, and she went down to defeat in 1955. After a second career as a newspaper editor and investment banker, she retired in 1978 and died in 1983.|$|E

Arundel's son and heir Richard only recovered the title and lands in 1331, after Edward III had taken <b>power</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regency of Isabella and Mortimer. In the 1390s, a cult emerged around the late earl. He was venerated as a martyr, though he was never canonised.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with <b>power</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> internal combustion engine and regenerative braking, {{they can not be}} recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|A partial {{evacuation}} of British citizens {{was completed by}} 17 January, when the army riots in Southeast Africa prompted Rhyls diversion to Tanganyika so the troops she was carrying could assist in quelling the mutiny. In replacement, a company of the Gordon Highlanders was loaded aboard Owen so an intervention could still be made if necessary. The aircraft carriers Centaur and Victorious were also transferred to the region as part of Operation Parthenon. Although never enacted, Parthenon {{was intended as a}} precaution should Okello or the Umma party radicals attempt to seize <b>power</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more moderate ASP. In addition to the two carriers, the plan involved three destroyers, Owen, 13 helicopters, 21 transport and reconnaissance aircraft, the second battalion of the Scots Guards, 45 Commando of the Royal Marines and one company of the second battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The island of Unguja, and its airport, were to be seized by parachute and helicopter assault, followed up by the occupation of Pemba. Parthenon would have been the largest British airborne and amphibious operation since the Suez Crisis.|$|E

Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.|$|E
