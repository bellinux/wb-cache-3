50|$|The <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of human}} skin is {{non-linear}} and depends on many {{factors such as}} intensity, duration, history, and frequency of the electrical stimulus. Sweat gland activity, temperature, and individual variation also influence the <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> of skin. In addition to non-linearity, skin impedance exhibits asymmetric and time varying properties. These properties can be modeled with reasonable accuracy. Resistance measurements made at low voltage using a standard ohmmeter do not accurately represent the impedance of human skin over a significant range of conditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{magnetoresistance}} oscillations in superconducting NbNx nanowires synthesized through ammonia gas annealing of NbSe 3 precursor nanostructures.

We show that both the magnetoresistance oscillations and <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> observed in this work result from the granular structure of our nanowires.

The theory adequately reproduces the time-dependent <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the two extreme cases corresponding to the Lieberman rf sheath theory and the Metze-Ernie-Oskam theory. Contained within the approximation is a time constant which controls the amount of ion response to the rf electric field.

40|$|Two ITER-type Nb 3 Sn {{superconductor}} strands, one {{prepared with}} the bronze route {{and the other}} with the internal-tin route, were used to investigate the impact of filament cracking on the strand's transport properties. Careful mechanical polishing allowed unambiguous identification of the microscopic fractures of filaments caused by axial straining of the strands. After application of high axial tensile strain, densely and uniformly spaced cracks were observed in the bronze strand, while fewer but more correlated cracks occurred in the internal-tin strand. Crack initiation was observed in the bronze strand after an applied tensile strain of more than 0. 8 %, while for the internal-tin strand cracks were found already in the unloaded specimen, with further crack growth beyond 0. 3 % applied strain. With the Pacman strain device, the <b>voltage–current</b> <b>characteristics</b> at zero applied strain were measured after several successive applications of incrementally increasing tensile strain. Distinct dissimilarities in the <b>voltage–current</b> <b>characteristics</b> were observed between the dispersed and the collective crack distributions.

40|$|The {{application}} of quasiperiodic AlGaAs superlattices as a nonlinear {{element of the}} FitzHugh-Nagumo neuromorphic network is proposed and theoretically investigated on the example of Fibonacci and figurate superlattices. The sequences of symbols for the figurate superlattices were produced by decomposition of the Fibonacci superlattices' symbolic sequences. A length of each segment of the decomposition was equal to the corresponding figurate number. It is shown that a nonlinear network based upon Fibonacci and figurate superlattices provides better parallel filtration of a half-tone picture than a network based upon traditional diodes which have cubic <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It {{was found that the}} figurate superlattice F 011 (1) as a nonlinear network's element provides the filtration error almost twice less than the conventional "cubic" diode. These advantages are explained by a wavelike shape of the decreasing part of the quasiperiodic superlattice's <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which leads to multistability of the network's cell. This multistability promises new interesting nonlinear dynamical phenomena. A variety of wavy forms of <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> opens up new interesting possibilities for quasiperiodic superlattices and especially for figurate superlattices in many areas - from nervous system modeling to nonlinear control systems developmentComment: 19 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We report on their experimental observation in a superconducting film with a square lattice of perforated microholes (antidots) and on numerical simulations showing the Shapiro steps in the <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the de flux transformer. For the square antidot lattice, the ratio V-o/v of the step height to the applied rf frequency depends on the antidot lattice period d, while in the flux transformer geometry this ratio can be tuned by the magnetic field. This tuneability of the resolution makes the flux transformer a good candidate for applications (e. g. broad-band radiation detection). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{back-corona}} discharge {{is formed}} {{by a series}} of micro-discharges in the air spaces between the partcles of the dust layer deposited on the collecting plates.

In the present work, the variation of the <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics,</b> depending on resistivity and particle layer thickness, has been successfully reproduced by a simple electrical circuit model of the dust layer, including a back-corona current generator and the voltage drop across the particle layer. The model also includes an estimation of the variation of the captation efficiency: as back-corona lowers the ion space charge, the computation of the back-corona current allows to evaluate the variation of the particle charging rate and therefore of their migration velocity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} mechanisms that are responsible for the nonlinearities and asymmetries of the voltage current characteristic of the human skin. Furthermore to provide an explanation for the partially reversible breakdown of the electrical resistance of the skin that results in a rapid decrease of the skin resistance and occurs when the skin is stimulated with a dry electrode. The skin resistance and impedance was investigated with low frequency constant voltage pulses and with sinusoidal stimulation over a range of amplitudes (10 - 20 V) and frequencies (3 - 30 Hz), using a dry 79 mm 2 Ag/AgCI electrode. Evidence is presented that electroporation of the lipid bilayer membranes occurs in the dry skin over in the voltage range 10 - 20 V, a wider range than previously thought; it is further shown that experimental results are predicted by electroporation theory, if it is assumed that {{a small percentage of the}} total surface area of the dry skin consists of 15 lipid bilayers in series, rather than the generally accepted estimate of 70 - 100 layers. By modeling the dry skin as 15 lipid bilayers in series undergoing electroporation, the non-linearity of <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the skin is accurately predicted. Evidence is presented in support of a new hypothesis that the asymmetry of the skin's <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> can be attributed to electro-osmosis occurring within the lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum. It is further suggested that the existing mathematical description of electro-osmosis would not accurately describe this situation and equations were introduced to model the effect of electro-osmosis on the <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the skin. An electrical model of the skin is presented based on the hypothesis that the <b>VOltage-current</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the skin is due to the combined effect of electroporation and electro-osmosis on the lipid bilayers in the stratum corneum. In addition the model accounts for the effect of trans epidermal water loss. Dissertation (M Eng (Bio-Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Civil Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Multimegawatt {{operation}} of quasi-steady MPD arcjets can involve serious ablation of the insulator surfaces within the arc discharge chamber. Various degrees of insulator ablation manifest themselves by significantly perturbing the <b>voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the exhaust velocity profiles. <b>Voltage-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> for two different insulator materials, Plexiglas and boron nitride, are interpreted {{in terms of}} an empirical Ohm's law. Use of the refractory insulator material eliminates the ablation-dominated nature of the terminal voltage, but the exhaust stream is still disturbed by insulator material. An Alfven critical velocity model can be applied to this influence of insulator ablation on exhaust velocity. Appropriate changes in the propellant injection geometry eliminate this influence and result in arcjet operation which is independent of insulator material. A particular combination of propellant injection geometries reduces the terminal voltage for a given current and mass flow while maintaining insulator-independent operation, thus implying an improvement in the overall efficiency of the device...|$|R
