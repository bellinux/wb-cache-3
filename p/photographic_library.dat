The company would send out batches of photos to public libraries, and many remain there today. In addition, key images were reproduced as postcards from the 1920s through to the 1980s. In addition to Aerofilms’ own imagery, the firm expanded its holdings with the purchase of two smaller collections - AeroPictorial (1934-1960) and Airviews (1947-1991).|$|R
50|$|The BBC <b>Photographic</b> <b>Library</b> is {{responsible}} for approximately 10 million images, dating back to 1922, created for publicity purposes and subsequently kept for future use.

The images themselves are kept as originals in the archive, with digitisation only utilised when a specific image is required for use, when the image is sent in a digital format. Copies of images are also used in case any images are damaged, notable due to vinegar syndrome. The BBC <b>Photographic</b> <b>library</b> itself is based within BBC Television Centre, London.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a simple framework for automatically annotating images using non-parametric models of distributions of image features. We show that under this framework quite simple image properties such as global colour and texture distributions provide a strong basis for reliably annotating images. We report results on subsets of two <b>photographic</b> <b>libraries,</b> the Corel Photo Archive and the Getty Image Archive. We also {{show how the}} popular Earth Mover’s Distance measure can be effectively incorporated within this framework. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstract The first {{pictures}} of the earth were taken from a balloon in the mid- 19 th century and thus started ‘earth observation’. Aerial missions in the 20 th century enabled the build-up of outstanding <b>photographic</b> <b>libraries</b> and then with Landsat- 1, the first civilian satellite launched in 1972, digital images of the earth became an operational reality. The main roles of earth observation have become scientific, economic and strategic, {{and the role of}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is significant in this overall framework. Radar image exploitation has matured and several operational programs regularly use SAR data for input and numerous applications are being further developed. The technological development of interferometry and polarimetry has helped further develop these radar based applications. This paper highlights this role through a description of actual applications and projects, and concludes with a discussion of some challenges for which SAR systems may provide significant assistance...|$|R
