5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

Theories considering the effect of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake have also been linked to the lipodystrophic syndrome. It is possible that <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can cause a decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, representing inhibition of early steps in insulin signaling. Decreased adiponectin secretion and induced expression of interleukin-6 associated with HIV <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> may also contribute to inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.|$|R
5|$|The {{molecule}} ritonavir, {{marketed as}} Norvir, was {{developed as a}} <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> and used to target HIV infection. However, {{it has been shown}} to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases; to be specific, the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome is inhibited by ritonavir, while the trypsin-like activity is somewhat enhanced. Studies in animal models suggest that ritonavir may have inhibitory effects on the growth of glioma cells.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid polypeptide from tomato leaves that induced the production of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs of tomato systemin in other members of the Solanaceae including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the Solanaceae, but other members of the family, such as tobacco, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|Proteases {{from the}} {{digestive}} system of insects are targets of plant defense: the plant produces <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to eliminate them. These <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are small proteins, {{which can also}} be applied in crop protection, for instance through techniques of genetic modification (GMO). However, a number of polyphagous insects, for example Helicoverpa spp., appear not {{to be affected by}} <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Being polyphagous, these insects are used to the presence of different natural <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in their diet. This may explain why they have adapted and use a protease that cannot be inhibited by a range of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> This <b>protease</b> is homologous to proteases that are extremely sensitive to inhibitors, and we are seeking a molecular understanding of how this adapted protease can avoid being inhibited. <b>Protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> do work against a number of non-polyphagous insects and also against insects like aphids and thrips, which usually avoid contact with <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Application in agriculture is therefore increasin...|$|R

25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that {{presence}} of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have resulted in resistance to bevirimat. However, mutations at these sites were not found in phase I and II clinical trials. Instead, mutations in the glutamine-valine-threonine (QVT) motif of the SP1 peptide are also known to cause bevirimat resistance. In addition, V362I mutations have been shown to confer strong resistance to bevirimat, where the S373P and I376V mutations may confer low resistance to bevirimat. A further complication of the use of bevirimat is that, since bevirimat targets the CA/SP1 cleavage site, it could also be used in the treatment of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> resistant patients. Except for A364V, mutations in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have showed to result in fitness deficits when combined with <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> resistance. This proposes that these mutations may develop slowly. It has been shown that <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> resistance can result in an increase in the occurrence of mutations within the downstream QVT motif.|$|E

40|$|Proteases are {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by participating in the activation of mediator systems and by producing proteolytic tissue injury. Homeostatic control of inflammation is accomplished in part by physiologic <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The authors investigated the effectiveness of a number of synthetic <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in ameliorating the glomerular injury induced by immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in mice. Two amidine-type <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> bis (5 -amidino- 2 -benzimidazolyl) methane and 1, 2 -bis (5 -amidino- 2 -benzimidazolyl) ethane, had the greatest effects.

The inhibition constants of the <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> against nine purified physiologic proteases were determined. These results were discussed in relation to the effectiveness of the <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in reducing glomerular injury.

40|$|The global {{prevalence}} of HIV {{is a major}} challenge for control of visceral leishmaniasis, a disseminated protozoan infection. In some east African regions, up to 40 % of patients with visceral leishmaniasis are co-infected with HIV. Management of visceral leishmaniasis in such patients is complicated by treatment failures and relapses, even while patients are receiving standard antiretroviral therapy. In-vitro studies have consistently documented an inhibitory effect of specific HIV- 1 <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on leishmania parasites, and the underlying mechanism is partly explained. With the global scaling up of HIV treatment, HIV- 1 <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are increasingly becoming available for second-line HIV treatment in regions where visceral leishmaniasis and HIV are endemic. However, {{additional research is needed}} before HIV- 1 <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can be taken forward for clinical use against visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients. Since the effect of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> against Leishmania species was generally observed at high drug concentrations, efficacy and dose-response relationships should be studied in animals before these drugs are used in clinical trials. More extensive studies of all available HIV <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are needed, including investigation of drug interactions and emergence of drug-resistant parasites. In addition to exploring the full potential of current HIV- 1 <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> against visceral leishmaniasis, leishmania-specific <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> should be developed...|$|R

25|$|Antithrombin is a serine <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (serpin) that degrades the serine proteases: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa.

25|$|Oral mucosa heals {{faster than}} skin, {{suggesting}} that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived tissue factor, and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary tissue factor, associated with microvesicles shed from {{cells in the}} mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> secretory leukocyte <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing. Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, VEGF, TGF-β1, leptin, IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-α induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that cytoplasmic proteases play a functional role in {{programmed cell death}} was tested by examining the effect of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the T cell receptor-mediated death of the 2 B 4 murine T cell hybridoma and activated T cells. The cysteine <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> trans-epoxysuccininyl-L-leucylamido-(4 -guanidino) butane (E- 64) and leupeptin, the calpain selective inhibitor acetyl-leucyl-leucyl- normethional, and the serine <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, all showed dose- dependent blocking of the 2 B 4 death response triggered by the T cell receptor complex and by anti-Thy- 1. These <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> enhanced rather than inhibited IL- 2 secretion triggered by T cell receptor cross- linking, showing {{that they did not}} act by preventing signal transduction. Growth inhibition induced by cross-linking the 2 B 4 T cell receptor, measured by inhibition of thymidine incorporation, was not generally blocked by these <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> All five of these <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> enhanced rather than blocked 2 B 4 cell death triggered by dexamethasone, an agent previously shown to have a death pathway antagonistic with that of the TCR. 2 B 4 cytolysis by the cytotoxic agents staphylococcal alpha-toxin and dodecyl imidazole, and that caused by hypotonic conditions, was not significantly affected by the five <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> tested. The selected <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> blocked both the apoptotic nuclear morphology changes and DNA fragmentation induced by T cell receptor cross-linking, and enhanced both these properties induced by dexamethasone in 2 B 4 cells.

25|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{that interfere with}} bradykinin production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency {{in one of its}} prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH. This serine <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited.|$|E
