5|$|Smyth's {{research}} {{was in the}} subfields of <b>petrology,</b> chemical geology, and economic geology. When he began his research most American geologists who used chemistry were mineralogists, volcanologists, or specialists in ore. Smyth was a pioneer in chemical <b>petrology,</b> applying chemistry to ordinary rocks, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and <b>petrology</b> to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, {{convinced}} Smyth to {{join the}} Princeton faculty, where Smyth remained until retiring in 1934. He strengthened the graduate program in the Department of Geology, which awarded only two advanced degrees before 1912; during his 29 years, another 31 degrees were awarded. Among his students were Arthur Francis Buddington and Albert Orion Hayes. His courses in <b>petrology</b> and chemical geology introduced students to subjects that were relatively new in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{specialized}} in <b>petrology,</b> chemical geology, and economic geology. He showed the sedimentary origin of iron ore deposits near his native Clinton, New York, mapped the geology {{of the western}} Adirondack Mountains, and published a well known monograph {{on the origins of}} alkaline igneous rocks. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The <b>petrology</b> of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E

25|$|The AGU {{is divided}} into 11 {{sections}} that provide the main structure for managing volunteers, developing leaders and honoring scientists. These sections also reflect the breadth of science within Earth and space science: atmospheric sciences; biogeosciences; geodesy; geomagnetism, paleomagnetism and electromagnetism; hydrology; ocean sciences; planetary sciences; seismology; space physics and aeronomy; tectonophysics; volcanology, geochemistry, and <b>petrology.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} he {{attended}} St. John's College, Scrope had his first real experiences with what would become his geologic specialty – volcanoes {{and what would be}} called igneous <b>petrology.</b> During the winter break of 1817 through 1818, George went on a vacation with his mother and father in Italy. In Naples he explored Mount Vesuvius and other areas of volcanism in the region.|$|E
25|$|In igneous <b>petrology,</b> geologists {{attempt to}} learn more about {{volcanic}} systems through the record in igneous rocks. Most magma is generated in the mantle through a process called decompression melting. As material rises and the pressure decreases, solidus declines until part of the mantle can melt. At or near the surface, the magma cools and crystallizes. Depending on the conditions, it may have time to cool uniformly, or fractional crystallization can occur if parts of the magma are removed after they crystallize.|$|E
25|$|At first, NSF program {{managers}} were skeptical of this computational approach, and Ghiorso had three NSF proposals turned down. Fortunately, {{he managed to}} persuade the Digital Equipment Corporation to fund his work. After a decade of publishing thermodynamic data on minerals such as olivine and feldspar, Ghiorso and Sack presented their new model, now called MELTS. Their 1995 publication in Contributions to Mineralogy and <b>Petrology</b> became the journal's most cited paper, with more than 2,100 citations as of early 2017.|$|E
25|$|Geologists use {{a number}} of field, laboratory, and {{numerical}} modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to <b>petrology</b> (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface. Sub-specialities of geology may distinguish endogenous and exogenous geology.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} several {{attempts}} have been made to explain the observations with numerical geodynamical models of mantle convection. The purpose of these calculations was, among other things, to resolve the paradox that a broad plume with a relatively low temperature anomaly is in better agreement with the observed crustal thickness, topography, and gravity than a thin, hot plume, which has been invoked to explain the seismological and geochemical observations. The most recent models prefer a plume that is 180–200°C hotter than the surrounding mantle and has a stem with a radius of ca. 100km. Such temperatures have not yet been confirmed by <b>petrology,</b> however.|$|E
25|$|The {{passion for}} coins and medals led Remick to {{encourage}} the development of medals in recognition of excellence within the GAC. He supported the design and adoption of the Volcanology and Igneous <b>Petrology</b> Division’s Career Achievement Award and the Leopold Gelinas Medal. Remick actually paid for the dies and the first striking of medals. He would later be consulted {{on the design of}} the GAC Ward Neale Medal. Once again, he would also pay for its die and first run. Ward Neale was a long-time friend and fellow GAC stalwart. Jerry was honoured and delighted {{to be associated with the}} development of a medal for the public awareness of geoscience that honoured his friend.|$|E

These collections are dispersed among six independently administered units on campus, and include the Vascular Plant Herbarium, the Mycological Herbarium, the Lichen Herbarium, the Louisiana State Arthropod Museum, the Palynology Collection, the Mineralogy and <b>Petrology</b> Collections, the Textile and Costume Museum, the Louisiana Geological Survey Log Library and Core Repository, and, within the LSU Museum of Natural Science, the Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles, the Collection of Birds, the Collection of Fishes, the Collection of Genetic Resources, the Collection of Mammals, the Vertebrate Paleontology Collection, the Collection of Microfossils and Invertebrates, and the Anthropological and Ethnological Collections.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{isolation}} and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists. The German Gustav Nachtigal, dispatched by Otto von Bismarck, {{was the first}} European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869. Prior to Nachtigal's expedition, an American along with two missionaries had attempted to enter the Tibesti range, but were killed by a Toubou warrior. While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years, as he was convicted by the Toubou of spying for Bismarck and only released after the intervention of Maï Arami Tetimi. Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and <b>petrology</b> of the range. The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Margaret, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935. Le Cœur {{was the first to}} closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research. French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957. In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research at the station was interrupted several times due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974.|$|E

500|$|Smyth {{continued}} his studies at Cornell University under James Furman Kemp and Harvard University under Nathaniel Shaler. He also {{worked as an}} analytical chemist at the Franklin Iron Works, his father's company. He earned his Ph.D. in geology from Columbia in 1890, writing a dissertation titled [...] "The Origin of the Clinton Type of Iron Ore". He then spent an additional year studying <b>petrology</b> at Heidelberg University under Harry Rosenbusch, the world expert in the field.|$|E

2500|$|In the Slovak {{republic}} {{the content}} of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to [...] "Nature science" [...] in English (this course covers both biology and <b>petrology).</b> Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and {{is dependent on the}} teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.|$|E
