5000|$|Any stamp that is {{cancelled}} by postal authorities {{before it}} is sold is described as [...] "precancelled": the <b>precancellation</b> mark is an overprint. This is usually only done when stamps are sold in large bulk quantities to businesses or other large organizations: the postal service will save the labor of cancelling each individual stamp by precancelling the entire purchased quantity. The overprints also help prevent theft or misuse because they usually include {{the name of the}} city or region in which they are to be used. Unlike standard cancellation marks, they usually do not give a specific date, affording the bulk purchaser time to use them at their discretion. In some situations, however, months or years may be included in the overprint to indicate an expiration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” Space-time block codes (STBC) are {{powerful}} techniques to achieve full spatial diversity in Rayleigh fading channels with low decoding complexity. When channel state {{information is available}} to the transmitter, space-time block codes can be improved {{through the use of}} a transmit precoder chosen based in part on the current channel state. In this paper, we investigate the downlink transmission of an Alamouti space-time block coded multiuser wireless system in which complete channel knowledge is available to the base transceiver station. A novel unitary precoder is proposed that, with enough antennas, can effectively precancel co-channel interference at each mobile user thus enabling simple single user space-time block decoding. It is shown that excess transmit antennas, beyond the minimum required for <b>precancellation,</b> can be used to further improve the diversity performance through careful selection of the precoding matrix. Though the derivation assumes perfect channel state information, the impact of estimation error is investigated by deriving an lower bound on the signal to interference plus noise ratio. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed downlink precoder can effectively cancel the interference between mobiles, while still providing good diversity performance. I...|$|E
30|$|We present robust joint {{nonlinear}} transceiver {{designs for}} multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink {{in the presence}} of imperfections in the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit antennas, and each user terminal is equipped with one or more receive antennas. The BS employs Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for interuser interference <b>precancellation</b> at the transmitter. We consider robust transceiver designs that jointly optimize the transmit THP filters and receive filter for two models of CSIT errors. The first model is a stochastic error (SE) model, where the CSIT error is Gaussian-distributed. This model is applicable when the CSIT error is dominated by channel estimation error. In this case, the proposed robust transceiver design seeks to minimize a stochastic function of the sum mean square error (SMSE) under a constraint on the total BS transmit power. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. The other model we consider is a norm-bounded error (NBE) model, where the CSIT error can be specified by an uncertainty set. This model is applicable when the CSIT error is dominated by quantization errors. In this case, we consider a worst-case design. For this model, we consider robust (i) minimum SMSE, (ii) MSE-constrained, and (iii) MSE-balancing transceiver designs. We propose iterative algorithms to solve these problems, wherein each iteration involves a pair of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Further, we consider an extension of the proposed algorithm to the case with per-antenna power constraints. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed algorithms to imperfections in CSIT through simulation, and show that the proposed robust designs outperform nonrobust designs as well as robust linear transceiver designs reported in the recent literature.|$|E
