50|$|On 16 May 1991, the {{sentence}} {{was reduced to}} {{two and a half}} years. Lord Justice Neill said that he was satisfied that Saunders was suffering from <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is incurable. The decision was based on evidence from Dr Patrick Gallwey, a forensic pathologist, that Saunders was unable to recite three numbers backwards, was unable to use a door and his assertion that Gerald Ford rather than George Bush was the current President of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Sheekman {{suffered}} a heart attack in the spring of 1960 and his health became a concern. In 1970, his confusion and disorientation were diagnosed as <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia.</b> Sheekman had to be cared for in a nursing facility. During the next seven years, Groucho regularly came to see his friend. Gloria Stuart wrote in her book, [...] "The only tender thing I ever heard Groucho say was to my husband on a visit... Leaning down over Arthur's wheelchair he said, [...] "Don't go before I go, Sheek." [...] Sheek did not. He died five months after Groucho on January 12, 1978.|$|E
40|$|Although {{forms of}} {{dementia}} arising {{late in life}} had been identified by Kraepelin and {{his colleagues in the}} 1800 s, it was not until 1907 that Alois Alzheimer identified the <b>pre-senile</b> form of <b>dementia</b> with unique neuropathologic fea-tures that now bears his name. Alzheimer described a 51 -year-old woman who presented with personality changes and soon developed progressively worsening memory loss, disorientation to time, and language disturbances but who had relatively normal neurologic function. Mental deterio-ration progressed, and she died 41 ⁄ 2 years later. On autopsy, her brain showed clear evidence of cerebral atrophy. Under the microscope, Alzheimer discovered that many cortical neurons contained argyrophilic fibrous structures—neuro-fibrillary tangles (NFTs) —now known to be mainly com-posed of abnormal filamentous forms of the microtubule...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} the recommendations on supplementary exams employed for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Brazil published in 2005. A systematic assessment of the consensus reached in other countries, and of articles on AD diagnosis in Brazil available on the PUBMED and LILACS medical databases, was carried out. Recommended laboratory exams included complete blood count, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), albumin, hepatic enzymes, Vitamin B 12, folic acid, calcium, serological reactions for syphilis and serology for HIV in patients aged younger than 60 years with atypical clinical signs or suggestive symptoms. Structural neuroimaging, computed tomography or - preferably - magnetic resonance exams, are indicated for diagnostic investigation of dementia syndrome to rule out secondary etiologies. Functional neuroimaging exams (SPECT and PET), when available, increase diagnostic reliability and assist in the differential diagnosis of other types of dementia. The cerebrospinal fluid exam is indicated in cases of <b>pre-senile</b> onset <b>dementia</b> with atypical clinical presentation or course, for communicant hydrocephaly, and suspected inflammatory, infectious or prion disease of the central nervous system. Routine electroencephalograms aid the differential diagnosis of dementia syndrome with other conditions which impair cognitive functioning. Genotyping of apolipoprotein E or other susceptibility polymorphisms is not recommended for diagnostic purposes or for assessing the risk of developing the disease. Biomarkers related to the molecular alterations in AD are largely limited to use exclusively in research protocols, but when available can contribute to improving the accuracy of diagnosis of the disease...|$|R
50|$|Current {{association}} of dementia and PPIs {{have been documented}} in Germany and in research articles denoting how benzimidazole derivatives, astemizole (AST) and lansoprazole (LNS) interact with anomalous aggregates of tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles). Current theories include the non-selective blockade of sodium-potassium pumps in the brain causing osmotic imbalances or swelling in the cells. opinionInteraction of PPIs with other drug affecting the sodium-potassium pump, e.g., digoxin, warfarin etc., has been well documented.Memory {{has been associated with}} astrocytes and the alpha3 subunit of adenosine receptor found in hydrogen/Sodium-potassium pumps may be a focal point in dementia.Chronic use of PPIs may cause down regulation of alpha3 subunit increasing damage to astrocytes.Osteopetrosis via TCIRG1 gene has a strong association with <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because of his {{apparent}} illness, Saunders {{was released from}} Ford Open Prison on 28 June 1991 having served only ten months of his sentence. (He would normally {{have been expected to}} have served 15 months of the 30-month sentence). After his release, he recovered from the symptoms which had led to the diagnosis. Saunders himself claimed in 1994 that he was never diagnosed with Alzheimer's, When asked by The Independent in 1996, Dr Gallwey commented: [...] "In the early stages of Alzheimer's or <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia,</b> it can be very difficult to make a diagnosis, so we did not make one; we expressed worries about it." [...] It has been suggested he was in reality suffering from memory loss caused by stress.|$|E
40|$|CLINICAL and {{pathological}} {{findings on}} the condition of <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> first described by Creutzfeldt and Jakob have most recently been reported by Siedler and Malamud (1963).

40|$|Factors {{associated}} with survival were studied in 84 neuropathologically documented {{cases of the}} <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> frontotemporal dementia lobar degeneration (FTLD) with transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP- 43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated mean survival as 7. 9 years (range: 1 - 19 years, SD = 4. 64). Familial and sporadic cases exhibited similar survival, including progranulin (GRN) gene mutation cases. No significant differences in survival were {{associated with}} sex, disease onset, Braak disease stage, or disease subtype, but higher survival was associated with lower post-mortem brain weight. Survival was significantly reduced in cases with associated motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) but increased with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) co-morbidity. Cox regression analysis suggested that reduced survival was associated with increased densities of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) while increased survival was associated with greater densities of enlarged neurons (EN) in the frontal and temporal lobes. The data suggest that: (1) survival in FTLD-TDP is more prolonged than typical in <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> but shorter than some clinical subtypes such as the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), (2) MND co-morbidity predicts poor survival, and (3) NCI may develop early and EN later in the disease. The data have implications for both neuropathological characterization and subtyping of FTLD-TDP...|$|E
40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is {{typically}} {{described as a}} <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia.</b> However, cases do occur in the elderly and a case of sporadic CJD in an 86 -year-old patient is described. The database of the UK national surveillance unit has been studied, and the age-specific incidences for various age groups over the period 1980 - 93 calculated. Cases of CJD in those over 80 years old have been identified and their clinical characteristics examined. There {{is no evidence that}} CJD presents atypically in the elderly, or that large numbers of cases are being missed in the elderly due to poor ascertainment...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{five million}} people suffer with Alzheimer disease (AD) {{and more than}} twenty-four million people are {{diagnosed}} with AD, <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia,</b> and other disorders of cognitive loss worldwide. Furthermore, the annual cost per patient with AD can approach $ 200, 000 with an annual population aggregate cost of $ 100 billion. Yet, complete therapeutic prevention or reversal of neurovascular injury during AD and cognitive loss is not achievable despite the current understanding of the cellular pathways that modulate nervous system injury during these disorders. As a result, identification of novel therapeutic targets {{for the treatment of}} neurovascular injury would be extremely beneficial to reduce or eliminate disability from diseases that lead to cognitive loss or impairment. Here we describe the capacity of intrinsic cellular mechanisms for the novel pathways of erythropoietin and forkhead transcription factors that may offer not only new strategies for disorders such as AD and cognitive loss, but also function as biomarkers for disease onset and progression...|$|E
40|$|Alois Alzheimer {{might have}} {{mentioned}} plaques and tangles {{in a single}} short paper on <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> in 1907 {{but it was the}} co-discover of Alzheimer’s disease, Oskar Fischer, who in that same year far more extensively reported neuritic plaque in 12 cases of senile dementia, a condition which he and many others refused to differentiate from Alzheimer’s “pre-senile” dementia. Fischer, Alzheimer’s great rival, speculated {{that for the most part}} these plaques, found only in senile demented patients, caused their dementia. Moreover, Fischer felt such cerebral plaque to be the result of an infection and was very specific as to the sort of infection that might be involved. He felt that he had spotted, throughout his Alzheimer’s brain autopsies, a tubercular-like Actinobacteria then called Streptothrix (Actinomycosis), often and repeatedly confused with the filamentous cell-wall-deficient (CWD) forms of the tubercular bacilli. At this point for Fischer, this was the possible infectious cause of Alzheimer’s. To be sure, Oskar Fischer was the first on record to suggest that chronic infection might be causative for what we today call Alzheimer’s disease. Fischer’s infectious view never gained immediate popularity, although today, more than a century later, a volume of data supporting such an approach has begun to accumulate. But was Fischer’s specific microbe on the right track to discovering the cause of Alzheimer’s to begin with? Documents uncovered since then seem to suggest that he was considerably closer than anyone else –either then or since...|$|E
40|$|Frontotemporal lobar {{degeneration}} (FTLD) is {{the second}} most common form of <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia.</b> Recent discoveries have identified the proteins present in the pathological ubiquitinated inclusions of previously undifferentiated subtypes of FTLD. Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) is the primary pathological marker of a subtype now called FTLD-FUS. This normally nuclear protein is seen within the cytoplasmic and intranuclear aggregates of FTLD-FUS. FUS, together with Ewing’s Sarcoma (EWS) and TATA box binding associated factor 68 kDa (TAF 15), forms the FET family. These related proteins are predominately nuclear owing to the action of the nuclear importin Transportin 1 (TRN 1). Investigations by other authors have implicated TRN 1 in the cytoplasmic aggregation of ALS-associated mutant FUS. Since ALS and FTLD represent different ends of a disease spectrum, the role of TRN 1 in the pathology and biochemistry of FTLD-FUS was investigated. Extensive TRN 1, TAF 15 and EWS cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions were seen throughout the frontal cortex, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, medulla, XIIth cranial nerve nucleus and spinal cord. Double-label immunofluorescence revealed TRN 1 and FUS pathology co-localised. Immunoblotting of solubility fractions demonstrated that highly insoluble, likely highly aggregated TRN 1 is present in FTLD-FUS, and not in healthy controls. Stress granules are transient cytoplasmic foci consisting of stalled translation initiation complexes and associated proteins produced by the cell in response to various stressors. Cellular investigations revealed that the same antibodies used to detect TRN 1 pathology in FTLD-FUS labelled cytoplasmic stress granules induced after oxidative or osmotic stress. The re-localisation of wild type endogenous FET proteins was investigated under various pharmacological agents as well as TRN 1 knockdown and overexpression. Evidence is presented that the pathology of FTLD-FUS is more complex than previously thought. Cellular studies investigate the implication of stress granules in aggregate formation and find that there is evidence to support oxidative stress in protein re-localisation and aggregation...|$|E
30|$|Water is most {{abundant}} {{and is an}} essential component of our life supporting system. Near about 97 % of earth’s surface is covered by water. But from the last few decades, these water resources are getting polluted by various natural and anthropogenic contaminants such as heavy metals, fluoride, arsenic, lead and mercury (Abu Bakar et al. 2016; Bashir et al. 2012). Among all the contaminants, fluoride contamination of water has now become a major issue in most of the parts of the world because of its toxic effects. Fluoride is well recognized as an element of public health concern. Fluoride is present universally in almost every water (higher concentrations are found in ground water), earth crust, many minerals, rocks, etc. It is also present in most of our everyday needs, viz. toothpastes, drugs, cosmetics, chewing gums, mouthwashes, and so forth (Bashir et al. 2012; Rout et al. 2015). Though a small amount of it is beneficial for human health for preventing dental carries, it is very harmful when present in excess. Maximum permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water has been set as 1.5  mg/L by many regulatory authorities such as WHO, US EPA, CPCB and so forth (Bashir et al. 2015; Bell and Ludwig 1970; Kanaujia et al. 2015; Singh 2017). The high fluoride levels in drinking water and its impacts on human health have increased the importance of defluoridation studies (Chidambaram et al. 2004; Singh 2017). The magnitude of the problem is sinking in, and efforts are being made towards defluoridation of drinking water, combating the debilating fluorosis and taking steps to prevent and control the disease (Karthikeyan and Ilango 2007). Chemical coagulants like Aluminum sulphate (alum), FeCl 2 are used in the Municipal drinking water treatment plant for the purification process. This excess use of an amount of chemical coagulants can affect human health, e.g., Aluminum has also been indicated to be a causative agent in neurological diseases such as <b>pre-senile</b> <b>dementia</b> (Muyibi and Evison 1995). The conventional method of fluoride removal includes: ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, and adsorption (Popat et al. 1994). Adsorption processes using natural adsorbents or agricultural waste products are becoming the new alternatives for the removal of fluoride from aqueous solution as they are cheap, simple, sludge-free, regenerable, environment friendly, involve small initial cost, and minimal chemical use (Saka and Sahin 2011).|$|E
