50|$|Trade credit {{insurance}} usually covers {{a portfolio of}} buyers and pays an agreed percentage of an invoice or receivable that remains unpaid {{as a result of}} <b>protracted</b> <b>default,</b> insolvency or bankruptcy. Policy holders must apply a credit limit on each of their buyers for the sales to that buyer to be insured. The premium rate reflects the average credit risk of the insured portfolio of buyers. In addition, {{credit insurance}} can also cover single transactions or trade with only one buyer.|$|E
50|$|Risks covered include {{political}} risks, such as {{bad debt}} losses due to legislative or administrative measures, war, and civil commotion, losses {{due to the}} inability to convert or transfer sums paid in local currency by the debtor due to restrictions in the international payment system, inability to fulfill the contract due to political circumstances, and loss of goods (before the risk has passed to the foreign buyer) due to political circumstances, such as the goods being confiscated or destroyed. They also include commercial risks such as <b>protracted</b> <b>default</b> and bankruptcy of the buyer.|$|E
5000|$|Trade credit insurance, {{business}} credit insurance, {{export credit}} insurance, or credit insurance is {{an insurance policy}} and a risk management product offered by private insurance companies and governmental export credit agencies to business entities wishing to protect their accounts receivable from loss due to credit risks such as <b>protracted</b> <b>default,</b> insolvency or bankruptcy. This insurance product {{is a type of}} property and casualty insurance, and {{should not be confused with}} such products as credit life or credit disability insurance, which individuals obtain to protect against the risk of loss of income needed to pay debts. Trade credit insurance can include a component of political risk insurance which is offered by the same insurers to insure the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers due to currency issues, political unrest, expropriation etc.|$|E
50|$|Payments for {{exports are}} open to risks even {{at the best of}} times. The risks have assumed large {{proportions}} today due to the far-reaching political and economic changes that are sweeping the world. An outbreak of war or civil war may block or delay payment for goods exported. A coup or an insurrection may also bring about the same result. Economic difficulties or balance of payment problems may lead a country to impose restrictions on either import of certain goods or on transfer of payments for goods imported. In addition, the exporters have to face commercial risks of insolvency or <b>protracted</b> THE <b>default</b> of buyers. The commercial risks of a foreign buyer going bankrupt or losing his capacity to pay are aggravated due to the political and economic uncertainties. Export credit insurance is designed to protect exporters from the consequences of the payment risks, both political and commercial, and to enable them to expand their overseas business without fear of loss.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the debt}} ceiling is {{actually}} reached without {{an increase in}} the limit having been enacted, Treasury will need to resort to [...] "extraordinary measures" [...] to temporarily finance government expenditures and obligations until a resolution can be reached. The Treasury has never reached the point of exhausting extraordinary measures, resulting in default, although on some occasions, Congress appeared like it would allow a default to take place. If this situation were to occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt to avoid a default on its bond obligations, but it would at least have to default on some of its non-bond payment obligations. A <b>protracted</b> <b>default</b> could trigger a variety of economic problems including a financial crisis, and a decline in output that would put the country into an economic recession.|$|E
40|$|Argentina {{has been}} making its {{way back to the}} {{international}} capital markets after being shunned for almost a decade following a catastrophic default and devaluation. The question of whether financial intermediaries and institutional investors in the U. S. and Europe should welcome Argentina back to the global capital markets is certainly relevant –- especially for those with short memories who may be tempted by the high yields on offer to rush in without a full understanding of the significant risks involved. At first sight, it would appear that Argentina {{has come a long way}} from its troubled past: it has recorded major gains in real GDP, employment growth, and various financial ratios that usually buttress creditworthiness (e. g., tax revenues, export earnings and international reserves). However, it would be naïve to rush to the conclusion that Argentina is a creditworthy or relatively safe place in which to invest. Notwithstanding an impressive economic recovery, the country’s ability to service its financial obligations remains quite limited, and the government’s attitude toward official and private creditors, as well as toward court judgments and arbitral awards, remains one of contempt. The country is ranked uniformly low in various measures of the business climate, competitiveness, transparency, corruption and economic liberty. Therefore, Argentina –- including its sovereign, sub-sovereign and most corporate issuers –- is classified correctly as a very risky, single-B credit by the leading rating agencies. Indeed, the country remains an outlier in the community of nations. It is the only nation in the G- 20 group of countries that is in <b>protracted</b> <b>default</b> on its financial obligations to its fellow members. It is the only country in the G- 20 that refuses to abide by its treaty obligations to the International Monetary Fund. It is the only member of the G- 20 to have received a "thumbs down" from the leading governmental organization that sets and monitors standards to combat transnational financial crimes. And it is the G- 20 member with by far the most investor claims against it in the world’s premier dispute resolution center. ...|$|E
