In this manner, Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Rise of Scourge was {{released}} on 24 June 2008 and, unlike the other manga which form trilogies, is a standalone volume. The story details the early life of BloodClan leader Scourge, one of the antagonists in The Darkest Hour, who is bullied in his youth for being small. The book chronicles his story up to the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> he kills Tigerstar, who once attacked Scourge when he ventured into the forest as a kitten.|$|E
5|$|Abby {{is in love}} again, {{but then}} finds out that Charles is the front {{for a group of}} thugs wanting to build a marina at Lotus Point for drug trafficking. Abby pretends {{to go along with the}} {{marriage}} and accepts a two million dollar wedding gift from Charles. After the ceremony she has the marriage annulled, but keeps the money. After this, Abby marries Greg Sumner. It isn't love, but rather a political marriage. Abby forms another company, Morikame, in order to buy Lotus <b>Point.</b> <b>When</b> her former partners find out and threaten to have her arrested for fraud, she donates Lotus Point to the government as a wildlife preserve. Abby goes after a political appointment that Greg wants, and leaves Knots Landing to be a trade representative in Japan. Abby later forms another illegal company with Nigel Treadwell, and tries to take over the Sumner Group, but her plan fails. She moves back into her old house on the cul-de-sac.|$|E

5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a <b>point</b> <b>when</b> it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Easy was {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. The hurricane developed in the western Caribbean Sea on September 1, and tracked northeastward. After crossing Cuba, the hurricane rapidly strengthened in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h). Easy executed a cyclonic loop, moved northeastward to hit near Cedar Key, Florida, executed a second loop, and hit western Florida again. After rapidly weakening over Florida, the hurricane turned to the northwest, and ultimately dissipated over northeastern Arkansas on September 9. From the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> Hurricane Easy entered the Gulf of Mexico until it weakened to a tropical storm, it was observed nearly constantly from radars or Reconnaissance Aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking <b>point</b> <b>when,</b> on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{bounced back}} in the 200m {{backstroke}} and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze {{in a time of}} 2m 3.14s behind the Hungarian duo of Sándor Wladár and Zoltán Verrasztó. He edged out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since David Theile in 1960. In the 4200m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway <b>point</b> <b>when</b> Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth {{by the end of his}} leg, just 0.78s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1m 52.64s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon could not keep pace with the opposition anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52s outside the medals.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper <b>Point</b> <b>when</b> a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

5|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team {{spent the}} first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines, organising field research field trips, and capturing photographs. A total of 180,000 photographs were available as resources throughout development, and over 1,000 newspapers were used for research. Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets were the result of researched reference material. For example, the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference <b>point</b> <b>when</b> modelling an apartment building in the game. However, some sets were originally designed, {{in order to meet the}} gameplay or the narrative script.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route210 (NY210) is a {{state highway}} in Orange County, New York, in the United States. It runs north from the New Jersey state line—where it {{continues}} south as Passaic County Route511 (CR511)—along the west shore of Greenwood Lake to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, where it ends at a junction with NY17A. It was once much longer, as it originally extended east along NY17A and CR106 in Orange and Rockland counties to Stony <b>Point</b> <b>when</b> it was assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route was truncated to its current length in 1982. Prior to becoming NY210 in 1930, the road alongside Greenwood Lake was part of NY55, a route connecting New Jersey to Goshen, in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading {{on the outside}} of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, may help explain why they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Paul Brown and Modell reached a breaking <b>point</b> <b>when</b> Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the rights}} to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only heard about it after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis a chance to play before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, dying on May 18, 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the composition is a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore {{the date of the}} composition is not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled juxtaposition of biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an anonymous author. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da gamba and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning <b>point,</b> <b>when</b> the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E
