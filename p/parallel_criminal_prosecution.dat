5000|$|There {{is not a}} rule or law {{explicitly}} {{saying that}} the absolute right to institute a <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{is given to the}} Government. Thus, theoretically, the general public or individuals are allowed to prosecute. Moreover, Section 14 of the Magistrates Ordinance (i.e. Chapter 227) gives guidance on how the Secretary for Justice intervenes and assumes a private <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution.</b> This provision indeed indirectly points out the possibility of private <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution.</b> However, practically, private <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> does not exist because of the expensive costs involved in <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> the lack of manpower, resources, and special statutory powers to carry out a thorough investigation, the exclusive right for the Secretary for Justice to get involved or even take over private <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> the requirement of beyond reasonable doubt of evidence, etc. Consequently, the Secretary {{is the only one who}} institutes almost all the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> in Hong Kong.

40|$|The {{prohibition}} against double jeopardy is of ancient lineage in western civilization. In a ringing and scholarly dissent that rewards reflection, Justice Hugo Black said: Fear and abhorrence of governmental power to try people twice {{for the same}} conduct {{is one of the}} oldest ideas found in western civilization. Its roots run deep into Greek and Roman times. Even in the Dark Ages, when so many other principles of justice were lost, the idea that one trial and one punishment were enough remained alive through the canon law and the teachings of the early Christian writers. By the thirteenth century it seems to have been firmly established in England, where it came to be considered as a 2 ̆ 2 universal maxim of the common law. 2 ̆ 2 It is not surprising, therefore, that the principle was brought to this country by the earliest settlers as part of their heritage of freedom, and that it has been recognized here as fundamental again and again. Today it is found, in varying forms, not only in the Federal Constitution, but in the jurisprudence or constitutions of every State, as well as most foreign nations. It has, in fact, been described as a part of all advanced systems of law and as one of those universal principles 2 ̆ 2 of reason, justice, and conscience, of which Cicero said: 2 ̆ 7 Nor is it one thing at Rome and another at Athens, one now and another in the future, but among all nations it is the same. 2 ̆ 7 While some writers have explained the opposition to double prosecutions by emphasizing the injustice inherent in two punishments for the same act, and others have stressed the dangers to the innocent from allowing the full power of the state to be brought against them in two trials, the basic and recurring theme has always simply been that it is wrong for a man to 2 ̆ 2 be brought into Danger for the same Offence more than once. 2 ̆ 2 Few principles have been more deeply 2 ̆ 2 rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people. 2 ̆ 2 Because the {{prohibition against}} placing someone in double jeopardy is so deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, double jeopardy challenges have been prevalent throughout our nation 2 ̆ 7 s history. This Preface highlights some of the major themes involved in such double jeopardy challenges. Section II of this Preface briefly describes the protections offered by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Section III touches upon one of the key issues in double jeopardy cases-the determination of what actions constitute the 2 ̆ 2 same offense. 2 ̆ 2 Section IV addresses some recent developments in double jeopardy law and introduces a rapidly-growing question in modern double jeopardy cases: Whether the double jeopardy protections apply in the context of <b>parallel</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> and civil forfeiture actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{alternatives}} to the public <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> have changed the criminal laws. Contrary to the traditional way of settling the disputes which puts emphasis on analyzing the committed crimes, the most significant factor in {{alternatives to}} the public prosecution is the conditions, in which the crime happens. The present research seeks to evaluate the problems and challenges {{in the way of}} developing and increasing the {{alternatives to the}} <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> by taking the England’s laws into consideration. The alternatives to the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> are an intermediate approach that are substituted for <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> and filing the criminal record away unconditionally. In this way, the aim of the punishments is achieved without imposing the punishment. The alternatives to the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> are based on the ideological, criminological and practical principles. There are many similar cases of imposing alternatives to the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> on the defendants in Islamic teachings. But the alternatives to the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> have not properly developed in Iran. Their development faces with many theoretical and practical challenges. According the investigations, we can define the theoretical challenges faced with alternatives to the <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> as the series of the factors and reasons that impede the development of this idea and runs it into the problem. In other words, lack of intention and will to apply these alternatives...|$|R
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{problems}} and challenges of international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> in Africa. Part I examines the values of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution.</b> It examines whether international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> {{can be used as}} a vehicle to contribute to 2 ̆ 2 national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace. 2 ̆ 2 I concede that punishing perpetrators of evil is definitively a viable mechanism for combating impunity. In appropriate cases, the criminal process can be deployed to engineer compliance with the law and to deter would-be perpetrators of evil. I argue, however, that the objectives of using <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> to reestablish social equilibrium and promote reconciliation, though laudable and rhetorically inspiring, are simply unattainable. The hope that international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> will reconcile mutually distrustful ethnic groups with a long history of reciprocal hatred is quaint, perhaps even naive. International <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> launched in Africa amidst much publicity and high expectations are on the verge of oblivion, perhaps irrelevance. After more than ten years of international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> in Africa, it is becoming increasingly obvious that <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> is a weak reed on which to hoist the strategy of reestablishing social equilibrium and reconciling intergroup hostilities in post-conflict African societies. A confluence of systemic and environmental factors have undermined the hoped-for influence of international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> in Africa. Part II examines the limitations of criminal trials. This portion presents a clear and rich exploration of the causes of violence in Africa and explains why international criminal law has not delivered as promised. It offers some explanations of factors that undermine the effectiveness of international <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> namely attitudinal, environmental factors, lack of cooperation from state governments, and limits of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution.</b> It urges all those involved in the fight against impunity in Africa to rethink the deeply flawed assumptions about the capacity of international law to bring about transformative changes in the conduct of citizens and group relations in Africa. Violence is so interwoven with the maladies in the continent - corruption, poverty, ethnic tensions - that it is doubtful if <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> alone can serve as a chastening influence on the behavior of the leaders or the citizens trapped within the society. Building an effective strategy to reestablish social order in post-conflict African societies requires an understanding of the idiosyncratic environmental factors that animate violence, as well as recognition that <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> cannot address the social pathologies that have disfigured Africa. It is these pathologies that will define and shape Africa 2 ̆ 7 s future, not the legacy of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions...</b>|$|R

The stress will be put on problematic details of current legislation and conceptions created during the procedure of recodification of criminal procedure in the Czech republic.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{discontinuance}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> in jurisprudence of Czech courts The discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> is {{the institution of}} criminal procedure law, which is relatively widely used in criminal proceedings {{and it may be}} used at its different stages. This work is focused on current and controversial issues of interpretation of discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution,</b> part in light of obligatory reasons (generally defined in § 172 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code), part in light of facultative reasons of discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> (§ 172 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure). At the same time is pointed to the controversial problems in theory of interpretation. This contrariety arising out of the adoption of the new Penal Code (Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll.). An important part of this work is focused on the determination of basic concepts that are closely linked with the issue of the discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> and as such it affects. An undivided part is also the view de lege ferenda and the regulation of some selected institutes in the proposed revision of the Penal Code. Key words: Criminal procedure, discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution,</b> obligatory reasons of discontinuance of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution,</b> facultative reasons of discontinuance of [...] ...|$|R

It examines the values of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> and offers some explanations {{of the factors that}} limit the effectiveness of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> namely attitudinal, environmental factors, lack of cooperation from state governments and the limits of criminal law. I argue that the objectives of using <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> to reestablish social equilibrium and promote reconciliation though laudable and rhetorically inspiring are simply unattainable.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate and {{discussion}} about the potential public health impact {{of the emergence of}} <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> for the sexual transmission of HIV in the United Kingdom. This paper offers a unique opportunity to examine data that connects views on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> with evidence of HIV prevention need among an opportunistic sample of men in the UK who are homosexually active. Quantitative and qualitative data on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were collected {{as a part of the}} Gay Men's Sex Survey 2006, and this paper represents an initial analysis of those responses. The data demonstrate how dominant views on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> come into direct conflict with health promotion aims, thereby exacerbating pre-existing HIV prevention need in a population at increased risk of participating in HIV transmission. This conflict is most clearly apparent in the close relationship between men's support of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> and their expectation that a partner with diagnosed HIV will disclose his status before engaging in sex. Changing such unrealistic and universalised expectations has long been an aim of HIV prevention planning that targets Gay and Bisexual men, yet it would appear that the popularity of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> helps to resist attitudinal change, thereby exacerbating HIV prevention need...|$|R
