It is still an open problem to find a completely satisfactory definition.

Some new attractive inequalities for the Tracy-Singh product, Khatri-Rao product and geometric means of several <b>positive</b> <b>matrices</b> are established.

40|$|AbstractA real matrix {{is called}} k-subtotally {{positive}} if {{the determinants of}} all its submatrices of order at most k are positive. We show that for an m×n matrix, only mn inequalities determine such class for every k, 1 ⩽k⩽min(m,n). Spectral properties of square k-subtotally <b>positive</b> <b>matrices</b> are studied. Finally, completion problems for 2 -subtotally <b>positive</b> <b>matrices</b> and their additive counterpart, the anti-Monge matrices, are investigated.

50|$|Let A be a <b>positive</b> <b>matrix,</b> {{assume that}} its {{spectral}} radius ρ(A) = 1 (otherwise consider A/ρ(A)). Hence, there exists an eigenvalue λ {{on the unit}} circle, {{and all the other}} eigenvalues are less or equal 1 in absolute value. Assume that λ ≠ 1. Then there exists a positive integer m such that Am is a <b>positive</b> <b>matrix</b> and the real part of λm is negative. Let ε be half the smallest diagonal entry of Am and set T = Am &minus; εI which is yet another <b>positive</b> <b>matrix.</b> Moreover if Ax = λx then Amx = λmx thus λm &minus; ε is an eigenvalue of T. Because of the choice of m this point lies outside the unit disk consequently ρ(T) > 1. On the other hand all the entries in T are positive and {{less than or equal to}} those in Am so by Gelfand's formula ρ(T) ≤ ρ(Am) ≤ ρ(A)m = 1. This contradiction means that λ=1 and there can be no other eigenvalues on the unit circle.|$|E
