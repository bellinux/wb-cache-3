5|$|I {{realized}} the <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to push}} with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E
500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} sessions, Higgs {{suffered from}} depression. He {{referred to the}} end of their 150-date tour as [...] "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-cold-bath experience", adding that [...] "riding that low as well as trying to make a record was quite hard". He was affected by frequent mood swings {{as a result of his}} medication; Pritchard said that these [...] "affected [...] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to Q that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with [...] "Pigdog", a song about [...] "how [...] a horrible person and [...] want to be one any more". Spearman objected to this style: [...] "For me that was a turning <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, 'Let's make a record that’s energetic and fucked up and exciting.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The stories {{themselves}} were designed as glimpses into the Halo universe, including {{information on the}} inner workings of the alien Covenant, as well as details regarding elements of the back-story that were hitherto undisclosed. Jarrard explained that [...] "The stories that happen off camera, the parallel events to the arcs that our fans know from the existing mediums, are the stories we really wanted to tell." [...] Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond [...] "...a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." [...] The four stories that ended up in the final publication were [...] "the most interesting to , and the writers of [...] ". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel, the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that [...] "the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game. Beyond that <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given free rein to interpret the script and the action" [...] based on what was given to the artists and writers.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing {{a poor job}} with his fighters: [...] "I failed them miserably, completely. So I {{have to figure out}} a way to get this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought they needed to do for ratings, but in the end, my fans, my family and my God know exactly who I am." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm {{not going to pay}} a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna {{has been}} a strong {{supporter}} of U.S. President Barack Obama. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? The <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience. [...] Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, [...] "I don't care who you vote for. [...] Do not take this great privilege for granted." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E

[...] In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying [...] "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog… who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her… Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" [...] Madonna went on to shout, [...] "Support education! Support the people who support women!" [...] Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E
