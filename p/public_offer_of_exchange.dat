40|$|It {{is universally}} {{considered}} nowadays that investors {{find it difficult}} to choose the right business transaction because there is no appropriate system of disclosure and they lack proper financial knowledge. In this context, the European Commission has issued the Directive No 2003 / 71 /CE on Prospectus regulation that aims to enhance investor protection by requiring harmonised high standards of disclosure for issues of securities that are <b>offered</b> to the <b>public</b> or admitted to trading on a regulated market. In particular, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ seeks to improve market efficiency through the issue of a single approved prospectus and enables issuers to raise capital across the EU without further approval. More precisely, this directive applies to <b>public</b> <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> securities and admission of securities to trading on a regulated market; also, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ only applies to transferable securities, defined by reference to the MiFID Directive. Specifically, the European Commission has introduced a new regime of ‘private placements’ concerning the exemptions on issuers making a <b>public</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> securities or seeking an admission to trading on a regulated market. Finally, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ aims to ensure that investors are provided with clear and comprehensive information when making investment decisions...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, a major debate was raised among {{political}} science scholars about people's willingness to deliberate and to participate, mainly based on quantitative approaches using opinion surveys. Hibbing and Theiss-Morse argue {{that people do}} not want to participate in more direct forms of democracy despite better opportunities provided by political authorities, which only concern well-integrated citizens. By opposition, an Harvard research argue that younger people, racial minorities, and lower income people tend to participate only when <b>public</b> authorities <b>offer</b> a concrete proposition of deliberation. This argument is based on an experimental survey which compares hypothetical and concrete opportunities to deliberate. Our paper confronts this statement to real politics: could a pre-existent and real <b>public</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> participatory deliberation concern excluded people and oppose the tendency toward social oligarchisation of local democracy? Based on a survey address to 1200 French people in 2009, we correlate knowledge and opinion of our sample about existing regional <b>public</b> <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> participatory deliberation. Our results are twofold. Firstly, only high-educated people, aware to political innovation, who have a good knowledge about political life, have a real knowledge about this <b>public</b> <b>offer.</b> Secondly, despite people know the existence of participatory institutional-settings they do not perceive it as a "progress": a large proportion of respondents have a negative opinion about this trend. These empirical results lead us to argue that the non-experimental participatory/deliberative settings have serious difficulties to enlarge its public beyond the classical oligarchy of politicized people, which question the "top-down" origins of these democratic innovations...|$|R

40|$|Based on the authors' {{recent study}} {{published}} in the "Journal of Financial Economics", this article summarizes new evidence on the first-day and aftermarket price performance of a firm's first <b>public</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> bonds after its equity IPO.

" However, bonds that are more equity-like (junk bonds) are underpriced at the initial offer whereas high-grade debt is actually overpriced.
