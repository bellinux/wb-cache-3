In addition, Ars Technica criticized the M9's rear-facing (primary) camera for the inconsistent quality of its images compared to its 2014-2015 contemporaries, while lacking optical image stabilization that was found in preceding HTC One (M7).

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent history and {{development}} of the telecommunications sector in Malaysia. Section 2 provides a brief historical account of the sector and the current structure of the sector. This is followed by a discussion on regulatory reforms in Section 3. Section 4 examines the impact of reforms in the telecommunications sector. Section 5 concludes by discussing the future policy agenda for the sector. EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY STRUCTURE Physical Expansion The infrastructure sector {{plays a key role in}} Malaysia's economic growth and development. The sector's share of development expenditure in the various five-years plans implemented since 1966 has fallen in the range between 18 per cent to as high as 34 per cent (Lee, 2000). This emphasis on infrastructure development notwithstanding, the expenditures appear to be targeted mainly at the transport and power sectors. As a result, telecommunications indicators - such as the fixed line penetration ratio - remained relatively low particularly before 1980 (Table 1). In 1970, the fixed line penetration ratio was merely 1. 3 per 100 population. This figure increased to 2. 9 per 100 population in 1980 and 8. 7 per 100 population in 1990. Significant gains in the fixed line penetration were made after telecommunications reforms were undertaken beginning 1987. By 1995 and 2000, the fixed line penetration ratio had risen to 16. 6 per 100 population and 21. 0 per 100 population respectively (note: the direct exchange line penetration rate is around 20 per 100 population). Concomitantly, cellular phone subscriptions have grown very rapidly since the early 1990 s. The total number of cellular <b>phone</b> subscribers <b>stood</b> close to 84, 557.

40|$|The advancements in {{the field}} of mobile {{computing}} over the last decade have enabled the scientific community to expedite the theoretical and experimental work to achieve the vision of ubiquitous computing. As ubiquitous computing aims to provide seamless and distraction free task support to its users, one of the essential pieces of information required by the ubiquitous computing systems to do so is the context of its users. Context of a user can be defined as the information that describes the task the user is performing and the environment in which the user is currently present. Among various platforms that are commonly used to determine user's context, the personal mobile devices like smart <b>phones</b> <b>stand</b> out {{as one of the most}} widely used and widely evaluated ones. However, despite numerous advantages that are provided by modern day personal mobile devices, such as high computational and communication capabilities, variety of on-board sensors to capture raw data related to user's motion and environment, high resolution displays to enable interaction with other services and systems, these devices suffer from limited battery resources. In contrast to the advancements in other domains, the advancements in the battery domain have not been up to the mark. Consequently, the context recognition applications developed for these devices suffer from the trade-off between achieving accuracy and longevity of other device's basic operations. As a result, most of the existing context recognition applications for these devices are fine tuned for specific context types and thereby lacks generality. The situation gets worse when a number of context recognition applications are executed simultaneously, thus competing for limited resources and consuming the device's battery additively. To address the aforementioned issues, this thesis provides a generic and energy efficient context recognition framework for personal mobile devices. The main contribution consists of a generic framework to support development of context recognition applications supported by algorithms to achieve their energy efficient execution. The proposed framework consists of two systems namely the component system and the activation system. The component system allows developers to create context recognition applications using a component abstraction. This enables runtime analysis of applications' structures to adopt our novel energy efficiency mechanism. The activation system uses a state machine abstraction to allow context dependent activation of context recognition configurations pertaining to relevant user's tasks such that only needed configurations are executed to determine only the relevant context characteristics, thereby enabling energy efficiency. The activation system also provides generic applicability of four different energy efficiency techniques, already used in different existing systems but mostly for specific context characteristics. To aid rapid prototyping, both systems are equipped with off-line development tools. The tools include graphical editors and a component tool-kit. The graphical editors allow developers to create component configurations used by the component system and state machines used by the activation system. These editors enable developers to create component configurations and state machines by simply dragging, dropping and connecting different models used in our component and state machine abstractions. These tools also provide validation and code generation utilities. In addition to the graphical editor, the framework provides a component tool-kit which consists of a number of already implemented sensing, preprocessing and classification components which can be re-used in new applications. In order to provide the energy efficient execution of context recognition applications, the thesis introduces a novel energy efficiency technique called configuration folding. Configuration folding analyses structures of simultaneously executing context recognition applications to identify redundant functionalities between them and as an output produces a single redundancy free context recognition configuration which holds the structural integrity of all applications. Consequently, the overall energy expenditure is reduced compared to the original expenditure when redundant functionalities are not removed. The experimental evaluation of configuration folding on test applications shows energy savings between 13 and 48 %. The thesis also investigates optimization possibilities in configuration folding in case the redundant functionalities between the applications differ in parametrization. Towards this end, the thesis identifies commonly used parameters in context recognition applications and defines relations between them. Finally, an extended version of configuration folding is introduced to handle the differences in parametrization. The evaluation of the extended version of configuration folding on test scenarios shows energy saving of up to 45 %. The contributions in this thesis have been evaluated extensively. The framework has been used in number of European Commission (EC) projects and in student projects and theses at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Using the component system and the activation system, a number of applications have been developed in those projects. Some of these applications include crowd density estimation in buses, bus ride detections, navigation application for buses in Madrid, user movement detection, user localization, fall detection application etc. Moreover, the component system, the activation system and the configuration folding technique have been published in different prestigious conferences and workshops...|$|R

We are not always aware of the “controlling” power of surveillance cameras, RFID or data banks. It is in the field of tension in between visible and invisible interferences, between actively and passively dealing with the environment where some developments within media art are situated. These projects do not only take the man/technology/environment relationship as a point of departure of an artistic interference, but also as a goal. The work of art is a result of reflecting on the relationship mentioned above, but at its turn wants to intrude on the environment and “tactically” (de Certeau, 1984) reassess the relationship between man, technology and living space. This they do, for example, by making invisible qualities of spaces visible, “writing” spaces or giving tools to people so they can create their place in space themselves. The often – literally - border and discipline transcending media works make a different, often more holistic approach to space possible. The fields of tension between tangible and intangible, place and space and between disciplines serve as the source of inspiration for alternative field studies on “space”. In this research we chose to combine methods in the cultural and visual studies with the artistic and design research to make a more holistic and material approach to the man/technology/environment relationship possible.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study to}} determine the opportunities and barriers for mobile health in New Zealand. The world total of mobile <b>phones</b> currently <b>stands</b> at 2. 5 billion and is set to reach 3 billion {{by the end of}} 2007 [1]. New Zealand has approximately 3. 8 million mobile subscribers [2],[3] and this country, along with many others, recognizes the opportunities for using mobile technology in healthcare. Mobile health (m-health) has moved past the hype stage overseas; there is good evidence for improved productivity, and growing evidence for improved patient engagement. Broadband wireless, improved mobile devices and integrated mobile applications will continue this growth. New Zealand health and disability providers can adapt these overseas m-health successes to develop their own mobile health strategies [4]. M-health involves the use of mobile technology to enhance health services. The mobile technology can be either a short-distance or long-distance technology, or be device driven. The health industry is an information intensive industry, and as New Zealand has a public healthcare model, the idea of information integration among and within health sectors is encouraged. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the barriers and opportunities of m-health in New Zealand. Following an introduction, the literature survey defines the scope of the study. It first discusses wireless and mobile computing technologies, then looks at New Zealand healthcare information strategies and the importance of information in the health industry. Finally, these two topics are investigated by exploring the literature on the use of wireless technology in healthcare - in both clinical and non-clinical applications. M-health is a new area of development in the health industry. Hence the practical part of the research used a qualitative research strategy, determined to be appropriate to obtaining a better understanding of any phenomena about which little is yet known [5]. The two main parts of this research include the questionnaire and the interviews. The questionnaire sample was selected from health users, health planners, health technology suppliers, and academics, and covered areas of patient care, primary care, secondary care, community care, and integrated care. The interview sample consisted of technology strategists, primary healthcare planners, secondary healthcare planners, and community healthcare planners. The main focus of the interview was to find out about the future of m-health in New Zealand, analyze which sectors can benefit from m-health, examine the opportunity for customized software on mobile devices, gather possibilities of mobile assistance toward integrated care, and lastly, find out about the privacy and security issues of using mobile technology in healthcare. The questionnaire results indicate that the patients would appreciate receiving health services on their mobile phones. There is strong agreement that patients will benefit from text reminders, health awareness campaigns, and patient monitoring. The findings indicate that community nurses could use m-health technology to improve integration of information. There are two differing opinions on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and their mobility across all sectors - the technology strategists think it is very important, but the health planners are divided. The opportunities that have been identified from the interviews include monitoring, health alarms, patient engagement in healthcare, community workers information integration, SMS reminders and alerts, ability of health workers to work offsite, prescription feedback, and using PDAs where necessary to enable electronic data capture. The barriers include legacy systems, disparate systems, lack of standards, lack of integration tools, lack of bandwidth, DHB-led initiatives, older health planners who are resistant to technology, ill population having the least uptake of technology, inability to share information with patients, development of mobile applications, infrastructure investment, telecommunication barriers, changed management, lack of technical capabilities, and cultural barriers...|$|R
40|$|Moore´s law, a {{prediction}} made in an obscure article over 30 {{years ago that}} computer processing power would double every 18 months, has proved remarkably prescient. It has also become emblematic of the ICT revolution and the unstoppable proliferation of technologies and applications into our daily lives. In particular, rapid technological advances are apparent in the information technology (hardware, software and peripherals), telecommunications technologies (radio and television broadcasting, telephones) and networking technologies (the Internet, wireless and broadband connectivity). While achievements in these fields are impressive, statistics starkly show the gap (or ´digital divide´) between those {{who have access to}} the technologies (mainly in the developed North) and those who have little or no access (mainly in the developing South). Closer inspection of statistics for developing countries also reveals the yawning gap between access to ICTs in urban and rural areas, the latter being agriculture-based economies commonly struggling with a lack of basic infrastructure, and low levels of literacy. In many developing countries the digital divide is also a gender divide between men and women, which is exacerbated by a host of socio-economic and cultural factors that marginalise women even further. Notwithstanding these seemingly insuperable difficulties, a technological optimism is discernable in the development debate that seems to have its origins in Moore´s Law. This optimism, put simply, translates the rapid development of the technology predicted by Moore´s Law into the rapid societal development achieved through the swift introduction of the technology itself. Critics have been {{quick to point out that}} this gives the impression that developing countries are on an appropriate track for the introduction of ICTs and that the problems are primarily technological - issues that are hotly contested. The prevailing consensus is that ICTs can only gain their true power for economic and social leverage when they are adapted to the prevailing local conditions, with attendant support mechanisms. What is never in doubt is that ICTs have enormous potential for developing countries, a point that has been repeatedly driven home in international forums. The potential of ICTs in three related areas stand out in the debate: for information distribution, for communication, and for building social capital. The situation here is quite complex. Depending on the stakeholder group (e. g. policy makers, regulators, industry, NGOs, users/beneficiaries), opinions differ widely on which technologies/applications to adopt (and in which situations) and how these should be supported, monitored and regulated. These are clearly problems when mainstreaming ICTs into programmes. It is worth looking at how CTA has addressed these issues over the years. When CTA became operational in 1984, its raison d´être was ´?to provide ACP States with better access to information, research, training and innovations in the agricultural field´. In the early years the emphasis was on supplying information, but this strategy changed in 1995, partly in recognition of the ICT developments at the time, to one where the balance is more heavily weighted towards building capacity within ACP states to help individuals and institutions manage information and communication more effectively themselves. In effect, much greater emphasis was put on a two-way dialogue and on facilitating South-South and intra-ACP exchanges. To address the complex issues of surrounding ICT adoption, in 1998 CTA formed its Observatory on ICTs, a think-tank of technical and policy experts to inform CTA´s programme-related ICT strategies and to monitor developments in ACP countries. Today, the mainstreaming of ICTs into CTA´s programmes is conspicuous, from their conception to their delivery. A few examples suffice. In information dissemination, ICTs are used as delivery mechanisms in their own right (portals, electronic newsletters, newsfeeds, etc.), or to complement established print media (such as electronic versions of articles distributed via email and via WorldSpace satellite). In communication, ICTs are used for electronic forums and e-consultations by email, or to allow the participation of a wider electronic community in location-based seminars (through live forums, conference blogs and newsletters). In building social capital, ICTs underpin efforts to build electronic communities (for example, in training support) and to promote information sharing among thematic networks. What are the prospects for the future? To date, the development of the ICT landscape in ACP states has not shown the same exponential growth as the development of the technology as predicted by Moore´s law.

Digital, satellite-based radio broadcasting looks set to penetrate even the remotest areas of Africa. Telecentres or <b>phone</b> shops <b>stand</b> to capitalize on infrastructure developments such as low-cost, two-way satellite voice and data services and broad-spectrum wireless links (WiFi). The potential of such technological advances will only be realized, however, if there is a suitable, enabling policy environment, as well as improvements in basic infrastructure and capacity building at all levels.
