50|$|We {{mention the}} {{theoretical}} calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss. We consider a state such as 6f of Xe whidi consists of 7 quasi-degnerate {{levels in the}} range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system. The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two <b>photon</b> <b>coupling</b> between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al. observed structures on the curves of singly charged ions of Xe, Kr and Ar. These structures were attributed to electron trapping in the strong laser field. A more unambiguous demonstration of population trapping has been reported by T. Morishita and C. D. Lin.|$|E
40|$|Axions are pseudo-scalar particles, those arise {{because of}} {{breaking}} of Peccei Queen (PQ) symmetry. Axions have a tree level coupling to two photons. As a consequence {{there exists a}} tree level coupling of axion to photon in a magnetic field. However, in an external magnetic field, there exists a new loop induced, axion photon vertex, that gives rise to axion <b>photon</b> <b>coupling.</b> The strength of the tree level axion <b>photon</b> <b>coupling</b> in magnetic field {{is known to be}} model dependent. However in a magnetic field, the new loop induced coupling has some interesting features. This note discusses the new axion photon vertex in a magnetized medium and the corrections arising from there. The magnitude of the correction to axion <b>photon</b> <b>coupling,</b> because of magnetized vacuum and matter is estimated in this note. While making this estimate we note that the form of the axion photon vertex is related to the axial polarization tensor. This vertex is shown to satisfy the Ward identity.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the shadow of a}} regular phantom black hole as <b>photons</b> <b>couple</b> to Weyl tensor. We find that the <b>coupling</b> yields that <b>photons</b> with {{different}} polarization directions propagate along different paths in the spacetime so that there exits double shadow for a black hole, which is quite different from that in the non-coupling case where only a single shadow emerges. The umbra of black hole increases with the phantom charge and decreases with the coupling strength. The dependence of the penumbra on the phantom charge and the coupling strength is converse to that of the umbra.

40|$|We {{consider}} several gauge invariant higher dimensional operators that couple gravity, gauge {{fields and}} scalar or fermionic fields and thus break conformal invariance. In particular, we consider terms that break conformal invariance by the <b>photon</b> <b>coupling</b> to heavy and light fermions. While the coupling to heavy fermions typically do not induce significant magnetic fields, the coupling to light fermions may produce observable magnetic fields {{when there are}} a few hundred light fermions. Next we consider Planck scale modifications of the kinetic gauge terms of the form f(phi) F_mu nu F^mu nu and h(psi) F_mu nuF̃^mu nu, where f and h are functions of scalar and pseudoscalar fields phi, psi, and F_mu nu, F^mu nu are the gauge field strength and its dual, respectively. For a suitable choice of f sufficiently strong magnetic fields may be produced in inflation to be potentially observable today. The pseudoscalar coupling may lead to birefringence in inflation, but no observable magnetic field amplification.

40|$|We present firstly {{equation}} of motion for the <b>photon</b> <b>coupled</b> to Weyl tensor in a Kerr black hole spacetime and then study further the corresponding strong gravitational lensing. We find that black hole rotation makes propagation of the <b>coupled</b> <b>photons</b> more complicated, which brings some new features for physical quantities including the marginally circular photon orbit, the deflection angle, the observational gravitational lensing variables and the time delay between two relativistic images. There is a critical value of the coupling parameter for existence of the marginally circular photon orbit outside the event horizon, which depends on the rotation parameter of black hole and the polarization direction of photons. As the value of coupling parameter is near the critical value, {{we find that the}} marginally circular photon orbit for the retrograde photon increases with the rotation parameter, which modifies a common feature of the marginally circular photon orbit in a rotating black hole spacetime since it always decreases monotonously with the rotation parameter in the case without Weyl coupling.
