The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate. Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town. Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000people homeless. Damage was estimated at $4.5million, and there were 21deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. Farther north, two <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia.|$|E

This paper will build on the concept of `imagined futures' (Ball et al 2000) to explore the shifting (and sometimes disjunctive) positions of respondents as they moved across education and workplace boundaries. This leads to a problematisation of notions of transitions and trajectories and the over expectations of linearity in understanding these young peoples' lives...|$|R
