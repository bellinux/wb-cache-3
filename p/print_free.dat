6000|$|Ezra Pound {{has been}} fathered with vers libre in English, {{with all its}} vices and virtues. The term is a loose one--any verse is called [...] "free" [...] by people whose ears are not {{accustomed}} to it--in the second place, Pound's use of this medium has shown the temperance of the artist, and his belief in it as a vehicle is not that of the fanatic. He has said himself that when one has the proper material for a sonnet, one should use the sonnet form; but that it happens very rarely to any poet to find himself in possession of just the block of stuff which can perfectly be modelled into the sonnet. It is true that up to very recently {{it was impossible to}} get free verse printed in any periodical except those in which Pound had influence; and that now it is possible to <b>print</b> <b>free</b> verse (second, third, or tenth-rate) in almost any American magazine. Who is responsible for the bad free verse is a question of no importance, inasmuch as its authors would have written bad verse in any form; Pound has at least the right to be judged by {{the success or failure of}} his own. Pound's vers libre is such as is only possible for a poet who has worked tirelessly with rigid forms and different systems of metric. His [...] "Canzoni" [...] are in a way aside from his direct line of progress; they are much more nearly studies in mediaeval appreciation than any of his other verse; but they are interesting, apart from their merit, as showing the poet at work with the most intricate Provençal forms--so intricate that the pattern cannot be exhibited without quoting an entire poem. (M. Jean de Bosschere, whose French is translated in the [...] "Egoist," [...] has already called attention to the fact that Pound was the first writer in English to use five Provençal forms.) Quotation will show, however, the great variety of rhythm which Pound manages to introduce into the ordinary iambic pentameter: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} blueprint for England 2 ̆ 7 s public library service, to help ensure it is fit for purpose in the 21 st century. It aims to help libraries adapt to the Internet revolution; grasp the opportunities of digital technology; {{and respond to the}} decline in use of existing services, the current economic climate and the public’s expectation of more customer-focused public services. The paper includes proposals to: Recommend that all local authorities have a ‘national core offer’ for the public, comprising membership from birth, free access to the Internet, a right to order any book to borrow (even those out of <b>print),</b> <b>free</b> access to eBooks as the market grows, opening hours to suit users and an opportunity {{to be a member of}} all libraries in England;  Create a ‘local offer’ as well, which could include commitments on bookstock, event programmes, activities and other services like CD and DVD lending;  Offer best practice guidance to local authorities on consulting their communities about the library service, putting local people at the centre of the service;  Make all libraries ‘digitally inclusive’ with easier—and free—access to the Internet for users, along with advice on how people can get the most from online access;  Consider establishing a new, strategic body for libraries to provide leadership and development for the sector, and with the formal power to advise the Secretary of State; this body would also run an accreditation programme, awarding a ‘Book Mark’ for the best services, which could be linked to funding opportunities; and  Look at a radical approach to new partnerships across existing local authority boundaries, possibly linking with other public functions like post offices and private sector services such as coffee shops.  ...|$|E
40|$|The {{road to a}} {{sustainable}} agricultural market information service (AMIS) is not necessarily very long but {{it is full of}} many steps. It is also full of many temptations which can cause its collapse. Experience in establishing and running an AMIS is comparatively limited. Most AMISs have been launched, usually in a hurry (see the article Mr Two Percent in this Spore), in the last two decades. What are the issues to be considered before making any plans? There are several definitions of an AMIS; the safest and surest came from the FAO in 1995 : 'a service, usually operated by the public sector [that has changed in the last six years!], which involves the collection of information on prices and, in some cases, on quantities of widely traded agricultural products from rural markets and wholesale and retail markets. It equally involves the dissemination of this information on a timely and regular basis through various media to farmers, traders, government officials, policymakers and others, including consumers. ' A lot of people may come to depends on an effective AMIS. Primarily, it facilitates fair trade and competition for farmers, by improving their bargaining power and lowering transaction costs. By reducing risks and expanding access to information it encourages innovation by farmers (in changing cropping patterns, for example). It can empower the small trader and consumer. It can also provide key data to policy makers on how markets are functioning, and provide timely data for monitoring food security situations. The widest spread of information available on AMIS is on the Agricultural Market Information Virtual Library, www. aec. msu. edu/agecon/fs 2 /market_ information. htm. This gives access to a fine set of documents, and selected Websites presented by region (including Africa, from Mali to Mozambique), by commodity, on market analysis and on e-commerce. The Library is run by J-C Le Vallée, Department of Agricultural Economics, Department of Economics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA. Email: levallee@msu. edu. The Department s Working paper number 64, Market Information Sources Available Through the Internet: Daily to Yearly Market and Outlook Reports, Prices, Commodities and Quotes, updated in July 2001, is a valuable addition. Correspondence is welcome in French, Spanish and English. But is it yours to do? An AMIS today has several characteristics: it must provide reliable data, with the precision of a proper statistics service; it must operate as a viable business, with the disciplines of the profit and loss account, and the balance sheet; it must communicate with people with low levels of literacy, and sometimes little experience in trading; it must motivate users with extra services all within the profit margin. Statisticians, farmers, traders, processors, exporters, communicators, bank managers, businesswoman or businessman some of the skills of each of them are needed in an AMIS. A few rules to follow: Know the products and markets: at the outset, it is important to restrict the range of crops and produce covered to those traded in major markets in the country. Each additional commodity means more data collection and processing, and more communication. It may be far better to cover only six crops and 75 % of the market than twenty-six crops and 90 %! Similarly, keep your horizons low: cover the local regions first before trying to cover the national market, let alone the markets of neighbouring countries or even other continents. Know the data: the core of an AMIS is up-to-date data and proper data collection is essential. It may be more appropriate to acquire data from outside agencies, on a contract basis, than to organise data collection by the AMIS itself. It requires trained data collectors, who may be found in national statistics services, although these may operate at a different pace than a business. Organise and move information: market data must be computerised, and great care is required in designing a simple but sturdy programme that can be used at many levels, and quickly repaired if it develops bugs. Data entry must be straightforward; data analysis must allow for following trends in price and supply and demand; data transmission must be fast, reliable and affordable. One well-tested software, FAO-AgriMarket, automates the entry, processing, transmission, reporting and electronic diffusion of market data (mostly prices and quantities of agricultural products and inputs). It is designed for marketing agencies; statistical offices; ministerial departments; local authorities; chambers of commerce and agriculture; trader, producer and consumer associations; import and export companies; research institutions and NGOs. It helps in analysing market data, such as determining movements in price or supply movements over time, or comparing prices and quantities in different markets. The AgriMarket package, on a CD-ROM, is available, only in English, free of charge to public institutions and organizations in developing countries. Other users must pay US$ 25. Email: agrimarket@fao. org. The producers of AgriMarket have also produced two major documents for AMIS operators and users, which have guided this article.
