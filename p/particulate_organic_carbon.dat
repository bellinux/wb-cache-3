Variations in light intensity and external carbonate system composition alter intracellular carbon fluxes and therewith the production rates of <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>carbon.</b> Aiming to find a mechanistic explanation for the interrelation between dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes and particulate carbon production rates, we develop a numerical cell model for Emiliania huxleyi, one of the most abundant coccolithophore species. The model consists of four cellular compartments, for each of which the carbonate system is resolved dynamically. The compartments are connected to each other and to the external medium via substrate fluxes across the compartment-confining membranes. By means of the model we are able to explain several pattern observed in <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>carbon</b> production rates for different strains and under different acclimation conditions. <b>Particulate</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>carbon</b> production rates for instance decrease at very low external CO 2 concentrations.

The origins and yields of biomarkers were determined in cultured marine bacteria, and the results indicated that D-amino acids are derived from numerous macromolecules in addition to peptidoglycan and are not solely from peptidoglycan.

The rest sinks to the ocean floor. Shells out of calcium carbonate are also deposited on the ocean floor as sediment, whereas the carbon can dissolve and reach the lower ocean levels again.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of primary producers in coastal lagoons due to changes of external control parameters—phosphorous external load and maximum tidal flow rate—is investigated {{by using a}} eutrophication model. The eutrophication model allows the simulation of the temporal evolution of the concentration of the following species: a) in the water column: dissolved oxygen, vegetal <b>organic</b> <b>carbon,</b> <b>particulate</b> and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon,</b> dissolved phosphorous and hydrogen sulphide; b) in sediments: dissolved oxygen, <b>particulate</b> and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon,</b> dissolved and adsorbed phosphorous, hydrogen sulphide. The vegetal <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> is distinguished in three components related to the main groups of primary producers, namely eelgrass, macroalgae and microalgae, having different modalities of nutrient uptake and kinetics parameters depending on the S/V ratio. Diagrams representing the ecosystem dynamic response to the changes of the control parameters were constructed by simulations. The response diagrams suggest the existence of regime shifts which border different ecosystem stability ranges, characterized by the dominance of a specific group of primary producers and by different ecosystem vulnerability at summer water anoxia. A catastrophic bifurcation or abrupt regime shift—evidenced by Poincar`e sections obtained mapping, at a prefixed time period, {{the values of the}} concentration of the species—occurs for a critical value of the control parameter and manifests itself as an abrupt change of the dominant species from eelgrass to macroalgae.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} carbon tied up in a typical single whale carcass (about two metric tons of carbon for a typical forty-ton carcass) is roughly {{equivalent}} to the {{amount of carbon}} exported to a hectare of abyssal ocean floor in 100-200 years. [...] This amount of organic material reaching the seafloor at one time creates a pulse equivalent to about 2000 years of background carbon flux in the 50 square metres of sediment immediately beneath the whale fall. [...] This helps to sustain the community structure that develops around a whale fall, but it also has potential implications for the biological pump, or the flux of organic material from the surface ocean to depth. Whales and some other large marine animals feed on and follow large aggregations of zooplankton for sustenance. Based on simple trophic structure, this would mean whales and other large zooplankton feeders can be found at higher abundance around areas of high primary production, potentially making them important exporters of carbon to depth through food falls. (Higgs et al., 2014). Biological pump models indicate that a large amount of carbon uptake by the deep sea is not supplied by <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> (POC) alone, and must come from another source. Lateral advection of carbon, especially in coastal areas contributes to this deficit in the model, but food falls are also another source of organic carbon for the deep ocean (Higgs et al., 2014). Various percentages of the food fall contribution to the total carbon flux to the deep ocean have been hypothesized, ranging from 0.3% (Smith 2006) to 4% (Higgs et al., 2014). There is growing evidence that the contribution of food falls to the deep ocean carbon flux is larger than originally proposed, especially on the local scale in areas of high primary productivity. Unfortunately, contributions of food falls to the biological pump are hard to measure and rely on a few serendipitous studies on discovered falls (Smith et al., 1989; Higgs et al., 2014) as well as planted carcasses (Janssen et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009), with much of the deep sea carbon flux studies relying on sediment traps (Robison et al., 2005; Miller and Wheeler, 2012). One study even suggested that the whaling industry has had an effect on the biological pump through the elimination of many large whales, as well as a large number of whales, reducing the amount of whale falls (Pershing et al., 2010).|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of organic carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the oceans via erosion and riverine transport constitutes {{an important component}} of the global carbon cycle. More than one third of this organic carbon flux comes from sediment-laden rivers that drain the mountains in the western Pacific region. This region is prone to tropical cyclones, but their role in sourcing and transferring vegetation and soil is not well constrained. Here we measure <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> load and composition in the LiWu River, Taiwan, during cyclone-triggered floods. We correct for fossil <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> using radiocarbon, and find that the concentration of <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> from vegetation and soils is positively correlated with water discharge.

We suggest that tropical cyclones, which affect many forested mountains within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, may provide optimum conditions for the delivery and burial of non-fossil <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> in the ocean.

All participating laboratories performed well on samples of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP), a compound commonly used as a standard in carbon analysis. However, problems associated with the oxidation of difficult to oxidize compounds, such as dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and caffeine, were noted. Humic substances posed fewer problems for analysts. <b>Particulate</b> <b>organic</b> matter (POM) in the form of polystyrene beads, freeze-dried bacteria and pulverized leaf material were the most difficult for all analysts, {{with a wide range of}} performances reported. The POM results indicate that the methods surveyed in this study are inappropriate for the accurate determination of POC and TOC concentration. Finally, several analysts had difficulty in efficiently separating inorganic carbon from KHP solutions, thereby biasing DOC results...|$|R
