You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|RAF Weston-super-Mare {{was opened}} in 1936 by No. 24 Group, {{with a single}} tarmac runway. It served as a flying {{candidates}} selection and initial training facility, and as a relief airport during World War II, latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946. After the war it served as a logistics supply station, with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987. Today there is an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service. The former Westland site, which closed in 2002, houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft. <b>Pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC Mk.4, formerly of the Queen's Flight.|$|E

Evening horizon lectures on non-built environment topics contribute towards the ambition that course graduates learn about government and policy making.|$|R

They have the <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> manhood in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> birth, and a grim {{optimism}} which chiefly finds expression in attempting that which is apparently beyond accomplishment, and in holding on, in spite of frost and snow and icy gale, until achievement comes.

25|$|The Assyrians, {{like the}} rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, {{followed}} the ancient Mesopotamian religion, with the national god Assur having <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> at the head of the Old Assyrian Empire. Other major gods within the pantheon of the Old Assyrian Empire were: Ishtar, Adad, Sin, Ninurta, Nergal, and Ninlil. Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colorful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of the Akkadian language, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavor.|$|E
50|$|This {{combination}} of Hispano-Romance expression with Arabic script, only discovered in 1948, locates {{the rise of}} a Spanish literary tradition in the cultural heterogeneity that characterized Medieval Spanish society and politics. However, the Mozarabic language of the Jarchas appears to be a separate Romance language whose evolution from Vulgar Latin paralleled that of Castilian Spanish rather than deriving from or fusing into the latter. Hence, while the relatively recent discovery of the Jarchas challenges <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> chronological <b>place</b> that belonged for so long to the Poema del Cid (El Cantar de mío Cid) (1140 CE) in the history of Spanish literature, they cannot be seen as a precursor to Spain's great epic poem. What the discovery of the jarchas makes clear instead is that from its origins, the literature of Spain has arisen out of and born witness to a rich, heterogeneous mix of cultures and languages.|$|R

Casey was standing next to Bridges when Bridges was shot by a sniper (he died three days later). A statue of Casey being rescued by a Turkish soldier has <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in the Gallipoli battlefields. Later he served in France, where he observed operations and sifted information, earning the Military Cross and promotion to brigade major of the 8th Brigade. This position involved dangerous visits to the front line and he received a Distinguished Service Order in 1918. He resigned his commission in June 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers, serving as a part-time intelligence officer in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|In {{this part}} of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E
60|$|Having {{ordered the}} best luncheon that his old {{housekeeper}} could provide Alan went off for his walk {{in much better}} spirits, which were further improved by his success in persuading the tenant to do without the new buildings for another year. In a year, he reflected, anything might happen. Then he returned by the wood where a number of new-felled oaks lay ready for barking. This was not a cheerful sight; it seemed so cruel to kill the great trees {{just as they were}} pushing their buds for another summer of life. But he consoled himself by recalling that they had been too crowded and that the timber was really needed on the estate. As he reached the house again carrying a bunch of white violets which he had plucked in a sheltered place for Barbara, he perceived a motor travelling at much more than the legal speed up the walnut avenue which was the <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> the <b>place.</b> In it sat that young lady herself, and her maid, Snell, a middle-aged woman with whom, as it chanced, he was on very good terms, as once, at some trouble to himself, {{he had been able to}} do her a kindness.|$|R

That painting was of a young girl, pretty, standing beside a creek; the girl in the painting was Old Matt's daughter, with whom he had fallen in love. However, Mad Howard believed that his father's <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> family and <b>place</b> in society would never allow him to approve of his son's marriage to an Ozark country girl. Mad Howard packed up his paintings and returned to the city, leaving Old Matt's daughter with the impression that he would return. Once returning to the city, Mad Howard sent her a letter explaining that his father would not approve of their marriage. However, he never told his father about Old Matt's daughter and his relations with her; the secrecy drove a wedge between Mad Howard and his father, although his father never understood why. Meanwhile, Old Matt has sworn he will kill the man who abandoned his daughter, as well as his father, if ever he finds them.|$|R
25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E
