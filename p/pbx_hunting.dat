50|$|Before {{a manual}} {{exchange}} was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate <b>PBX</b> <b>hunting</b> groups were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number groups have <b>PBX</b> <b>hunting</b> facility, and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a hunting group {{have to be}} in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 & 2720; and the <b>PBX</b> <b>hunting</b> group on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 incoming lines (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and <b>PBX</b> <b>hunting</b> groups requiring more than 10 incoming lines would be served by special 11-and-over PBX final selectors which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.|$|E
