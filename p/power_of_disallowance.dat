500|$|In 1924, the UFA {{government}} {{passed the}} Mineral Tax Act, which taxed mineral rightsholders {{at a rate}} of three cents per acre. [...] The two largest such rightsholders, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson's Bay Company, urged the federal government to use its <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> {{to put a stop to}} the legislation. When the federal government complied, Brownlee protested its action on three grounds: first, as a direct tax the proposed levy was within Alberta's rights under section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and it was constitutional convention for the federal government to exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional. Second, disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts, where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested. Third, the federal government's stated reasons for disallowing the legislation, which were released belatedly by justice minister Ernest Lapointe, were (according to Brownlee) erroneous and led Brownlee to suggest that Lapointe, a Québécois lawyer trained in the civil law tradition of his home province rather than the common law system used in the rest of Canada, must be unfamiliar with the land-holding system outside of Quebec. Brownlee's attacks were rejected, and the disallowance stood.|$|E
50|$|The {{federal power}} of reservation, {{under which the}} provincial {{lieutenant}} governor could refer a bill passed by a provincial legislature {{to the federal government}} for assent or refusal, would have been abolished, and the federal <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance,</b> under which the federal government could overrule a provincial law that had already been signed into law, would have been severely limited.|$|E
50|$|The Charter {{would have}} also {{terminated}} the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> and reservation, which {{remain in the}} Constitution. There was also {{a bill of rights}} and a new amending formula.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the federal}} Governor General of Canada and the provincial Lieutenant Governors, who officially retain {{the power to}} approve or reject {{legislation}} from parliament or a provincial legislative assembly but in practice are bound by {{the will of the}} legislature with their <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> and reservation restricted to extraordinary circumstances, a territorial commissioner retains much stronger power over the territory's political affairs. The council was, thus, not a fully democratic government; although an elected body, its powers were significantly more constrained than those of a provincial legislative assembly.|$|R
50|$|In Canadian {{constitutional}} law, the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> {{reservation and}} <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> both federal and provincial legislation still formally {{remain in place}} and are described in Sections 55 and 56 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which until 1982 {{was known as the}} British North America Act.|$|R
50|$|The federal {{government}} under Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King {{could have used}} its <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> to nullify the Padlock Law, as it had done to overturn equally controversial laws that had been passed by Alberta's Social Credit government around the same time. However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec. The most likely reason is that King {{did not want to}} alienate rural voters in Quebec, who continued to support the Liberals federally even as they supported the Union Nationale provincially.|$|E
50|$|The {{powers of}} {{disallowance}} and reservation still exist {{at the federal}} level in Australia, and are described in sections 58 to 60 of the Australian Constitution. Section 58 gives the Governor-General an additional power, that of returning a bill to Parliament with suggested amendments. Once the Governor-General has assented to a law, the Queen has one year in which to disallow it. If the Governor-General reserves a bill for the Queen's assent, the bill will die unless the Queen approves it within two years of its passage. However, the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> has never been used in relation to Australian federal legislation, and reservation has likewise been rare to nonexistent.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{calls from}} Clarke {{for the federal}} {{government}} to use its <b>power</b> <b>of</b> reservation to stop the legislation, Bulyea granted royal assent December 16. [...] Sifton, in his capacity as provincial treasurer, immediately tried to access the money; the Royal, Dominion, and Union banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment. [...] Attorney-General Mitchell sued the banks; on November 4, 1911, Justice Charles Allen Stuart of the Supreme Court of Alberta found in the government's favour. [...] The Royal Bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to use its <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> to strike down the provincial act. [...] In the meantime, Sifton announced a new railway policy that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with the assistance of provincial loan guarantees, including several pioneer lines; this policy, in its resemblance to the Rutherford policy, met with the approval of the Cross faction, and the Liberals were once more united.|$|R
2500|$|The complex {{resulting}} {{constitution was}} couched in more centralist terms than intended. As prime minister, Macdonald tried to exploit this discrepancy to impose his centralist ideal against chief opponent Oliver Mowat. In {{a series of}} political battles and court cases from 1872 to 1896, Mowat reversed Macdonald's early victories and entrenched the co-ordinated sovereignty which {{he saw in the}} Quebec Resolutions. In 1888, Edward Blake summarized that view: [...] " [...] a federal as distinguished from a legislative union, but a union composed of several existing and continuing entities ... not fractions of a unit but units of a multiple. The Dominion is the multiple and each province is a unit of that multiple ..." [...] The accession of Wilfrid Laurier as prime minister inaugurated a new phase of constitutional consensus, marked by a more-egalitarian relationship between the jurisdictions. The federal government's quasi-imperial <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> and reservation, which Macdonald abused in his efforts to impose a centralised government, fell into disuse.|$|R
50|$|However, the General Assembly did {{not have}} total control of the executive.

These <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> reservation and <b>disallowance</b> were prerogative powers included in the Act. This power was limited by the Balfour Declaration of 1926, in that they were to be exercised only on the advice of New Zealand ministers. The powers were not continued by the 1986 Constitution Act.|$|R

5000|$|The use {{of these}} powers {{declined}} {{over the course of}} the nineteenth century, in particular because of the abolition of the doctrine of general repugnancy by the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, and because the British government began to leave it to the court system to rule on the vires of colonial legislation. With the development of responsible government, the {{use of these}} powers declined even more rapidly. The 1926 imperial conference approved a committee report that stated:"Apart from provisions embodied in constitutions or in specific statutes expressly providing for reservation, it is recognised that it is the right of the Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating to its own affairs. Consequently, it would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty's Government in Great Britain in any matter appertaining to the affairs of a Dominion against the views of the Government of that Dominion."The Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and Merchant Shipping Legislation, 1929 (Cmd 3479), which was approved by the 1930 imperial conference, stated that both the prerogative and statutory powers of disallowance had [...] "not been exercised for many years" [...] in relation to dominion legislation (para. 19), and more specifically:"In fact the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> has not been exercised in relation to Canadian legislation since 1873 or to New Zealand legislation since 1867; it has never been exercised in relation to legislation passed by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia or the Union of South Africa."

Use <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> and reservation in the states declined and eventually ceased, and both powers were formally abolished by the Australia Act 1986.|$|R
50|$|This {{election}} did {{not bring}} an end to the education issue. Greenway's legislation brought about a complex series of legal cases, as well as threats <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> from various levels of government.

5000|$|In May 2010, the NCAA {{banned the}} use of BYU Independent Study high school courses as course credit for {{students}} bound for Division I schools.

40|$|We {{and others}} have {{previously}} identified a group of genes, dubbed “disallowed,” whose expression is markedly lower in pancreatic islets than in other mammalian cell types. Forced mis-expression of several members of this family leads to defective insulin secretion, demonstrating the likely importance <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> for normal beta cell function. Up to now, transcriptomic comparisons have been based solely on data from whole islets. This raises the possibilities that (a) there may be important differences in the degree <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> family members between beta and other either neuroendocrine cells; (b) beta (or alpha) cell disallowed genes may have gone undetected. To address this issue, we survey here recent massive parallel sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets from purified mouse and human islet cells. Our analysis reveals that the most strongly disallowed genes are similar in beta and alpha cells, with 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd 11 b 1) mRNA being essentially undetectable in both cell types. The analysis also reveals that several genes involved in cellular proliferation, including Yap 1 and Igfbp 4, and previously assumed to be disallowed in both beta and alpha cells, are selectively repressed only in the beta cell. The latter finding supports the view that beta cell growth is selectively restricted in adults, providing a mechanism to avoid excessive insulin production {{and the risk of}} hypoglycaemia. Approaches which increase the expression or activity of selected disallowed genes in the beta cell may provide the basis for novel regenerative therapies in type 2 diabetes...|$|R

50|$|Diacritic marks {{are almost}} always left out, save for the tilde on the ñ, because {{of the use of}} American {{standard}} machines and because <b>of</b> the <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> using these marks by English-language media companies.

Spanish words, however, are vocally stressed as they would be by Spanish speakers. Yet, the absence of these diacritic marks makes Filipinos studying Spanish liable to put the accent on the wrong syllable of loanwords in Philippine languages, as those words are pronounced as in their mother languages.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{prepared}} for the Democratic Audit of Australia, Ernst Willheim notes that parliamentary procedures for tabling and <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> delegated legislation, together with restrictions on the remaking of regulations that have been disallowed, enable considerable scrutiny of the Executive.

40|$|A {{party in}} breach of {{contract}} cannot sue the victim of breach to recover {{what would have been}} the victim’s loss on the contract. The doctrinal rationale is simple: A violator should not benefit from his violation. This rationale does not, however, provide an economic justification for the rule. Indeed, efficient breach theory is founded on the proposition that a breach of contract need not be met with reproach. Yet the prospect of a recovery by the {{party in breach}}—that is, the prospect of negative damages—has received scant attention in the contracts literature. Close analysis reveals potential costs to <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> negative damages particularly where a party with private information about the benefits of termination also has an incentive to continue under the contract. These costs can occur both ex post, at the time of a performance-or-termination decision, and ex ante, in anticipation of that decision. Nevertheless, allowance of negative damages could impose its own costs, where background information would create an incentive to repudiate a contract before either party could gather more information, for example. Ex ante contractual provisions, such as liquidated-damages or specific-performance clauses, permit parties some latitude to balance the costs <b>of</b> <b>disallowance</b> and allowance <b>of</b> negative damages, albeit imperfectly. Common law limitations on the mitigation duty, moreover, may be seen as a mechanism to approach this balance {{in the absence of an}} explicit contractual solution...|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, {{mindful of}} the federal government's <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, {{reserved}} royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> reservation in Alberta history, and {{in the summer of}} 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.|$|R
25|$|Where a local {{government}} makes {{a contract that}} is within its power, and then fails to perform its obligations under the contract, it may be sued {{in the same manner}} as any other entity, and may raise all defenses typically available in a contract action. However, if it is a county government that is alleged to be in breach, Virginia law imposes several additional steps before a lawsuit may be brought. Specifically, the claim must be formally presented to the county's governing body for an allowance, and it is only after that governing body has disallowed the claim that its decision may be appealed to the Virginia Circuit Court. The claim must be brought within thirty days <b>of</b> the <b>disallowance</b> if the claimant is present when the governing body so decides; if the claimant is not present, the claim must be brought within thirty days of the claimant receiving notice <b>of</b> the <b>disallowance.</b> In either case, the appeal must specify that the required presentment was made. This rule also applies to equitable claims for monetary relief.|$|R
50|$|A bill assented to by a Governor-General or colonial Governor {{would pass}} into law, but {{might still be}} {{disallowed}} by the King or Queen in Council, usually within a certain timeframe after its passage.

For example, Jehovah's Witnesses require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>disallowance</b> <b>of</b> blood transfusion from the Bible, and Muslims require that the donor have provided written consent in advance. [...] Orthodox Judaism considers it obligatory if it will save a life, as long as the donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law, which is a matter of debate among different rabbis.
