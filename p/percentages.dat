40|$|This study {{provides}} an updated test of Billy Beane’s Moneyball hypothesis using a panel model {{over the years}} 1999 - 2013.

In turn we created our own model which replaced the “against” statistics with earned run average and fielding <b>percentage.</b> Within both models, we concluded that the coefficient of on-base <b>percentage</b> was significantly greater than slugging <b>percentage,</b> which supports Beane’s theory that in today’s game on-base <b>percentage</b> is more important than slugging in determining winning <b>percentage.</b> We extend this analysis using both models to test for the effects of the 2005 steroid ban and found that neither of the coefficients for on-base <b>percentage</b> or slugging <b>percentage</b> were significantly affected by the ban. These conclusions can be used by major league managers and owners to decide which players to trade for or to pick up in free agency...|$|R

5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last.

At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end <b>percentages,</b> but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end <b>percentages.</b> In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself.
