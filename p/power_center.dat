5|$|The {{retail and}} service sector {{is also an}} {{important}} part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the downtown area. Today, downtown is home to small shops and restaurants and south Grand Forks has become the major retail district in the city. Grand Forks has three large shopping centers. The oldest, Grand Cities Mall, is on South Washington Street and contains mainly small, locally owned stores as well as a Kmart. With about 80 stores, the area's largest indoor mall is Columbia Mall which is anchored by Scheels, Sears, J.C. Penney, and a small food court. The newest major shopping center in the city is the Grand Forks Marketplace <b>power</b> <b>center</b> mall which features SuperTarget, Best Buy, Lowe's, Gordmans, and several smaller stores. Depending on the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the American dollar, the Greater Grand Forks area attracts large numbers of tourist shoppers from Manitoba and especially from Winnipeg.|$|E

25|$|In October 1830, the Sublime Porte {{assigned}} {{the districts of}} Jerusalem, Nablus and Hebron to Abdullah Pasha's jurisdiction. The districts were traditionally part of Damascus Eyalet, but the latter's governor, Mehmed Pasha, {{had been unable to}} collect the miri (annual tax designated for the Hajj pilgrimage caravan) from them. The Ottomans also feared an imminent invasion of Syria by Muhammad Ali and viewed Acre, however weakened, as the sole <b>power</b> <b>center</b> that could confront such an invasion. Thus, the imperial authorities sought to strengthen Abdullah's political position.|$|E
25|$|The double-headed eagle {{became the}} symbol of the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.

It represented looking towards the East (Asia Minor, traditional <b>power</b> <b>center</b> of the Byzantine-government in exile after the IVth Crusade) and the West (newly reconquered land in Europe) centered on Constantinople. The Byzantine double-headed eagle has been seen in late 13th century, certainly pre-dating the development of the same in western heraldry.|$|E

It was consecrated in 1145 and for the next 400 years, Lund became the ecclesiastical <b>power</b> <b>center</b> for Scandinavia and one of the most important cities in Denmark.

25|$|Since Stibor of Beckov (died 1434) did {{not have}} any heirs who could inherit {{existing}} properties, the testament told that it would be passed onto the closest family, including Beckov Castle that was made as <b>power</b> <b>center</b> of the clan in Upper Hungary. This Castle was made {{to be one of the}} most significant residences of that time, including great paintings, sculptures and chapel that was formed by artist from many different countries. Several testaments have been approved by the Emperor Sigismund and also his wife. The main issue in those was that all the properties of the Stibors in the kingdom of Hungary would be divided by closest family in case of lack of hair in the line. In that way, the land would stay in family hands.|$|E

25|$|Whether the Chiapa {{actually}} {{conquered the}} Zoque city {{or whether it}} had fallen before their arrival, the newcomers decided to occupy the adjacent floodplain of the Grijalva River, where the modern town is, and leave the old ruins untouched. By the early 16th century, this town had become a local <b>power</b> <b>center</b> called Napinaica. The Chiapa people were distinct from others in Chiapas in size, nudity, and fierceness which impressed the Spanish who noted it in their writings. These people were fiercely opposed to Spanish intrusion and were a major obstacle to the first efforts by the conquistadors to dominate. However, in 1528, Diego de Mazariegos succeeded in breaking this resistance by enlisting the help of neighboring peoples who were enemies of the Chiapa. The last Chiapa leader, named Sanguieme, tried to help his people escape the domination of the Spanish but, according to historian Jean de Vos, he was captured and burned alive in a hammock strung between two kapok trees, with a hundred of his followers hung from trees near the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{two parts}} of town were divided into encomiendas for a very short time, but in 1537 the {{entirety}} would be declared a city by the Spanish Crown, receiving its coat of arms in 1540. However, {{there is evidence that}} the division of the city was recognized since the early colonial period. The Franciscans established themselves in San Pedro first, with the San Gabriel monastery because this was the <b>power</b> <b>center</b> of the city and at first the monks were not sufficient to be spread out around the entire city. This early emphasis on the San Pedro side, along with the settling of the Spanish population almost exclusively here, resulted in this side of the city becoming mixed race (mestizo) early in the colonial era. Evidence of political distinctions can be found as early as 1548, but in 1714, the two halves were definitely separated when San Andrés was made an Indian Republic. This separation would cause political and economic problems between the two halves of the city, but still coexisting in matters of religion. The two municipalities were established by 1861. However, the two halves never completely split and the two municipalities formed a partial union called the Distrito Cholula de Rivadavia in 1895, with the appendage in honor of Bernardino de Rivadavia. As such, San Pedro is part of what is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Americas.|$|E
