The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> the physical interactions of gravity with it.

5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E

Cracks on PVB {{laminated glass}} are rich in impact information, which contribute to its impact resistance design. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical simulation model describing PVB laminated glass under impact loading is firstly established and validated qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the corresponding experimental results recorded by the high-speed photography system. In the meantime, the extended finite element method (XFEM) is introduced to analyze the crack <b>propagation</b> mechanism <b>of</b> laminated glass based on dynamic stress intensity factors (DSIFs) and <b>propagations</b> <b>of</b> stress waves. Parametric studies are then carried out to investigate the influence of five critical parameters, that is, plate dimension, crack length, impact energy, glass properties, and PVB properties, on crack <b>propagation</b> characteristics <b>of</b> laminated glass.
