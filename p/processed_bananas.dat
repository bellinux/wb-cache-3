40|$|Thesis (PhD (Viticulture and Oenology. Wine Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Although bananas {{are widely}} grown {{worldwide}} in many tropical {{and a few}} subtropical countries, banana beverages are still among the fruit beverages processed by use of rudimentary methods {{such as the use}} of feet or/and spear grass to extract juice. Because banana juice and beer remained on a home made basis, there is a research drive to come up with modern technologies to more effectively <b>process</b> <b>bananas</b> and to make acceptable banana juices and wines. One of the main hindrances in the production of highly desirable beverages is the pectinaceous nature of the banana fruit, which makes juice extraction and clarification very difficult. Commercial enzyme applications seem to be the major way forward in solving processing problems in order to improve banana juice and wine quality. The particular pectinolytic enzymes that were selected for this study are Rapidase CB, Rapidase TF, Rapidase X-press and OE-Lallzyme. In addition this study, investigate the applicability of recombinant yeast strains with pectinolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic and amylolytic activities in degrading the banana polysaccharides (pectin, xylan, glucan starch) for juice and wine extraction and product clarification. The overall objective of this research was to improve banana juice and wine by enzymatic processing techniques and to improve alcoholic fermentation and to produce limpid and shelf-stable products of clarified juice and wine. The focus was on applying the selected commercial enzyme preparations specifically for the production of better clarified banana juice and wine. This is because the turbid banana juice and beer, which contain suspended solids that are characterised by a very intense banana flavour, require a holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities in order to <b>process</b> pure <b>banana</b> beverages with desirable organoleptic qualities. The specific objectives of applying commercial enzymes in the processing of banana juice and wine, comparing with grape winemaking practices, use of recombinant yeast and analyses of various parameters in the juices and wines made have enabled generation of information that could be of help to prospective banana juice and wine processors. The research findings obtained could be used to establish a pilot plant or small-scale industry in the banana processing beverages producing large quantities,and finally the overall objective of obtaining limpid and shelf stable products would be achieved...|$|R

To accomplish this <b>process,</b> samples of <b>banana</b> (Musa sapientum L.) or mango (Mangifera indica L.) were heated to 60 °C by hot air, and a vacuum pulse was applied, which resulted in dehydration by a combination of convective drying and flash evaporation. <b>Banana</b> <b>processed</b> by CMFD had a moisture content of 0. 293 g/g (dry basis) and aw= 0. 272 after 3 h of processing.

40|$|Although, the {{ripening}} of climacteric fruits such as bananas {{is known}} to be mainly triggered by ethylene, cytokinins may also intervene in the control and regulation of this <b>process.</b> <b>Bananas</b> were treated by dipping for 24 h in solutions of cytokinins at concentrations ranging from 10 - 6 to 10 - 3 M to determine effects of these phytohormones on some parameters during the fruit ripening. At all concentrations used, benzylaminopurine induced significant retentions of water in the peel of banana fruits. Only 10 - 3 M kinetin solution was significantly effective in inhibiting the decrease of water content in the peel. There was an inhibition of the accumulation of water in the pulp of bananas after treatments with kinetin or benzylaminopurine. Qualitative analysis of pigments in peel extracts revealed an inhibition of chlorophyll degradation after application of cytokinins. Thus, banana fruits treated with 10 - 3 M kinetin still contained only chlorophyll a whereas, fruits treated with 10 - 3 M benzylaminopurine contained both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b at ripening stage 7. At this ripening stage, no chlorophyll could be detected in extracts from the peel of control fruits. There were increased accumulations of monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol and free fatty acids in the peel of banana fruits treated with 10 - 3 M benzylaminopurine. Contrarily to apolar lipids, no remarkable effects of treatments of bananas with 10 - 3 M benzylaminopurine on polar lipids could be observed. These results indicated that cytokinins modulated the metabolism of photosynthetic pigments and lipids and changes in the water content and that chlorophyll b was converted into chlorophyll a before its degradation in the peel of banana fruits during the ripening process...|$|R
