50|$|Dermanyssid mites {{are much}} larger than most {{parasitic}} mites and are easily {{visible to the naked}} eye. They have long, powerful legs that they use to seek their hosts and their size and active crawling cause them to resemble larval ticks. Their lifecycle proceeds from egg to larva to nymph to adult, and all of the active stages are only temporarily parasitic. A single blood meal is completed within a few minutes, so they are found on their hosts only for a short time relative to their time off the host. These types of mites naturally live in the nests of their bird hosts. The species of economic importance to poultry-rearing have adapted to living within the fabric of poultry houses. Their mouthparts are adapted for sucking blood with a pair of long piercing chelicerae. Dermanyssus gallinae, the <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mite,</b> is typical. A related genus is Ornithonyssus - O. bursa, the tropical fowl mite, and O. sylvarium, the northern fowl mite.|$|E

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 12 th International Symposium on Ectoparasites in Pets, celebrado en Munich (Alemania) del 7 al 9 de abril de 2013. Diseases {{transmitted}} by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies greatly impact {{human and animal}} health, and therefore, their control {{is important for the}} eradication of vectorborne diseases (VBD). Vaccination is an environmen- tally friendly alternative for vector control that allows control of several VBD by targeting their common vector. Recent results have suggested that subolesin (SUB) and its orthologue in insects, akirin (AKR) are good candidate antigens for the control of arthropod vector infestations and pathogen infection. SUB was dis- covered as a tick-protective antigen in Ixodes scapularis. Vaccination trials with recombinant SUB/AKR demonstrated effective control of arthropod vector infes- tations in various hard and soft tick species, mosquitoes, sand flies, <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and sea lice by reducing their numbers, weight, oviposition, fertility and/or moulting. SUB/AKR vaccination also reduced tick infection with tickborne patho- gens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. marginale, Babesia bigemina and Borrelia burgdorferi. The effect of vaccination on different hosts, vector species, develop- mental stages and vectorborne pathogen infections demonstrated the feasibility of SUB/AKR universal vaccines for the control of multiple vector infestations and for reduction in VBD.

40|$|Infestations with ectoparasitic <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae) pose an {{increasing}} threat to poultry health and welfare. Because {{of resistance to}} acaricides and higher scrutiny of poultry products, alternative and environmentally safe management strategies are warranted. Therefore, we investigated how volatile cues shape the behavior of D. gallinae and how this knowledge may be exploited {{in the development of}} an attractand- kill method to control mite populations. A Y-tube olfactometer bio-assay was used to evaluate choices of mites in response to cues related to conspecific mites as well as related to their chicken host. Both recently fed and starved mites showed a strong preference (84 and 85 %, respectively) for volatiles from conspecific, fed mites as compared to a control stream of clean air. Mites were also significantly attracted to ‘aged feathers’ (that had remained in the litter for 3 – 4 days), but not to ‘fresh feathers’. Interestingly, an air stream containing 2. 5 % CO 2, which mimics the natural concentration in air exhaled by chickens, did attract fed mites, but inhibited the attraction of unfed mites towards volatiles from aged feathers. We conclude that both mite-related cues (aggregation pheromones) and host-related cues (kairomones) mediate the behavior of the poultry mite. We discuss the options to exploit this knowledge as the ‘attract’ component of attract-and-kill strategies for the control of D. gallina...|$|R

Recent evidences showed a reduction in the survival and/or fertility of mosquitoes, sand flies and <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> fed in vitro with antibodies against the recombinant Aedes albopictus akirin. These experiments were the first step toward the development of a multi-target arthropod vaccine. In this study, we showed that the oviposition of A. albopictus and Phlebotomus perniciosus fed on mice vaccinated with recombinant A. albopictus akirin was reduced by 17 % and 31 %, respectively when compared to controls. However, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were not affected after feeding on vaccinated mice. These results showed that recombinant A. albopictus akirin could be used to vaccinate hosts for the control of mosquito and sand fly infestations and suggested new experiments to develop improved vaccine formulations.

A combination of two-dimensional immunoblotting and immunoaffinity chromatography, using IgY from hens immunised with these subfractions, was used in concert with proteomic analyses to identify the strongest immunogenic proteins in each of these subfractions. Ten of the immunoreactive proteins were selected for assessment as vaccine candidates using the following criteria: intensity of immune recognition; likelihood of exposure of the antigen to the antibodies in a blood meal; proposed function and known vaccine potential of orthologous molecules. Recombinant versions of each of these 10 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and were used to immunise hens. Subsequent in vitro feeding of mites on blood from these birds indicated that immunisation with Deg-SRP- 1 (serpin), Deg-VIT- 1 (vitellogenin), Deg-HGP- 1 (hemelipoglycoprotein) or Deg-PUF- 1 (a protein of unknown function) resulted in significantly increased risk of mite death (1. 7 – 2. 8 times higher than in mites fed blood from control hens immunised with adjuvant only, P< 0. 001).

40|$|Essential oils (EOs) and entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (Bb) strains {{have the}} {{potential}} to be used as alternative insecticides and acaricides for controlling ectoparasites as Dermanyssus gallinae. These compounds have some limitations in their use: the acaricidal effect of EOs is rapid, but short-lived, whilst that of Bb is delayed, but long-lived. To evaluate the effect of both compounds combined against D. gallinae, the non-toxic dose of Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus citriodora, Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllata essential oils were firstly calculated for "native" strains of Bb. Subsequently, the effects of the combination of selected EOs with Bb against nymph and adult <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> (PRMs) was assessed. EO concentrations ranging from 0. 0015 to 8 % v/v (i. e., nine double dilutions) were used to evaluate their effect on germination, sporulation and vegetative growth rates of native strains of Bb. A total of 1440 mites (720 nymphs and 720 adults) were divided into three-treated group (TGs) and one control group (CG). In TGs, mites were exposed to Bb in combination with the selected EO (TG 1), EO alone (TG 2) or Bb (TG 3) alone. In the CG, mites were exposed to 0. 1 % tween 80 plus EO solvent (CG). E. globulus and E. citriodora were toxic for Bb in concentrations higher than 0. 2 % and 0. 003 % respectively, whilst E. caryophyllata and T. vulgaris were toxic at all concentrations tested against Bb. Based on the results of the toxicity assays against Bb, E. globulus was chosen to be tested as acaricide resulting non-toxic for Bb at concentration lower than 0. 4 %. Increased mortality of D. gallinae adults was recorded in TG 1 than those in other TGs from 4 days post-infection (T+ 4 DPI). A 100 % mortality of D. gallinae was recorded in adults at T+ 9 DPI and at T+ 10 DPI in nymphs in TG 1 and later than T+ 11 DPI in the other TGs.

40|$|Introduction Dermanyssus gallinae, {{also known}} as the <b>red</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>mite,</b> is a major problem in the poultry {{industry}} worldwide; not only because of its economical and animal welfare impact, but also due to its vector function of a great variety of agents. An important aspect why D. gallinae-infestations are hard to control in poultry practice is that populations are difficult to monitor. Quantitative population-studies have not yet been performed because a good monitoring method does not exist. Therefore, this pilot-study has been done. The setup of this study is rather unique because a quantitative monitoring method is tested and evaluated on four <b>poultry</b> farms. The <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> traps, which were used are based upon the Arends tube-trap of 1984, but were modified by Bronneberg (AviVet B. V., Austerlitz, the Netherlands) and are further mentioned as the AviVet-trap. Aims The aims of the study are: 1. to evaluate the monitoring technique and determine whether it is suitable monitoring the D. gallinae-population in a poultry house, and. 2. to evaluate the effect of the predatory mite Hypoaspis miles on the D. gallinae-population. Results The AviVet-trap reaches a maximum number of D. gallinae at a 750 mg weight-increase of the trap. However with the infestation-criteria that are set, the method can be used properly for screening the level of a D. gallinae-infestation in the poultry house. The exact effect of the use of the predatory mite (H. miles) was difficult to determine in this study. This mainly due to other factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, that also influence the D. gallinae-population. However, the predatory mite, seemed to be a major factor for decreasing numbers of D. gallinae. Conclusion The described AviVet-traps can be easily used for objective quantitative monitoring and evaluating the effect of control measures on the D. gallinae-population. Some small adjustments in the monitoring-method can be done, but with some further research this method can be validated and readily be used in practice...|$|R
