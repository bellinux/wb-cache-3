SNP markers {{have been used in}} tea plant for cultivar identification (Fang et al. 2014), genetic diversity analysis (Yang et al. 2016), genetic map construction (Ma et al. 2015), nevertheless, it does not mean we cannot use SSR markers anymore. SSRs are still served as excellent markers in tea plant genetic analyses. As useful genetic markers, SSRs have been provided with several advantages for their co-dominant, hyper-variability, polymorphism, ease and reliability of scoring. SSRs have been used extensively for analysis of genetic diversity, population genetics, linkage mapping and association analysis (Verma et al. 2012). Furthermore, the high PIC value of SSRs (up to three fold higher than SNPs), coupled with high heterozygosity values makes them useful for assessment of genetic relatedness and map based cloning (Yang et al. 2011). We reported the combined <b>PID</b> <b>value</b> of only 6 long-core motif SSRs herein was 2.22  ×  10 − 5, while that of 60 polymorphic SNPs was about 1.0  ×  10 − 5 (Fang et al. 2014).

40|$|Abstract Background Percentage Identity (PID) is {{frequently}} quoted in discussion of sequence alignments since it appears simple {{and easy to}} understand. However, although there are several different ways to calculate percentage identity and each may yield a different result for the same alignment, the method of calculation is rarely reported. Accordingly, quantification {{of the variation in}} PID caused by the different calculations would help in interpreting <b>PID</b> <b>values</b> in the literature. In this study, the variation in PID was quantified systematically on a reference set of 1028 alignments generated by comparison of the protein three-dimensional structures. Since the alignment algorithm may also affect the range of PID, this study also considered the effect of algorithm, and the combination of algorithm and PID method. Results The maximum variation in PID due to the calculation method was 11. 5 % while the effect of alignment algorithm on PID was up to 14. 6 % across three popular alignment methods. The combined effect of alignment algorithm and PID calculation gave a variation of up to 22 % on the test data, with an average of 5. 3 % ± 2. 8 % for sequence pairs with Conclusion Although it is well known amongst expert sequence analysts that PID is a poor score for discriminating between protein sequences, the apparent simplicity of the percentage identity score encourages its widespread use in establishing cutoffs for structural similarity. This paper illustrates that not only is PID a poor measure of sequence similarity when compared to the Z-score, but that there is also a large uncertainty in reported <b>PID</b> <b>values.</b> Since better alternatives to PID exist to quantify sequence similarity, these should be quoted where possible in preference to PID.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 66). This work presents an implementation of a digital PID (Proportional + Integral + Derivative) controller algorithm in real-Time Linux environment. PID controllers are well known and have {{a wide range of}} applications in automatic control of systems. such as servomotors and temperature control etc. <b>PID</b> <b>values</b> are dependent on the sampling rate at which system output is read and the new value for system input generated. In order to achieve the desired performance the system output (axis position) is feed-back to the PID controller which generated the system input (motor voltage), in a closed loop. The Real-Time system is the accurate system which gives lowest latency. Through this real real-time the temperature control unit is controlled. The PID controller computes the error of the temperature control circuit between the desired system output (reference) and the actual system output. Then, the system input, which is the PID controller output, is generated as weighted sum of the error, its integral and derivative. The weighting coefficients are known as controller gains and referred as Kp, Ki, and Kd. The values of the controller gains determine the performance of the closed loop system and even its stability. The data acquisition card AX 5411 receives the data from the computer to control the temperature controller and retrieve the data and send it to computer again from the output as a feed back element simultaneously.

The following properties of neural networks are identified as of major interest to this field: their ability to implement nonlinear mappings, their massively parallel structure and their capacity to adapt. Exploiting the first feature, a new method is proposed for PID autotuning. Based on integral measures of the open or closed loop step response, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are used to supply <b>PID</b> parameter <b>values</b> to a standard PID controller. Before being used on-line, the MLPs are trained offline, to provide <b>PID</b> parameter <b>values</b> based on integral performance criteria. Off-line simulations, where a plant with time-varying parameters and time varying transfer function is considered, show that well damped responses are obtained. The neural PID autotuner is subsequently implemented in real-time. Extensive experimentation confirms the good results obtained in the off-line simulations. To reduce the training time incurred when using the error back-propagation algorithm, three possibilities are investigated. A comparative study of higherorder methods of optimization identifies the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm as the best method. When used for function approximation purposes, the neurons in the output layer of the MLPs have a linear activation function.

However, these types of movements are difficult to perform by humanoid robots. Humans perform these activities without difficulty thanks {{to their ability to}} absorb the ground impact force. The absorption of the impact force is based on the human ability to vary muscles stiffness. The principal objective of this dissertation is to study vertical jumps {{in order to reduce the}} impact force in the landing phase of the jump motion of humanoid robots. Additionally, the impact force reduction is applied to an arm-oriented movement with the objective of preserving the integrity of falling humanoid robot. This dissertation focuses on researching vertical jump motions by designing, implementing and testing variable stiffness control strategies based on Computed-Torque Control while tracking desired trajectories calculated using the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and the Center of Mass (CoM) conditions. Variable stiffness method is used to reduce the impact force during the landing phase. The variable stiffness approach was previously presented by Pratt et al. in [1], where they proposed that full stiffness is not always required. In this dissertation, the variable stiffness capability is implemented without the integration of any springs or dampers. All the actuators in the robot are DC Motors and the lower stiffness is achieved by the design and implementation of <b>PID</b> gain <b>values</b> in the <b>PID</b> controller for each motor. The current research proposes two different approaches to generate variable stiffness. The first approach is based on an optimal control theory where the linear quadratic regulator is used to calculate the gain <b>values</b> of the <b>PID</b> controller. The second approach is based on Fuzzy logic theory and it calculates the proportional gain (KP) of the PID controller. Both approaches are based on the idea of computing the PID gains to allow for the displacement of the DC motor positions with respect to the target positions during the landing phase. While a DC motor moves from the target position, the robot CoM changes towards a lower position reducing the impact force. The Fuzzy approach uses an estimation of the impact velocity and a specified desired soft landing level at the moment of impact in order to calculate the P gain of the PID controller. The optimal approach uses the mathematical model of the motor and the factor, which affects the Q matrix of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), in order to calculate the new <b>PID</b> <b>values.</b> A One-legged robot is used to perform the jump motion verification in this research. In addition, repeatability experiments were also successfully performed with both the optimal control and the Fuzzy logic methods. The results are evaluated and compared according to the impact force reduction and the robot balance during the landing phase. The impact force calculation is based on the displacement of the CoM during the landing phase. The impact force reduction is accomplished by both methods; however, the robot balance shows a considerable improvement with the optimal control approach in comparison to the Fuzzy logic method. In addition, the Optimal Variable Stiffness method was successfully implemented and tested in Falling Robots. The robot integrity is accomplished by applying the Optimal Variable Stiffness control method to reduce the impact force on the arm joints, shoulders and elbows...|$|R

SPSA algorithm indirectly controls DFIG speed through adjusting duty cycle of power converter, makes system operate at maximum power point under any wind speed, thus the maximum power output is transmitted to the load. SPSA algorithm not only {{does not need to}} set up <b>PID</b> three parameter <b>values,</b> but also does not anemometer and tachometer in practical applications. Simulation results show no matter how wind speed changes, SPSA algorithm can effectively improve power output of wind power generation system, and make tip speed ratio and power coefficient be near optimum value, reduce system cost...|$|R
