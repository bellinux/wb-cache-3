25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> and motivation.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} for training programs is learning. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes. Cognitive training {{is aimed at}} instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).|$|E

[...] In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus (the CA1 region) are involved with memory. [...] Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur.

Scientists {{were able to find}} that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice. In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In addition, priming (both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge. Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between undergraduates 2 ̆ 7 <b>procedural</b> {{and conceptual}} <b>knowledge</b> specific to fractions and their general mathematical self-efficacy and positive attitudes towards mathematics. The participants were 64 undergraduates who were assessed based on their <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>knowledge</b> of fractions as well as their mathematical self-efficacy and attitudes towards mathematics. The results revealed that both <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>knowledge</b> of fractions were related to mathematical self-efficacy and attitudes towards mathematics. However, the relationship with conceptual knowledge was stronger.

Strategy Hubs provide critical search procedures and associated high-quality links to enable users to find comprehensive and accurate information. We begin by describing how we collaborated with physicians to systematically identify generalizable search procedures to find comprehensive information about a disease, and how these search procedures were made available through the Strategy Hub. A controlled experiment suggests that this approach can improve the ability of novice searchers in finding comprehensive and accurate information, when compared to general-purpose search engines and domain-specific portals.

5000|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology, <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> is {{the knowledge}} exercised in {{the accomplishment of}} a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike declarative knowledge, cannot be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically nonconscious (or tacit). Many times, the individual learns <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> without even being aware that they are learning (Stadler,1989). For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as [...] "attractive" [...] or a specific joke as [...] "funny," [...] but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of [...] "attractiveness" [...] or being [...] "funny." [...] This example illustrates the difference between <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the ordinary notion of knowing how, a distinction which is acknowledged by many cognitive psychologists (Stillings, et al. Cognitive Science: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995, p. 396). Ordinarily, we would not say that one {{who is able to}} recognize a face as attractive is one who knows how to recognize a face as attractive. One knows how to recognize faces as attractive no more than one knows how to recognize certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables. Recognizing faces as attractive, like recognizing certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables, is simply something that one does, or is able to do. It is, therefore, an instance of <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge,</b> though it is not an instance of know-how. Of course, both forms of knowledge are, in many cases, nonconscious. For instance, research by a cognitive psychologist Pawel Lewicki has demonstrated that <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> can be acquired by nonconscious processing of information about covariations.|$|E

The evaluations indicated high levels of completeness and correctness of the guideline specification process by both the clinicians and the knowledge engineers, although the best results, in the case of declarative-knowledge specification, were achieved by teams including a clinician and a knowledge engineer. The usability scores were high as well, although the clinicians’ assessment was significantly lower than the assessment of the knowledge engineers...|$|R
40|$|Learning of {{threshold}} {{concepts in}} engineering science courses such as statics {{has traditionally been}} a difficult and critical juncture for engineering students. Research and other systematic {{efforts to improve the}} teaching of statics in recent years range widely, from development of courseware and assessment tools to experiential and other “hands-on ” learning techniques. This dissertation reports the findings from a multi-year, dual-institution study investigating possible links between short writing assignments and conceptual knowledge development in statics courses. The theoretical framework of the study draws on elements from cognitive learning theory – expertise, <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>knowledge</b> development, and conceptual change. The way that students approach learning in statics with regard to <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>knowledge</b> is explored qualitatively, and the relationship between the writing assignments and conceptual knowledge development is examined using a mixed-methods approach. The results show that students approach learning in statics with varying emphasis placed on <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>knowledge</b> development and that a student’s learning approach influences their perception of the written problems and the ways that they utilize them in learning. Thus, they provide evidence that the learning approach of students may be an important factor in the success of interventions designed to improve conceptual knowledge in statics. Increases in conceptual knowledge as a result of completing the written problems are also empirically supporte...|$|R
