40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{hierarchical}} bivariate time series model {{to characterize the}} relationship between particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (<b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10)</b> and both mortality and hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases. The model is applied to time series data on mortality and morbidity for 10 metropolitan areas in the United States from 1986 to 1993. We postulate that these time series should be related through a shared relationship with <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10.</b> At {{the first stage of}} the hierarchy, we fit two seemingly unrelated Poisson regression models to produce city-specific estimates of the log relative rates of mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10</b> within each location. The sample covariance matrix of the estimated log relative rates is obtained using a novel generalized estimating equation approach that takes into account the correlation between the mortality and morbidity time series. At the second stage, we combine information across locations to estimate overall log relative rates of mortality and morbidity and variation of the rates across cities. Using the combined information across the 10 locations we find that a 10 µg/m 3 increase in average <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10</b> at the current day and previous day is associated with a 0. 26 % increase in mortalit...|$|E
30|$|PM {{monitoring}} in heritage {{sites is}} generally focused on coarse dust, {{and the two}} most frequently measured particle types are <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10</b> and P M 2.5, which include particles up to 2.5 and 10 μm. This standard, however, has limitations. Measurements of P M 2.5 sum up some particles from the coarse mode (> 1 μm) and some from the fine mode (< 1 μm) and therefore these values do not help to identify the fractions of fine and coarse particles, which would enable appropriate action to be taken. Complete size-resolved measurements of particle concentration would provide {{more information on the}} likely source and typology of particles; however, measurement of size distributions requires costly equipment. A much more informative and cost-effective measurement would be <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10</b> and P M 1, or <b>P</b> <b>M</b> <b>10</b> − 1 and P M 1.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the correlation between}} vascular cholesterol metabolism and proteoglycan (PrGl) biosynthesis, we investigated PrGl synthesis in human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) after cholesterol enrichment with cationized low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Compared with normal SMCs, total PrGl synthesis by cholesterol-enriched cells decreased 2. 4 -fold (11874 +/- 530 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells compared with 4890 +/- 385 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells). This was the net result of a 6. 9 -fold reduction in medium PrGl (11000 +/- 490 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells compared with 1580 +/- 246 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells) and a 3. 8 -fold increase in cellular PrGl over controls (874 +/- 27 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells compared with 3310 +/- 193 d. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> per <b>10</b> (5) cells). Prior incubation of SMCs with native LDL {{had no effect on}} PrGl synthesis by these cells. The decrease in PrGl synthesis in cholesterol-enriched cells correlated with a 90 % and 20 % reduction in the steady-state level of mRNA for biglycan and decorin respectively, and a virtual elimination of the steady-state level of mRNA for versican over controls. Despite the down-regulation of PrGl synthesis, cholesterol-loaded cells produced a 2 -fold increase in a PrGl subfraction with high affinity for LDL. Compared with the corresponding PrGl subfraction from normal cells, that from the cholesterol-enriched cells exhibited increased charge density and a higher molecular mass and contained relatively larger proportions of chondroitin 6 -sulphate and dermatan sulphate. These results show that PrGl metabolism is dramatically altered in cholesterol-enriched human SMCs...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{carried out}} a {{detailed}} exposure assessment of benzene and toluene in two shoe factories in Tianjin, China. Our goal was to identify workers with {{a broad range of}} benzene exposures, for an epidemiologic study relating exposure to early biologic effects. Methods: A comprehensive exposure survey program was initiated. Over a period of 16 months, 2783 personal solvent exposure samples were collected in two workplaces from 250 workers. Mixed-effects models were used to identify factors affecting exposure. Principal component analyses (PCA) and subsequent regression analyses on the scores of the identified principal components were used to relate potential co-exposures to various exposure sources present in the workplace. Results: The mean benzene exposure level was 21. 86 p. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (<b>10</b> th– 90 th percentiles 5. 23 – 50. 63 p. p. m.) in the smaller shoe factory (factory A) and 3. 46 p. <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (<b>10</b> th– 90 th percentiles 0. 20 – 7. 00 p. p. m.) in the larger shoe factory (factory B).

Moreover, the correlations between reverse financial and environmental flows (i. e. flows of different layers going in opposite directions) are generally stronger than correlations between synergic flows (flows going in the same direction). This suggests a trade-off between financial and environmental layers, where, more financialised countries display higher correlations between outgoing financial flows and incoming environmental flows from lower financialised countries, which could have important policy implications.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} {{experiments}} were to define a new experimental model of pulmonary hypertension induced by a post-capillary mechanism and to assess the haemodynamic effects of nitric oxide on post-capillary pulmonary hypertension. Cardiopulmonary variables of 28 male beagle dogs, anaesthetized with chloralose, 16 spontaneous breathing and 12 with assisted ventilation, were studied before and after sino-aortic denervation (SAD). The haemodynamic effects of inhaled nitric oxide (25 p. <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> <b>10</b> [*]min), Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), urapidil (0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and propranolol (300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) were studied after SAD. SAD induced an acute and transient pulmonary hypertension, more marked in spontaneous breathing dogs. This pulmonary hypertension involved a post-capillary mechanism, secondary to the left ventricular haemodynamic effects of the acute increase of left ventricular after-load induced by systemic hypertension. In fact, the increase of mean pulmonary arterial pressure after SAD and the decrease of this parameter after urapidil or propranolol were strongly correlated with the variations of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Furthermore, no significant change in pulmonary vascular resistances was found after SAD or administration of α or β-adrenoceptor antagonists. Inhaled nitric oxide did not reverse pulmonary hypertension induced by SAD. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester had no significant haemodynamic effect on pulmonary circulation. In conclusion, the lack of effect of inhaled nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on pulmonary circulation parameters after SAD suggests that endothelium-derived nitric oxide {{is not involved in}} the mechanisms leading to post-capillary pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{examine whether}} young adults' alcohol {{consumption}} {{during the course}} of an evening was affected by the number of friends present, and the interaction between participants' gender and number of friends present. Design Participants used the internet-based cellphone-optimized assessment technique (ICAT) to complete a series of cellphone questionnaires every Thursday, Friday and Saturday evening over five weekends. A multi-level growth curve model (hourly assessments, clustered within evenings, clustered within individuals) with time-invariant and time-varying covariates was estimated. Setting French-speaking Switzerland. Participants A total of 183 young adults (53. 0 % female, mean age= 23. 1) who completed 7205 questionnaires on 1441 evenings. Measurements Alcohol consumption and number of friends present assessed at 8 p. m., 9 <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> <b>10</b> p. m., 11 p. m. and midnight. Findings Drinking pace accelerated notably {{over the course of the}} evening on Saturdays (b= 0. 047; P< 0. 01). Men consumed more alcohol than women, particularly at the beginning of the evening (b= 0. 152; P< 0. 05). However, this effect was no longer significant when the impact of friends was accounted for (b= 0. 096; P= 0. 139). The higher the number of friends present, the higher the number of drinks consumed at a given time {{during the course of}} the evening (b= 0. 070; P< 0. 001). Cross-level interaction effects indicated that this relationship was stronger for men than women (b= 0. 027; P< 0. 05). Conclusions Among young adults in Switzerland, the number of friends present is associated positively with hourly drinking frequency during the course of weekend evenings. The impact of the drinking group size on alcohol use is stronger for men than women...|$|E

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of gastritis and gastric carcinoma. Aspirin has anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effects of aspirin on H. pylori-induced gastritis and the development of heterotopic proliferative glands. Methods: H. pylori strain SS 1 was inoculated into the stomachs of Mongolian gerbils. Two weeks after inoculation, the animals were fed with the powder diets containing 0 <b>p.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (n = <b>10),</b> 150 <b>p.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (n = <b>10),</b> or 500 <b>p.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (n = <b>10)</b> aspirin. Mongolian gerbils were killed after 36 weeks of infection. Uninfected Mongolian gerbils (n = 10) were used as controls. Histologic changes, epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels of gastric tissue were determined. Results: H. pylori infection induced gastric inflammation. Administration of aspirin did not change H. pylori-induced gastritis, but alleviated H. pylori-induced hyperplasia and the development of heterotopic proliferative glands. Administration of aspirin accelerated H. pylori-associated apoptosis but decreased H. pylori-associated cell proliferation. In addition, the increased gastric PGE 2 levels due to H. pylori infection were suppressed by treatment with aspirin, especially at the dose of 500 <b>p.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Conclusions: Aspirin alleviates H. pylori-induced hyperplasia and the development of heterotopic proliferative glands. Moreover, aspirin increases H. pylori-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated the antineoplastic activities of aspirin in H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
