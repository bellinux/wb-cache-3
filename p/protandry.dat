5|$|In {{polygynous}} {{species with}} considerable sexual dimorphism, males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. This is termed <b>protandry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is <b>protandry,</b> whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protandry</b> is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (<b>protandry).</b> Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the Banksia flower, with the style end functioning as a pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. In many Banksia species, the risk of this occurring is reduced by protandry: a delay in a flower's receptivity to pollen until after its own pollen has lost its viability. There is dispute, however, over whether this occurs in B.prionotes: one study claimed to have confirmed [...] "protandrous development", yet recorded high levels of stigmatic receptivity immediately after anthesis, and long pollen viability, observations that are not consistent with <b>protandry.</b>|$|E
500|$|If it does occur, <b>protandry</b> {{does nothing}} to prevent geitonogamous self-{{pollination}}: that is, pollination with pollen from another flower on the same plant. In fact, when birds forage at B.prionotes, only {{about a quarter of}} all movements from inflorescence to inflorescence involve a change of plant. Geitonogamous self-pollination must therefore occur more often in this species than cross-pollination. This does not imply high rates of self-fertilisation, however, as the species appears highly self-incompatible: although pollen grains will germinate on flowers of the self plant, they apparently fail to produce pollen tubes that penetrate the style. Even where cross-pollination does occur, fertilisation rate is fairly low. It is speculated that this is related to [...] "a variety of chemical reactions at the pollen-stigma interface".|$|E
2500|$|Usually hermaphrodites are sequential, {{meaning they}} can switch sex, usually from female to male (protogyny). This can happen if a {{dominant}} male {{is removed from}} a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male. This is found amongst coral reef fishes such as groupers, parrotfishes and wrasses. It is less common for a male to switch to a female (<b>protandry).</b> As an example, most wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system. Hermaphroditism allows for complex mating systems. [...] Wrasses exhibit three different mating systems: polygynous, lek-like, and promiscuous mating systems. [...] Group spawning and pair spawning occur within mating systems. The type of spawning that occurs depends on male body size. [...] Labroids typically exhibit broadcast spawning, releasing high amounts of planktonic eggs, which are broadcast by tidal currents; adult wrasses have no interaction with offspring. [...] Wrasse of a particular subgroup of the Labridae family Labrini do not exhibit broadcast spawning.|$|E
2500|$|The Pacific oyster {{usually has}} {{separate}} sexes. Their sex {{can be determined}} by examining the gonads, and it can change from year to year, normally during the winter months. In certain environmental conditions, one sex is favoured over the other. <b>Protandry</b> is favoured in areas of high food abundance and protogyny occurs in areas of low food abundance. In habitats with a high food supply, the sex ratio in the adult population tends to favour females, and areas with low food abundances {{tend to have a}} larger proportion of male adults. Spawning in the Pacific oyster occurs at [...] This species is very fecund, with females releasing about 50–200 million eggs in regular intervals (at a rate of 5–10 times a minute) in a single spawning. Once released from the gonads, the eggs move through the suprabranchial chambers (gills), are then pushed through the gill ostia into the mantle chamber, and are finally released in the water, forming a small cloud. [...] In males, the sperm is released {{at the opposite end of}} the oyster, along with the normal exhalent stream of water. [...] A rise in water temperature is thought to be the main cue in the initiation of spawning, as the onset of higher water temperatures in the summer results in earlier spawning in the Pacific oyster.|$|E
50|$|Self-pollination {{is often}} avoided {{by means of}} <b>protandry.</b> Most species are {{entomophilous}} (pollinated by insects).|$|E
5000|$|The {{male part}} of the {{reproductive}} system is developed [...] "slightly earlier" [...] (<b>protandry)</b> in Bulinus jousseaumei.|$|E
50|$|In {{polygynous}} {{species with}} considerable sexual dimorphism, males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. This is termed <b>protandry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Within the clade Littorinimorpha {{however, the}} {{superfamily}} Calyptraeoidea are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites. <b>Protandry</b> {{means that the}} individuals first become male, {{and then later on}} become female. See for example the genus Crepidula.|$|E
50|$|In {{all species}} the stamens blossom first, and the stigmas unfold later (<b>protandry).</b> Halothamnus subaphyllus was {{proved to be}} pollinated by insects (entomophily). There are no {{observations}} for the other species, but they {{are considered to be}} pollinated by insects, too.|$|E
5000|$|Other protandrous fishes can {{be found}} in the classes clupeiformes, siluriformes, stomiiformes, and within the perciform {{families}} pomacentridae and sparidae. Since these groups are distantly related and have many intermediate relatives that are not protandrous, it strongly suggests that <b>protandry</b> evolved multiple times. Other examples of protandrous animals include: ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{possibility}} is that Banksia flowers are simply not exposed to their own pollen. This is highly unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, the morphology of the Banksia flower makes it virtually inevitable that the stigma will be exposed to its own pollen, since it functions also as a [...] "pollen-presenter". It {{has been suggested that}} this problem would be avoided if the flowers were strongly protandrous, but the evidence so far supports only partial <b>protandry.</b> Moreover, the question of <b>protandry</b> of individual flowers is probably irrelevant, because the sequential anthesis of flowers means that each inflorescence will typically contain flowers in both male and female stages at the same time. Observations of foraging patterns in pollinators have shown that transfer of pollen between different flowers in the same inflorescence is inevitable.|$|E
5000|$|This {{butterfly}} exhibits <b>protandry.</b> Males tend {{to emerge}} 4-8 days before females {{do and the}} average life span of both sexes is 10 days, though {{it can be as}} long as three weeks. [...] <b>Protandry</b> may {{have an effect on the}} butterfly's mating success in a population. In many time constrained species such as the Edith's checkerspot, early season matings may have a higher probability of producing adults in the next generation than those later in the year. Pre-diapause larvae are under time pressure to mature to diapause size before host plants senesce in summer drought. Therefore, larvae hatching from eggs laid earlier in the season are more likely to have reached the intended size. This is why males mating at the beginning of the season are more likely to produce surviving offspring than males mating a few weeks later.|$|E
50|$|In {{any group}} of anemonefish, there is a strict sized based {{dominance}} hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit <b>protandry,</b> meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male.|$|E
5000|$|Cavoliniids have {{a strange}} sexual life. They develop from males as juveniles into hermaphrodites {{and then later}} convert into females. More than one male stage can occur. This bizarre-seeming, but not very {{uncommon}} phenomenon is called <b>protandry.</b> (This is also common among many species of fish, some may all start as females, others species may start as males.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{sequentially}} hermaphroditic, with most individuals maturing as males and becoming female after {{at least one}} spawning season; most of the larger specimens are therefore female. Fish held in captivity sometimes demonstrate features atypical of fish in the wild: they change sex at a smaller size, exhibit {{a higher proportion of}} <b>protandry</b> and some males do not undergo sexual inversion.|$|E
50|$|E. rhodantha has a mixed mating system; it reproduces {{mainly by}} outcrossing but {{is able to}} self-pollinate. <b>Protandry</b> doesn’t stop {{self-pollination}} in E. rhodantha, as plants can have numerous flowers in different stages at the same time. Single plants in remote settings have been found with seed, indicating that self-pollination occurs in E. rhodantha. Inbreeding besides self-pollination can also occur, most likely the result of mating between closely related plants.|$|E
50|$|Selection on {{development}} time is often sexually antagonistic. In seed beetles, populations differed in development time and growth rate between sexes. Population fitness is not significant to either body size or growth rate, but variation in development time {{was significantly related}} to population fitness. In females, genes associated with long development time lead to high fecundity and mate immediately upon eclosion. Males have shorter development time and emerge early (<b>protandry)</b> resulting in greater fertilization opportunities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protandry</b> is {{the general}} rule among the Digenea. Usually two testes are present, but some flukes can have more than 100. Also present are vasa efferentia, a vas deferens, seminal vesicle, {{ejaculatory}} duct and a cirrus (analogous to a penis) usually (but not always) enclosed in a cirrus sac. The cirrus {{may or may not}} be covered in proteinaceous spines. The exact conformation of these organs within the male terminal genitalia is taxonomically important at the familial and generic levels.|$|E

50|$|Sequential {{hermaphroditism}} (called dichogamy in botany) {{is a type}} of hermaphroditism {{that occurs}} in many fish, gastropods, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. It can change from a male to female (<b>protandry),</b> or from female to male (protogyny) or from female to hermaphrodite (protogynous hermaphroditism), or from male to hermaphrodite (protandrous hermaphroditism). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the gonads or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.
