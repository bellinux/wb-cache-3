2500|$|The {{second step}} in this reaction, the {{conversion}} of 12(S)-HpETE to HxA3 and HxB3, may be catalyzed by ALOX12 as an intrinsic property of the enzyme. [...] Based on gene knockout studies, however, the epidermal lipoxygenase, ALOXE3, or more correctly, its mouse ortholog Aloxe3, appears responsible for converting 12(S)-HpETE to HxB3 in mouse skin and spinal tissue. It is suggested that ALOXE3 contributes in part or whole {{to the production of}} HxB3 and perhaps other hepoxilins by tissues where it is expressed such as the skin. [...] Furthermore, hydroperoxide-containing unsaturated fatty acids can rearrange non-enzymatically to form a variety of epoxyalcohol isomers. The 12(S)-HpETE formed in tissues, it is suggested, may similar rearrange non-enzymatically to form HxA3 and HXB3. Unlike the products made by ALOX12 and ALOXE3, which are stereospecific in forming only HxA3 and HxB3, however, this non-enzymatic production of hepoxilins may form a variety of hepoxilin isomers and occur as an artifact of tissue processing. Finally, cellular peroxidases readily and rapidly reduce 12(S)-HpETE to its hydroxyl analog, 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE; see 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; this reaction competes with the hepoxilin-forming reaction and in cells expressing very high <b>peroxidase</b> <b>activity</b> may be responsible for blocking the formation of the hepoxilins.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the involvement of selenium and glutathione peroxidase in prostaglandin biosynthesis by the ram vesicular gland. Vesicular glands were collected from healthy intact rams covering a wide range of selenium nutrition and were analyzed for selenium concentrations, glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> <b>activities</b> and levels of prostaglandin E₂ and prostaglandin F₂α. This study showed a statistically highly significant positive relationship between selenium concentrations and glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> <b>activities,</b> a statistically significant negative relationship between glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> <b>activities</b> and prostaglandin F₂α levels and a statistically positive relationship between prostaglandins E₂ and F₂α, but it did not show any significant relationships between gluthathione <b>peroxidase</b> <b>activities</b> and prostaglandin E₂ levels, between selenium concentrations and prostaglandin E₂ levels and between selenium concentrations and prostaglandin F₂α levels. The results of this study do not favour the direct involvement of selenium and glutathione peroxidase in prostaglandin biosynthesis by the ram vesicular gland. Glutathione peroxidase appears not to be an indispensible enzyme in this process or an obligatory requirement for its continuation. However glutathione peroxidase may have an indirect effect on prostaglandin biosynthesis by protecting the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase enzyme against harmful effects of lipid peroxides. The negative effect of glutathione peroxidase on prostaglandin F₂α, showed in this study agrees with and confirms a previous report.
