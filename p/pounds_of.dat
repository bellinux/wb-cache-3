5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> baking soda {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> wool, 316,610 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> hides and skins, 1.3 million <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> tanning materials, 4 million <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> copra, 544,660 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
50|$|Kierkegaard {{compared}} a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> {{gold and}} a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> feathers. He views the <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> feathers as a lesser weight {{because of the}} value of gold compared to feathers. He then asks the reader to decide if a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> temporality is equal to a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> eternity. Feathers and gold and temporality and eternity and numbers all have value in this world. He has seven different discourses in this third section. He seems to be using religious numbers generally while writing but always referring to Christianity specifically.|$|R

5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Historically, one of {{the largest}} {{releases}} was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> mercury are unaccounted for.|$|E

50|$|From the War of 1812 {{until the}} 1840s, The U.S. Navy used three classifications: the gun proper, {{which had a}} barrel weight of 150 lbs per <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> shot, the double-fortified gun which had a barrel weight of 200 lbs per <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> shot, and the medium gun, which had a barrel weight of 100 lbs per <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> shot. By comparison, a carronade would have a barrel weight of 65 lbs per <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> shot.|$|R
50|$|Cotton covers 2.5% of the world's {{cultivated}} land yet uses 16% of the world's insecticides, {{more than any}} other single major crop. It can take almost a 1/3 <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> synthetic fertilizers to grow one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> raw cotton in the US, and it takes just under one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> raw cotton to make one t-shirt.|$|R
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
5|$|In 967 or 968, Nikephoros sent to Sviatoslav his agent, Kalokyros, {{with the}} task of talking Sviatoslav into {{assisting}} him in a war against Bulgaria. Sviatoslav was paid 15,000 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> gold and set sail with an army of 60,000 men, including thousands of Pecheneg mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 <b>pounds)</b> <b>of</b> fruit each year.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{mentions}} of butterscotch {{associate the}} confection with Doncaster in Yorkshire. An 1848 {{issue of the}} Liverpool Mercury gave a recipe for [...] "Doncaster butterscotch" [...] as [...] "one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> butter, one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> sugar and a quarter <b>of</b> a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> treacle, boiled together" [...] (1 lb each of butter and sugar and [...]25 lb treacle).|$|R
5000|$|Avoirdupois (goods of weight) {{refers to}} those things {{measured}} by the lesser but quicker balances: the bismar or uncel, the Roman balance, and the steelyard. The original mercantile <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> 25 shillings or 15 (tower) ounces was displaced by variously the <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> the Hanseatic League (16 tower ounces) and by the <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> the then-important wool trade (16 ounces of 437 grains). A new <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> [...] grains was inadvertently created as 16 troy ounces, referring to the new troy rather than the old troy. Eventually, the wool pound won out.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Exercise Science)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. The caloric deficit {{required}} for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> body weight loss {{is reported to be}} 3, 500 kilocalories (Wishnofsky, 1960). However, published articles, textbooks, and professional organizations equate a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> fat mass loss to 3, 500 kilocalories (Applegate, 2011; Mayo Clinic, 2012; Kravitz, 2007; Cerrato, 1987). The purpose was to perform a theoretical review pertaining to caloric deficits {{required for}} equivalent changes in body composition, body weight, and fat mass loss. An online database search was performed using key words such as adipose tissue, adipose cell, body composition, body weight loss, fat mass loss, adipose loss, diet, direct calorimetry, and 3, 500 calories. 43 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 of which were used for calculating caloric equivalents. The differences in caloric deficit {{required for a}} <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> body weight loss, adipose tissue loss, and fat mass loss was compared to the calculated theoretical caloric equivalent for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> fat mass loss. A percent error measurement was calculated between the theoretical caloric equivalent for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> fat mass loss to the caloric equivalents for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> body weight loss, adipose tissue loss, and fat mass loss. The energy equivalent of body weight loss varied considerably, dependent upon the constituent portions of fat, water, protein, carbohydrate and mineral lost. Adipose tissue also varied with type and was dependent upon the composition of lipid, water, and protein. The most valid theoretical equivalent for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> fat was calculated at 4, 423. 90 kilocalories (P??ronnet & Massicotte, 1991) based on in vivo extraction of human intracellular lipid samples. The calculated percent errors between the theoretical caloric equivalent for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> fat mass and published, accepted values for a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> body weight loss, dietary lipid loss, adipose tissue loss, and fat mass loss were 20. 88...|$|R

5|$|An African prefecture, {{centered}} in Carthage, {{was established in}} April 534, but it would teeter {{on the brink of}} collapse during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies. The area was not completely pacified until 548, but remained peaceful thereafter and enjoyed a measure of prosperity. The recovery of Africa cost the empire about 100,000 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> gold.|$|E

5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas. By 12weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2million (2003USD, ($ USD)).|$|E
60|$|I thought I {{observed}} a frown on the sailor's brow as I said this, {{but he made}} no remark, {{and in a few}} minutes we were walking rapidly through the streets. My companion stopped at one of those stores so common in seaport towns, where one can buy almost anything, from a tallow candle to a brass cannon. Here he purchased a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> tea, a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> sugar, a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> butter, and a small loaf,--all of which he thrust into the huge pockets of his coat. He had evidently no idea of proportion or of household affairs. It was a simple, easy way of settling the matter, to get a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> everything.|$|R
