Because kittens have {{been seen in the}} months of April and October, this could mean that the mating season extends into November or even December. A litter will usually consist of one or two offspring born {{in the spring and summer}} months.

40|$|We {{measured}} daily intracage ammonia {{levels and}} performed weekly assessments of CD 1 male, female, and breeder mice housed within disposable, ventilated cages that remained unchanged for 28 d. We tested housing groups comprising 1, 3, or 5 sex-matched mice per cage and breeder <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>litters.</b> Mice housed in cages with higher concentrations of ammonia developed degeneration and inflammatory lesions in the nasal passages. Mean ammonia exposure levels that caused rhinitis were 181 ppm for 18 d. Ammonia exposures of 93 ppm for 16 d caused necrosis of the olfactory epithelium, whereas 52 ppm for 13 d caused epithelial degeneration. Observers could not detect visible signs of rhinitis or identify cages with elevated ammonia levels, {{nor did they}} identify any sick or distressed mice. Observers consistently assigned poorer welfare scores as cages became dirtier. We conclude that we can extend the cage-change interval to at least 28 d for disposable, ventilated caging housing a single CD 1 mouse. Cages containing 3 CD 1 mice of either sex should be changed biweekly, and cages containing 5 CD 1 mice or breeder pairs should be changed at least once weekly...|$|R
40|$|Burrow {{construction}} {{abilities of}} laboratory-reared oldfield mice (Pero-myscus polionotus), deermice (P. maniculatus), and their FI hybrids were compared using a spacious earth-filled test chamber. Mated <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> nursing <b>litters</b> were individually {{introduced into the}} chamber for 4 days in each test. Oldfield mice bred in metal or plastic cages for 20 or more generations constructed elaborate burrows, with entrance and escape tunnels, tunnel plugs, nest chambers, and nests, essentially like those of wild mice of this species. Prairie deermice maintained for 25 or more generations in captivity constructed shallow or superficial burrows char-acteristic of deermice in nature. F made burrows like those of oldfield mice, complete in all particulars. First-generation backcross an-imals tested for burrow building exhibited a spectrum of performances. Species difference in burrow construction is principally genetic in origin, and during 20 - 25 generations in captivity no substantial loss of this ability occurred. F data indicate that the more complex burrow building exhibits genetic dominance, and backcross results show {{that at least two}} and probably more gene loci strongly influence the trait.

40|$|Litter {{decomposition}} is {{a critical}} process in terrestrial ecosystems and, since in natural conditions plant litter occurs in mixtures, understanding {{the interactive effects of}} mixed litter is of great ecological relevance. In this context, we test the hypothesis that N transfer between high quality litter to N-poor substrates are at the base of synergistic interactions, positively affecting litter decay rate, temperature sensitivity, and changes of organic C quality. We carried out a manipulative experiment using four organic substrates, encompassing a wide range of biochemical quality (Hedera helix and Quercus ilex leaf litter, cellulose strips and woody sticks), each decomposing either separately or in matched pair mixtures for 360 days. Organic substrates were characterized for mass loss, C and N content and by C- 13 CPMAS NMR to assess biochemical quality changes. Litter response to mixing was related to the biochemical quality of the components in the mixture: additive when substrates with similarly high (H. helix and Q. ilex) or low (cellulose and wood) N content were paired, but synergistic when substrates with contrasting N content were associated (either of the two leaf <b>litters</b> <b>with</b> either cellulose or wood). Overall, no antagonist effects were observed in this experiment. Interestingly, decomposition of cellulose and wood showed an higher temperature sensitivity, compared to monospecific substrates, when <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> N rich materials. Significant N transfer was found from N rich litter to N poor substrates and C- 13 CPMAS NMR showed rapid changes of C quality of cellulose and wood sticks only when <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> N rich <b>litter.</b> Our findings support the hypothesis that mixing litters of different quality, with quality expressed in terms of C/N ratio and N content, increases decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity of the lower quality substrates...|$|R

Taking Castanopsis fargesii and Castanopsis carlesii as test objects, {{which were}} both {{important}} dominant specises of evergreen broadleaved {{forest in the}} Three Gorges Reservoir Area, we made gaps (57 m 2) in Pinus massoniana forest in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and studied {{the effect of adding}} and removing litter under two forest conditions (gaps and under-canopy) on the seed germination and seedling growth of Castanopsis fargesii and Castanopsis carlesii, moreover, analyzed the death causes of seeds. The results showed as follows. 1) In the forest gap, Castanopsis carlesii seeds covered <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> and that without litter both had significantly higher germination rate than that under forest canopy. Castanopsis fargesii seeds covered <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> in the gap showed higher germination rate as well, but the seeds covered without litter showed lower rate compared with that under forest canopy. 2) In the forest gap, Castanopsis fargesii and Castanopsis carlesii seedlings (including adding litter treatment and removing litter treatment) both demonstrated lower survival rate and plant height than that in the forest. 3) In the forest gap, the germination rate of Castanopsis fargesii and Castanopsis carlesii seeds that covered without litter were respectively 60. 22 % and 45. 06 % higher than that of the seeds covered <b>with</b> <b>litter,</b> and so were the plant height, which were respectively 33. 76 % and 19. 51 % higher than that of the seeds covered <b>with</b> <b>litter.</b> Unde...|$|R
40|$|Free-living cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs {{are killed}} {{by a number of}} predators, thus {{vigilance}} in cheetah mothers may be a form of anti-predator behaviour as well as a means of locating prey. Mothers' vigilance during the day was closely associated with measures of hunting but not with measures of anti-predator behaviour. In contrast, mothers' vigilance at kills was not related to hunting but was related to anti-predator behaviour. Both forms of vigilance decreased as cubs grew older. Vigilance during the day increased <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> size which supports a model of ‘shared’ parental investment (Lazarus and Inglis 1986) because after prey had been located and caught by mothers, cubs shared the prey between them. Vigilance at kills did not increase <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> size when cubs were young; in these situations predators stole cheetahs' prey and rarely chased cubs so, at most, only a single cub would be taken. Mothers' anti-predator behaviour away from kills did increase <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> size at young cub ages however; more cubs are killed in these circumstances the greater is the size of the litter. When cubs were older and could outrun predators, neither vigilance at kills nor anti-predator behaviour increased <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> size. These results strongly support two models of ‘unshared’ investment (Lazarus and Inglis 1986) and demonstrate, not only that superficially similar behaviour has different functions in different contexts, but that parental investment is shaped by the type of benefits accrued from it...|$|R

40|$|The {{impacts of}} leaf litter from genetically-modified hybrid poplar accumulating {{high levels of}} {{condensed}} tannins (proanthocyanidins) were examined in soil microcosms consisting of moss growing on sieved soil. Moss preferentially proliferated in microcosms with lower tannin content; DGGE detected increased fungal diversity in microcosms <b>with</b> low-tannin <b>litter.</b> The proportion of cloned rDNA sequences from Actinobacteria decreased <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> addition while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and α-Proteobacteria significantly increased. β–Proteobacteria were proportionally more numerous at high tannin levels. Tannins had no significant impact on overall diversity of bacterial communities analyzed with various estimators. There was an increased proportion of N-fixing bacteria corresponding to the addition of <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> low tannin levels. The addition of litter increased the proportion of Ascomycota/Basidiomycota. Dothideomycetes, Pucciniomycetes, and Tremellomycetes also increased and Agaricomycetes decreased. Agaricomycetes and Sordariomycetes were significantly more abundant in controls, whereas Pucciniomycetes increased in soil <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> from transformed trees (P = 0. 051).

40|$|Few {{mechanisms}} that determine the assemblage structure of mites have been identified. Whilst the relative abundance of soil fauna {{is known to}} change with humus form, {{the degree to which}} the quantity of litter inputs play a part in these changes has not been investigated. We tested the response of oribatid and mesostigmatid mites in litter and soil layers to increasing levels of birch Betula pubescens litter to test whether litter mass could affect the mite assemblage. Six litter treatments (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 ×natural litter mass and complete litter removal) were established in November 2004 and the soil and litter communities sampled in October 2005. Species composition of oribatids was distinct for the soil and litter. There was no apparent effect of increasing litter mass on the soil mite assemblage. In the litter layer, the number of oribatids g− 1 of litter showed a strong negative relationship <b>with</b> increasing <b>litter</b> mass whilst the number of mesostigmatids g− 1 of litter was unresponsive to litter mass. Hence, the relative abundance of these two groups altered <b>with</b> increasing <b>litter</b> mass. The response of the oribatid groups Oppiidae and Poronota followed this negative relationship <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> mass but Phthiracaridae appeared less affected. Consequently, there was a subtle shift in the relative abundance of these groups <b>with</b> increasing <b>litter</b> mass. Our results demonstrate that oribatids as a whole and within groups respond in a predictable manner to increases in litter mass whilst mesostigmatids are unresponsive. Whilst there are undoubtedly biological and physical aspects that vary <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> mass, litter mass itself, is able to explain some patterns in the assemblage of oribatid mites. ...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} has been highlighted {{as one of}} the main unknowns controlling the fate and turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) in response to climate change. How microbial community structure and function may (or may not) interact with increasing temperature to impact the fate and turnover of SOM, in particular when combined <b>with</b> changes in <b>litter</b> chemistry, is not well understood. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine if litter chemistry impacted the decomposition of soil and litter-derived carbon (C), and its interaction with temperature, and whether this response was controlled by microbial community structure and function. Fresh or pre-incubated eucalyptus leaf litter (13 C enriched) was added to a woodland soil and incubated at 12, 22, or 32 �C. We tracked the movement of litter and soilderived C into CO 2, water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), and microbial phospholipids (PLFA). The litter additions produced significant changes in every parameter measured, while temperature, interacting <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> chemistry, predominately affected soil C respiration (priming and temperature sensitivity), microbial community structure, and the metabolic quotient (a proxy for microbial carbon use efficiency [CUE]). The direction of priming varied <b>with</b> the <b>litter</b> additions (negative <b>with</b> fresh <b>litter,</b> positive <b>with</b> pre-incubated <b>litter)</b> and was related to differences in the composition of microbial communities degrading soil-C, particularly gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, resulting from litter addition. Soil-C decomposition in both litter treatments was more temperature sensitive (higher Q 10) than in the soil-only control, and soil-C priming became increasingly positive with temperature. However, microbes utilizing soil-C in the litter treatments had higher CUE, suggesting the longer-term stability of soil-C may be increased at higher temperature <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> addition. Our results show that in the same soil, the growth of distinct microbial communities can alter the turnover and fate of SOM and, in the context of global change, its response to temperature...|$|R

30|$|The equivocal {{nature of}} tree {{mortality}} in shrub patches {{may be due}} to the relatively small proportion of total fuel provided by shrubs. The surface fuel loading in the YFDP was 334.8 Mg ha− 1 (influenced by the abundance of 1000 -hour fuels and larger), <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> and duff 252.7 Mg ha− 1 (litter 63.9 Mg ha− 1, duff 188.8 Mg ha− 1; Larson et al. 2016), compared to the shrub fuel loading of 5.8 Mg ha− 1. Consumption of surface fuels, litter, and duff in the YFDP was ∼ 95 % (Larson et al. 2016). The YFDP fuel loadings were similar to those reported in other fire suppressed forests. In the Suwanee prescribed fire unit in Sequoia National Park, California, surface fuel was 50.65 Mg ha− 1 <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> and duff 179.66 Mg ha− 1 (Stephens and Finney 2002).

Consumption of fuels in all three cases was approximately 90 %. Initially, we had hypothesized that the high level of shrub cover might have provided ladder fuels that would contribute to foliar and cambial damage to trees, but the tree mortality results suggest that fuel strata other than shrubs drive fire effects in this system.|$|R
