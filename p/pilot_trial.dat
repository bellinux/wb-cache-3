40|$|Both {{the number}} and rigor ofrandomized {{controlled}} trials(RCTs) in critical care have in-creased significantly {{over the past two}} decades (1). Through classic and innovative methodologic research, practi-tioners, clinical investigators, and sponsors are appropriately demanding higher stan-dards for the evaluation of interventions in the intensive care unit. With increas-ing reliance upon national and interna-tional critical care collaboration to bring adequately powered RCTs to fruition, peer-review funding is reserved for those trials with the most well-justified study designs (2). Thus, the need for rigorous pilot studies (a term applied to back-ground projects of various study designs) and <b>pilot</b> <b>trials</b> (<b>pilot</b> studies that include a randomization procedure) are gaining recognition and endorsement from granting agencies such as the Clinical Trials Committee of the Canadian Insti-tutes for Health Research (2). Despite the increasing appeal of <b>pilot</b> <b>trials,</b> there is limited information to guide investigators on their design, implementa-tion, and interpretation. Our objectives were to synthesize key methodologic fea-tures of <b>pilot</b> <b>trials,</b> highlighting their value in informing the design of large RCTs using examples from critical care; and to pro-vide a framework for the design and in-terpretation of future <b>pilot</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R

Conclusions: <b>Pilot</b> <b>trials</b> should not simply aim to improve recruitment estimates but should also identify factors likely to influence recruitment performance in a future trial and inform the development of that <b>trial’s</b> recruitment strategies. <b>Pilot</b> <b>trials</b> are a crucial part of RCT design. Nevertheless, <b>pilot</b> <b>trials</b> are likely to be small scale, involving only a small number of sites, and contextual differences between sites are likely to impact recruitment performance in any future trial. This means that ongoing monitoring and evaluation in trials are likely to be required...|$|R

5000|$|Traditional <b>pilot</b> <b>trial</b> {{design is}} {{typically}} done by controlling type I error rate and power for detecting a specific parameter value. The {{goal of a}} <b>pilot</b> <b>trial</b> such as a phase II trial is usually not to support registration. Therefore it doesn't make sense to control type I error rate, especially a big type I error, as typically done in a phase II trial. A <b>pilot</b> <b>trial</b> usually provides evidence to support a Go/No Go decision for a confirmatory trial. Therefore {{it makes more sense}} to design a trial based on PPOS. To support a No/Go decision, traditional methods require the PPOS to be small. However the PPOS can be small just due to chance. To solve this issue, we can require the PPOS credible interval to be tight such that the PPOS calculation is supported by sufficient information and hence PPOS is not small just due to chance. Finding an optimal design is equivalent to find the solution to the following 2 equations.|$|E
