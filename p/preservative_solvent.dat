40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{response}} of three hardwoods from Ghana and a hardwood and three softwoods from the United States to liquid and gas-phase impregnation was investigated. Impregnation with liquids included a sink-float test in a water-glycerine solution and pressure treatment with a copper sulphate solution and creosote under identical treating conditions. Flow of gases through wood {{was measured with}} an air permeability test and by the movement of chloropicrin vapour, an agricultural fumigant, through the samples. The effect of physical and anatomical characteristics of each species on its treatment was investigated. Penetration and retention of treating solutions in wood samples immediately after the time of removal from the treating cylinder followed nearly identical trends for the copper sulphate and creosote. That is, a particular species of wood would have large penetration and retention of both preservative solutions compared to other species of wood, although the values for each preservative solution differed. The sapwood and heartwood of Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) from the United States gave highest penetration and retention among the hardwoods. Among the woods from Ghana, highest retention and penetration were in the sapwood and heartwood of Subaha (Mitragyna stipulosa [De Candole] 0. Kuntze). Low penetration and retention were found in Dahoma (Piptadeniastrum africanum [Hook f. ] Brenan), and very low retention and penetration were present in Kaku (Lophira alata [Banks] Gaertner). Of the softwoods, the heartwood of redwood (Sequoia sempevirens [D. Don] Endl.) retained {{the greatest amount of}} preservative and was also the best penetrated sample. Sapwood of Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) was penetrated better with preservatives and retained more preservatives than sapwood and heartwood of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsup menziesii [Mirb] Franco) but the heartwood of Ponderosa pine was the least penetrated sample and retained the smallest amount of preservative. Retentions in samples treated with copper sulphate solution were higher than retentions in creosote treated samples. Loss of <b>preservative</b> <b>solvent</b> by evaporation or bleeding of preservative solution from treated samples 7 days after treatment was directly related to the amount of preservative retained in the sample immediately after withdrawal from the treating cylinder. Retention of preservative solutions in the heartwood of hardwood species was directly related to the distribution of vessels but indirectly related to the diameter of the vessel lumen. Gum was the most important inclusion which influenced penetration and retention in the hardwood species. Retention among the softwood species was directly related to the diameter of the tracheid lumen. The release rate of chloropicrin vapour from a vial attached to the treated specimen and the subsequent time taken by the vapour to diffuse through the length of the specimen were the two treating variables measured in vapour-phase treatment. These two variables were interdependent, and their values followed almost the same pattern as the air permeability measurements in hardwoods and softwoods. Longitudinal permeability (liquid and air flow) was the only physical property of the species which was related to their preservative treatment. The extent of the relationship between values for air permeability and values for retention, penetration and vapour release was tested by applying linear regression analyses. The results showed that air permeability correlated better with the release of chloropicrin vapour than it did with preservative retention or penetration. Air permeability was a better indicator of the treatability of softwoods from the United States than the hardwoods from Ghana...|$|E

30|$|Each {{fraction}} was assayed for caseinolytic {{activity at}} 30 °C in different pH-buffered solutions from 3 to 12, prepared as follows: 100 mM Glycine-HCl (pH 2), 100 mM citrate-phosphate (pH 3 - 5), 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6 - 8), 100 mM Glycine-NaOH (pH 9 - 11), and KCl-NaOH (pH 12 - 13). The pH tolerance {{was determined by}} incubating each fraction in these buffer solutions for 16 hours at 4 °C; and after neutralization at 30 °C the remaining activity was determined (expressed as % of the activity at pH 7). In addition, the long-term storage of these enzymes was also investigated using distilled water and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 as <b>preservative</b> <b>solvents.</b> The freeze-dried enzymes were dissolved in these solvents containing 0.1 % (w/v) sodium azide, and stored in carefully-sealed glass vials at 4 °C for 10 months.

40|$|Background and purpose: 2, 4 {{dinitrophenol}} is {{the most}} important nitrophenol compound that is widely used in paints, adhesives, wood <b>preservatives,</b> <b>solvents,</b> pesticides, and explosive materials. Because of the high toxicity and non-biodegradability of 2, 4 DNP, must be prevented from entering the water body. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of ordered mesoporous carbon CMK- 3 in adsorption of 2, 4 dinitrophenol from aqueous solutions and the effect of various parameters on the performance of this process. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, mesoporous carbon, CMK- 3 was prepared using hexagonal SBA- 15 mesoporous silica in a batch reactor. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, BET and TEM. After Synthesis of CMK- 3, the effect of different parameters were investigated on adsorption process including pH (3 - 11), contact time (20 - 180 min) initial concentration of 2, 4 dinitrophenol (10 - 500 mg/L), and adsorbent dose (0. 2 - 1. 2 gr/L). Results: Removal efficiency increased when pH and initial concentration of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol decreased and contact time and adsorbant doze increased. The optimum pH was 5 and the equilibrium time was 100 minutes. The optimal dose of CMK- 3 was 0. 4 g/L and the adsorption capacity of 2, 4 dinitrophenol by CMK- 3 was 194 mg/g. Conclusion: In general, mesoporous carbon CMK- 3 showed high capacity in removal of 2, 4 dinitrophenol from aqueous solutions. Therefore, it can be used in the treatment of wastewater containing 2, 4 dinitrophenol. © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The MDR values did {{not change}} when more {{additives}} than those categorized as ‘HAZ’ or ‘CLP’ (i.e. those categorized only as ‘>  10 % STU’ or not assigned to any category based on available data) were additionally taken into account (Fig.  2 d). This finding indicates that the consideration of all additives does not improve the predictability of product toxicity, and hence is clearly not necessary. It further shows that the ‘>  10 % STU’ criterion alone is too conservative for the identification of additives as relevant for a CBA. Hence, {{with regard to the}} draft guidance definition of relevant components, this finding for seven water-based wood preservative products demonstrates that the consideration of a.s. from other product types (here: <b>preservatives)</b> and <b>solvents</b> (unless categorized as ‘HAZ’ or ‘CLP’) was not necessary to predict the overall aquatic toxicity of the product.|$|R

40|$|Aim of study: To {{determine}} {{the effect on}} wood from Pinus sylvestris of treatment with preservatives on mechanical properties and to establish {{the relation between the}} penetration and compression strenght. Area of study: Spain. Material and methods: 40 samples of defect-free wood from Pinus sylvestris L. were treated with Light Organic <b>Solvent</b> <b>Preservative</b> (Vacsol Azure WR 2601) and 50 with waterborne Copper Azole (Tanalith E 3492). 40 control samples were not treated (water or preservative). Mechanical resistance to static bending, modulus of elasticity and compression strength parallel to the grain were compared with untreated wood. Regression analysis between the penetration and compression strength parallel was done with the samples treated with waterborne preservative. Main results: The results indicate that the treated wood (with either product) presents a statistically significant increase in mechanical resistance in all three mechanical characteristics. The results obtained differ from earlier studies carried out by other authors. There was no correlation between parallel compression strength and the degree of impregnation of the wood with waterborne Copper Azole. The most probable explanation for these results concerns changes in pressure during treatment. The use of untreated control samples instead of samples treated only with water is more likely to produce significant results in the mechanical resistance studies. Research highlights: Treated wood presents a statistically significant increase in MOE, modulus of rupture to static bending and parallel compression strength. There was no correlation between parallel compression strength and the degree of impregnation with waterborne preservative...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} air {{evacuation}} on the treatability of wood using either vacuum or heating {{was determined by}} impregnating Australian grown Pines radiata (D. Don) sapwood and heartwood samples with polar and non polar preservatives. Systematic variation in vacuum and pressure levels resulted in different preservative penetration, preservative uptake and within treatment variation in uptake and penetration. Variation in vacuum and pressure levels were applied to a standard Bethell (Full cell) treatment process. The significance of the treatment results obtained was tested statistically. The statistical tools used include: analysis of variance Fisher's PLSD and regression analysis. Parameters affecting the treatability of Pinus radiata other than pressure and vacuum were also established. These include moisture content and basic density. Borax / boric acid uptake in radiata pine sapwood was found to vary with pressure, vacuum and basic density. It increased with a rise {{in each of these}} variables. Wood moisture content was insignificant in determining preservative penetration and retention in the range 10 - 20 % moisture content. Uptake of borax / boric in heartwood was affected by pressure and vacuum. The validity of previously developed unsteady state heat flow models was tested to determine their applicability in predicting temperatures at various points in the wood during heating in air by convection. In general the correlation between experimentally and theoretically determined temperatures was high. However, Siau's unsteady state heat flow theory overestimated surface temperatures {{at the beginning of the}} heating period and underestimate temperatures at the centre of the wood at the end of the heating period. The effect of temperature of wood before soaking was determined by heating radiata pine sapwood samples and a mixture of sapwood and heartwood samples in a convection oven at different temperatures prior to soaking in copper chromate arsenate (CCA) solution or light organic <b>solvent</b> <b>preservative</b> (LISP). Regression equations were used to evaluate the factors influencing the treatability of radiata pine. Absorption of CCA and LISP in radiata pine was influenced by the temperature of the wood, moisture content, basic density and soaking time. The effect of heating time on the treatability of Australian and New Zealand grown Pinus radiata and Australian grown Pinus elliottii was determined by heating end-matched samples for different periods with or without sealing in polythene bags during heat application and then soaking the wood samples in CCA. Samples were wrapped in polythene bags to minimise moisture loss during heat application. These investigations showed that in general there was a rise in uptake with increases in heating time. However, the positive effect of heating time reached an optimum point beyond which there was a fall in uptake and penetration of CCA with further increases in heating time for Australian grown Pinus radiata samples heated without sealing in polythene bags. The optimum varied with sample thickness. However, the period of heating did not have a significant effect on uptake and penetration of CCA in Australian grown Pinus radiata when samples were sealed in polythene bags. Heating time had no significant effect on Australian grown Pinus elliottii and New Zealand grown Pinus radiata. Full sapwood penetration was achieved in New Zealand grown Pinus radiata regardless of heating time and with or without sealing samples in polythene bags. Pinus elliottii sapwood could not be penetrated fully regardless of heating time. Investigations into the effect of evacuation method, by heating wood by convection or microwave energy until the wood samples reached certain temperatures at the centre, showed that microwave evacuation achieved higher preservative uptake and deeper preservative penetration. Better air evacuation was achieved when the wood was heated at low microwave power levels for extended exposure. Microwave irradiation also achieved rapid CCA fixation in radiata pine and structural modification of green S. obliqua and E. magmata. Fixation time was greatly reduced by using higher microwave power levels. Structural modification investigations of E. obliqua achieved by heating wood samples at different power levels for different times indicated substantial increases in the permeability and treatability of this normally refractory wood speciesRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|Notes: Includes: A. Natural decay {{resistance}} of wood [...] B. Laboratory evaluation of wood preservatives [...] C. Preservative tolerance of wood-destroying fungi© 1977 Dr. Edwin Warner Brandon Da CostaThe researches {{described in the}} attached papers followed a prolonged period of change and development. The initial purpose was to evaluate in the laboratory the probable durability of Australian timbers in service as poles, posts, sleepers and so on. (Papers A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4). These papers were {{at the time of}} publication more rigorous and comprehensive than any published tests. (In this connection, {{it should be noted that}} the “Progress Report” series of the Division of Forest Products were distributed to all known major research workers in the field, abstracted in major abstracting journals, and freely cited in publications. Divisional policy was at that time opposed to publication of results in scientific journals, rather than specialized reports with “targeted” distribution). They were especially notable in the variety of test fungi used; in the development of testing techniques which would allow decay in dense timbers (based on extensive so far unpublished experiments on varying technique parameters); in the use of statistical analyses; and in recognition that no single value can be assigned to “natural durability”, a theme developed in A 14, my final definitive paper on natural durability, which should be a seminal paper for future work in this field. A major contribution has been the clear understanding that weight losses in decay tests cannot have any absolute value and that tests are essentially comparative. Classification of natural durability is therefore best obtained, not by arbitrary classification on weight losses, but by close comparison with “yardstick” timbers whose durability is thoroughly familiar. (A 11, A 12, A 14). These papers, and several unpublished experiments of the same nature, contributed largely to the lists of natural durability of timbers published by the Division of Forest Products and used in Australian Standards (e. g. As 1604 – 1974, on preservation of sawn timber). Similar inter-species comparisons were later made of Papua New Guinea timbers (A 11) where information on natural durability, vital to effective utilization of mixed hardwood rain forests, was virtually absent. From this work on inter-species variation in durability, there came an interest in the causes of this variation and this was investigated for several years in collaboration with Dr. P. Rudman (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 9, A 10). The initial and critical paper in this series (A 3) was a seminal paper in being the first paper to adopt a “toxicity balance” approach, in which the decay {{resistance of}} untreated wood, of extracted wood, and of susceptible wood containing these extractives was measured. This was important because previous workers had concentrated on the toxicity of specific extractives as the explanation of durability, neglecting the possibility that the wood might still be durable after complete removal of these extractives, due to other extractives or to physical factors. My approach also took account of the detoxification of extractives during removal and of the effect of their original distribution in the wood. The paper also contained the first description of a reliable and precise technique for determining decay resistance of wood meal of a variety of species. Since adequate extraction required conversion of wood to a finely-divided form, this technique was essential and was unexpectedly difficult to develop. The general design of the work the decay technique, the decay tests and interpretation of the results were the work of the senior author. This line of work on chemical reasons for decay resistance was gradually transferred to Dr. Rudman. Because of the reputation acquired from earlier work on natural durability, work on natural durability of teak (Tectona grandee) was requested by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This was concerned with relative durability of plantation-grown and natural teak and with possible detrimental effects of high growth rates on durability. The resultant work (A 5, A 6, A 7, A 8) showed that the widely held belief that fast frown timber was less durable was, at best, only partially true. The papers were important in describing some of the few attempts to test this experimentally and in pioneering multiple regression analyses to assess the relative importance of silvicultural, factors in durability of teak and the potential importance of decay resistance testing in selection and breeding of teak and other timbers. The early stages of my research in wood pathology were confined to natural durability, but with the establishment and rapid growth of a pressure-impregnation wood preservation industry in Australia, and the world-wide need for more sophisticated treatments, my research activities changed to study of chemically enhanced decay resistance. After some preliminary investigations to solve urgent problems (B 1, B 2, B 3), they took the form of an intensive study of water-borne preservatives (especially copper-chrome-arsenic preservatives or “CCA”) and factors affecting their efficiency (B 4, B 5, B 6, B 7, B 16, B 19); and also a study of factors affecting the performance of Australian [?] (B 8, B 10, B 11, B 12, B 18, B 20). CCA studies were important as being the most comprehensive studies to that date of fixed water-borne preservatives (B 6) and as the first to discuss the effect of wood substrate on preservative performance (B 7), a topic of international recognition in the 1970 ’s. My demonstration of the enormous variation in CCA tolerance of basidiomycete wood-destroying fungi (C 1) led to a fundamental study of fungal tolerance (c 4, C 5, C 6). This included the original discovery that basidiomycete cultures could be dedikaryotized by toxic agents (C 2, C 3) a discovery of considerable importance to general biology and experimental fungal taxonomy, as well as to wood pathology (C 5). My later discovery that the toxic effects of arsenic could be antidote by phosphate (B 16, C 7, C 8, B 19, B 21) is also one of fundamental importance to general biology, as well as to wood pathology, especially to techniques of standard testing of wood preservatives (C 7, C 8). The research on creosote established conclusively that removal of phenols from low temperature creosotes lowered their efficiency and led directly to a revision of the Standards Association of Australia specification for creosote (despite considerable opposition from manufacturers). The work on use of propylene oxide for sterilization (B 10, B 11) had important implications in view of its widespread use in laboratory tearing (e. g. in British Standard 338; 1961). I was probably the first worker to use propylene oxide as a sterilant for wood specimens (B 3, C 1) and have much unpublished data on its use, as well as the best statement to date (B 11) of its limitations. Apart from work on CCA and on creosotes, I studied various organic <b>solvent</b> <b>preservatives</b> (B 9, B 13 < B 14) and also studied the use of special techniques for preservation of plywood (B 15, B 17). In general, these papers are regarded as making a substantial contribution to the science of wood pathology and of biodeterioration as well as having had some influence in the application of wood preservation technology in Australia and overseas. Many of the papers (e. g. A 1, A 3, A 8, A 10, A 11, A 14, B 6, B 9, B 17, B 20, C 1, C 2, C 5, C 6, C 7) introduced novel concepts and techniques.
