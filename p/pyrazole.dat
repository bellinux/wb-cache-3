25|$|Most CB1 antagonists {{reported}} so far {{are close}} analogs or isosteres of rimonabant. A general CB1 inverse agonist pharmacophore model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (Figure 4). This pharmacophore contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. <b>pyrazole</b> in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic lipophilic part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In Figure 4 rimonabant is used as an example. Unit A represents a 4-chlorophenyl group and unit B a 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring. Unit C is the central <b>pyrazole</b> ring and unit D represents the carbonyl group which serves as the hydrogen bond acceptor. Unit E represents a lipophilic aminopiperidinyl moiety.|$|E
25|$|SR147778 (surinabant), {{a second}} {{generation}} antagonist, has a longer duration of action than rimonabant and enhanced oral activity. This enhanced duration {{of action is}} {{probably due to the}} presence of the more metabolically stable ethyl group at the 4-position of its <b>pyrazole</b> ring. Another change is the replacement of the 5-phenyl chlorine substituent by bromine.|$|E
25|$|Several {{research}} groups have studied six-membered ring <b>pyrazole</b> bioisosteres.

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 8 th November 2001 This report shows the importance of Principal Component Analysis for grouping types of products observed when α-acylenaminoketones K 1 –K 3 react with four substituted hydrazine nucleophiles in five organic solvents. The reactions were carried out {{with the goal of}} obtaining substituted <b>pyrazoles</b> and determining which of the carbonyls would preferentially be attacked by the nucleophile.

25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to increase the affinity of the diarylpyrazole derivatives by rigidifying the structure of rimonabant. In terms of the general pharmacophore model the units A, B and/or C are connected by additional bonds leading to rigid molecules. For example, the condensed polycyclic <b>pyrazole</b> NESS-0327 showed 5000 times more affinity for the CB1 receptor than rimonabant. However, this compound possesses a poor central bioavailability.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{favorable}} {{to have a}} ring substitution at the 3-carboxamide group, such as the 1-piperidinyl group in rimonabant. Replacement of the amino piperidinyl substituent by alkyl amides, ethers, ketones, alcohols or alkanes resulted mostly in decreased affinity. Replacement of the piperidinyl by pentyl or a heptyl chain gave the compounds agonistic properties. Based on these results {{it was concluded that}} the <b>pyrazole</b> 3-position seems to be involved in agonism, while the 1-,4-,5-positions appear to be involved in antagonism.|$|E
25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, <b>pyrazole,</b> oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E
