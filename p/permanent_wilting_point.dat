40|$|<b>Wilting</b> <b>point</b> is an {{important}} parameter indicating the inhibition of plant transpiration processes, which is essential for green infrastructure. Generalization of <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> is very essential for analyzing the performance of even green infrastructure (green roof, biofiltration units) and ecological infrastructure (wetlands). <b>Wilting</b> <b>point</b> of various species {{is known to be}} affected by the factors such as soil clay content, soil organic matter, slope of soil water characteristic curve at inflection point (i. e., s index) and fractal dimension.

This study proposes the <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> model development task based on optimization approach of Genetic programming (GP) with respect to the input variables (soil clay content, soil organic matter, s-index and fractal dimension) for various type of soils. The GP model developed is further investigated by sensitivity and parametric analysis to discover the relationships between <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> and input variables and the dominant inputs. Based on newly developed model, it was found that <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> increases with fractal dimension while behaves highly non-linear with respect to clay and organic content.

In the USA, Gupta and Larson (1979) developed 12 functions relating particle-size distribution and organic matter content to water content at potentials ranging from -4 kPa to -1500 kPa.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} element of his work was {{in the field of}} soil-water-plant relations, and led to the standardisation of characteristic soil-water properties. Together with scientists at the USDA Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, Richards correlated water content at certain water potential values with then current soil water parameters. The currently accepted moisture potential values defining the lower and upper limits for plant growth; at field capacity (−1/3 bar, or −33 J/kg) and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> (−15 bar, or −1500 J/kg) were determined through experimental work by Richards and his colleagues.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{potential}} of 0 kPa, soil is {{in a state}} of saturation. At saturation, all soil pores are filled with water, and water typically drains from large pores by gravity. At {{a potential}} of −33 kPa, or −1/3 bar, (−10 kPa for sand), soil is at field capacity. Typically, at field capacity, air is in the macropores and water in micropores. Field capacity is viewed as the optimal condition for plant growth and microbial activity. At a potential of −1500 kPa, soil is at its <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point,</b> meaning that soil water is held by solid particles as a [...] "water film" [...] that is retained too tightly to be taken up by plants.|$|E

Drought resistant genotypes showed high relative water content in stress environment as compared to susceptible ones. They also took relatively longer time to wilt, consequently showing low soil water content at wilting and lower biomass reductions under moisture stress conditions. A significant negative correlation was obtained between days to <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> and relative water with biomass reduction.

50|$|If {{the water}} {{potential}} (or strictly, water vapour potential) inside a leaf {{is higher than}} outside, the water vapour will diffuse out of the leaf down this gradient. This loss of water vapour from the leaves is called transpiration, and the water vapour diffuses through the open stomata. Transpiration is natural and inevitable for plants, and much water is lost through this process. However, {{it is vital that}} plants living in dry conditions are adapted so as to reduce this water loss and decrease the size of the open stomata, in order to reduce unnecessary loss from the plant. It is important for a plant living in these conditions to conserve water because, without enough water, plant cells lose turgor. This is known as plasmolysis. If the plant loses too much water, it will pass its <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point,</b> and die.|$|E

50|$|Plinthite is a redoximorphic {{feature in}} highly {{weathered}} soil. The product of pedogenesis, it commonly occurs as dark red redox concretions that usually form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to irregular soil aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, {{especially if it}} is also exposed to heat from the sun. The lower boundary of a zone in which plinthite occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, {{but it may be}} abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Generally, plinthite forms in a soil horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concretions. These concretions are not considered plinthite unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying.

40|$|The plant <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> is {{generally}} believed to occur at a matric potential value of - 1500 kPa for all plant species in all environments. In this study, I strive {{to illustrate how}} varied the plant <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> can actually be and to show how using a constant value for all species may {{be a source of}} error. Matric potential values are determined through the use of the van Genuchten soil water characteristic curves, where each soil has its own curve. Additionally, the maximum depth of the groundwater table was studied. The maximum depth was determined based on the rooting depth of the plant species and the height of the capillary fringe water at the plant <b>wilting</b> <b>point.</b> Since no acceptable calculation for capillary fringe height at plant wilting could be found in the literature, my own technique is presented here.

Then, a relationship between the volumetric water content at the plant <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> and the capillary fringe height was developed and employed. Summing the rooting depth and the capillary fringe height resulted in the maximum depth of the groundwater table. Data was collected through a literature review and was categorized based on twelve soil types, four ecoregions, and three vegetation classes. These categories allowed me to identify patterns within subsets of data points. Based on these patterns, guidance tables for managing the groundwater table depth are presented...|$|R

To measure field capacity and <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> is expensive, laborious and is time consuming, so, frequently, matemath-ic models, called pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) are utilized to estimate field capacity and <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> through physical-chemical soil characteristics.

In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established {{from a pool of}} 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained in general by bi-annual weeding and mowing. Since 2010, plot size was reduced to 5 x 6 m and plots were weeded three times per year. Field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> at 10, 20 and 30 cm depth were derived from soil texture data of 2002 and bulk density 2006 by using pedotransfer functions. Soil texture was determined from undisturbed soil cores at 27 locations distributed throughout the experimental site in spring 2002 before plot establishment. Soil cores were taken to 100 cm depth and separated in depth increments with a resolution of ten cm from ground level to 40 cm depth and 20 cm from 40 cm to 100 cm depth. The bulk material was passed through a sieve with 2 mm mesh size and only fine soil was used for the investigation of soil texture. Grain size fractions according to DIN 19683 - 2 for every sample were then determined at the laboratory for geoecology of Jena University by a combined sieve and hydrometer analysis. Values for each plot were interpolated by ordinary kriging and the interpolated values were used for the investigation of field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point.</b> Soil bulk density was determined from undisturbed soil samples to a depth of 30 cm. Three soil cores per plot were taken with a split tube sampler with an inner diameter of 4. 8 cm and separated in depth increments of five cm. The bulk material was passed through a sieve with 2 mm mesh size, dried to constant weight at 40 °C and subsequently weighed to calculate the density. The determination of field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> was based on pedotransfer functions described in Zacharias and Wessolek (2007).
