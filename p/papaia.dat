60|$|For {{the rest}} of the day, on the greater heights, they lay in a lava glen where terraced taro and <b>papaia</b> grew. And here Grief made his plans and learned the fulness of the situation.|$|E
60|$|Of humans {{about the}} low bungalow-like house, there were many; but one only of them slept. The rest {{were on the}} tense tiptoes of silence. At {{the rear of the}} house a tiny babe piped up a thin blatting wail that the quickly thrust breast could not appease. The mother, a slender hapa-haole (half-white), clad in a loose- flowing holoku of white muslin, hastened away swiftly among the banana and <b>papaia</b> trees to remove the babe's noise by distance. Other women, hapa-haole and full native, watched her anxiously as she fled.|$|E

"Well, if {{you must}} know, I found a tin of {{mushrooms}} and a package of egg-powder which had fallen down behind the locker, {{and there are other}} things as well that will go into it. But don't interrupt. Boiled yam, fried taro, alligator pear salad--there, you've got me all mixed, Then I found a last delectable half-pound of dried squid. There will be baked beans Mexican, if I can hammer it into Toyama's head; also, baked <b>papaia</b> with Marquesan honey, and, lastly, a wonderful pie the secret of which Toyama refuses to divulge." ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{continued}} to draw nearer to the rain, trees began to be mingled with the shrubs; and we came at last to where a house stood in an orchard of <b>papaias,</b> with their palm-like growth and collar of green gourds. In an out-house stood the water-barrel, that necessity of Kona life. For all the water comes from heaven, and must be caught and stored; {{and the name of}} Hookena itself may very well imply a cistern and a cup of water for the traveller along the coast. The house belonged to Nahinu, but was in occupation by an American, seeking to make butter there (if I understood) without success. The butterman was gone, to muse perhaps on fresh expedients; his house was closed; and I was able to observe his three chambers only through the windows. In the first were milk pans and remains of breakfast, in the second a bed; in the third a scanty wardrobe hung from pegs, and two pirated novels lay on the floor. One was reversed and could not be identified; the name of the other I made out. It was Little Loo. Happy Mr. Clark Russell, making life pleasant for the exile in his garden of <b>papaias,</b> high over sea, upon the forest edge, and where the breeze comes freely.|$|R
60|$|The days passed, but the {{abundance}} did not diminish. On {{the day of}} departure, canoe after canoe put off to us. Tehei brought cucumbers and a young <b>papaia</b> tree burdened with splendid fruit. Also, for me he brought a tiny, double canoe with fishing apparatus complete. Further, he brought fruits and vegetables with the same lavishness as at Tahaa. Bihaura brought various special presents for Charmian, such as silk-cotton pillows, fans, and fancy mats. The whole population brought fruits, flowers, and chickens. And Bihaura added a live sucking pig. Natives whom I did not remember ever having seen before strayed over the rail and presented me with such things as fish-poles, fish-lines, and fish-hooks carved from pearl-shell.|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{he began}} to win out. A grass-walled house was built. On the fertile, {{volcanic}} soil he had wrested from the jungle and jungle beasts were growing five hundred cocoanut trees, five hundred <b>papaia</b> trees, three hundred mango trees, many breadfruit trees and alligator-pear trees, {{to say nothing of}} vines, bushes, and vegetables. He developed the drip of the hills in the canyons and worked out an efficient irrigation scheme, ditching the water from canyon to canyon and paralleling the ditches at different altitudes. His narrow canyons became botanical gardens. The arid shoulders of the hills, where formerly the blazing sun had parched the jungle and beaten it close to earth, blossomed into trees and shrubs and flowers. Not only had the Nature Man become self-supporting, but he was now a prosperous agriculturist with produce to sell to the city- dwellers of Papeete.|$|E
60|$|The boy merely {{peered into}} the house as he passed around it to the rear, and he saw his father and mother, at {{opposite}} corners, sleeping without covering, and, {{in the middle of}} the floor, his four naked brothers and sisters curled together in a tangle like a litter of puppies. All about the house, which in truth was scarcely more than an animal lair, was an earthly paradise. The air was spicily and sweetly heavy with the scents of wild aromatic plants and gorgeous tropic blooms. Overhead three breadfruit trees interlaced their noble branches. Banana and plantain trees were burdened with great bunches of ripening fruit. And huge, golden melons of the <b>papaia,</b> ready for the eating, globuled directly from the slender-trunked trees not one-tenth the girth of the fruits they bore. And, for Jerry, most delightful of all, there was the gurgle and plash of a brooklet that pursued its invisible way over mossy stones under a garmenture of tender and delicate ferns. No conservatory of a king could compare with this wild wantonness of sun-generous vegetation.|$|E
60|$|The far head of Kalalau Valley {{had been}} well chosen as a refuge. Except Kiloliana, who knew back-trails up the precipitous walls, no man could win to the gorge save by {{advancing}} across a knife-edged ridge. This passage was {{a hundred yards}} in length. At best, it was a scant twelve inches wide. On either side yawned the abyss. A slip, and to right or left the man would fall to his death. But once across he would find himself in an earthly paradise. A sea of vegetation laved the landscape, pouring its green billows from wall to wall, dripping from the cliff-lips in great vine-masses, and flinging a spray of ferns and air-plants in to the multitudinous crevices. During the many months of Koolau's rule, he and his followers had fought with this vegetable sea. The choking jungle, with its riot of blossoms, had been driven back from the bananas, oranges, and mangoes that grew wild. In little clearings grew the wild arrowroot; on stone terraces, filled with soil scrapings, were the taro patches and the melons; and in every open space where the sunshine penetrated were <b>papaia</b> trees burdened with their golden fruit.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the house}} {{stood on the}} {{mountain}} side, visible to ships. Above, the forest ran up into the clouds of rain; below, the black lava fell in cliffs, where the kings of old lay buried. A garden bloomed about that house with every hue of flowers; {{and there was an}} orchard of <b>papaia</b> {{on the one hand and}} an orchard of breadfruit on the other, and right in front, toward the sea, a ship’s mast had been rigged up and bore a flag. As for the house, it was three storeys high, with great chambers and broad balconies on each. The windows were of glass, so excellent that it was as clear as water and as bright as day. All manner of furniture adorned the chambers. Pictures hung upon the wall in golden frames: pictures of ships, and men fighting, and of the most beautiful women, and of singular places; nowhere in the world are there pictures of so bright a colour as those Keawe found hanging in his house. As for the knick-knacks, they were extraordinary fine; chiming clocks and musical boxes, little men with nodding heads, books filled with pictures, weapons of price from all quarters of the world, and the most elegant puzzles to entertain the leisure of a solitary man. And as no one would care to live in such chambers, only to walk through and view them, the balconies were made so broad that a whole town might have lived upon them in delight; and Keawe knew not which to prefer, whether the back porch, where you got the land breeze, and looked upon the orchards and the flowers, or the front balcony, where you could drink the wind of the sea, and look down the steep wall of the mountain and see the Hall going by once a week or so between Hookena and the hills of Pele, or the schooners plying up the coast for wood and ava and bananas.|$|E

40|$|The {{coating of}} papayas with Cassava Starch (CS) and {{carboxymethyl}} starch (CMS) {{is an alternative}} to extend the shelf life of these fruits. This study evaluated {{the effect of the}} three different levels of CS and CMS (1, 3, and 5 %) on sensory characteristics of papayas during storage. Nine selected and trained assessors evaluated 13 sensory attributes using the Multiple Comparison Test. The appearance and flavor attributes of the papayas treated with CS and CMS were compared to the control or reference sample (R - fruit without coating) using a nine-point scale, which varied from 1 : less intense than R; 5 : equal to R; 9 : more intense than R. The samples were coded with three digit numbers and evaluated with repetition by a panel of assessors. In general, appearance was more affected by the coatings than flavor. Fruits coated with 3 and 5 % of both coatings kept the green color longer than the other coating’s concentrations, and at 5 % the color of the fruits was less uniform on the last evaluation day. The 3 and 5 % CS coating gave greater brightness to the fruits. 5 % CMS favored the presence of fungi and damaged the fruit surface at the 14 th day of storage. The CS coating at 5 % presented peeled surface during all experimental time. Changes in fruits’ flavor were perceived at the 12 th and 14 th days of storage. A less characteristic flavor and a bitter taste were noticed in the fruits coated with CS and CMS at 5 % at the 12 th day of storage. O revestimento de mamões por Fécula de Mandioca (FM) e carboximetilamido (CMA) é uma alternativa que visa prolongar a vida de prateleira dos frutos. Este estudo avaliou o efeito de três diferentes níveis de FM e CMA (1, 3 e 5 %) nas características sensoriais de mamão <b>papaia</b> durante o armazenamento. Nove provadores selecionados e treinados avaliaram 13 atributos sensoriais através do teste de comparação múltipla. Os atributos de aparência e sabor dos mamões tratados com FM e CMA foram comparados com a referência (R - sem revestimento) usando escalas de nove pontos, as quais variaram de 1 : menos intenso que R; 5 : igual a R; 9 : mais intenso que R. As amostras foram codificadas com número de três dígitos e avaliadas com repetição pelos provadores. Em geral, a aparência dos frutos foi mais afetada que o sabor pelos revestimentos utilizados. Frutos revestidos a 3 e 5 % de FM e CMA apresentaram coloração verde por mais tempo, mas a 5 % a cor foi menos uniforme no último dia de avaliação. Os revestimentos de FM a 3 e 5 % conferiram maior brilho aos frutos. O CMA a 5 % favoreceu a presença de fungos e injúrias na superfície no 14 º dia de armazenamento. O revestimento de FM a 5 % apresentou descascamento durante todo o período experimental. Alterações no sabor dos frutos foram percebidas aos 12 º e 14 º dias de armazenamento. Sabor menos característico e gosto amargo foram identificados nos frutos revestidos por FM e CMA a 5 % no 12 º dia de armazenamento...|$|E
