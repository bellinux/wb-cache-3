40|$|As {{improving}} {{milk production}} and milk composition {{is always a}} tough problem in dairy cows industry, research on the genomics that related to milk production traits and regulation technique are important to design feed ingredients and study new feedstuffs. Recently many papers reported QTL for the major milk <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> (fat and protein concentration (%), protein, fat and milk yield, and somatic cell score). Here we summarized a quantitative trait loci (QTL) map for dairy <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> and also gave {{an overview of the}} most common non-antibiotic feed additives, probiotics, DCAD, enzymes and plant-derived products including saponins, tannins and essential oils. This yields a comprehensive contemplation of the reviewed studies targeted on QTL related to milk yield and non-antibiotic feed additives to enhance further research in dairy cow industry.

Association of ev genes with <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> differences was studied in White Leghorns free of exogenous ALV. The Cornell Strain K and S chickens used in Experiment 1 had multiple ev genes. In each of four lines of chickens in Experiment 2, there was a 1 : 1 segregation of full-sibs free of ev genes and those carrying one ev gene: ev- 12 mat produces the complete endogenous virus, ev- 3 or ev- 6 that express certain viral antigens, or ev- 1, a silent gene. In Experiment 1, the presence of genes ev- 10 or ev- 19, known to produce the complete virus, was associated with a 9 % reduction in the annual egg production rate (P< 05) in Strain S. Similarly, the presence of the virus-producing ev- 12 in Experiment 2 was associated with an 8 % reduction of annual egg production rate (P< 05), a 2. 2 -g reduction in egg weight (P< 01), and a. 003 reduction in egg specific gravity (P< 01). No significant effects of ev genes on age at first egg, Haugh unit score, percentage of eggs with blood spots, and body weight of hens were observed.

In selection process of candidate tress, genetic diversity plays very important role because higher genetic diversity will give higher opportunity to get source of genes for improved trait. Selection activities of high resin yielder candidates were started in 2006 through a series of survey activity and morphological identification of candidate trees with high resin production. Specific information about traits genetically related to resin production in Cijambu Seedling Seed Orchard is still not determined yet, although based on resin distribution trend this SSO has the highest mean of resin production. In this study, progenies planted in 1978 - 1983 were evaluated to determine the effectiveness of previous selection, as well as the value of heritability and phenotypic traits that allegedly related with resin production. The results showed high value of coefficient genetic variation (CVG: 16. 08 %), narrow sense heritability values for resin <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> (0. 65) and resemble with previous research. This indicates that genetic factor was dominant for resin production and selection activities has been done for 30 years was effective to get high yielder superior candidate.

Restricted maximum likelihood with a bivariate model was used for estimation genetic parameters, including fixed effects of herd-year of classification, period of classification, classifier and stage of lactation for linear type traits and herd-year of calving, season of calving and lactation order effects for <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The age of cow at calving was fitted as a covariate (with linear and quadratic terms), common to both models. Heritability estimates varied from 0. 09 to 0. 38 for linear type traits and from 0. 17 to 0. 24 for <b>production</b> <b>traits,</b> indicating sufficient genetic variability to achieve genetic gain through selection. In general, estimates of genetic correlations between type and <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were low, except for udder texture and angularity that showed positive genetic correlations (> 0. 29) with MY, FY, and PY.

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, including the A 59 V in exon 3 and Sau 3 AI in intron 2. The genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies were estimated. Statistical analysis revealed that the A 59 V polymorphism significantly affected the milk, protein, and fat yield (P ≤ 0. 01, P ≤ 0. 05, respectively) with C as a desirable allele. No associations were observed between the Sau 3 AI polymorphism and the traits analysed in this study. However, cows with the CC/TT haplotype were characterised by a significantly lower milk fat content compared with cows with other haplotypes. The results indicated that selection for the A 59 V CC and CT animals might contribute to increase in milk yield as well as fat and protein yields in Jersey cattle.

40|$|Age at puberty is an {{important}} <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> in beef cattle where heifers are bred to calve at 2 years of age, especially when a restricted breeding season is used. It is not only important that heifers breed and conceive, but, for maximum efficiency, they should breed and conceive early in the breeding season. Thus, age at puberty may be {{an important}} selection trait for identifying breeds most suited for efficient utilization of feed resources. Several researchers have demonstrated large differences among breed or breed cross in age at puberty of heifers. Other researchers have demonstrated that undernutrition may result in increased age at puberty, subnormal conception rate, and underdeveloped udders. Overfeeding, however,may result in weak heat symptoms, subnormal conception rate, high embryonic mortality, decreased mammary gland development, and decreased milk production. Thus, proper nutrition during the developmental period may have both short and long term effects on heifer productivity.

40|$|The {{production}} environment {{is known to}} have a large influence on extensively managed beef cows. A better understanding {{of the relationship between the}} beef cow and her environment should be useful in the pursuit of improving beef cow efficiency. The influence of the {{production environment}} on the efficiency of extensively managed Bonsmara cows was investigated through a series of research objectives. It was found that VEGMAP’s bioregion classification system can be used to describe the South African beef production regions. The environmental characteristics with the potential to influence beef cow efficiency were identified as temperature, rainfall, cation exchange capacity, soil pH, soil organic carbon, soil P and grazing capacity. A dataset was created that contains the historical cow production records for every Bonsmara breeder. GIS tools were then used to link the cow production records with the production region in which the farm is located, as well as the environmental characteristics for that specific location. The combined dataset was then statistically analysed to investigate the research objectives. The influence of the geographic location, production region and breeder on Bonsmara <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> was investigated by cluster analysis and ANOVA. Results from ANOVA indicate that production region has a statistically significant (p < 0. 05) influence on <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The influence of the breeders on the same <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> was, however, statistically much larger (p < 0. 0001) than production region. Bonsmara <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> are therefore influenced to a greater extent by the breeders rather than production environment. Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the influence of the combined environment on <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The combined environment has a statistically significant (p < 0. 0001) influence on all the <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The results indicate that the extent of the influence of the environment on production change through the growth curve. The environment’s influence was the greatest at weaning (9 %) and yearling age (10 %). Bonsmara weaning and yearling weights therefore show the largest potential for manipulation through management. The influence of individual environmental characteristics on all the Bonsmara cow <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> was then investigated by the same stepwise regression analysis. Most of the environmental characteristics were found to have a statistically significant (p < 0. 0001) influence on the <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> Rainfall and temperature had the largest influence on Bonsmara <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The negative influence of rainfall was attributed to the influence of rainfall on the quality of the grazing. The influence of temperature on <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> was small. The small negative influence of temperature could indicate that Bonsmara cows are well adapted to the main South African beef production regions. Finally, the relationship between Bonsmara cow size and reproduction was investigated by linear regression analysis. Results indicate that larger Bonsmara cows are to some extent more reproductive than smaller cows. The study confirmed that production environment influences beef cow efficiency. Bonsmara breeders however have a much larger influence on the efficiency of their cows through the implementation of management practices and breeding objectives.

The principle {{is based on the}} fact that variability within genes coding for protein products involved in key physiological mechanisms and metabolic pathways directly or indirectly involved in determining an economic trait (e. g. feed efficiency, muscle mass accretion, reproduction efficiency, disease resistance, etc.) might probably explain a fraction of the genetic variability for the <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> itself. Growth hormone (GH) and myostatin (MSTN) genes play important roles in animal growth, development and muscle mass accretion.

In addition to antibodies we also measured in vitro lymphocyte proliferation {{as a measure of}} cell-mediated immunity (CMI), zymosan-induced reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production as a measure of phagocytosis, and BW gain as a measure of <b>production</b> <b>trait.</b> In general, significantly higher antibody responses to KLH and natural antigens were found in the H line as compared to the other two lines. Specific antibody re-sponses to KLH were not significantly affected by CS, but an acute transient increase in natural antibody titers to ovalbumin was found in H line birds subjected to 1 d (Key words: adaptation, chicken, cold stress, immune response...|$|E
40|$|A {{spreadsheet}} {{model was}} constructed {{to describe the}} change in allelic frequency over time for a lethal recessive mutation in an animal population. The model allowed relative fitness to differ between genotypes, between sexes, and over time. Whereas a lethal recessive allele is naturally eliminated very slowly from a population, a small selective disadvantage of the heterozygote results in a large increase {{in the rate of}} elimination. With selective advantage of the heterozygote through linkage with a <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> or pleiotropy, the allele is never naturally eliminated but tends toward a stable equilibrium frequency. The model was used to investigate various alternative control programs based on the detection of heterozygotes by genotyping and their exclusion from breeding. The programs (genotyping males only, genotyping males and 50 % of females, and genotyping all breeding animals) were modeled for various initial heterozygote frequencies, and the results were described {{in terms of the number}} of generations, number of tests, and number of culls required to reduce the heterozygote frequency to a predefined level. The model can be used to compare the feasibility and cost of various control strategies and to illustrate clearly to breeders the expected outcomes, as well as the danger of prematurely terminating a control program when there is a selective advantage of the heterozygote...|$|E
40|$|Selecting {{animals for}} their {{resistance}} to diseases {{is a way}} to improve their health and welfare and reduces the need for veterinary treatment. The objectives of this study were to estimate: i) the genetic parameters for simple visually assessed disease syndromes, and for a composite trait of resistance to infectious disease including all disease syndromes, ii) their genetic correlations with <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> Clinical signs were recorded during weighing at 63 or 70 days of age on above 150, 000 rabbits of two commercial paternal rabbit lines (HYPLUS) of the French breeding company Hypharm. Disease traits were: digestive syndromes, respiratory syndromes, infectious syndromes (a composite trait including digestive and respiratory syndromes), and infectious mortality. The <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were body weight and carcass yield at 63 or 70 days of age. The heritabilities were low for disease traits (0. 01 to 0. 08 ± 0. 01), and moderate for <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> The genetic correlations between digestive and respiratory syndromes were slightly negative (- 0. 18 ± 0. 07). The genetic correlations between the composite infectious disease trait and digestive or respiratory syndromes were moderate (0. 65 ± 0. 04 and 0. 61 ± 0. 04, respectively). Genetic correlations between disease and <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were either null or favorable. Our results indicate {{that it is possible to}} select rabbits using visually assessed disease syndromes without the need for a trade-off between health and <b>production</b> <b>traits.</b> Using a composite criterion that includes all infectious syndromes is a promising way to improve the general disease resistance in rabbits...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on 373 lactation records from 126 does of New Zealand White rabbit (NZW) breed to assess the effects of genetic and non-genetic factors affecting milk <b>production.</b> Milk <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> (g) of each doe were recorded during the 1 st week (MP 1), 2 nd week (MP 2), 3 rd week (MP 3) and 4 th week (MP 4) week of lactation and during the whole lactation (TMY). A repeatability animal model was used based on covariance analysis model. Means of milk yield were increased gradually from the 1 st week up to the 3 rd week of lactation, and then declined in the 4 th week. Most of milk <b>production</b> <b>traits,</b> generally, increased with the advancement of parity from the 1 st to 3 rd parity, then relatively decreased from 3 rd to 5 th parity and increased again to reach the peak at 7 th parity. Effect of the linear regression coefficient of milk production at certain week of lactation on their litter size at that week was significant (P< 0. 01) for all the studied traits. Percentages of direct additive genetic effects for milk <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were mostly low and the highest percent was 5. 3 % for MP 3, followed by MP 1 (3. 7 %). Percentages of permanent environmental effects were higher during the 1 st week of lactation (8. 2 %) and gradually decreased thereafter to reach the minimum during the 3 rd week (0. 5 %). Heritability estimates for milk <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were low and ranged from 0. 001 for TMY to 0. 05 for MP 3. Repeatability estimates for milk <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were also low and ranged from 0. 002 for TMY to 0. 119 for MP 1. Milk production during the 3 rd week of lactation is closely correlated with total milk yield (0. 84; P< 0. 01). In general, the same trends for permanent environmental correlations between milk <b>production</b> <b>traits</b> were obtained...|$|R
