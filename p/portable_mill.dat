50|$|Sawmill workers (1963-1971) also {{lived there}} until mill {{operations}} ceased though steady changes in logging operations meant constantly fluctuating population numbers for Chilanko Forks, at least along the roads near to, or leading to, the airbase. Beginning in 1963 Pinnette and Therrien of Williams Lake began logging operations around nearby Puntzi Lake and a <b>portable</b> <b>mill</b> was {{used throughout the}} area. Eventually sited at the extreme eastern end of the lake, the operation ran until August 1964 when it relocated to a spot about fifty kilometers back north into the bush at Chezacut. Following a particularly severe winter, with temperatures as extreme as 70 degrees F below zero, Pinnette and Therrien transferred their operation back to Chilanko Forks. The mill was then situated at the junction of the old highway and the base access road near Skinner Bridge (a name which has since evolved into Skinny Bridge - even though the bridge itself no longer exists). Relocation was undertaken in March 1965. It was {{at this time that}} Pinnette and Therrien phased out its logging operation in the area in favour of contracting the work to Illnicki Logging of Williams Lake. In 1966 a planer mill was added to the operation. In 1971 operations ceased.|$|E

50|$|The {{more common}} use, however, {{is in the}} {{production}} of specialty timber products not readily available through lumber yards. The most common ways they are used to generate an income are - sawing lumber for customers as a mobile service, cutting and selling lumber locally, and cutting lumber that is directly used to create a final product. <b>Portable</b> <b>mills</b> are particularly effective for truing up logs for use in log building, replacing the traditional use of a drawknife, which is inordinately time-consuming. They are also used for low-volume production of specialty hardwoods used in furniture, and can be used to produce the large timbers used in post-and-beam framing techniques.|$|R
50|$|The land {{on which}} Fowlers Hollow State Park sits was clear cut during the early 1900s (decade). The Perry Lumber Company built a narrow-gauge {{railroad}} on the former Path Valley Railroad bed from New Germantown {{to the area of}} what is now Big Spring State Forest Picnic Area. The lumber company never built a permanent sawmill in the area. Instead they used five <b>portable</b> <b>mills.</b> Lumber was cut and bark was stripped from the hemlock. The standing lumber was quickly exhausted and logging operations were complete in the area by 1905. The state of Pennsylvania bought 2573 acre from the Perry Lumber Company in 1907. Construction of the park facilities took place during the Great Depression by works of the Works Progress Administration.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} of Baynes Lake began along {{the shores of}} Baynes Lake in 1896.

Many of the remaining residents were farmers or worked in the new <b>portable</b> <b>mills</b> of the area. With flooding of Kootenay River valley to accommodate the Libby Dam in Montana, several families who had been displaced by the rising waters were relocated to small building lots in Baynes Lake.|$|R

40|$|As {{many farmers}} know, {{agricultural}} lime {{can be used}} to correct soil acidification, with the aluminium and manganese toxicity that goes with it, and the poor yields that result. Lime is an inexpensive mineral and in Zambia it is found throughout the country. The greatest expense for this important agricultural input is transportation, making localised lime production a promising avenue for cutting costs. With this in mind, the Technology Development and Advisory Unit (TDAU) of the University of Zambia joined up with the British Geological Society on a project called Local Development of Affordable Lime in Southern Africa. The scheme aimed to develop low-cost, small-scale production of lime for agriculture and water treatment. In response to the challenge, TDAU engineers have developed a <b>portable</b> hammer <b>mill,</b> which was originally used to mill grain and has now been modified to mill minerals, in this case agricultural lime. To date, more than a dozen Zambian farmers and entrepreneurs have bought <b>portable</b> hammer <b>mills</b> and set up mobile production units of lime for their own use or for sale to local communities. Business owners wanting to manufacture <b>portable</b> hammer <b>mills</b> can enter into an agreement with the TDAU. The market price is about 1, 860 per unit.

50|$|Portable sawmills are sawmills {{small enough}} to be moved easily and {{set up in the}} field. They have existed for over 100 years but grew in {{popularity}} in the United States starting in the 1970s, when the 1973 oil crisis and the back-to-the-land movement had led to renewed interest in small woodlots and in self-sufficiency.

50|$|In 1863, George Lucy bought five {{acres of}} land {{on the site of}} Diana's Bath. The Lucy family had built a sawmill {{in the middle of the}} {{cascading}} waterfalls. During the year 1890, the owner George Lucy began to notice that his property was attracting tourists. In response to this new flow of tourists he built a boarding house that was three stories tall. His business was not as successful as he thought it would be, because of the other major hotels in the surrounding area. In the 1930s the family moved from having a sawmill to having a concrete dam with turbines. The family abandoned the site when the invention of <b>portable</b> <b>mills</b> was introduced and they could now use it when they moved from timber harvest site to the next. Mr. DeSimone purchased the remaining land and used it till the 1950s, when he eventually sold it to the government. This is when the land became National Forest land and the remaining buildings were torn down.|$|R

40|$|The {{sawmilling}} industry within North Queensland, Australia {{has traditionally}} processed a {{diverse range of}} high quality rainforest cabinet timbers from locally occurring tropical rainforests. Over 100 species are suitable for milling, many of which produce highly prized timber for cabinet work and flooring. The sawmilling industry contracted dramatically with the World Heritage listing in 1988 and associated logging bans on Crown and some private land. Sawmilling is currently restricted to {{a small number of}} fixed-site and <b>portable</b> <b>mills</b> which source timber from privately owned native forests. The low stumpage prices paid by these mills relative to the final sawn timber prices is a source of contention, with landholders believing that the mills are profiteering from an oligopsony situation. There has been increased use of portable sawmills in recent years by full-time and part-time millers. While portable sawmills do compete with traditional fixed-site sawmills on the local market, they are not seen as a major threat to the future of traditional fixed-site sawmills. Anecdotal evidence suggests that portable sawmillers do not account for all costs relevant to their milling activities but rather work on a cash flow basis. For portable sawmillers, labour is the major cost element, especially if associated costs such as workers compensation and superannuation are included. This paper examines cost structures of portable sawmills in North Queensland. The various sources of cost data and the limitations of these data are discussed. Short-run cost curves are derived and sensitivity analysis undertaken with respect to a number of key cost parameters. An attempt is also made to develop a timber milling long-run average cost curve. Results of this analysis are used to shed light on the accusations of rent capture by fixed-site sawmillers and to examine the potential role of portable sawmills...|$|R

50|$|More recently, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the Wood-Mizer in 1982, <b>portable</b> bandsaw <b>mills</b> represented a dramatic shift in design. Unlike traditional mills, they used a thin-kerf blade of the type used on a band saw rather than a circular blade, which reduced weight and cost, and reduced the size and weight of the bearings and support blocks. The smaller kerf on these blades dramatically increased the yield from a given log. Use of band blades also allowed for a different design where the head, consisting of the blade and a power source, moves back and forth while the log remains stationary. This is in contrast to traditional mills where the log moves on a trolley while the blade remains fixed. Aside from the original Wood-Mizer company, many companies now manufacture and sell personal and portable sawmills.|$|R
50|$|A {{specialty}} form {{of logging}} involving the felling of trees {{for the production}} of railroad ties was known as tie hacking. These lumberjacks, called tie hacks, used saws to fell trees and cut to length, and a broadaxe to flatten two or all four sides of the log to create railroad ties. Later, <b>portable</b> saw <b>mills</b> were used to cut and shape ties. Tie hacking was an important form of logging in Wyoming and northern Colorado and the remains of tie hacking camps can be found on National Forest land. The remains of flumes can be seen near Dubois, Wyoming and Old Roach, Colorado. In addition, a decaying splash dam exists near the Old Roach site as well. There tie hacks attempted to float logs down to the Laramie River for the annual spring tie drives, and the splash dam was used to collect winter snowmelt to increase the water flow for the tie drive.|$|R
40|$|The {{listing of}} north Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s State-owned {{rainforest}} as a World Heritage Area and {{the cessation of}} timber harvesting in 1988 caused a severe contraction in the north Queensland timber industry. The remaining industry is based on softwood from State Government plantations, which supplies only one sawmill of any appreciable size. A few small fixed <b>mills</b> and several <b>portable</b> <b>mills</b> cut hardwoods from Crown and private land outside the World Heritage Area. After only 15 years, north Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s formerly world famous cabinetwoods are now virtually unmentioned in the country 2 ̆ 7 s timber trade, and marketing these timbers {{has become a major}} issue for the small-scale forest growers. The lack of a steady, high quality supply of north Queensland timbers is probably the cause of depressed prices. The irregularity of supply ensures that prices vary widely. Private Forestry North Queensland Association (PFNQ) is the north Queensland forestry industry cluster and Private Forestry Development Committee. A number of other organisations work alongside PFNQ trying to develop the private forestry industry. A timber cooperative has been formed in the region but it has had little success in establishing a business or securing markets. PFNQ has therefore initiated a marketing facilitation project to provide market intelligence while it finds ways to initiate a private forest and timber stocktake. A stocktake and quality assessment of the region 2 ̆ 7 s resource will provide information about the timber already cut and held in storage, and standing timber available to be cut, as well as a projection for the future sustainable yield. This will assist in developing a sale strategy on which to establish sustainable, consistent wood flows to maintain a market in specialist timber uses (e. g. parquetry flooring, furniture and house panelling). Producing timber for the high volume, lower value markets is not favoured as an option for farm forestry. A possible scenario {{for the development of a}} small-scale market is suggested; however, it is acknowledged that given the weak state of the local industry and the absence of any industry funding, external resources (particularly Government support) will be necessary to re-establish a viable forestry industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{shrinking}} {{average size}} of Connecticut forested land parcels, {{as well as}} increased interest in roadside forest management activities and small-acreage treatments for wildlife habitats, all necessitate scale-appropriate management methodologies for tree harvesting and vegetation management. Corresponding value-added processing for wood products, such as with portable band sawmills, {{has the potential to}} foster local markets and utilization of wood products in the small quantities produced. A survey of <b>portable</b> band saw <b>mill</b> operators (PBSOs) in Connecticut was conducted to help determine the capacity for PBSOs to assist in addressing the state’s small-scale forest management needs. Results of the survey revealed that the majority of sawmill owners are over the age of 60; age and annual income had significant effects on interest in operating a PBSO business, whereas sawmill ownership and income effected possible interest in becoming part of a niche market. Current sawyers indicated a need for education in harvesting and operational practices, value-added techniques, and marketing, with an additional interest in obtaining logs from roadsides. PBSOs can be of assistance in addressing small scale forest management needs...|$|R
40|$|The native {{tree species}} whitewood, Endospermum medullosum Euphorbiaceae, {{is well known}} as a native forest timber from Vanuatu which can produce large volumes of wood within 15 - 20 years when managed in plantations. Its {{domestication}} is well advanced in the country, where seed can be sourced from first generation seed orchards and where considerable silvicultural expertise has been developed. Although the existing value chain for whitewood is based mainly on trees from native forests, this resource is virtually exhausted {{and there is an}} opportunity to develop strong valueadded uses for plantation-grown trees. The objectives of this research were to elucidate the various components of the whitewood value chain, for both domestic and export markets, to identify impediments {{to the development of a}} whitewood plantation and processing sector, and further identify opportunities for value adding. Interviews were conducted in Vanuatu with 115 respondents from the islands of Santo and Efate to understand the existing value chain and identify value-adding opportunities. The respondents were whitewood growers (one of a larger plantation of 270 ha and 60 owners of smaller woodlots), processors (31) including saw-millers, timber yard owners and furniture makers, and consumers (domestic (21) and overseas (3)). The prices paid for whitewood vary greatly, from as little as $ 20 per m 3 for standing trees to more than $ 5, 393 per m 3 for finished furniture and mouldings. In some cases, whitewood trees are harvested and sawn into rough boards with <b>portable</b> Lucas <b>mills</b> and transported to processing centres in the main towns, specifically Luganville, Santo and Port Vila, Efate. Rough sawn green timber is sold in Vanuatu for $ 380 to $ 490 per m 3 and exported to New Caledonia for processing. The products include dry clear timber envelope-treated for $ 639 to $ 659 per m 3, dry clear timber envelope treated for domestic interior use for $ 658 to $ 2, 028 per m 3, and finally dry mouldings and furniture at $ 3, 852 to $ 5, 393 per m 3. Specific challenges that growers and processors need to confront along the value-chain are; the need to distinguish domestic whitewood from treated Pinus radiata products imported into Vanuatu from New Zealand; the creation of efficient methods of transport from logging sites to processing centres; the need to saw and dry boards quickly after tree harvest; the development of wood treatment (impregnation) techniques, preferably with substances not toxic to humans and wildlife; protecting boards from bluestain, which develops quickly on freshly cut trees; utilising sawing technologies that can be employed in isolated rural conditions to produce boards and small pieces for later value-adding; development of viable products from short, knotty pieces; and economical ways of producing high-value products like mouldings...|$|R
