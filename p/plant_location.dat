40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of ecotype and <b>planting</b> <b>location</b> on thermal properties of big bluestem. Three big bluestem ecotypes (CKS, EKS, ILL) and a cultivar (KAW) were harvested in 2010 from four locations (Colby, Hays, and Manhattan, KS; and Carbondale, IL) and were evaluated for their specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal stability, HHV (high heating value), and proximate contents. All populations revealed a large variation in specific heat (2. 35 - 2. 62 kJ/kg/K), thermal conductivity (77. 85 - 99. 06 x 10 ³ W/m/K), thermogravimetric analysis as weight loss during the heating process (71 - 73 %), and HHV (17. 64 - 18. 67 MJ/kg). Specific heat of the big bluestem was significantly affected by <b>planting</b> <b>location,</b> ecotype, and interaction between <b>location</b> and ecotype. <b>Planting</b> <b>location</b> had stronger influence on specific heat than ecotype. Specific heat increased as temperature increased, and a linear correlation model for specific heat prediction was developed as a function of temperature. Ecotype, <b>planting</b> <b>location,</b> and the interaction of ecotype and <b>planting</b> <b>location</b> did not {{have a significant effect on}} thermal conductivity; however, density and particle size showed a completely opposite relationship on thermal conductivity. Both <b>planting</b> <b>location</b> and ecotype significantly affected HHV. Among all environmental factors, potential evapotranspiration had the most significant effect on thermal properties...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Riparian {{vegetation}} is {{an essential}} component for the maintenance and/or repair of channel stability and function. Sedges within low-gradient riparian systems provide the structure necessary for sediment trapping leading to channel narrowing through bank building processes. Planting success in riparian restoration projects has often failed due to inappropriate species selection, <b>planting</b> <b>locations</b> and/or methodologies. Stream restoration efforts utilizing channel reconstruction methods are increasing in number across the West thus emphasizing the need for knowledge on revegetation methods. Planting success in a recently constructed channel is essential because the lack of vegetation makes the channel highly susceptible to erosion. Sedges {{play an important role}} in the stability of low gradient, fine-textured stream channels. Two native sedges, Carex nebrascensis (Nebraska sedge) and Carex utriculata (beaked sedge) are often used in riparian restoration within the West because they have extensive root systems that can provide bank stability in fine-sediment channels. Survival and vegetative reproduction were evaluated on greenhouse grown plugs of these two sedge species following transplanting within a reconstructed NE Oregon meadow stream. Sedge plugs were planted on two fluvial surfaces along the stream: depositional (point bars) and erosional surfaces (straight) at or below bankfull level. A second study was performed to evaluate the effect of Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) presence on sedge transplant survival and vegetative reproduction. This was performed only on erosional <b>planting</b> <b>locations.</b> Depths to groundwater and soil moisture were also recorded at each <b>planting</b> <b>location.</b> Survival at the end of the first growing season in the first study was the same for both species, but shoot numbers were greater for Carex nebrascensis (98 shoots/m²) compared with Carex utriculata (84 shoots/m²). No differences were observed between shoot numbers by species at the end of the second growing season. Greater shoot numbers also occurred on depositional <b>planting</b> <b>locations</b> (117 and 165 shoots/m²) compared to erosional <b>planting</b> <b>locations</b> (65 and 59 shoots/m²) at the end of the first and second growing seasons.

40|$|Abstract:- Through {{analyzing}} the product structure tree, the complete supply chain network (SCN) including materials supplying, products manufacturing and distribution is established. The directions {{of all the}} flows in the original SCN are narrowed down into one single way by dividing up all the possible circulation of both manufacturing and transportation. Each node of the SCN is simplified according to its different functions, outputs and raw material sources. According to the layer of the product structure tree, all the divided nodes are combined so that each route includes all the raw material sources of the finished product. The most suitable <b>plants</b> <b>location</b> under the time constraints are worked out {{through the application of}} generalized permanent labeling algorithm on the combined SCN. Finally, by tracing backward to the original SCN according to the most suitable <b>plants</b> <b>location</b> and routes selection, the real optimal <b>plants</b> <b>location</b> and routes selection can be found out...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of a firm that {{searches}} the optimal <b>location</b> of <b>plants</b> under the following conditions: (1) Transport costs for delivery are incurred by the firm; transport costs between a plant and a customer are linear.

(4) The production cost, at each possible plant, may be divided into two parts: (a) a fixed charge supported only if there is some production; (b) a linear unit cost. The rigorous treatment of the problem involves the production and transport costs' being minimized for each combination of <b>plant</b> <b>locations.</b> This paper presents an algorithm using the special features of the problem that reduces the number of combinations of <b>plant</b> <b>locations</b> to study.

40|$|Three big {{bluestem}} ecotypes {{from central}} Kansas (Cedar Bluffs and Webster populations), eastern Kansas (Konza and Top of the World populations), and Illinois (12 Mile and Fults populations), {{as well as}} the Kaw cultivar, were harvested from four reciprocal garden <b>planting</b> <b>locations</b> (Colby, Hays, and Manhattan, KS; and Carbondale, IL) and evaluated for their chemical (glucan, xylan, arabinan, lignin and ash) and elemental (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur) compositions. The objective of this research was to study the effects of ecotype and <b>planting</b> <b>location</b> on the chemical and elemental compositions of big bluestem along the Great Plains precipitation gradient (∼ 1200 to 400 mm mean annual precipitation). All the populations revealed a large variation in cellulose (31. 8 – 36. 5 %), hemicellulose (24. 96 – 29. 74 %), lignin (14. 4 – 18. 0 %), carbon (47. 3 – 51. 3 %), and nitrogen (4. 91 – 6. 44 %). <b>Planting</b> <b>location</b> had significant effects on both chemical and elemental compositions of big bluestem.

In addition, the interaction between ecotype and <b>planting</b> <b>location</b> had significant effects on glucan, lignin, and hydrogen. <b>Planting</b> <b>location</b> had a greater effect on chemical and elemental compositions than the ecotype and interaction between location and ecotype.
