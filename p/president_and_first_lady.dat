5|$|In February 1972, Nixon and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40hours in preparation. Upon touching down, the <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon {{made a point of}} shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva. Over 100television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.|$|E

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady).</b> The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E

She also has an affair with her speechwriter Tom Yates (Paul Sparks), with Frank's approval.|$|E
