40|$|Cilia and flagella are organelles of {{motility}} {{that enable}} cells to swim or move liquid over its surface. An exhaustive literature survey {{for the presence}} of the organelle in organisms across phyla showed that most animal cells harbor cilia in contrast to very few fungal cells. While this was not unexpected, it was the position and arrangement of this organelle in each cell that intrigued our attention. Natural selection might have favored motility over chemotaxis; and it would have done so to evolve a stable structure that could have undergone an optimization process requiring a precise geometry in the shape of cells and the structure that would help cells to move. The positioning of such a structure would play a pre-dominant role in optimal motility. It is now known that the flagellar position of a cell is a genetically distinct trait, occasionally used in phylogeny of bacteria, distributed in distinguishing patterns over cellular surface, but basically are of two types, either polar (one flagellum arising from one pole per cell) or <b>peritrichous</b> (lateral <b>flagella</b> distributed over the entire cell surface). Irrespective of the cellular habitat, flagella origin, ultrastructure and proteome, the present investigation surveyed 26 sub-types of flagellar arrangements from as many species as possible. A peculiar pattern ensued-Prokaryotes harbored predominantly polar and peritrichous types; eukaryotes showed a mere change of the peritrichous one. These numbers when used to create a Similarity tree depicted a similarity distance of 14 between the Eubacteria and Archaebacteria forming the first neighborhood; Protozoans, Algae, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia formed a second neighborhood. We offer a working hypothesis for this pattern and the gradual shift in the flagellar arrangement from polar, peritrichous, sub-apical, and apical to lateral throughout evolution. </span...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{second messenger}} c-di-GMP has been recently {{found to be}} implicated in controlling many cellular processes in bacteria, {{one of them is}} the switch between motility and sessility. When in a sessile lifestyle (such as in a biofilm), bacteria are known to be more resistant to immune defences and to antibiotics. Mesophilic Aeromonas species are known to constitutively express a single polar flagellum which allows the bacteria to swim in liquid environments. They as well are able to express many <b>peritrichous</b> lateral <b>flagella</b> which allow them to move as a group (swarm). The multiple lateral flagella although are needed for swarming, they are, however, also required for biofilm formation. this study investigates the relationship between different components within the c-di-GMP network and the lateral flagella (laf) genes expression. Diguanylate cyclases containing GGDEF domains are responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis and phosphodiesterases containing EAL domains are known to breakdown the second messenger. Thirteen GGDEF-EAL domains encoding genes present in A. caviae Sch 3 N were mutated by plasmid insertion mutagenesis after which the effects of these mutations were studied phenotypically and by transcriptional fusions. We have found differences among the mutants in their ability to form a biofilm and on the activities of the lateral flagellin promoters lafA 1 p and lafA 2 p. C-di-GMP is known to bind to the PilZ domain and to RNA domains (riboswitches) to exert its function. We have mutated the pilZ gene present in the lateral flagella gene cluster by insertion of a kanamycin cassette and also we have deleted the lafK riboswitch by Spliced Overlap Extension PCR. Performance of phenotypic and beta-galactosidase assays following these mutations allowed us to conclude that the lafK c-di-GMP type I riboswitch seems to act as a c-di-GMP modulator in A. caviae. In addition, the lafK riboswitch acts as an "OFF switch" which prevents the expression of LafK, the major regulator of the laf operon...|$|R
