25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as <b>Plunge</b> <b>Routers,</b> Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|R

5000|$|This jig uses a zero {{reference}} line {{from which the}} rise and tread are measured. The {{upper part of the}} jig is a right triangle with a roundover overhang. The template allows for a tight fit of the tread into the stringer in the overhang section. The bottom of the jig incorporates an acute angle. This tapered angle allows a space for a wedge to fit against {{the back side of the}} vertical and the horizontal plane of the stringer. This jig can be used to lay out different rise (vertical) and tread (horizontal) widths. The jig is used with a <b>plunge</b> <b>router</b> and a [...] guide. The router plows out a precise groove into the finished product that allows all the parts to fit together.|$|E
