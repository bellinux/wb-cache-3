40|$|Background: Sustainable forest {{management}} (SFM), {{which has been}} recently introduced to tropical natural <b>production</b> <b>forests,</b> is beneficial in maintaining timber resources, but information about the co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration is currently lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the diversity of medium to large-bodied forest-dwelling vertebrates using a heat-sensor camera trapping system {{and the amount of}} above-ground, fine-roots, and soil organic carbon by a combination of ground surveys and aerial-imagery interpretations. This research was undertaken both in SFM applied as well as conventionally logged <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Our carbon estimation revealed that the application of SFM resulted in a net gain of 54 Mg C ha- 1 on a landscape scale. Overall vertebrate diversity was greater in the SFM applied forest than in the conventionally logged forest. Specifically, several vertebrate species (6 out of recorded 36 species) showed higher frequency in the SFM applied forest than in the conventionally logged forest. Conclusions/Significance: The application of SFM to degraded natural <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> could result in greater diversit...|$|R

30|$|Mixed shrimp–mangrove {{systems are}} a {{traditional}} form of raising shrimp that are markedly different to other production forms. Based on an ecosystem approach they benefit from rather than overexploit their surroundings (Hogarth 2007). Such {{systems can be}} found {{to a large extent}} in Ca Mau province, the southern-most province of Vietnam, where so-called <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> have increasingly been transformed from pure silvi-culture to mixed <b>production</b> systems combining <b>forest</b> <b>production</b> with shrimp cultivation. However, excessive shrimp farming led to forest degradation and required legal restrictions on mangrove removal. In 2002, based on national Decision 178 / 2001 /QD-TTg (GoV 2001), the local government in Ca Mau introduced Decision 24 / 2002 /QĐ-UB which stipulated that the use of <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> for non-timber extraction be limited to a maximum of 30  % aquaculture for farms with more than 5  ha of land, while the ratio was 60 : 40 for farms of between 3 and 5  ha, and 50 : 50 for farms with less than 3  ha (PPC 2002).

30|$|In {{contrast}} to publically owned conservation areas {{managed by the}} Department of Conservation, <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> in New Zealand are almost completely in private ownership. Historically, some planted forests have been accessible {{to the public for}} example for hunting and fishing, but only those in close proximity to residential areas have any history of being visited regularly by the public (Turner et al. 2011). Hence most public visits to forested areas are within the national conservation estate. Children therefore do not visit nearby forests alone or with friends for play purposes, but may visit with their families or on school visits, particularly as limits to recreational access in private forests have increased in response to safety concerns during forest operations and permits for access are often required. Despite such restrictions, <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> can be desirable destinations for some people, even remote forests, as there are more roads and tracks through them than for native conservation forests (Burgin and Hardiman 2012).|$|R
40|$|Forests are {{of major}} {{importance}} to human society, contributing several crucial ecosystem services. Biodiversity is suggested to positively influence multiple services but evidence from natural systems at scales relevant to management is scarce. Here, across {{a scale of}} 400, 000 [*]km 2, we report that tree species richness in <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> shows positive to positively hump-shaped relationships with multiple ecosystem services. These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50 % greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of <b>production</b> <b>forests</b> will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain {{the full range of}} benefits that the society obtains from forests...|$|R
