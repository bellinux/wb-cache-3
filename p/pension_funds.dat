40|$|Abstract. In this paper, which {{presents}} a simplified behavioral finance model, we incorporate regret into {{the decision-making process}} of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> and derive the optimal asset allocation of a final-wealth-maximizing <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> in the accumulation and decumulation phases. We find that the optimal allocation must be congruent in both phases {{if and only if}} the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> is upside regret averse. In particular, our results suggest that allocation to risky assets must increase through time in the accumulation and decumulation phases so that the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> can realize gains from any upsides in the risky asset market, thereby maximizing final wealth and limiting the feeling of regret ex-post. Although decisions in both phases are congruent, we find that the optimal asset allocation generally depends on wealth levels. This evidence implies that separate management of the accumulation and decumulation phases of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> decreases available wealth levels and is not an optimal strategy. Keywords.
