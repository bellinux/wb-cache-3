25|$|Laurence Pomeroy joined Damler in late 1926, {{at first}} working on {{commercial}} vehicles but from 1928 {{he worked at}} the products of the main Daimler operation. Pomeroy introduced redesigned <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> engines with the Daimler Fifteen in September 1932, developed new models of Daimlers, and recommended what became the September 1932 introduction of the small BSA and Lanchester Tens with <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> engines to help Daimler survive the depression. According to Martin, these actions rescued the business from total collapse in 1932. In 1934, the Pomeroy-designed poppet-valve Straight-Eights replaced the Daimler Double-Six sleeve-valve V12s without controversy or embarrassment, thereby being a personal triumph for Pomeroy.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
25|$|The S1 did not {{represent}} Baldwin's true desires for the type, but {{in the design of}} the T1, of which two prototypes were ordered in July 1940, Baldwin was given much more freedom. The PRR's requirements were the use of the Belpaire firebox and the Franklin oscillating-cam <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> gear. The two, #6110 and #6111, were delivered in April and May 1942. Testing again proved them to be powerful and capable but not sure-footed.|$|E

25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a multivalve valvetrain on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type valvetrain which may result in less power for a given displacement than multi-valve inline engines. The limitations of the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the sleeve valve, but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Harry Ricardo wrote {{a paper on}} the sleeve valve design that led to the USAAC's hyper engine efforts. He claimed that the 1hp/in³ goal was {{impossible}} to achieve with <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> type engines. The USAAC engineering team at Wright Field decided to test this claim by beating it. The I-1430 was the result of an experimental effort at Wright Field to build a high-power cylinder using conventional poppet valves. The engineers, led by Sam Heron, used a variety of techniques to raise the allowable RPM, which was the key to increased power without requiring a larger engine.|$|E

2500|$|Problems became {{apparent}} very soon. The locomotives were incredibly susceptible to violent wheelslip, {{not just at}} starting but also at speed. Dividing the drive into two groups meant that each group was {{much more likely to}} slip. A theory has been advanced that the more rapid, [...] "sharper" [...] opening of the valves with the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> gear exacerbated the problem. Worse, such violent high-speed slipping could damage the valve gear components. This was major problem on a locomotive with the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> gear because, unlike the familiar piston valves and outside Walschaerts valve gear of other locomotives, many of the components were nearly inaccessible within the frame. Their complexity meant that availability and reliability proved poor, and while a very capable locomotive engineer (driver) could extract great performance from a T1, they proved rather unsuccessful in service.|$|E

5000|$|The T1 class {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} performance and design issues including difficulties regarding the <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> used by the locomotives. The original materials used to construct the <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> used by the T1 had fatigue issues which were increased when the locomotives were operated above 100 miles an hour. In 1947, a higher strength and fatigue resistant alloy was used and retrofitted to the T1 class to solve the fatigue problems. Nevertheless, the design of the Franklin Type A <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> made several key areas of the valves hard to access during maintenance overhauls. Despite the constant issues, the <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> did allow the T1 to perform better than conventional valved locomotives at high speeds. The <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> required less horsepower for fast operation and were able to distribute steam flow with precision valve operation when going at high speeds. The T1's were further burdened by excessive wheel slip on one of the two engine sets when the locomotive operated at high speed or when the engine started moving. The Pennsylvania Railroad tried to address the problem by changing the spring bed arrangement on the T1, from being a single bed that supported only the eight drivers, to two beds; the forward bed supporting the pilot truck and first engine and the aft bed supporting the second engine and trailing truck. Despite this, a permanent solution couldn't be found to ultimately prevent violent wheel slip, even though an [...] "anti-slip" [...] mechanism had been installed on the PRR Q2 class duplexii. It is possible that the engineers, more familiar with the K4s class were better used to the slower throttle action of the K4s, whereas the T1 reacted more immediately to the engineer's throttle input {{due in part to the}} use of <b>poppet</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1900, by a Danish {{immigrant}} shipbuilder, Peter Carstens (1842-1914), {{built a new}} vessel, {{also called}} Harvest Queen, at Portland for the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company. [...] Much of the machinery {{and many of the}} fittings from the old vessel were used on the new steamer. [...] The steam engines were of the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> type, with 24 inch cylinders and an 8-foot piston stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Although Ricardo did not {{invent the}} sleeve valve, in 1927, he {{produced}} a seminal research paper that outlined {{the advantages of the}} sleeve valve, and suggested that <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> engines {{would not be able to}} offer power outputs much beyond 1500hp (1,100kW). [...] A number of sleeve valve aircraft engines were developed following this paper, notably by Napier, Bristol and Rolls-Royce. Bristol produced the Perseus, Hercules, Taurus and the Centaurus, Napier produced the Napier Sabre, and Rolls-Royce produced the Eagle and Crecy, all using sleeve valves.|$|E

[...] These engines could drive the steamer at a speed of over 20 miles per hour. [...] The engines generated 1,300 horsepower, enough it was {{said at the time}} of its launch, to make Bailey Gatzert the fastest steamer on Puget Sound. [...] According to an official source, the engines generated 1,150 nominal horsepower and 1,300 indicated horsepower. [...] The sternwheel had 17 “buckets” (paddles), each of which was 18 feet long.|$|E

[...] A <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. [...] Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E

5000|$|When used in {{high-pressure}} applications, for example, as admission valves on steam engines, {{the same}} pressure that helps seal <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> also contributes {{significantly to the}} force required to open them. This {{has led to the}} development of the balanced poppet or double beat valve, in which two valve plugs ride on a common stem, with the pressure on one plug largely balancing the pressure on the other. [...] In these valves, the force needed to open the valve is determined by the pressure and the difference between the areas of the two valve openings. Sickels patented a valve gear for double-beat <b>poppet</b> <b>valves</b> in 1842.

5000|$|The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is {{fundamentally}} different from slide and oscillating valves; instead of sliding or rocking over a seat to uncover a port, the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> lifts from the seat with a movement perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} port. The main advantage of the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is that it has no movement on the seat, thus requiring no lubrication. In most cases it is beneficial to have a [...] "balanced poppet" [...] in a direct-acting valve.
