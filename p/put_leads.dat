25|$|There is {{historical}} evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or {{any hint of}} a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards <b>put</b> <b>lead</b> plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' replied Mr Folair, beating his {{slippers}} together, {{to knock}} the dust out; 'I CAN come it pretty well--nobody better, perhaps, in my own line--but having such business as one gets here, is like <b>putting</b> <b>lead</b> on one's feet instead of chalk, and dancing in fetters without the credit of it.

5000|$|The {{computer}} {{built into}} the BORS, constantly updates to account for changing factors. Barrett states that the BORS [...] "instantly {{takes care of the}} data work so the shooter can focus on the task of <b>putting</b> <b>lead</b> on target." [...] It takes data from thousands of tables and accounts for a number of real-time external factors automatically giving the shooter the exact yardage at which a bullet will hit its target.|$|R
50|$|Lead {{paint is}} hazardous. It can cause nervous system damage, stunted growth, kidney damage, and delayed development. It is {{dangerous}} to children because it tastes sweet, therefore encouraging children to <b>put</b> <b>lead</b> chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint {{is dangerous to}} adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death.|$|R
50|$|Two {{additional}} world leads {{came from}} Mo Farah (12:59.29 in the 5000 m) and Shaunae Miller (49.55 in the 400 m). Joe Kovacs improved his shot <b>put</b> <b>lead</b> with his third win over 22 metres. Ruth Beitia and Ekaterini Stefanidi also improved their leads with their {{third and fourth}} wins, respectively. First career wins on the series came for three men: Gao Xinglong (long jump), Jakub Vadlejch (javelin) and Jimmy Vicaut (100 m). Usain Bolt won a non-Diamond Race 200 m, marking a return to form after injury.|$|R
25|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} {{is thought}} to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally fortified wine. <b>Putting</b> <b>lead</b> sugar into wine was a very common practice to sweeten cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well.|$|R

500|$|Philitas {{was thin}} and frail, and may have {{suffered}} and died from a wasting disease. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280sBC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree {{by the people of}} Cos, depicting him as [...] "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary Posidippus wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which [...] "included nothing from the physique of heroes. No,... he cast the old man full of cares."

6000|$|God saith of his saved ones, [...] "He hath chosen them in {{the furnace}} of affliction."

And thus deals God with his church; there is silver in his church, aye, {{and there is also}} dross: now the dross are the hypocrites and graceless ones that are got into the church, and these will God discover, and {{afterwards}} put away as dross. So that it will without doubt prove a truth of God, that many of their professors that shall put in claim for heaven, will not have it for their inheritance.|$|R

50|$|With one out and {{a runner}} on second and/or third base, {{converting}} a powerful batter to a runner on first base means that a subsequent ground ball may become a double play that ends the scoring threat.

50|$|An endplay (also throw-in), in {{bridge and}} similar games, is a {{tactical}} play where a defender is <b>put</b> on <b>lead</b> at a strategic moment, and then {{has to make}} a play that loses one or more tricks. Most commonly the losing play either constitutes a free finesse, or else it gives declarer a ruff and discard. In a case where declarer has no entries to dummy (or to his own hand), the defender may also be endplayed into leading a suit which can be won in that hand.|$|R
