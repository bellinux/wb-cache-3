40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{itself to}} the problem of understanding the emotional connotations of printing types. It is hypothesized that there is a model useful in predicting reactions to a given type style based on atmosphere value and usage. The majority of the literature on this subject is nonempirical. It is characterized by the author 2 ̆ 7 s stating their opinions with little or no attempt to validate them. The empirical literature shows that there is an emotional connotation associated with particular <b>type</b> <b>faces.</b> These studies have not shown, however, the importance of this connotation in terms of appropriate choice of <b>type</b> <b>faces.</b> There seems to be a need for research which measures the ability of printing type to change the contextual meaning of a message. Five hypotheses were formulated in order to study this problem. The hypotheses utilized <b>type</b> <b>face</b> predictions [...] appropriate, inappropriate, and neutral. It was hypothesized that those <b>type</b> <b>faces</b> predicted to be appropriate would arouse stronger emotions compared to <b>type</b> <b>faces</b> predicted to be neutral or inappropriate; and that those predicted to be inappropriate would arouse stronger emotions compared to a <b>type</b> <b>face</b> predicted to be neutral. It was also hypothesized that the prediction for the neutral <b>type</b> <b>face</b> would not arouse stronger emotions compared to all other types tested. A six-scale semantic differential was used to test the reactions of students and employees at RIT to six <b>type</b> <b>faces</b> and six messages. The scores were taken as absolute values in order to see the strength of the emotional response to the message/type face combinations. Z scores were calculated to test the hypotheses at the 90...|$|R

The hybrid optimization algorithm is introduced {{to obtain the}} optimum configuration of <b>pin</b> <b>type</b> fixture.

Deformation as efect of clamping force and friction slip are predicted by simulation of pin-workpiece clamping model and analyzed by Finite Element methods.

Satisfies clamping arrangement to minimize the deformation and prevent the slip is evaluated using GAs to arrange the pin configuration. PSO is further applied based on the result of GAs for obtaining global optimum of objective function.

Recently the indirectly measuring method, which measures hoisting load and overturning moment of overload limiter, demands instead of the existing method, which measures only hoisting load. The indirectly measuring method is how to conduct the hoisting load and overturning moment as measuring the load of hydraulic cylinder for a luffing driving of boom. So {{we need to develop}} the many-angular <b>pin</b> <b>type</b> load cell with the measuring angle of ± 10 degree instead of the existing load cell with the measuring angle of ± 2 degree. In this study we conducted the finite element analysis in order to evaluate the effect of the aspect ratio of measuring cross section on the measuring limit of the load cell to develop the many-angular <b>pin</b> <b>type</b> load cell. For this investigation, the aspect ratio of measuring cross section and load applying angle were adopted as design parameters and the stresses of measuring part were evaluated for each parameter...|$|R

For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet. The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested. (Plugs and power cords are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions.) The NEMA 1-15 U.S. 2 <b>pin</b> (<b>Type</b> A) and NEMA 5-15 U.S. 3 <b>pin</b> (<b>Type</b> B) plugs are rated at 125 V.

We identified 98 topics and themes from 128 interviews with parents of children with leukaemia at first hospitalization, and then combined those into a smaller set of 11 psychometrically robust global dimensions. Spearman inter-rater reliability in identifying items for these dimensions was high.
