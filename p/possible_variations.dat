5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|When Airbus {{designed}} the Airbus A300 {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B {{in support of this}} long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer envisioned three {{possible}} {{responses to the}} majority's decision. First, legislatures could prescribe exactly the same sentence for all <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> of a crime [...] an automatic five-year sentence for all robberies, for instance. This system has the [...] "intolerable" [...] effect of imposing the same sentence on people who commit their crimes in vastly different ways. [...] Prosecutors would {{end up with the}} real control over defendants' sentences, since prosecutors ultimately make the decisions regarding how to charge the case. Second, states could return to indeterminate sentencing, in which the authorized range of punishment for crimes is very broad. But such systems were criticized (rightly, in Breyer's view) for their excessive disparity and unfairness. There would be less [...] "reason" [...] in an indeterminate sentencing system than in the guidelines system Washington had adopted.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, simple {{programs}} {{tend to have}} a {{very simple}} abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. [...] This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs {{can be seen as a}} minimal example of emergence. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a brute-force search through all of the possible components for the best match.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book had}} been planned for some time, to be {{published}} by Simon & Schuster. Its first title was to be Bobby Fischer's Best Games of Chess. Fischer first announced it would appear [...] "after my match with Botvinnik" [...] (then World Champion), an event first suggested for 1962 and again in the mid 1960s but which never took place. Fischer then added more games, and retitled it My Memorable Games – 52 Tournament Games. (At one time it was also titled My Life in Chess: 52 Memorable Games.) [...] At that point the collection ended at the Piatigorsky Cup in 1966. However he then had an abrupt change of heart and decided not to publish the book at all, and asked to be released from his contract. It was suggested {{that he did not want}} to reveal all his secrets, as the book has lengthy annotations and analysis of different <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> of his games. In 1968 he changed his mind and decided to go ahead with publication. His friend and colleague Grandmaster Larry Evans, who helped in an editorial capacity and also wrote introductions to all the games, has said this was because Fischer felt philosophically that [...] "the world was coming to an end anyway" [...] and he might as well make some money. Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon. Fischer continued to revise the manuscript and added eight more games, also changing the title to My Memorable Games – 60 Tournament Struggles before settling on the final name.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Eliot {{must have}} found his task {{anything}} but easy or inviting. He {{was to learn}} a dialect, in which he could be assisted by no affinity with the languages he already knew. He was to do this {{without the help of}} any written or printed specimens, with nothing {{in the shape of a}} grammar or analysis, but merely by oral communication with his Indian instructor, or with other natives, who, however comparatively intelligent, must from the nature of the case have been very imperfect teachers. He applied himself to the work with great patience and sagacity, carefully acting the differences between the Indian and the English modes of constructing words; and, having once got a clew to this, he pursued every noun and verb he could think of through all <b>possible</b> <b>variations.</b> In this way he arrived at analyses and rules, which he could apply for himself in a general manner.|$|E
60|$|This completes his charming {{story of}} the life of the English year, told in a way that convinces us of his {{intimate}} acquaintance with it. Half the interest of Mr. Parsons' work is in the fact that he paints from a full mind and from a store of assimilated knowledge. In every touch of nature that he communicates to us we feel something of the thrill of the whole--we feel the innumerable relations, the <b>possible</b> <b>variations</b> of the particular objects. This makes his manner serious and masculine--rescues it from the thinness of tricks and the coquetries of chic. We walk with him on a firm earth, we taste the tone of the air and seem to take nature and the climate and all the complicated conditions by their big general hand. The painter's manner, in short, is one with the study of things--his talent is a part of their truth. In this happy series we seem to see still more how that talent was formed, how his rich motherland has been, from the earliest observation, its nurse and inspirer. He gives back to her all the good she has done him.|$|E
