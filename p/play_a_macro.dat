50|$|Most macro {{recorders}} do {{not attempt}} to analyze or interpret what the user did when the macro was recorded. This can cause problems when trying to <b>play</b> back <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> if the user's desktop environment has changed. For example, if the user has changed their desktop resolution, moved icons, or moved the task bar, the mouse macro may not perform the way the user intended. That's {{one of the reasons}} for preferring keyboard macros over the mouse-oriented ones.|$|R
50|$|Dance {{animations}} move avatars. A dance animation lasts usually between 20 and 60 seconds. Animations can be looped—restarting automatically {{again and}} again until manually stopped. Different dances can also be sequenced by putting them into a HUD that can <b>play</b> <b>a</b> recorded <b>macro</b> along <b>a</b> timeline. With the available animations virtual dancers can recreate a lot of dances known in real life like waltz, tango, salsa, funk, bebop and even classical routines like solos of Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.|$|R
30|$|As was {{the case}} for micro flexibility, all labor market {{institutions}} <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in <b>macro</b> flexibility. For example, higher unemployment benefits lead to higher reservation wages, thus higher actual wages, and likely higher unemployment. By allowing variations in employment to adjust through the employment of temporary workers, dual employment protection systems isolate workers on permanent contracts—those workers who are likely to dominate bargaining—from labor market conditions. We focus here, however, on the three institutions that matter most: the minimum wage, the tax wedge (which affects primarily the average level of unemployment), and the collective bargaining structure (which affects not only the level but also the responsiveness of unemployment).|$|R

By merging into <b>a</b> <b>macro,</b> <b>an</b> element which is particularly easy to handle is created.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>macro</b> in Lisp superficially {{resembles a}} {{function}} in usage. However, rather than representing an expression which is evaluated, {{it represents a}} transformation of the program source code. The macro gets the source it surrounds as arguments, binds them to its parameters and computes a new source form. This new form can also use <b>a</b> <b>macro.</b> The macro expansion is repeated until the new source form does not use <b>a</b> <b>macro.</b> The final computed form is the source code executed at runtime.|$|R

30|$|In the {{considered}} system concept, UEs which {{connect to}} small cells {{are required to}} maintain a connection to <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> cell so as to enable the implementation of macro-assisted UE small cell connection establishment mechanisms, introduced in Section 3.4. This implies that the connection to <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> cell is <b>a</b> pre-requisite for the connection to a small cell. Note that this configuration corresponds to the first scenario described in Section 6.1. 1 of [34], in which a UE is in coverage of both <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> cell and <b>a</b> small cell simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{achievements}} {{were also}} {{made in the}} reform of the economic system. The new financial system with tax decentralization at its core, and the new tax system with value-added tax as its main component, were set up.

5000|$|In C, <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> cannot use {{the return}} keyword {{with the same}} meaning as a {{function}} would do (it would make the function that asked the expansion terminate, rather than the macro).

50|$|If <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> {{includes}} {{the press of}} a key that has another macro programmed to it, the second macro will be ignored and the original function of the key will be programmed into the new <b>macro.</b> If <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> includes <b>a</b> key that has been remapped, the macro will be programmed with the remapped function of the key and not its original function. If <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> is too long to fit in the keyboard's memory, it will be truncated at {{the point that the}} keyboard ran out of programming memory. There is no upperbound limit to the length of <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> except the total free memory remaining in the keyboard, which is believed to be a maximum of 16 kilobits (2048 x 8 bits) based on the controller board's inclusion of an Atmel AT28C16 EEPROM chip.|$|R
