40|$|As {{demonstrated}} by this symposium, the opinion in Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon 2 ̆ 7 {{is one of}} Benjamin Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s most celebrated opinions. The essential facts are these. The defendant, Lady Lucy, 2 ̆ 2 occupied a unique and high position as a creator of fashions in America, England and France. 2 ̆ 2 Because of her prestige in the fashion industry, her <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> women 2 ̆ 7 s fashions had 2 ̆ 2 a distinct monetary value to the manufacturers of such articles. 2 ̆ 2 The plaintiff, Otis F. Wood, had 2 ̆ 2 a business organization adapted to the <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> such <b>endorsements.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Accordingly, the parties agreed that Wood {{was to have the}} exclusive right to place Lady Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s endorsements. When he did so, the parties would share equally in the proceeds. [...] . This article considers three aspects of Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Lady Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s case. The first {{is the way in which}} he used the concept of unconscionability to create a contract that would not otherwise have existed (what we might call 2 ̆ 2 formative unconscionability 2 ̆ 2), rather than to invalidate a contract in whole or in part, and the incongruity of that result in this case. The second is Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s impracticality, from the point of view of a practicing lawyer and of a client in Lady Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s position, in creating a contract in Lady Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s case. The third is how Lady Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s case illustrates Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s sometime practice of abusing his power as a judge by neglecting, or even demeaning, the humanity of parties who appeared before him...|$|R

40|$|Interaction between agents {{representing}} {{real world}} actors in computational models must be informed by knowledge about interaction processes occurring amongst real world actors.

The main advantage in applying the idea <b>of</b> <b>endorsements</b> {{lies in the fact}} that they allow for combining the efficiency properties of numerical measures with the richness and subtleties of non-numerical measures of interest or belief.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} how {{individual differences in}} <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggressive behaviors and thoughts relate to individual levels of tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants and established prejudice correlates such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and ethnic out-groups ratings among adolescents. Participants (N = 141; Age M = 16. 08, 68 % girls) completed the Readiness for Interpersonal Aggression Inventory, the Tolerance and Prejudice Questionnaire, and measures of SDO and ethnic out-groups ratings. Results indicated that higher individual <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression was related to higher prejudice and SDO and lower tolerance and ethnic out-groups ratings. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression related to habitual and socially determined aggressive acts or stable needs to hurt others {{as a source of}} satisfaction were significantly correlated with prejudice. Conversely, the relationship between prejudice and <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> impulsive actions lacking of emotional control resulted was less marked. The results highlight how in the cognitive spectrum of prejudice, individual levels <b>of</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression may play a significant triggering role during adolescence. These findings may have implications for future studies and interventions aimed at reducing prejudice already in young ages...|$|R
