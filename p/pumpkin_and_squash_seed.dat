In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|R
40|$|Seed vigor tests provide {{additional}} {{information provided by}} the germination test, producing more consistent data in different field conditions. This study aimed to evaluate procedures and methodologies for vigor testing to indicate which tests are sensitive to identify vigor levels between lots of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash</b> <b>seeds.</b> Two species <b>pumpkin</b> (Cucurbita maxima) <b>and</b> <b>squash</b> (Cucurbita pepo) were used, and each one was represented by four lots, whose initial quality was assessed using the following tests: germination and first count, earliness of rdicle emission, speed, coefficient of velocity and mean germination time, Timson's index, vigor rating, seedling emergence, and mean emergence rate. In the test of earliness of rdicle emission at two days, {{there was no difference between}} lots of Cucurbita maxima, and there was adequate separation of Cucurbita pepo lots, while the cool germination test rated lots similarly to the primary root emergence test. For the <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> Caserta seeds, the cool germination, primary root emergence at 3 and 4 days and seedling vigor rating tests showed separation efficiency of lots as for physiological potential...|$|R
25|$|The {{region of}} this early {{agriculture}} {{is in the}} middle Mississippi valley, from Memphis north to St. Louis and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Indians were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri. At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, ragweed, bottle gourd, and the seeds of Cucurbita pepo, a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of <b>pumpkins</b> <b>and</b> most <b>squashes.</b> The <b>seeds</b> found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild C. pepo. The agency for this change was surely human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate C. pepo to produce edible flesh.|$|R

50|$|Aster yellows is {{a disease}} of various {{vegetable}} crops, weeds and ornamental plants and is transmitted almost entirely by the aster leafhopper. The disease is caused by phytoplasmas, specialised bacteria that are obligate parasites of plant tissue. The symptoms shown by the plant are a yellowing of the leaf veins followed by yellowing of the leaf blades, spindly stems with pale leaves, stunting of the plant, and deformed flowers, which sometimes show green colouring. Vegetable crops affected include carrot, celery, lettuce, potato, cucumber, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash.</b>|$|R

In addition, some spices, such as allspice and chili pepper, are fruits, botanically speaking. In contrast, rhubarb {{is often referred}} to as a fruit, because it is used to make sweet desserts such as pies, though only the petiole (leaf stalk) of the rhubarb plant is edible, and edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts.|$|R

50|$|Agriculture {{also started}} around that time, with the {{cultivation}} of corn, beans, <b>and</b> <b>squash.</b> <b>Seeds</b> were probably procured from traveling groups or tribes. Settlements of family groups became more stable, as they could store food in pottery, as well as procure more game with the bow and arrow.

They fished with nets or by hand in the shallow rivers. The Lenape trapped game with deadfalls and snares.|$|R

25|$|In {{the southwestern}} United States <b>and</b> Mexico, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash</b> flowers are a popular and widely {{available}} food item. They {{may be used}} to garnish dishes, and they may be dredged in a batter then fried in oil. Pumpkin leaves are a popular vegetable in the Western and central regions of Kenya; they are called seveve, and are an ingredient of mukimo, respectively, whereas the pumpkin itself is usually boiled or steamed. The seeds are popular with children who roast them on a pan before eating them. Pumpkin leaves are also eaten in Zambia, where they are called chibwabwa and are boiled and cooked with groundnut paste as a side dish.|$|R
40|$|In 1891 {{the writer}} read a paper {{before one of}} the Horticultural Societies of Iowa, 1 in which the {{statement}} was made that melons and cucumbers do not “mix,” nor do <b>pumpkins</b> <b>and</b> melons. He was vigorously assailed by horticulturists for teaching such doctrines. I quote from several horticulturists. 3 Hon. Geo. Van Houten remarked: “I must correct the statement {{in regard to the}} crossing of melons <b>and</b> <b>pumpkins</b> <b>and</b> <b>squashes.</b> They will mix.,) Mr. Elmer Reeves related his experience when a boy “in having his melons spoiled by sowing seed from those planted near squashes. ” In discussing this question with many horticulturists in the State and out, the opinion seems to be almost universal that “mixing” does occur. My brother,. who grows many cucurbits in Western Wisconsin, believes that <b>pumpkins</b> <b>and</b> <b>squashes</b> will “mix,” <b>and</b> that melons and cucumbers will “mix. ” While I have not endeavored to get the opinion of seedsmen on this question, I believe, as a general thing they caution those who grow cucurbit seeds for them, not to plant the different species too closely. In a discussion of this subject before the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, Dr. Neale stated that watermelons were affected by the Calabash (Lagenaria vulgaris) {{in such a way that}} the melons had an extremely bitter taste, so much so, that it served as a warning to keep away such as desired to take melons. I am inclined to discredit these general statements and the experiments made elsewhere and here at Ames confirm the position I have taken on this question...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash</b> are American {{members of}} the plant family Cucurbitaceae. Cucumbers, {{originally}} from India, muskmelons from the Middle East, and watermelons from Africa are other members of this important family of vine crops. Squash, like corn, was domesticated by Indians of Central America and spread to the 48 contiguous states of the United tates {{before the arrival of}} Columbus. Squash was among the first vegetables to be planted in Nebraska. These crops can be used in many ways. The quick-growing, tender-skinned summer <b>squash,</b> when harvested <b>and</b> used while still immature, are delicious either steamed and buttered or sliced and baked with onions, bacon, tomato suace <b>and</b> Italian seasoning. <b>Pumpkin</b> usually has finer-textured flesh than <b>squash</b> <b>and</b> is better for pies <b>and</b> custard. <b>Squash</b> or <b>pumpkin</b> pulp is a good ingredient for preparing moist quick breads...|$|R
5000|$|According to what {{traditionally}} {{is known}} as [...] "The First Thanksgiving," [...] the 1621 feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony contained waterfowl, venison, fish, lobster, clams, berries, fruit, <b>pumpkin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash.</b> William Bradford noted that, [...] "besides waterfowl and cider, there was great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many." [...] Many of the foods that {{were included in the}} first feast (except, notably, the seafood) have since gone on to become staples of the modern Thanksgiving dinner.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these studies}} {{was to assess the}} degree to which bean leaf beetle, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster), will feed on cucurbits. In 2003, we documented an infestation of C. trifurcata in a commercial pumpkin field near Rosemount, MN, USA. To evaluate C. trifurcata feeding on cucurbits, we conducted laboratory no-choice and choice test feeding studies. In the laboratory, C. trifurcata fed most heavily on cotyledon-stage cucumber plants, followed by <b>pumpkin</b> <b>and</b> <b>squash.</b> With soybean plants present, C. trifurcata still fed on cucumber plants. However, C. trifurcata appeared to prefer soybeans until the quality of the soybean plants was diminished through feeding damage. This is the first known report of C. trifurcata feeding on cucurbits. The pest potential of C. trifurcata in cucurbit cropping systems should be further evaluated...|$|R
