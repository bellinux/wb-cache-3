2500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the {{availability}} of news via [...] and then {{the availability of}} online journalism posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid circulation has declined, while advertising revenue—which makes {{up the bulk of}} most newspapers' income—has been shifting from print to the new media (social media websites and news websites), resulting in a general decline in print newspapers' revenues and profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in the 2000s, in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience. One of the big challenges is that a number of online news websites, such as Google news, are free to access. Some online news sites are free, and rely on online advertising; other online news sites have a paywall and require paid subscription for access. However, in the non-developed countries, cheaper <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution,</b> increased literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} legend that the {{magazine}} double-checked its facts before publishing its articles, {{as well as being}} vetted by Confidentials lawyers as [...] "suit-proof," [...] the later 1957 court case would show otherwise.

But Harrison had further safeguards in place. In addition to articles being vetted by lawyers and sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof of claims, Harrison compartmentalized both the <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> channels. Though the editorial content was prepared in the New York offices, the magazine itself was printed in Chicago by an independent contractor (Kable Publishing of Mount Morris, Illinois).

2500|$|The Reformation was {{a triumph}} of {{literacy}} and the new printing press. Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. By 1530 over 10,000 publications are known, {{with a total of}} ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a [...] "good" [...] against [...] "bad" [...] church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes. Especially effective were Luther's Small Catechism, for use of parents teaching their children, and Larger Catechism, for pastors. Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther's ideas. Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553), the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.|$|E
2500|$|While {{numerous}} German Catholics, {{who participated}} in the secret <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, went to jail and concentration camps, the Western democracies remained silent, which Pope Pius XI labeled bitterly a [...] "conspiracy of silence". As the extreme nature of Nazi racial anti-Semitism became obvious, and as Mussolini in the late 1930s began imitating Hitler's anti-Jewish race laws in Italy, Pius XI continued to make his position clear, both in Mit brennender Sorge and after Fascist Italy's Manifesto of Race was published, in a public address in the Vatican to Belgian pilgrims in 1938: [...] "Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no, I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we [...] are all Semites" [...] These comments were neither reported by Osservatore Romano or Vatican Radio. They were reported in Belgium in the 14 September 1938 issue of La Libre Belgique and in the 17 September 1938 issue of French Roman Catholic daily La Croix. They were then published worldwide but had little resonance at the time in the secular media. The [...] "conspiracy of silence" [...] included not only the silence of secular powers against the horrors of Nazism but also their silence on the persecution of the Church in the Mexico, the Soviet Union and Spain. Despite these public comments, Pius was reported to have suggested privately that the Church's problems in those three countries were [...] "reinforced by the anti-Christian spirit of Judaism".|$|E
