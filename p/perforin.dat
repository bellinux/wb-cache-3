25|$|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated {{cytotoxicity}} (ADCC) requires {{antibodies to}} bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region {{that can be}} detected by immune system cells via their Fc surface receptors. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including natural killer cells. When natural killer cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing <b>perforin</b> and granzyme B to kill the tumor cell. Examples include Rituximab, Ofatumumab and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for {{a specific type of}} Fc receptor, FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Killer T {{cells are}} a {{sub-group}} of T cells that kill {{cells that are}} infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as <b>perforin,</b> which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by [...] "helper" [...] T cells (see below).|$|E
50|$|One pathway is the {{cytotoxic}} protein pathway. In this pathway <b>perforins</b> and granzymes {{are taken}} up by the target cell.

Recent research has evaluated genetic signatures, described biologic subgroups, and suggested potential targeted treatments. Acute viral infection studies found that initial infection severity was the single best predictor of persistent fatigue. Genomic studies showed that persistent cases express Epstein Barr virus-specific genes and demonstrate abnormalities of mitochondrial function. Studies of immune dysfunction extended observations of natural killer cytotoxic cell dysfunction of the cytotoxic T cell through quantitative evaluation of intracellular <b>perforins</b> and granzymes.

30|$|From {{the data}} {{obtained}} to date, {{it is clear}} that stress can alter a potentially important defense mechanism against malignant diseases; stress can not only alter NK cell activity in normal populations but can also depress the ability of NK cells to respond to the cytokines necessary for effective cell killing of appropriate tumor or virally infected cells (Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser 1994). Immune cells like inflammatory macrophages, NK cells, and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) {{can be found in the}} core of primary tumors and within the invasive and metastatic tumor microenvironments Hanahan and Weinberg 2011). NK cells and CTL are known to be regulated by stress, influencing tumor progression through association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, interferon (IFN) production and release of apoptotic protein <b>perforins,</b> granzymes A and B, and FasL (Bubenik 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of mature T {{cells in the}} thymus involves changes in the regulation of numerous genes. In some cases genes are turned on or off, while in others they acquire {{the ability to be}} expressed in response to appropriate stimuli. One set of genes whose expression is initiated in the thymus encodes the T-cell receptor chains. Although surface T-cell receptor expression is a prerequisite for mature responsiveness, it is not sufficient. Mature T cells must also be able to induce the expression of various batteries of unlinked genes in response to antigenic stimulation. These inducible genes include interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and interferon-γ in some cells, interleukins- 4 and - 5 in others, <b>perforins</b> in still others, and the IL- 2 receptor 55 kd chain, which must explain changes in the regulation of both constitutively expressed and inducible genes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Perforin</b> is a pore forming cytolytic protein {{found in}} the {{granules}} of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells. Upon degranulation, <b>perforin</b> binds to the target cell's plasma membrane, and oligomerises in a Ca2+ dependent manner to form pores on the target cell. The pore formed allows for the passive diffusion {{of a family of}} pro-apoptotic proteases, known as the granzymes, into the target cell. The lytic membrane-inserting part of <b>perforin</b> is the MACPF domain. This region shares homology with cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E

50|$|<b>Perforin</b> has {{structural}} and functional similarities to complement component 9 (C9). Like C9, this protein creates transmembrane tubules and {{is capable of}} lysing non-specifically a variety of target cells. This protein {{is one of the}} main cytolytic proteins of cytolytic granules, and it is known to be a key effector molecule for T-cell- and natural killer-cell-mediated cytolysis. <b>Perforin</b> is thought to act by creating holes in the plasma membrane which triggers an influx of calcium and initiates membrane repair mechanisms. These repair mechanisms bring <b>perforin</b> and granzymes into early endosomes.|$|E
40|$|NK cells kill {{sensitive}} targets via exocytosis of {{cytoplasmic granules}} containing membrane damaging <b>perforins</b> and DNA damaging granzymes. Therefore, the target cell can either die by necrosis or by apoptosis. A third, non-secretory, mechanism of killing mediated by Fas-FasL interaction {{can be used}} by activated NK cells to kill Fas+ targets. Here, we have studied the modulation exerted by two NK active cytokines, IL- 2 and IL- 12, on the apoptosis-inducing activity of NK cells in NK-sensitive Fas- K 562 and NK-insensitive Fas+ Raji cells. Our results show that apoptosis is preferentially induced at low target:effector ratios. Resting NK cells virtually do not induce apoptosis in target cells while IL- 2 stimulation endows NK cells with the capacity of inducing apoptosis and IL- 12 further enhances this effect against both targets. Finally, we demonstrate that cytokine-stimulated NK cells use both granzyme and Fas-FasL pathways of apoptosis induction...|$|R
50|$|In Cullen's paper “Granzymes in Cancer and Immunity” he {{describes}} the process of “immune surveillance as the process whereby precancerous and malignant cells are recognized by the immune system as damaged and are consequently targeted for elimination”. For a tumor to progress it requires conditions within the body and surrounding area to be growth-promoting. Almost all people have suitable immune cells to fight off tumors in the body. Studies {{have shown that the}} immune system even has the ability to prevent precancerous cells from growing and arbitrate the regression of established tumors. The dangerous thing about cancer cells is they have the ability to inhibit the function of the immune system. Although a tumor may be in its beginning stage and very weak, it may be giving off chemicals that inhibit the function of the immune system allowing it to grow and become harmful. Tests have shown that mice without granzymes and <b>perforins</b> are at high risk to have tumors spread throughout their body.|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{control of}} cancer lesions {{requires}} local uptake of tumor-specific antigen {{followed by the}} activation and expansion of tumor specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). An efficient effector phase further depends upon the entry of activated CTL into the tumor microenvironment and scanning of tumor tissue, which leads to direct interaction of the CTL with target cells followed by apoptosis induction and shrinkage of the tumor lesion. Whereas the antigens and pathways that lead to efficient activation of tumor-specific CTL are well established, the local mechanisms that enable efficient - or deficient - CTL function in the tumor tissue are poorly understood. Firstly, effector T lymphocytes need to be mobile to reach the tumor lesion. Next, they must physically interact with and scan tumor cells for antigenic MHC/peptide complexes. Lastly, CTLs must undergo activation and functional conjugation with target cells to induce apoptosis either by the release of <b>perforins</b> or the engagement of Fas/FasL. All these steps of effector function are interdependent and require the amoeboid migration of CTL through tissue to reach, engage with and leave encountered cells...|$|R

40|$|Echinoderms are {{exclusively}} marine animals that, {{after the}} chordates, represent {{the second largest}} group of deuterostomes. Their diverse species composition and singular ecological niches provide {{at the same time}} challenges and rewards when studying the broad range of responses that make up their immune mechanisms. Two types of responses comprise the immune system of echinoderms: a cellular response and a humoral one. Cell-based immunity is carried by the celomocytes, a morphologically heterogeneous population of free roaming cells that are capable of recognizing and neutralizing pathogens. Celomocytes present diverse morphologies and functions, which include phagocytosis, encapsulation, clotting, cytotoxicity, wound healing among others. Humoral immunity is mediated by a wide variety of secreted compounds that {{can be found in the}} celomic fluid and play important roles in defense against infection. Compounds such as lectins, agglutinins, <b>perforins,</b> complement and some cytokines make up some of the humoral responses of echinoderms.

40|$|Studies on the {{molecular}} mechanism underlying the activation of T lymphocytes {{have demonstrated that}} T cell proliferation induced by soluble stimuli (lectins or antibodies) is linked to polyphosphoinositide breakdown and to {{a rise in the}} cytosolic-free Ca " concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) t (1 - 4). Consequently, it has been assumed that stimulation of T cells with specific antigens involves this same sequence of events, but direct evidence in support of this hypothesis has yet to be obtained. A special case of T cell activation is that of CTLs. In this case, in addition to the activation of the chain of events leading to DNA synthesis, the main consequence of T cell receptor triggering is initiation of the killing process. The mechanism of CTL-mediated cytotoxicity has been suggested (5 - 8) to involve the release of specific granule content. Among other cytotoxic enzymes, these granules contain proteins (<b>perforins)</b> capable of polymerizing in a Ca 2 +-dependent fashion into ring-like structures that perforate target cells (8).

The decrease was due to a reduction of Vδ 2 T cells, whereas the number of Vδ 1 T cells was not affected. As a consequence, the Vδ 2 /Vδ 1 ratio was inverted in melanoma patients. A lower percentage of γδ+ T cells producing tumor necrosis factor-α or interferon-γ was found in melanoma patients.

40|$|Successful immune-mediated {{regression}} of solid tumors {{is difficult because}} of the small number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that were traffic to the tumor site. Here, the targeting of tumor-specific infiltrating CTLs was dependent on a fusion protein consisting of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) with the D 227 A mutation. EGF-SEA strongly restrained the growth of murine solid sarcoma 180 (S 180) tumors (control versus EGF-SEA, mean tumor weight: 1. 013 versus 0. 197 g, difference  =  0. 816 g). In mice treated with EGF-SEA, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and SEA-reactive T lymphocytes were enriched around the EGFR expressing tumor cells. The EGF receptors were potentially phosphorylated by EGF-SEA stimulation and the fusion protein promoted T cells to release the tumoricidal cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Intratumoral CTLs secreted cytolytic pore-forming <b>perforins</b> and granzyme B proteins near the surface of carcinomas, causing the death of many tumor cells.

40|$|Ab-dependent {{polymorphonuclear}} granulocyte (PMN) -mediated cytotoxicity {{may play}} an important role in the control of malignant diseases. However, little is known as to which particular pathways are used for the killing of malignant cells by PMN. The production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) has been observed to occur during Ab-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, PMN from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease demonstrated strong ADCC against malignant lymphoma cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of ROI production in PMN from healthy donors had no significant effect on ADCC. Therefore, ROI production by the NADPH oxidase of PMN does not appear to be mandatory for PMN-mediated ADCC. Recent data suggest a role for <b>perforins</b> in PMN-mediated cytotoxicity. However, in our assays concanamycin A, an inhibitor of perforin-mediated ADCC by mononuclear cells, had no inhibitory effect on PMN-mediated ADCC. Using electron microscopy we observed that PMN and their target cells intimately interact with the formation of interdigitating membrane protrusions. During PMN and target cell contact there was a mutual exchange of fluorescent membrane lipid dyes that was strongly increased in the presence of tumor-targeting Abs. This observation may be closely related to the recently described process of trogocytosis by lymphocytes. The presence of transient PMN-tumor cell aggregates and the accumulation of PMN with tumor cell-derived membrane lipids and vice versa were associated with effective ADCC as measured by chromium-release or apoptosis induction. <br/...|$|R

The same protein had also been described as AP 65 by other authors, which identified it as one of the four surface proteins specifically responsible for binding of the parasite to the target cell in a ligand-receptor fashion.

The experiments performed in this work demonstrate that P 65 is secreted and retains its adhesive properties in the extracellular environment, being able to bind both erythrocytes and HeLa cells.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} model of genes in DNA. A Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GtlMM) provides {{the framework for}} describing the grasnmar of a legal parse of a DNA sequence (Stormo & Haussler 1994). Probabilities are assigned to transitions between states in tile GItMM and to the generation of each nucleotide base given a particular state. Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize these probabilities using a standardized training set. Given a new candidate sequence, the best parse is deduced from the model using a dynamic programlning algorithm to identify the path through the model with maximum probability. Tile GHMM is flexible and modular, so new sensors and additional states can be inserted easily. In addition, it provides simple solutions for integrating cardinality constraints, reading frame constraints, "indels’, and homology searching. The description and results of an implementation of such a gene-finding model, called Genie, is presented.
