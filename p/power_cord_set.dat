50|$|Instead, a {{country-specific}} <b>power</b> supply <b>cord</b> can {{be included}} in the product packaging, so that model variations are minimized and factory testing is simplified. A cord which is fitted with non-rewireable (usually moulded) connectors at both ends is termed a <b>cord</b> <b>set.</b> Appliance manufacturing may be simplified by mounting an appliance coupler directly on the printed circuit board. Assembly and handling of an appliance is easier if the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> can be removed without much effort.|$|R
50|$|Power cables may {{be either}} fixed or {{detachable}} from the appliance. In {{the case of}} detachable leads, the appliance end of the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a pilot lamp to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector. <b>Power</b> <b>cords</b> for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference.|$|R
50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> of your {{equipment}} may be replaceable. In this case, new BS 1363 compliant <b>power</b> <b>cords</b> {{are available in}} electronic stores.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> {{includes}} connectors molded to {{the cord}} {{at each end}} (see Appliance coupler). <b>Cord</b> <b>sets</b> are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> {{is attached to a}} molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.|$|R

25|$|Transformer-less power {{supplies}} required safety precautions in their design {{to limit the}} shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an interlock tying the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A cheater <b>cord</b> was a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.|$|R

50|$|Most desktop {{computers}} use the C14 inlet {{to attach the}} <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to the <b>power</b> supply, as do many instrument amplifiers, monitors, printers and other peripherals.A <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> with a suitable power plug (for the locality where appliance is being used) on one end and a C13 connector (connecting to the appliance) on the other is commonly called an IEC cord. IEC cords are used to power many pieces of electronic equipment, including computers, instrument amplifiers, professional audio equipment and virtually all professional video equipment.|$|R
50|$|Appliance {{couplers}} {{enable the}} use of standard inlets and country-specific <b>cord</b> <b>sets</b> which allow manufacturers to produce the same appliance for many markets, where only the <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> has to be changed for a particular market.

Couplers described under these standards have standardized current and temperature ratings.|$|R

The lamp's <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> plug (neutral) connects to the neutral terminal on the socket, and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|R
