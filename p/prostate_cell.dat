25|$|The {{prostate}} is a zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing organ. The protein ZIP1 {{is responsible}} for the active transport of zinc into <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> One of the zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. <b>Prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> are generally devoid of zinc. This allows <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene SLC39A1. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> effectively eliminate these cells in animals.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Medical Bioscience) - MSc(MBS) The {{prostate}} {{is prone}} to three pathological processes that include inflammation, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and tumors. According to the center for Disease and Control 1999 - 2012 report, prostate cancer is the second {{leading cause of death}} in the United States. Scientific evidence suggests that up to 30 % of men in the general population aged from 50 years and above, irrespective of geographic origin, have foci of prostate neoplastic growth. Unbalanced ROS production and a dysregulated antioxidant defence system have been implicated in prostate cancer development. The transformation of a normal cell into cancer takes a very long period. This observation provides the advantage of using nutraceuticals to prevent, arrest or reverse the cellular and molecular processes of carcinogenesis. Based on scientifically observed positive health roles of green tea (Cameli sinensis) and rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) on major diseases like atherosclerosis, hepatitis and certain types of cancer, this thesis evaluated the effects of these two teas on benign (RPWE 1) and malignant (LNCaP) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> This was done through the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using a fluorescence dye 5, 6 CM-H 2 DCFDA, total prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels using a PSA ELISA kit, cell viability using the MTT assay, apoptosis using Tali annexin V stain and cell imaging studies using a Zeiss axiovert 200 M inverted fluorescence microscope. Statistical analysis was done using graphpad prism. The findings of this study show that aqueous extracts of green and black tea, fermented and unfermented rooibos and their active compounds epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and aspalatin, respectively, are cytotoxic in malignant (LNCaP) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> but exert protective effects in benign (RPWE 1) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> This thesis implicates the pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant properties of the plant extracts, respectively, for the above mentioned effects. In this regard, tea and rooibos promoted ROS production in malignant (LNCaP) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells,</b> which subsequently promoted cell death of the malignant cells through apoptosis and necrosis. Further to this, tea and rooibos used in this thesis, protected normal <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> from the adverse effects of ROS. In this regard, fluorescence microscope photographs showed RPWE 1 cells with low DCF fluorescence compared to the malignant <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> Low magnification light microscope photographs showed RPWE 1 cells with flat polygonal shapes and increased adherence both at low and high concentrations of tea and rooibos. On the contrary, high concentrations of tea and rooibos on malignant (LNCaP) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> induced stress, which made the cells attain irregular shapes and as the stress levels increased, cells became detached and appeared dead. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of apoptotic and necrotic cell in malignant (LNCaP) <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> In this thesis, EGCG and aspalathin were responsible for the high rates of apoptosis observed whereas green tea and unfermented rooibos induced the highest rate of necrosis. Further to this, tea and rooibos and the main active compounds EGCG and aspalathin, respectively, significantly promoted the reduction of total serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in malignant <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> In normal <b>prostate</b> <b>cells,</b> these plant extracts maintained the total serum PSA at its basal physiological level. In this thesis, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, we report for the first time the cell-specific effects of fermented rooibos, unfermented rooibos and their main active component aspalathin, on <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells.</b> We showed that rooibos and aspalathin exert pro-oxidant effects on malignant LNCaP cells and anti-oxidant effects on benign RPWE 1 cells. In conclusion, tea (C. sinensis) and rooibos (A. linearis) and their respective main active compounds, epigallocatechin gallate and aspalathin, are cytotoxic to malignant <b>prostate</b> <b>cells</b> whereas in normal <b>prostate</b> <b>cells,</b> they have protective effects against ROS induced stress.

Unlike PC-3 cells, LNCaP and CWR22rv-1 human prostate cancer cell lines require exogenous androgen for their survival; this mimics the androgen dependency exhibited by most human prostate cancers in their early, untreated stages. Both cell lines overexpress BLT2 receptors compared to the PWR-1E non-malignant human <b>prostate</b> <b>cell</b> line. Treatment with the BLT2 receptor antagonist, Ly255283, caused both cell lines to become apoptotic; furthermore, BLT2 receptor knockdown using interference mRNA caused LNCaP but not PWR-1E cell apoptosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Androgens and {{androgen}} receptors (AR) regulate normal prostate {{development and}} growth. They also {{are involved in}} pathological development of prostatic diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). Antiandrogen therapy for PCa, in conjunction with chemical or surgical castration, offers initial positive responses and leads to massive <b>prostate</b> <b>cell</b> death. However, cancer cells later appear as androgen-independent PCa. To investigate the role of AR in <b>prostate</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and survival, we introduced a vector-based small interfering RNA (siRNA). This siRNA targeted 5 '-untranslated region of AR mRNA for extended suppression of AR expression in androgen-sensitive human prostate LNCaP cells. Results The siRNA design successfully suppressed endogenous AR expression, as revealed by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells did not proliferate {{in the absence of}} AR and underwent apoptosis, based on elevated phospho-Histone H 2 B expression and higher number of apoptotic body as compared to control cells.

Wedelolactone (WDL), a medicinal plant-derived natural compound, is known to inhibit 5 -Lox activity in neutrophils. However, its effect on apoptosis in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> has not been addressed. Thus, we tested the effects of WDL on human <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> in vitro. We observed that WDL kills both androgen-sensitive as well as androgen-independent <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> in a dose-dependent manner by dramatically inducing apoptosis. We also found that WDL-induced apoptosis in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> is dependent on c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (c-JNK) and caspase- 3. Interestingly, WDL triggers apoptosis in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells</b> via downregulation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε), but without inhibition of Akt.

Future studies will evaluate the therapeutic potential of AxdAdB 3 -F/RGD in prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Selenium {{compounds}} {{are potential}} chemopreventive agents for prostate cancer. There are several proposed mechanisms for their anticancer effect, including enhanced apoptosis of transformed cells. Because the transcription factor nuclear factor-B (NF-B) is often constitutively activated in tumors {{and is a}} key antiapoptotic factor in mammalian cells, we tested whether selenium inhibited NF-B activity in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>cells.</b> In our work, we used sodium selenite and a novel synthetic compound, methylseleninic acid (MSeA), {{that served as a}} precursor of the putative active monomethyl metabolite methylselenol. We found that both selenium forms inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in DU 145 and JCA 1 <b>prostate</b> carcinoma <b>cells.</b> Sodium selenite and MeSeA, at the concentrations that induced apoptosis, inhibited NF-B DNA binding induced by tumor necrosis factor- and lipopolysaccharide in DU 145 and JCA 1 <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> Both compounds also inhibited B. Luciferase reporter activity in <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> A key to NF-B regulation is the inhibitory B (IB) proteins that in response to diverse stimuli are rapidly phosphorylated by IB kinase complex, ubiquitinated, and undergo degradation, releasing NF-B factor. We showed that sodium selenite and MSeA inhibited IB kinase activation and IB- phosphorylation and degradation induced by TNF- and lipopolysaccharide in <b>prostate</b> <b>cells.</b> NF-B blockage by IB- d. n. mutant resulted in the sensitization of <b>prostate</b> carcinoma <b>cells</b> to apoptosis induced by selenium compounds. These results suggest that selenium may target the NF-B activation pathway to exert, at least in part, its cancer chemopreventive effect in prostate...|$|R
