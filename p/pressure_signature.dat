This {{is especially true for}} minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed.

40|$|Officially, the Tu- 144 was {{the first}} supersonic-cruise, passenger-carrying {{aircraft}} to enter commercial service. Design, construction, and testing were {{carried out by the}} Soviet Union, flight certification was by the Soviet Union, and the only regular passenger flights were scheduled and flown across the territory of the Soviet Union. Although it was not introduced to international passenger service, there were many significant engineering accomplishments achieved in the design, production, and flight of this aircraft. Development of the aircraft began with a prototype stage. Systematic testing and redesign led to a production aircraft in discrete stages that measurably improved the performance of the aircraft from the starting concept to final aircraft certification. It flew in competition with the English-French Concorde for a short time, but was withdrawn from national commercial service {{due to a lack of}} interest by airlines outside the Soviet Union. NASA became interested in the Tu- 144 aircraft when it was offered for use as a flying "testbed" in the study of operating characteristics of a supersonic-cruise commercial airplane. Since it had been in supersonic-cruise service, the Tu- 144 had operational characteris'tics similar to those anticipated in the conceptual aircraft designs being studied by the United States aircraft companies. In addition to the other operational tests being conducted on the Tu- 144 aircraft, it was proposed that two sets of sonic-boom <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> measurements be made. The first set would be made on the ground, using techniques and devices similar to those in reference I and many other subsequent studies. A second set would be made in the air with an instrumented aircraft flying close under the Tu- 144 in supersonic flight. Such in-flight measurements would require pressure gages that were capable of accurately recording the flow-field overpressures generated by the Tu- 144 at relatively close distances under the vehicle. Therefore, an analysis of the Tu- 144 was made to obtain predictions of <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> shape and shock strengths at cruise conditions so that the range and characteristics of the required pressure gages could be determined well in advance of the tests. Cancellation of the sonic-boom signature measurement part of the tests removed the need for these pressure gages. Since CFD methods would be used to analyze the aerodynamic performance of the Tu- 144 and make similar <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> predictions, the relatively quick and simple Whitham-theory <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> predictions presented in this paper could be used for comparisons. <b>Pressure</b> <b>signature</b> predictions of sonic-boom disturbances from the Tu- 144 aircraft were obtained from geometry derived from a three-view description of the production aircraft. The geometry was used to calculate aerodynamic performance characteristics at supersonic-cruise conditions. These characteristics and Whitham/Walkden sonic-boom theory were employed to obtain F-functions and flow-field <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> predictions at a Mach number of 2. 2, at a cruise altitude of 61000 feet, and at a cruise weight of 350000 pounds...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the current}} impediments to the {{establishment}} of supersonic transports as a viable part of the commercial aviation fleet is the sonic boom effect.

40|$|Capillarity {{controls}} {{the distribution and}} transport of multiphase and immiscible fluids in soils and fractured rocks; therefore, capillarity affects the migration of nonaqueous contaminants and remediation strategies for both LNAPLs and DNAPLs, constrains gas and oil recovery, and regulates CO 2 injection and geological storage. Surfactants alter interfacial tension and modify the invasion of pores by immiscible fluids. Experiments are conducted to explore the propagation of fluid interfaces along cylindrical capillary tubes and across pore constrictions {{in the presence of}} surfactants.

An aircraft synthesis code in combination with CFD and an extrapolation method were used to close the design. The principal configuration of this study is designated LBWT (Low Boom Wing Tail) and has a highly swept cranked arrow wing with conventional tails, and was designed to accommodate either 3 or 4 engines.

The continuous data acquisition approach allows for accurate signatures approximately 15 times faster than a move-pause technique. These successful results provide an incentive for future testing with greatly increased efficiency using the continuous model translation technique with the single probe to measure sonic boom signatures.

40|$|A {{sonic boom}} {{signature}} {{with a long}} rise time {{has the ability to}} reduce the sonic boom, but it does not necessarily minimize the sonic boom at the ground level because of the real atmospheric turbulence. In this study, an effect of the turbulence on a long rise-time <b>pressure</b> <b>signature</b> was experimentally investigated in a ballistic range facility. To compare the effects of the turbulence on the long and short rise-time pressure signatures, a cone-cylinder projectile that simultaneously produces these pressure signatures was designed. The pressure waves interacted with a turbulent field generated by a circular nozzle. The turbulence effects were evaluated using flow diagnostic techniques: high-speed schlieren photography, a point-diffraction interferometer, and a pressure measurement.

A standard deviation increases by a factor of 14 because of the turbulence interaction.
