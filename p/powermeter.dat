Over a 3 day period, seven male (mean +/- SD; 180. 0 +/- 3. 0 cm; 86. 2 +/- 6. 1 kg) elite track cyclists completed two maximal 6 s cycle ergometer trials and two 65 m sprints on a moving bicycle; calibrated SRM <b>powermeters</b> were used and data were analyzed per revolution to establish torque and power-pedaling rate relationships, maximum power, maximum torque and maximum pedaling rate. The inertial load of our laboratory test was (37. 16 +/- 0. 37 kg m 2), approximately half as large as the field trials (69. 7 +/- 3. 8 kg m 2). There were no statistically significant differences between laboratory and field maximum power (1791 +/- 169; 1792 +/- 156 W; P = 0. 863), optimal pedaling rate (128 +/- 7; 129 +/- 9 rpm; P = 0. 863), torque- pedaling rate linear regression slope (- 1. 040 +/- 0. 09; - 1. 035 +/- 0. 10; P = 0. 891) and maximum torque (266 +/- 20; 266 +/- 13 Nm; P = 0. 840), respectively.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} in interval training for cyclists {{have led to}} the development of both heart rate (HR) monitors and <b>powermeters</b> (PM). Despite the growing popularity of PM use, the superiority of PM-based training has not been established. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative effectiveness of HR-based versus PM-based interval training on 20 km time trial (20 km TT), lactate threshold (LT) power, and peak aerobic capacity (VO 2 max) in recreational cyclists. Participants (n = 20; M age= 33. 9, SD = 13) completed a baseline 20 km TT to establish their VO 2 max and LT and were then randomly assigned to either HR-determined or PM-determined training sessions. Over a period of up to 5 weeks participants completed 7. 2 (± 1. 1) interval training sessions at their specific LT for their respective interval training method. Repeated measures analyses of variances (ANOVAs) showed that both HR-based and PM-based training groups significantly improved their LT power (F(1, 16) = 28., p < 0. 01, eta 2 = 0. 63) and 20 km TT time (F(1, 16) = 4. 92, p = 0. 04, eta 2 = 0. 24) at posttest, showing a 17 watt increase (9. 8 %) and a near 3 -and-a-half minute improvement (7. 8 %) in 20 km TT completion time. There were no significant group (HR vs. PM) x time (baseline vs. posttest) interactions for 20 km TT completion time, LT power, or VO 2 max ratings. Our results coincide with the literature supporting the effectiveness of interval training for endurance athletes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is no empirical evidence for the superiority of any single type of device in the implementation of interval training. This study indicates that there are no noticeable advantages to using PM to increase performance in the average recreational cyclist, suggesting that low cost HR monitor are equally capable as training device...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{ubiquity of}} the modern smartphone, coupled with its technical capabilities in terms of processing power, internet connectivity, and sensor richness, make it an ideal platformfor sensing all kinds of information about ourselves and the world around us. The emerging field of Mobile Phone Sensing (MPS) is taking advantage of this new technology, with applications in health care, traffic planning, social science, and more. However, with these new capabilities come new challenges as well, several of which we address in this dissertation. First, accurate, continuous, and instantaneous localization is needed both as a primary sensor of human mobility, and to place other sensor source into a spatial context. Second, scaling up experiments to potentially thousands of devices poses unique organizational and technological challenges. Third, energy consumption {{is of paramount importance}} in mobile devices where battery life time is a major constraint on what can be achieved, yet accurate, fine-grained energy analysis on mobile devices is still very difficult. We studied two aspects of smartphone localization. First, we explored howwell three different sensor modalities (GPS,Wi-Fi, and Geolocation) performon the task of finding when and where people dwell. We found that each of these offer roughly equal performance, but only when the signal is of sufficient quality. Therefore, coverage is an important issue. Another consequence {{of this study is that}} where available,Wi-Fi is a good substitute for the more energy-hungry GPS receiver on these tasks. Second, encouraged by this last result, we designed a novelWi-Fi scanning algorithm that reduces the energy consumption of this task by roughly half on modern smartphones. It achieves this by scanning as few channels as possible, thereby reducing the time taken by a scan, and thus the energy consumed. The algorithm visits the available channels in sequence of popularity, and terminates early when enough information has been gathered to provide a good location estimate. This early termination happens either when a certain number of access points has been found, or when during the scan it is discovered that the user has notmoved since the previous scan. We then turned to the scalability aspect of mobile phone sensing. MPS experiments are typically quantitative, which means that ideally as many test subjects as possible should be included in the study. Unfortunately smartphone experiments scale terribly in terms of number of participants because of several factors. First, experiments must be deployed to end-user’s phones, but application stores are not designed for the type of rapid prototyping and frequent re-deployment we envision. Second, there is a large organizational overhead involved in recruiting and incentivizing people to take part. Third, smartphone development is non-trivial, and a lot of domain knowledge is required to write successful applications that typical researchers don’t possess. To tackle these issues we developed a middleware called Pogo, which turns an ordinary Android smartphone into a node in a large-scale MPS test bed. We solve the deployment issue by allowing researchers to push their experiments directly to participating devices without involvement from the user. Once users have been recruited into a test bed, their resources and sensor data can be used for different experiments, and nodes may be shared between research groups. Finally, experiments running on the Pogo middleware are written in JavaScript using a simple yet flexible API, which hides the intricacies of Android programming. However, even though Pogo lowers the barrier for participation, users may still leave an experiment if the strain on their battery is too high. Energy efficiency is therefore a topic of major importance in the context of mobile phone sensing. From our own experience we found that accurate measurement and analysis of smartphone energy usage is cumbersome at best, primarily due to a lack of proper tooling. Accurate, high-resolution power meters such as the Monsoon power monitor provide a wealth of data, but interpreting these power traces is difficult without context. Moreover, these bulky <b>powermeters</b> cannot be used in-situ, which makes it impossible to measure power consumption with the end-user in the loop. To address these issues we developed Neat, a power analysis toolkit comprising a mobile power meter, and software that fuses recorded phone state (event logs) with the power trace post-facto to yield a single annotated power trace. The toolkit is scriptable, and can be used to automatically extract meaningful statistical data from hours-long traces. We have used Neat to explore power consumption of backgroundWi-Fi scanning and found two kernel bugs in the process. The scriptable nature of Neat made it easy to extract energy consumption profiles of notoriously hard to model OLED panels, and by processing power traces obtained from phones carried by end-users we have demonstrated Neat’s usefulness in real-world experiments.

LoA for mean power output were 0. 92 ×÷ 1. 02 (95 % LoA = 0. 90 – 0. 93).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) {{has been}} {{suggested}} to improve bone tissue healing. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this effect are still unclear but bone cell proliferation and differentiation alteration have been proposed. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate, in vitro, the effect of LLLT on bone cell proliferation, osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation, both involved in bone remodeling and regeneration. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine bone marrow cells, which contain both osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors, were cultured and induced to differentiate in the absence or in the presence of LLLT. Laser exposition parameters were determined using a <b>powermeter</b> and consisted in an 808 nm infrared wavelength laser light in continuous mode, with an energy density of 4 J/cm(2) administered three times a week. Cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed after specific staining and microscopic analysis of the cultures after various times, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of a panel of osteoblast and osteoclast markers after nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: The use of a <b>powermeter</b> revealed that the power emitted by the optical fiber of the laser device was markedly reduced compared to the displayed power. This allowed to adjust the LLLT parameters to a final energy density exposure of 4 J/cm(2). In these conditions, proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as well as osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation of the corresponding progenitors were found similar in control and LLLT conditions. CONCLUSION: Using the present experimental protocol, we concluded that an 808 nm wavelength infrared LLLT does not alter murine bone progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.
