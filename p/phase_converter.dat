5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a <b>phase</b> <b>converter</b> having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

The 106km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3kV 15Hz.

25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency single-phase AC {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating <b>phase</b> <b>converter</b> feeding a single traction motor of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The number of poles on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E

40|$|The Distributed Power Flow Controller (DPFC) {{is derived}} from the Unified power-flow {{controller}} (UPFC). The DPFC is a solution to control the power flow in a single transmission line. By eliminating the common DC link and distributing the three <b>phase</b> series <b>converters</b> of the UPFC, a new concept of the Distributed Power Flow Controller (DPFC) is achieved. The active power exchange between the two converters, which is through the common dc link in the UPFC, is now through the transmission lines at the third-harmonic frequency in the DPFC. It inherits the advantages of the UPFC and the DFACTS concept, which allow power flow control for multi-line systems with relatively low cost and high reliability without additional cost. This paper presents two types of DPFCs; one is one three <b>phase</b> shunt <b>converter</b> and four three <b>phase</b> series <b>converters.</b> Another model is one three <b>phase</b> shunt <b>converter</b> and nine single <b>phase</b> series <b>converters.</b> By using three <b>phase</b> series <b>converters,</b> no common dc link between shunt and series converters but cost will increases.
