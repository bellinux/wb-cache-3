5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. <b>Plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound <b>plasminogen,</b> unlike tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound <b>plasminogen.</b> Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating <b>plasminogen</b> and clot-bound <b>plasminogen,</b> it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|Imbalance of <b>Plasminogen</b> Activator Inhibitor Type-1 (PAI-1) and Tissue <b>Plasminogen</b> Activator (t-PA) Activity.|$|E
25|$|In closed <b>plasminogen,</b> {{access to}} the {{activation}} bond (R561/V562) targeted for cleavage by tPA and uPA is blocked through {{the position of the}} KR3/KR4 linker sequence and the O-linked sugar on T346. The position of KR3 may also hinder {{access to the}} activation loop. The Inter-domain interactions also block all kringle ligand-binding sites apart from that of KR-1, suggesting that the latter domain governs pro-enzyme recruitment to targets. Analysis of an intermediate <b>plasminogen</b> structure suggests that <b>plasminogen</b> conformational change to the open form is initiated through KR-5 transiently peeling away from the PAp domain. These movements expose the KR5 lysine-binding site to potential binding partners, and suggest a requirement for spatially distinct lysine residues in eliciting <b>plasminogen</b> recruitment and conformational change respectively.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} inhibitors of urokinase are the serpins <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), which inhibit the protease activity irreversibly. In the extracellular matrix, urokinase is {{tethered to the}} cell membrane by its interaction to the urokinase receptor.|$|E
25|$|The other PAI, <b>plasminogen</b> {{activator}} inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is secreted by {{the placenta}} and only present in significant amounts during pregnancy. In addition, protease nexin {{acts as an}} inhibitor of tPA and urokinase. PAI-1, however, is the main inhibitor of the <b>plasminogen</b> activators.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that functions {{as the principal}} inhibitor of tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of <b>plasminogen</b> and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots). It is a {{serine protease}} inhibitor (serpin) protein (SERPINE1).|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is {{generated}} by proteolytic cleavage of <b>plasminogen,</b> a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasminogen</b> {{activator}} inhibitor-1 {{has been}} shown to interact with ORM1.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin II {{increases}} {{synthesis of}} <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1, so it accelerates {{the development of}} atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin {{deficiency}} {{may lead}} to thrombosis, as clots are not adequately degraded. <b>Plasminogen</b> deficiency in mice leads to defective liver repair, defective wound healing, reproductive abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of atherogenesis. Because of its structural similarity to <b>plasminogen</b> and tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator, competitive inhibition leads to reduced fibrinolysis, {{and as a result of}} the stimulation of secretion of <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor 1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and tissue repair, interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix. Apo(a), a distinct feature of the Lp(a) particle, binds to immobilized fibronectin and endows Lp(a) with the serine-proteinase-type proteolytic activity.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis-based tumor therapy {{relies on}} natural and {{synthetic}} angiogenesis inhibitors like angiostatin, endostatin and tumstatin. These are proteins that mainly originate as specific fragments of pre-existing structural proteins like collagen or <b>plasminogen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{expression}} {{levels of}} urokinase {{and several other}} components of the <b>plasminogen</b> activation system {{are found to be}} correlated with tumor malignancy. It is believed that the tissue degradation following <b>plasminogen</b> activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to metastasis. This makes urokinase an attractive drug target, and, so, inhibitors have been sought to be used as anticancer agents. However, incompatibilities between the human and murine systems hamper clinical evaluation of these agents. Through its interaction with the urokinase receptor, urokinase affects several other aspects of cancer biology such as cell adhesion, migration, and cellular mitotic pathways.|$|E
25|$|Postmortem {{studies of}} the BBB, {{especially}} the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase <b>plasminogen</b> activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type <b>plasminogen</b> {{activator}} (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is <b>plasminogen,</b> which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|Circulation or {{clotting}} conditions, such as peripheral vascular disease, polycythemia vera, sickle-cell anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, <b>plasminogen</b> or fibrinolysis disorders, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, or antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1's main {{function}} entails the inhibition of urokinase <b>plasminogen</b> activator (uPA), an enzyme {{responsible for the}} cleavage of <b>plasminogen</b> to form plasmin. Plasmin mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix either by itself or in conjunction with matrix metalloproteinases. In this scenario, PAI-1 inhibits uPA via active site binding, preventing the formation of plasmin. Additional inhibition is mediated by PAI-1 binding to the uPA/uPA receptor complex, resulting in the latter's degradation. Thus, PAI {{can be said to}} inhibit the serine proteases tPA and uPA/urokinase, and hence is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, the physiological process that degrades blood clots. In addition, PAI-1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which {{play a crucial role in}} invasion of malignant cells through the basal lamina.|$|E
25|$|Thrombolysis is the {{pharmacological}} {{destruction of}} blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including recombitant tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator, which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body's enzymes. This carries {{an increased risk}} of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations (such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism).|$|E
25|$|PEDF {{expression}} is upregulated by <b>plasminogen</b> kringle domains 1-4 (also known as angiostatin) and the kringle 5 (K5) domain. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, {{leads to the}} downregulation of PEDF. This effect is due to hypoxic conditions causing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to proteolytically degrade PEDF. In addition, amyloid beta {{has been shown to}} decrease PEDF mRNA levels.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} useful {{metabolic}} markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors {{that are used to}} predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2 to identify patients at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2 and SCD1 for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and urokinase <b>plasminogen</b> activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} {{endotoxin}} is the {{mechanism by which}} Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|The HIV {{viral protein}} gp120 induces {{apoptosis}} of neuronal cells by inhibiting levels of furin and tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator, enzymes responsible for converting pBDNF to mBDNF. gp120 induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases which {{may influence the}} upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells, gp120 induces oxidative stress in the neuronal cells, {{and it is also}} known to activate STAT1 and induce interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in neuronal cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of proteases is inhibited by protease inhibitors. One example of protease inhibitors is the serpin superfamily. It includes alpha 1-antitrypsin (which protects {{the body from}} excessive effects its own inflammatory proteases), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (which does likewise), C1-inhibitor (which protects the body from excessive protease-triggered activation of its own complement system), antithrombin (which protects the body from excessive coagulation), <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (which protects the body from inadequate coagulation by blocking protease-triggered fibrinolysis), and neuroserpin.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} PE include {{beginning}} {{to move as}} soon as possible after surgery, lower leg exercises during periods of sitting, and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery. Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin. Often these are recommended for six months or longer. Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (tPA), or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy. If blood thinners are not appropriate, a vena cava filter may be used.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens affect liver protein {{synthesis}} and thereby influence the cardiovascular system. They {{have been found}} to affect the production of a variety of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, including increased factor IX, von Willebrand factor, thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT), fragment 1+2, and D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen, factor VII, antithrombin, protein S, protein C, tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (t-PA), and <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Although this is true for oral estrogen, transdermal estradiol has been found only to reduce PAI-1 and protein S, {{and to a lesser extent}} than oral estrogen. Due to its effects on liver {{protein synthesis}}, oral estrogen is procoagulant, and has been found to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure). However, a small but significant increase in the risk of stroke, though not of myocardial infarction, has been found in menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. An increase in the risk of stroke has also been associated with older high-dose oral contraceptives that are no longer used.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanisms by}} which drotrecogin exerts its effect on survival in patients with severe sepsis is not completely understood. In vitro data suggest that activated protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, {{and that it has}} indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In vitro data also suggest that activated protein C may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production, by blocking leukocyte adhesion to selectins, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses within the microvascular endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{assists in}} {{the conversion of}} <b>plasminogen</b> to plasmin, resulting in fibrinolysis. The breakdown of clots results in an excess of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess plasmin also activates the complement and kinin systems. Activation of these systems leads {{to many of the}} clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibit, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Proper CVD {{management}} necessitates a {{focus on}} MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle income levels. Regarding MI, strategies using aspirin, atenolol, streptokinase or tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator have been compared for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in regions of low and middle income. The costs for a single QALY for aspirin, atenolol, streptokinase, and t-PA were $25, $630–$730, and $16,000, respectively. Aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins used together for secondary CVD prevention in the same regions showed single QALY costs of $300–400.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metals such as {{lead and}} cadmium have {{been implicated in}} osteoporosis. Cadmium and lead {{promotes}} the synthesis of <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which is the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis (the mechanism by which the body breaks down clots) and {{shown to be a}} cause of hypofibrinolysis. Persistent blood clots can lead to congestive blood flow (hyperemia) in bone marrow, impaired blood flow and ischaemia in bone tissue resulting in lack of oxygen (hypoxia), bone cell damage and eventual cell death (apoptosis). Of significance {{is the fact that the}} average concentration of cadmium in human bones in the 20th century has increased to about 10 times above the pre-industrial level.|$|E
25|$|Many useful {{proteins}} {{are currently}} available as recombinant products. These include--(1) medically useful proteins whose administration can correct a defective or poorly expressed gene (e.g. recombinant factor VIII, a blood-clotting factor deficient in {{some forms of}} hemophilia, and recombinant insulin, used to treat some forms of diabetes), (2) proteins that can be administered to assist in a life-threatening emergency (e.g. tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator, used to treat strokes), (3) recombinant subunit vaccines, in which a purified protein {{can be used to}} immunize patients against infectious diseases, without exposing them to the infectious agent itself (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine), and (4) recombinant proteins as standard material for diagnostic laboratory tests.|$|E
25|$|The glymphatic {{system may}} also be {{impaired}} after acute brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 2014, a group of researchers from the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) demonstrated by MRI that the glymphatic system was impaired after subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{because of the presence}} of coagulated blood in the paravascular spaces. Interestingly, injection of tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (a fibrinolytic drug) in the CSF improved glymphatic functioning. In a parallel study, they also demonstrated that the glymphatic system was impaired after ischemic stroke in the ischemic hemisphere, although the pathophysiological basis of this phenomenon remains unclear. Notably, recanalization of the occluded artery also reestablished the glymphatic flow.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 34 studies found a reduced risk of mortality from {{coronary heart disease}} in men who drank 2 - 4 drinks per day and women who drank 1 - 2 drinks per day. Alcohol {{has been found to}} have anticoagulant properties. Thrombosis is lower among moderate drinkers than abstainers.Ridker, P., et al. Moderate alcohol intake may reduce risk of thrombosis. American Medical Association press release, September 22, 1994 A {{meta-analysis of}} randomized trials found that alcohol consumption in moderation decreases serum levels of fibrinogen, a protein that promotes clot formation, while it increases levels of tissue type <b>plasminogen</b> activator, an enzyme that helps dissolve clots. These changes were estimated to reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 24%. Another meta-analysis in 2011 found favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, and fibrinogen associated with moderate alcohol consumption.|$|E
25|$|Thrombolysis, such as with {{recombinant}} tissue <b>plasminogen</b> activator (rtPA), {{in acute}} ischemic stroke, when given within {{three hours of}} symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability. It does not, however, improve chances of survival. Benefit is greater the earlier it is used. Between three and {{four and a half}} hours the effects are less clear. A 2014 review found a 5% {{increase in the number of}} people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term. After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated. There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of <b>plasminogen</b> to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E
