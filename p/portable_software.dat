25|$|In 1972, Unix {{was rewritten}} in the C {{programming}} language. The migration from assembly to the higher-level language C resulted {{in much more}} <b>portable</b> <b>software,</b> requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as Research Unix. In 1975, the first source license for UNIX was sold to Donald B. Gillies at the University of Illinois Department of Computer Science. UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson (who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs) was instrumental in negotiating the terms of this license.|$|E

500|$|In a United States {{hardware}} sales {{estimate for}} July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month earlier, about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price {{to match the}} DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012. Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line's [...] "final send-off" [...] and expects [...] "by {{this time next year}} its contributions to the market will be minuscule. After Christmas, Nintendo will effectively be a single-handheld system company, putting all of <b>portable</b> <b>software</b> efforts into the Nintendo 3DS." ...|$|E

Keywords: Computer-aided design, control libraries, numerical software, model reduction. 1 Introduction The development of efficient, reliable, and <b>portable</b> numerical <b>software</b> requires joining expertise in the application domain, in numerical mathematics, in numerical programming, and in numerical software engineering. Hence the development of tested, production-quality numerical software is a challenging and time-consuming task which involves cooperative efforts over a lasting period of time. <b>Portable</b> numerical <b>software</b> written in Fortran for computer-aided control systems design (CACSD) is provided [...] ...|$|R
