40|$|The {{investigation}} of ultrathin films which {{are sensitive to}} ambient air at large scale instruments is a challenge as the capabilities for on-site growth UHV chambers to measure in-situ are often limited, mostly due to lacking space. A common solution {{is the use of}} <b>protecting</b> <b>cap</b> layers on top of the films. However they might change the physical properties of the sample. Our solution is a handy mini UHV-chamber which is used for sample transfer and quasi in-situ measurements at the neutron reflectivity instrument MARIA of the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science at MLZ in Garching. The samples are prepared in the adjacent thin film laboratory by molecular beam epitaxy and moved into the compact chamber for transfer. It is equipped with sapphire windows, an SAES getter pump and a wobble stick, which serves also as a sample holder for samples of up to 1. 4 cm^ 2. The pressure in the transfer chamber is kept below 10 ^- 9 mbar. Neutron reflectivity measurements can be performed at room temperature in magnetic fields of up to 600 mT. We present first polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on Co thin films at room temperature in a magnetic field of 300 mT in the Q-range up to 0. 2 Å^- 1...|$|E
40|$|MARIA, {{belonging}} to JCNS at MLZ in Garching, is a dedicated versatile instrument for polarised neutron reflectometry (PNR) and grazing incidence small angle neutron scattering (GISANS) studies of ultra-thin films. However, due to limited space a UHV system for thin film growth and in-situ measurements cannot be placed on-site. Hence, {{up to now}} ultra thin films which are sensitive to ambient air have been fabricated in the MBE system located in the thin film laboratory nearby and were covered by <b>protecting</b> <b>cap</b> layers in-situ. However these layers may change the physical properties of the sample, which is undesirable and prevents from further manipulation of the sample, e. g. growth of additional layers. Recently, we have solved this problem by developing a handy mini UHV-chamber which is capable for both, sample transfer and quasi in-situ measurements at the neutron reflectivity instrument, respectively. Quasi in-situ polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) measurements can be performed at room temperature in magnetic fields of up to 600 mT at MARIA. Our solution consists of a DN CF- 40 cube with two opposing sapphire windows for the neutron beam, a combined non evaporable getter and ion pump for keeping the vacuum, a wobble stick, which is needed for in-situ sample transfer and also serves as sample holder for samples of up to 1 cm 2 and a valve for sample exchange by mounting the chamber on the MBE system. The pressure in the transfer chamber is kept in the 10 − 10 mbar range during transport and PNR measurement. We present first polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on Co ultra-thin films at room temperature at different magnetic fields in the Q-range up to 0. 2 Å− 1. Booking of the access to the MBE system {{as well as the}} transport chamber is possible via the MLZ user office system in combination with an application for a beam time at neutron instruments like MARIA.

It is said that the grease does not prevent the full action of the cap upon the powder. A sportsman has recommended to me a couple of well-marked caps, into the heads of which small wads of cork have been fitted; he uses them for loaded guns that are to be laid by for some hours or days.

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} structures {{at the end}} of eukaryotic chromosomes {{that are}} required to preserve genome integrity, chromosome stability and nuclear architecture. Telomere maintenance and function are established epigenetically in several eukaryotes. However, the exact chromatin enzymatic modifications regulating telomere homeostasis are poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, telomere length and stability are maintained through the retrotransposition of specialized telomeric sequences and by the specific loading of <b>protecting</b> <b>capping</b> proteins, respectively. Here, we show that the loss of the essential and evolutionarily conserved histone deacetylase Rpd 3, the homolog of mammalian HDAC 1, causes aberrant telomeric fusions on polytene chromosome ends. Remarkably, these telomere fusion defects are associated with a marked decrease of histone H 4 acetylation, as well as an accumulation of heterochromatic epigenetic marks at telomeres, including histone H 3 K 9 trimethylation and the heterochromatic protein HP 2. Our work suggests that Drosophila telomere structure is epigenetically regulated by the histone deacetylase Rpd 3. © 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Cationic {{antimicrobial}} peptides (CAPs) are {{an important}} component of the innate immune system and are instrumental in the elimination of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, yeast, fungi and cancerous cells from the body. CAPs are comprised of less than 100 amino acids and have a net positive charge due to a multitude of basic residues in their primary sequences. CAPs exert their antimicrobial activity primarily through the formation of pores in microbial membranes, but also play important immunostimulatory roles in the body. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are negatively charged, polydisperse linear polysaccharides found at cellular surfaces. Although many protein-binding interactions of the GAG family, including heparin and heparan sulfate, have been well-characterized, it is not known to what extent endogenous GAGs affect the innate immune system. In the studies here the modulatory activities of GAGs and other polyanionic polysaccharides (PPSs) on CAPs were probed. Initial studies focused on interactions between a short peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin and GAGs. GAGs and other PPSs were then tested for their ability to modulate the antimicrobial activities of a number of CAPs against Gram-positive and -negative organisms. GAGs were also tested for the ability to modulate CAPs binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. CAP affinities for the GAGs were determined from lipopolysaccharide competition binding assays. Finally GAGs were evaluated for the ability to <b>protect</b> <b>CAPs</b> from proteolytic degradation.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: A {{critical}} function of telomeres {{is to prevent}} fusion of chromosome ends by the DNA repair machinery. In Drosophila somatic cells, assembly of the <b>protecting</b> <b>capping</b> complex at telomeres notably involves the recruitment of HOAP, HP 1, and their recently identified partner, HipHop. We previously showed that the hiphop gene was duplicated before the radiation of the melanogaster subgroup of species, giving birth to K 81, a unique paternal effect gene specifically expressed in the male germline. RESULTS: Here we show that K 81 specifically associates with telomeres during spermiogenesis, along with HOAP and HP 1, and is retained on paternal chromosomes until zygote formation. In K 81 mutant testes, capping proteins are not maintained at telomeres in differentiating spermatids, resulting in the transmission of uncapped paternal chromosomes that fail to properly divide during the first zygotic mitosis. Despite the apparent similar capping roles of K 81 and HipHop in their respective domain of expression, we demonstrate by in vivo reciprocal complementation analyses {{that they are not}} interchangeable. Strikingly, HipHop appeared to be unable to maintain capping proteins at telomeres during the global chromatin remodeling of spermatid nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that K 81 is essential for the maintenance of capping proteins at telomeres in postmeiotic male germ cells. In species of the melanogaster subgroup, HipHop and K 81 have not only acquired complementary expression domains, they have also functionally diverged following the gene duplication event.

Intervention group participants were also eligible for the ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) RCT evaluating active monitoring, radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy treatments for localised prostate cancer. In ProtecT, over 1500 of around 3000 men with prostate cancer were randomised from over 10, 000 with an elevated PSA in around 111, 000 attendees at clinics. Investigation of the psychological impact of screening in a sub-sample showed that 10 % of men still experienced high distress up to 3 months following prostate biopsies (22 / 227), although most were relatively unaffected. The risk of prostate cancer with a raised PSA was lower if urinary symptoms were present (frequent nocturia odds ratio (OR) 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 22 - 0. 83) or if a repeat PSA decreased by > or = 20 % prior to biopsy (OR 0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 52).
