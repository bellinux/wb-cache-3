40|$|A {{technique}} is described for assembly of multiple batches of micro components onto a single substrate. The substrate is prepared with hydrophobic alkanethiol-coated gold binding sites. To perform assembly, a hydrocarbon oil, which {{is applied to}} the substrate, wets exclusively the hydrophobic binding sites in water. Micro components are then added to the water, and assembled on the oil-wetted binding sites. Moreover, assembly can be controlled to take place on desired binding sites by using an electrochemical method to deactivate specific substrate binding sites. By repeatedly applying this technique, different batches of micro components can be sequentially assembled to a single substrate. As a <b>post</b> <b>assembly</b> procedure, electroplating is incorporated into the technique to establish electrical connections for assembled components. Important issues presented are: substrate fabrication techniques, electrochemical modulation by using a suitable alkanethiol (dodecanethiol), electroplating of tin and lead alloy and binding site design simulations.

40|$|The new U. S. National Vision for Space Exploration {{requires}} {{many new}} enabling technologies {{to accomplish the}} goals of space commercialization and returning humans {{to the moon and}} extraterrestrial environments. Traditionally, flight elements are complete subsystems requiring humans to complete the integration and assembly. These bulky structures also require the use of heavy launch vehicles to send the units to a desired location. This philosophy necessitates a high degree of safety, numerous space walks at a significant cost. Future space mission costs must be reduced and safety increased to reasonably achieve exploration goals. One proposed concept is the autonomous assembly of space structures. This concept is an affordable, reliable solution to in-space and extraterrestrial assembly. Assembly is autonomously performed when two components join after determining that specifications are correct. Local sensors continue monitor joint integrity <b>post</b> <b>assembly,</b> which is critical for safety and structural reliability. Achieving this concept requires a change in space structure design philosophy and the development of innovative technologies to perform autonomous assembly.

This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel concept for assembling space structures autonomously. Core technologies required to achieve in space assembly are presented. These core technologies are critical to the goal of utilizing space in a cost efficient and safe manner.

40|$|As {{quantum dot}} (QD) {{synthesis}} techniques and device architectures advance, {{it has become}} increasingly apparent that new ways of connecting QDs with each other and the external environment are required in order to realize the considerable potential of QDs for optoelectronic applications. Throughout my PhD studies at Cornell, I have worked to establish the scientific and engineering foundation for processing techniques to produce designer materials from QD building blocks. Specifically, I have investigated two general processing methods, thermal annealing and solution based chemical treatments to remove or replace the insulating native ligands and produce electronically coupled thin films. In a series of studies on thermal annealing of QD films across 10 orders of magnitude in time, I show how nonequilibrium laser annealing over ns and [mu]s can be used to precisely control the structure of QD thin films to increase electronic coupling while maintaining quantum confinement, how in situ studies of QDs arranged in a periodic nanoreactor can shed light on QD fusion at the second to minute time scale, and how spatial temperature gradients during nonequilibrium laser annealing can be exploited to reveal that QD sintering is a thermally activated process with a constant activation energy over two orders of magnitude of QD growth rate. My work on chemical processing of QD films focuses on low temperature solution processing methods. I demonstrate how simultaneous cation and ligand exchange at the surface of QDs can electronically couple and passivate QD films in a single step, leading to a 4 fold increase in Förster resonant energy transfer rate and order of magnitude reduction in trap density. Through controlled removal of ligands and <b>post</b> <b>assembly</b> QD growth, I show how building epitaxial bonds among QDs in a long range ordered assembly can lead to a ~ 3 order of magnitude increase in the mobility of carriers in QD films. This work is an illustration of how detailed understanding of the processing-structureproperty relationships in QD assemblies over multiple length scales can produce functional thin films with properties by design. Further advances that build on this work and others will take full advantage of the unprecedented flexibility provided by the size tunable properties of QDs to expand the periodic table into another dimension and drive materials innovation. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|E

40|$|Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) {{has shown}} great {{potential}} in molecular diagnostics, antisense/antigene therapy and nanotechnology. Like other synthetic nucleic acids and artificial analogues, PNA {{has been extensively}} modified to achieve better performance in these applications. To efficiently develop PNA probes for molecular diagnosis, this thesis is focused on versatile functionalization of PNA via post-synthetic click chemistry. Chapter 2 presents the synthesis of quencher-free PNA molecular beacons (MBs) targeting a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) sequence mutation. To avoid the tedious synthesis of functionalized PNA monomers for probe development, a simple approach to modify PNA oligomers by post-synthetic on-resin click chemistry was developed. Precursor PNA MBs were prepared by incorporation of azide-containing monomers into the oligomer by automatic solid-phase peptide synthesis and subsequent derivatization with pyrene moieties by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) produced the functional MBs. Two pyrene-based quencher-free PNA molecular beacons, a stemless MB and one possessing a stem-loop structure, both targeting {{a portion of the}} cystic fibrosis gene, were successfully synthesized by this method. Fluorescence studies showed that the stem-loop MB exhibited better discrimination of changes in excimer/monomer ratios as compared to the stemless MB construct and showed promise as MB for detection of this CFTR mutation. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of PNA MBs targeting CFTR mutation via a “click-couple-click” method. Unlike the well-known synthetic procedure of conventional PNA MBs that requires different protection strategies on the sites where fluorophores and quenchers are attached, an on-resin “click-couple-click” approach that includes microwave-assisted on-resin CuAAC of a quencher to PNA, coupling of an azide-containing PNA monomer and another on-resin CuAAC of a fluorophore without need of protecting reactive sites. By using this method, various PNA MBs have been successfully synthesized and characterized. Chapter 4 discloses the simultaneous, multiple conjugation of alkynyl-(Gd(III) -DOTA) to a PNA oligomer possessing azide residues in a single post-synthetic CuAAC reaction. The resulting probe, (Gd(III) -DOTA) 4 -PNA, has potential as a MRI contrast agent. Conceptually by binding to the target, poly(rA) tail of mRNA, Gd ions would be significantly loaded to a localized microenvironment, which may improve the enhancement of contrast in MR images. The in vitro MR characteristics of this probe is presented. With the interest in the conjugation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to PNA for the development of targeted contrast agents for CT imaging, preliminary studies have been carried out by conjugating an oligopeptide to AuNPs. Chapter 5 introduces a new method combining an interfacial strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition and <b>post</b> <b>assembly</b> deprotection (SPAAC-PAD) for the well-defined functionalization of small, water-soluble gold nanoparticles with oligopeptides. This approach will enable the fabrication of gold nanoparticles {{with a high degree of}} complexity with biomolecules for a variety of applications in targeted cancer diagnosis and therapies...|$|E
