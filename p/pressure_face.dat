40|$|A {{laboratory}} study assessed {{the impacts of}} water spray <b>pressure,</b> <b>face</b> ventilation quantity, and line brattice setback distance on respirable dust and SF 6 tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine using a sprayfan or directional spray system. Dust levels were measured at locations representing the mining machine operator and the standard and off-standard shuttle car operators, and in the return airway. The results showed that changes in all three independent variables significantly affected log-transformed dust levels at the three operator sampling locations. Changes in setback distance impacted return airway dust levels. Laboratory testing also identified numerous variable interactions affecting dust levels. Tracer gas levels were measured {{on the left and}} right sides of the cutting drum and in the return. Untransformed gas levels around the cutting drum were significantly affected by changes in water <b>pressure,</b> <b>face</b> ventilation quantity, and setback distance. Only a few interactions were identified that significantly affected these concentrations. Gas levels in the return airway were grouped by face ventilation quantity. Return gas levels measured at the low curtain quantity were generally unaffected by changes in water pressure or curtain setback distance. At the high curtain quantity, return airway gas levels were affected by curtain setback distance. A field study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} these parameters in an actual mining operation. These data showed that respirable dust levels may have been impacted by a change in water pressure and, to a lesser extent, by an increase in curtain setback distance. A series of tracer gas pulse tests were also conducted during this study. The results showed that effectiveness of the face ventilation was impacted by changes in curtain flow quantity and setback distance. Laboratory testing supported similar conclusions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to present {{experimental}} results obtained on a fan composed of a radial impeller matched with a vaned diffuser. There is no volute downstream to the diffuser. Consequently the diffuser outlet is at free air. The particularity of this machinery is that the diffuser design flow rate corresponds to 80 % of the impeller one. Investigations have been made for five different flow rates. Global performances of the machine are evaluated thanks to pressure measurements and averaged velocities obtain with a three holes probe, at nine angular positions at diffuser inlet and outlet just as five radial positions in a middle section of a blade-to-blade passage. In order to better characterize separations observed in previous experimental and numerical studies unsteady pressure measurement campaigns have been carried out. The transducers are located at five positions on the <b>pressure</b> <b>face</b> and four positions on the suction face on diffuser vanes in a blade-to-blade plane. For each position, three transducers are located at three different heights, from hub to shroud.

40|$|Silver {{and copper}} halides {{generally}} display an abrupt (first-order) {{transition to the}} superionic state. However, powder diffraction studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AgI under hydrostatic pressure both indicate that a continuous superionic transition occurs on heating. The gradual onset of the highly conducting state is accompanied by an increasing fraction of dynamic Frenkel defects, a peak in the specific heat and anomalous behavior of the lattice expansion. Similar methods have been employed to investigate the proposed continuous superionic transition between the two ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>face</b> centered cubic phases of CuI. This is difficult to examine experimentally, because the hexagonal β phase exists over a narrow temperature range between the γ (cation ordered) and a (cation disordered) phases. MD simulations performed with the simulation box constrained to remain cubic at all temperatures show that, although limited Cu+ Frenkel disorder occurs within γ-CuI, CuI undergoes an abrupt superionic transition at 670 K to the superionic a phase. This is supported by powder neutron diffraction studies of CuI lightly doped with Cs+ to prevent stabilization of the β phase. The implications of these results on the phase transitions of other copper and silver halide superionic conductors are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The linear phenomenological {{equations}} giving particle {{and practical}} fluxes {{of a single}} electrolyte across an ion-selective membrane are stated and interrelated. It is shown that the experimental measurements commonly made in biological and synthetic membrane studies may be used, with minor modification, to obtain the phenomenological transport coefficients and their concentration dependences. It is demonstrated that the electrical properties of a homogeneous membrane may be obtained as functions of the bathing solution concentration by combining fluxes measured under open and short circuit. Attention is paid {{to the use of}} radiotracers when measuring ionic fluxes. To obtain all the phenomenological coefficients at least one measurement must be made under a pressure gradient. The experimental difficulties in such measurements are discussed and the merits and demerits of various experiments considered. The problems of measuring potentials and concentrations at the low <b>pressure</b> <b>face</b> of a supported membrane make several mathematically simple approaches experimentally unattractive. The best methods appear to be either the measurement of a succession of “apparent osmotic pressures” under concentration differences sufficiently small that the membrane does not require support or the study of “reverse osmosis”. Sets of equations are given which enable the phenomenological coefficients to be evaluated from convenient experiments. With a stable homogeneous membrane nine coefficients may be obtained thus enabling either the applicability of the reciprocal relations or the applicability of linear theory under the conditions of the experiments to be tested. For a discontinuous system the six independent coefficients may be obtained from experiments in a single membrane cell...|$|E
40|$|ASME 2010 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, IMECE 2010, Vancouver, BC, 12 - 18 November 2010 Mixing of liquids in {{rotating}} micro-channel is {{studied as}} it has important applications in portable diagnostic devices in rotating lab-on-achip. The latter utilizes rotation to pump liquid samples and reagents, and to actuate mixing between different liquids during transport in the channel using secondary flow generated from rotation. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a rotating platform wherein two liquids are directed from their respective reservoirs through small capillaries into a common channel when the centrifugal force generated from rotation exceeds the capillary force which initially traps the liquid in their respective reservoirs. As two liquids are combined to flow through a common channel directed radially outward, Coriolis acceleration which is proportional to the rotation speed and relative radial velocity of the fluids, induces a tangential acceleration and thus velocity component that directs opposite to the direction of rotation. As this cross-flow, predominantly with maximum effect {{at the center of the}} channel, intercepts the far wall (i. e. <b>pressure</b> <b>face)</b> it splits up into two streams returning the flow back to the leading (in direction of rotation) face of the channel. This produces two main vortices/circulations for the channel and smaller vortices at the four corners for a channel with a rectangular cross-section. These vortices specifically the two main vortices are responsible for mixing of momentum, mass and energy in the cross-flow direction as the throughflow moves radially outward along the channel from small to a large radius. In the reference frame of the rotating channel, the combination of throughflow and crossflow results in two cork screw-shaped helical flow pattern streaming down the rotating channel. Connected with a microscope to view in details of the mixing in a small area, a rotating camera, mounted to the rotating platform, is used to take video of the mixing at various locations along a radial channel 30 -mm in length and 1 mm width. This test is repeated for other observation locations along the channel. All the tests under identical rotation speed are grouped together to provide a full record of the mixing in the entire channel. These results can also be examined as mixing under same rotation speed but different channel lengths. Obviously, increasing length enhances mixing especially at small channel lengths under 5 - 10 mm. However, between 10 - 30 mm downstream mixing is diminished. It was also found that higher rotation speed can indeed produces better mixing with a modest increase.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} improves {{our understanding}} of Asian consumers by providing {{a new perspective on}} the role of face in consumer decision-making. This dissertation develops a theory of <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> which argues that consumers consider the effects of their decisions on their face (e. g. saving face) during the decision-making process and this exerts a pressure on conspicuous consumption intentions. This research contributes to the literature by fundamentally re-conceptualizing the role of face in the decision-making process to be a direct motivator of specific behavior. This conceptualization also incorporates important aspects of face that are critical to understanding its role in decision-making. The theory of <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> considers <b>face</b> a direct motivator of behavior and, due to this novel perspective, identifies a pair of <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> motivations-a motivation to gain face and a motivation to avoid the loss of face. It also captures the interdependence of face which theorizes that an individual’s behavior impacts the face of others. Finally, the theory of <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> hypothesizes that <b>face</b> is context specific and the influence of <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> will depend on the consumption context. A scale to measure <b>face</b> <b>pressure</b> is developed and, over four studies, evidence is provided t...|$|R

Indeed, difference between affiliated and unaffiliated analysts’ recommendations is statistically significant over one, three or five year horizon. The timing of recommendations specifies that investors {{pay more attention to}} affiliated analysts’ recommendations made later in the aftermarket.
