40|$|Recent {{clinical}} studies demonstrate that serum levels of {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) are significantly decreased in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and that antidepressant treatments reverse this effect, indicating that serum BDNF is a biomarker of MDD. These findings raise the possibility that serum BDNF may also have effects on neuronal activity and behavior, but the functional significance of altered serum BDNF is unknown. To address this issue, we determined the influence of <b>peripheral</b> BDNF <b>administration</b> on depression- and anxiety-like behavior, including the forced swim test (FST), chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) /anhedonia, novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test, and elevated-plus maze (EPM). Furthermore, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal and striatal expression of BDNF, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), {{in order to determine}} whether peripherally administered BDNF produces antidepressant-like cellular responses in the brain. <b>Peripheral</b> BDNF <b>administration</b> increased mobility in the FST, attenuated the effects of CUS on sucrose consumption, decreased latency in the NIH test, and increased time spent in the open arms of an EPM. Moreover, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was increased after chronic, <b>peripheral</b> BDNF <b>administration.</b> We also found that BDNF levels as well as expression of pCREB and pERK were elevated in the hippocampus of adult mice receiving peripheral BDNF. Taken together, these results indicate that peripheral/serum BDNF may not only represent a biomarker of MDD, but also have functional consequences on molecular signaling substrates, neurogenesis, and behavior...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that acetaldehyde, the first product of ethanol metabolism, is involved in the locomotor stimulant effects of ethanol in mice, although it has never been formally tested whether acetaldehyde injected directly into the brain of mice has stimulant properties. Recently, it was also shown in rats that both ethanol and acetaldehyde can induce opposite locomotor effects according to the route of <b>administration.</b> Whereas <b>peripheral</b> <b>administrations</b> of ethanol and acetaldehyde induced locomotor depressant effects, their infusions directly into the brain produced locomotor stimulation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize in mice the locomotor effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde injected either peripherally by the intraperitoneal route or centrally into the brain ventricles. Additionally, the effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde were compared in two strains of mice known for their differential sensitivity to the locomotor effects of ethanol, namely Swiss and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Ethanol induced a biphasic effect on locomotor activity in Swiss mice, with stimulant effects at low to moderate doses and depressant effects at higher doses. Such a profile of effects was observed whatever the route of <b>administration,</b> <b>peripheral</b> or central. In C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, ethanol only induced monophasic depressant effects. In this mouse strain, no evidence of the stimulant effects of ethanol was found after either an i. p. or an i. c. v. administration of ethanol. In contrast to ethanol, acetaldehyde yielded only depressant effects in both strains of mice after both <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>administrations.</b> These results indicate that the route of administration does not alter the locomotor effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde in mice.

PYY-knockout female mice increase in body weight and fat mass.

50|$|Dieters {{who lose}} weight, {{particularly}} {{those with an}} overabundance of fat cells, experience a drop in levels of circulating leptin.

It is the antagonist of cholecystokinin and inhibits the pancreatic secretion which is stimulated by cholecystokinin. On fasting, PP seric concentration is 80 pg/ml; after the meal, it rises up from 8 to 10 times more; glucose and fats also induce PP's level increase, but on parenteral introduction of those substances, the level of hormones doesn't change. The administration of atropine, the vagotomy, blocks the PP's after-meal secretion. The excitation of the vagus nerve, the administration of gastrin, secretin or cholecystokinin induce PP secretion.|$|E

To investigate, etanercept was labeled with a positron emitter to enable visualization of its intracranial distribution following <b>peripheral</b> <b>administration</b> by PET in an animal model. Findings Radiolabeling of etanercept with the PET emitter 64 Cu was performed by DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazadodecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid) conjugation of etanercept, followed by column purification and 64 Cu labeling. MicroPET imaging revealed accumulation of 64 Cu-DOTA-etanercept within the lateral and third cerebral ventricles within minutes of peripheral perispinal administration in a normal rat anesthesized with isoflurane anesthesia, with concentration within the choroid plexus and into the CSF. Conclusion Synthesis of 64 Cu-DOTA-etanercept enabled visualization of its intracranial distribution by microPET imaging. MicroPET imaging documented rapid accumulation of 64 Cu-DOTA-etanercept within the choroid plexus and the cerebrospinal fluid within the cerebral ventricles of a living rat after <b>peripheral</b> <b>administration.</b> Further study of the effects of etanercept and TNF {{at the level of the}} choroid plexus may yield valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Lou/C rat, an inbred {{strain of}} Wistar origin, was {{described}} as a model of resistance to age- and diet-induced obesity. Although such a resistance involves many metabolic parameters described in our previous studies, Lou/C rats also exhibit a spontaneous food restriction due to decreased food consumption during the nocturnal period. We then attempted to delineate the leptin sensitivity and mechanisms implicated in this strain, using different protocols of acute central and <b>peripheral</b> leptin <b>administration.</b> A first analysis of the meal patterns revealed that Lou/C rats eat smaller meals, without any change in meal number compared to age-matched Wistar animals. Although the expression of the recognized leptin transporters (leptin receptors and megalin) measured in the choroid plexus was normal in Lou/C rats, the decreased triglyceridemia observed in these animals is compatible with an increased leptin transport across the blood brain barrier. Improved hypothalamic leptin signaling in Lou/C rats was also suggested by the higher pSTAT 3 /STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) ratio observed following acute <b>peripheral</b> leptin <b>administration,</b> {{as well as by the}} lower hypothalamic mRNA expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3), known to downregulate leptin signaling.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in humans and non-human animals clearly demonstrates that GABA {{plays a role}} in anxiety and anxiety-like behaviors. With rodent models, GABA agonists produce anxiolytic effects under multiple paradigms but the effects of directly administering GABA remain unclear. The current study investigated the effects of chronic <b>peripheral</b> GABA <b>administration</b> on behavior using a common measure of anxiety-like behavior in rodents, the elevated zero maze. Eight-week old male and female Swiss Webster mice were quad-housed and exposed to either cat urine or plain litter as part of a secondary hypothesis regarding the development of a murine model of PTSD. Starting 20 minutes after predator scent exposure, each mouse was given an intraparitonael injection of either GABA (10 mg/kg) or saline once a day for seven days. On the eighth day, each mouse was placed on an elevated zero-maze for recorded observation without an injection. Unfortunately, analysis of initial latency to new arm entrance (sec), exploratory behavior in the open arms (i. e., dipping behavior), and duration in the open arms (sec) found only small sex differences, and did not reveal any effect of GABA or predator scent exposure on anxiety-like behavior. The current findings suggest that the sexes behave differently under stress, as male and female mice displayed differences in their behavioral profiles across the testing sessions.
