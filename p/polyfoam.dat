Berger went on to describe more specifically the usage of such practical prosthetic's, [...] "These green screen gloves and leggings we'll put that on and Yusef and we'll get them dressed and we've got these body parts and we're going to attach them with Velcro underneath their costumes ... For Fiore, who's gonna have a compound fracture, we'll green screen his leg ...." [...] Berger continued by detailing the process at which the prosthetic's are used, to which he stated, [...] "They're just slip latex skins backed with <b>polyfoam,</b> it's like a two part a and b that you mix together and it foams up."Berger also mentioned, [...] "Soft <b>polyfoam</b> that's been tinted red and their armature wire running through it so we can position it". Make-up artist Mike Smithson of KNB EFX was also interviewed for the [...] "Making Of Preacher: “The Possibilities”" [...] segment, with him noting, [...] "Most of these body parts will be under clothing, but the carnage and trauma we're going to end up dressing." [...] For the intricate scene of Cassidy running DeBlanc and Fiore over with the church van, 12 costumes, two dummies, three stunt doubles, {{and a great deal of}} prosthetics were involved.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} two bioresorbable polylactic acid (PLA) filler materials in a guided bone regeneration (GBR) model system. The first was Polyfibre, a fibrous PLA filler material. <b>Polyfoam,</b> the second material tested, consisted of a spongy PLA filler material. In each group there were eight rabbits. In test rabbits a flap was raised uncovering the calvaria. A hemispherical PLA dome was filled with Polyfibre or <b>Polyfoam</b> material and periphereal blood and anchored onto the calvaria. Eight rabbits with the same domes, filled with blood alone, served as controls. The rabbits were sacrificed at 1 or 2 months. Histomorphometric measurements of regenerated total tissue volume, bone height and bone volume were carried out in undecalcified sections under a light microscope. At 1 month the totally filled volume attained 87 % (range 82 - 91) in the fibre group, including 25 % (23 - 27) fibres, 87 % (85 - 95) in the foam group, including 15 % (15 - 16) foam, and 55 % (16 - 100) in the controls. The volume of mineralized bone was 12 % (7 - 15) in the fibre group, 15 % (12 - 18) in the foam group and 6 % (1 - 11) in control domes. Bone height attained 48 % (27 - 79) in the fibre group, 37 % (31 - 58) in the foam group and 45 % (14 - 67) in the control group. At 2 months, tissue volume attained 86 % (85 - 87) including 26 % (22 - 29) fibres, bone volume attained 13 % (7 - 21) and bone height attained 56 % (42 - 78) in the Polyfibre group. In the <b>Polyfoam</b> group, they were 83 % (55 - 99) including 18 % (15 - 19) foam, 13 % (7 - 24) and 49 % (29 - 74). In control domes, tissue volume was 82 % (35 - 100), bone volume 20 % (9 - 27) and bone height 86 % (60 - 100). The Polyfibre and <b>Polyfoam</b> material was excellently integrated. No adverse reactions were found in the surrounding tissues. Direct bone apposition was observed onto the material. In conclusion, Polyfibre and <b>Polyfoam</b> material had a positive effect on initial bone and tissue formation but was a hindrance to increasing tissue volume, bone volume or bone height at 2 months compared to control specimens. The Polyfibre and <b>Polyfoam</b> material provoked no adverse reactions in the surrounding tissues and allowed for extensive angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During the 1984 and 1985 summer {{seasons in}} Greece, an {{operational}} cloud seeding program {{was conducted to}} reduce hail intensity at ground level over three target areas. The program {{was sponsored by the}} Greek government and operated by Atmospherics Incorporated of Fresno, California. Five cloud seeding airc. raft, two S-band radars, one C-band radar, upper air sounding equipment, a severe storm forecasting unit, a computerized Digital Video Scanning System and the aerial application of pyrotechnic generated silver iodide formed the core operational components of this program. One of the target areas included a network of <b>polyfoam</b> hailpads plus the design and application of a randomized crossover exploratory experiment. The operational aspects are summarized and the preliminary results from the analysis of hailpad data are presented. 1...|$|E

Hence, in urban stormwater structural design, the investigation of the hydrological performance investigation is often required. Thus, this paper presents the results of a hydrological investigation in term of peak flow reduction and green roof’s weight using 0, 2, and 6 % slope for three specimens drainage layer in green roofs. Three types of recycled waste are selected for each test bed which is rubber crumbs, palm oil shell, and <b>polyfoam.</b> Another test bed without a drainage layer as a control. The result indicates that rubber crumbs {{can be used}} as a stormwater control and runoff reduction while ensuring a good drainage and aeration of the substrate and roofs. From the results obtained shows that rubber crumbs are suitable as a drainage layer and a proposed slope of 6 % are suitable for lightweight green roofs...|$|E

The populations of antagonists and colonization of rooting cubes by R. solani were monitored during a 3 -week period. Colonization of cubes by R. solani was reduced in cubes treated with P. cepacia, but the population of P. cepacia decreased {{by as much as}} 97 % during the test period. Increased colonization by R. solani was correlated with a decline in population of P. cepacia. P. lilacinus was more persistent than P. cepacia in cubes, with only a 21 % reduction observed during the 3 -week period. Colonization of the P. lilacinus-treated cubes by R. solani was significantly less than colonization of infested controls. No correlation existed between population of P. lilacinus and colonization of cubes by R. solani...|$|E

As part of a whole-system study, {{the response of the}} heterotrophic microfaunal community colonizing artificial substrata (<b>polyfoam</b> units) to fertilization of an arctic tundra stream was followed for 6 weeks during the summer. 2. Dominant heterotrophic microfauna observed included amoebae (approximately 40 % of colonizing biomass), rotifers (36 % of biomass) and ciliates (25 % of biomass). 3. Biomass of heterotrophic microfauna on artificial substrata was not significantly different in a control reach and an experimental reach fertilized with phosphorus (loading rate ten times ambient), but in a reach fertilized with both phosphorus and nitrogen (loading rates ten times ambient) biomass was double that of the control and phosphorus-fertilized reaches. The lack of response in the phosphorus reach was probably due to greater insect grazing as a result of previous phosphorus fertilization of this reach. 4. Abundance of microfauna on epilithic surfaces in the river was higher on rocks from pools than on rocks from riffle areas, but abundance on the artificial substrata was higher than on the natural rocks. 5. The results suggest that microfauna of arctic tundra streams are regulated by grazers and that their importance in transfers among trophic levels is greater in pools than in riffles...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} some minimal art has always {{intrigued}} me. However, the "how" and "why" were not evident {{to me when}} this body of work began, nor did I {{think of myself as}} a minimalist. The materials used in these works are acrylics, powdered pigment, <b>polyfoam</b> core, rag paper and spackle. A great release of energy went into the physical preparation of the surface. The gut tightened as the layers of color went down [...] one after another. The struggle of making something "happen" was agonizing. At rare times [...] it was exhilarating. These works, a kind of theme and variations, have evolved because I wanted to create the feeling of space, of light and luminosity [...] of some "thingness. " "Less in Art is not less," comes to mind. When the complications of imagery are eliminated the complications are not removed. They are merely focused on that which remains. These works have been honed to a confrontation with just a few of the formal issues of art. There is much attention to surface (its color and texture, its luminosity) and implied space. There is no structure to the surface other than a very fine thin-lined rectangular shape at the base of the piece; suggesting what? A doorway? An entrance into timelessness? A space beyond? Krishnamurti once said something which I feel also applies to art. "There is no one path to truth. " We cannot come to art through organization, creed, dogma, philosophical knowledge, or psychological technique. We find it through observation, through understanding the contents of our own minds, and through the mirror of our relationship to what we see...|$|E
