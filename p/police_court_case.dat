During the {{prevalence}} of the [...] "Stonewall" [...] agitation, in 1876, McKean was committed to {{the custody of the}} Serjeant-at-Arms for disorderly conduct in defying the closure rule, and was ultimately expelled the House in June 1876 for some uncomplimentary references to his fellow-members of the Assembly, made whilst conducting a <b>police</b> <b>court</b> <b>case.</b> McKean was subsequently again elected for North Gipps Land in May 1880, but was defeated at the general election in February 1883, and did not re-enter parliament, though he contested Collingwood in June 1892 and 1894.|$|E

"But at this {{juncture}} his relations with a woman parishioner were called in question by a hostile witness in a <b>police</b> <b>court</b> <b>case</b> in which he appeared as prosecuting witness, and became a front-page newspaper sensation. He denied everything, and resented all inquiry. Sharp and acrimonious differences of opinion rocked the church. At the end of April 1896, the tension became so great he resigned. The faction of church officers who supported him having come into control as others stepped to one side, led by Isaac H. Morse, closed the church, transferred his ministrations to a hall, and planned {{the sale of the}} church, expecting, when the trouble blew over, to build elsewhere. Their plans running into difficulties, he went East on vacation, and while there accepted a call to Chicago." ...|$|E

Osborne was arrested twice more attempting to speak, running his arrest count to 3, and the Seattle Socialists {{and their supporters}} paying out $270 in fines by {{the first week of}} October. Further expense was in the offing, as three of Osborne's <b>Police</b> <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> were headed for appeal by jury trial in County Court. The party telegraphed its next move, publishing in dark type in the pages of The Socialist an appeal for [...] "Volunteers for Jail." [...] "Spring bed Socialism is past in Seattle," [...] the announcement declared: [...] "It means cement floor in jail from now on. Either that or cowardly surrender."

5000|$|... 2008 {{marked a}} centenary {{in the history}} of Geevagh. It is {{difficult}} from today's position to realise the distressed state of the parish in 1908. Widespread evictions from the local Keogh estate meant many poor families eked out an existence of sorts on the rough barren slopes of Carran mountain. A campaign of non-payment of rent exposed many families to such a fate, and in an effort to prevent further evictions, the Land League organised demonstrations to prevent delivery of eviction notices by local postmen, which led to several confrontations in January 1908 between a large number of citizens and the <b>police.</b> <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> ensued against around two dozen locals, some of whom ended up serving hard labour in prison for up to six months. While the <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> and prison terms were ongoing, the local community rallied around the families of the prisoners, making sure their farms were worked and tilled. It was not until summer 1909 that a resolution came with the release of the last prisoners, to much local rejoicing by the parish as a whole. John C. Mc Ternan in his book Olde Sligo (1997) records the 1908 events in detail.|$|R

Results: The court sentence measured in terms of days in jail is influenced by motive, source of information and police culture. Conclusions: Based on court documents, this study developed measures, coded court text and analyzed relationships between constructs. The analysis identified crime motive, police culture and information source as predictors of jail sentence length. The extent of physical versus non-physical crime by police employees on duty was influenced by crime motive. The source of information tends to be police officers internally when a colleague has committed a physical rather than non-physical crime...|$|R

25|$|The {{spread of}} {{prostitution}} practices {{has introduced a}} large quantity of slang to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of <b>police</b> raids, <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example is news of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage. Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.|$|R

The case fuelled discussion and controversy in New Zealand over the use by courts of suppression orders to protect the identity of perpetrators of higher social status.|$|R
40|$|Despite the proven {{capabilities}} of Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (MALDI MS) in laboratory settings, research is {{still needed to}} integrate this technique into current forensic fingerprinting practice. Optimised protocols enabling the compatible application of MALDI to developed fingermarks will allow additional intelligence to be gathered around a suspect’s lifestyle and activities prior to the deposition of their fingermarks while committing a crime. The detection and mapping of illicit drugs and metabolites in latent fingermarks would provide intelligence that is beneficial for both <b>police</b> investigations and <b>court</b> <b>cases.</b> This study investigated MALDI MS detection and mapping capabilities for a large range of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in fingermarks; the detection and mapping of a mixture of these drugs in marks, with and without prior development with cyanoacrylate fuming or Vacuum Metal Deposition, was also examined. Our findings indicate the versatility of MALDI technology {{and its ability to}} retrieve chemical intelligence either by detecting the compounds investigated or by using their ion signals to reconstruct 2 D maps of fingermark ridge details...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Police</b> <b>court</b> fines of {{less than}} $20 on a single charge are not {{appealable}} or otherwise reviewable in any other Kentucky court.

The <b>police</b> <b>court</b> suspended judgment for 24 hours, during which time a longer stay from the Kentucky Circuit Court was sought.

50|$|Up to 1861, {{the date}} of the emancipation, the peasant serfs had been under the patrimonial {{jurisdiction}} of their lords. The edict of emancipation abolished this jurisdiction, and set up instead in each volost a court particular to the peasants, of which the judges and jury, themselves peasants, were elected by the assembly of the volost (volostnoy skhod) each year. In these courts the ordinary written law had little to say; the decisions of the volost courts were based on the local customary law. The justice administered in them was patriarchal and rough, but not ineffective. All civil cases involving less than 100 roubles value were within their competence, and more important cases by consent of the parties. They acted also as <b>police</b> <b>courts</b> in the <b>case</b> of petty thefts, breaches of the community and the like. They were also charged with the maintenance of order in the mir and the family, punishing infractions of the religious law, husbands who beat their wives, and parents who ill-treated their children. The penalty of flogging, preferred by the peasants to fine or imprisonment, was not unknown. The judges were, of course, wholly illiterate, and this tended to throw the ultimate power {{into the hands of the}} clerk (pisar) of the court, who was rarely above corruption.|$|R
