50|$|Dodecatheon {{is related}} to the genus <b>Primula</b> (<b>primroses</b> and related plants); in fact, Primula without Dodecatheon is paraphyletic. One way of {{avoiding}} this is to move the Dodecatheon species into Primula. If this is done, the former genus Dodecatheon becomes a monophyletic section, Primula subg. Auriculastrum sect. Dodecatheon (L.) A.R.Mast & Reveal.|$|R

40|$|Natural history {{information}} for rare plants can help land managers {{better understand the}} threats to extinction that a taxon may face. Our {{focus is on the}} natural history of Maguire <b>primrose</b> (<b>Primula</b> cusickiana var. maguirei, Primulaceae), an endemic, threatened plant found along a narrow corridor within a single canyon in northern Utah. We examined floral morphology, air temperature, relative humidity during flowering, dichogamy, blooming period, and visits from flying insects. As with most <b>Primula,</b> Maguire <b>primrose</b> displays distinct floral distyly. Within the distylous flowers, 17 % of our samples had a timing difference in the maturation of anthers and stigmas, a trait not previously recorded in any other Primula species. Temperatures during the early-spring blooming period fluctuated widely between recorded minima below 0 Â°C and maxima above 33 Â°C. We captured 8 different species of flying insects visiting Maguire primrose flowers in air temperatures ranging from 6 to 15 Â°C. Bloom timing was not well synchronized between different canyon locations. Between different canyon locations, we observed {{only a small number of}} plants that overlapped in their flowering phenology. This threatened primrose variety has a cool, early-season blooming period, a dependence on visiting insects for outcrossing, and disjunct populations throughout the canyon, resulting in the potential for serious challenges to reproduction...|$|R
