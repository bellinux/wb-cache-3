40|$|Lecturepg. 49 The aim of pump {{development}} {{in recent years}} has been mainly reliability, safety, low maintenance, and the avoidance of dangerous leakages. For years, more and more rigid regulations against pollution and for better safety have been issued. Many reaction components have been classified toxic or dangerous, with the consequence of a great trend towards leak free systems. For oscillating displacement pumps, the plunger sealing is difficult due to high pressure, pulsating forces and sliding speed. If ever one finds a satisfactory solution for a difficult <b>plunger</b> <b>seal,</b> there remain the disadvantage of unavoidable low leakage, necessary skilled maintenance and low lifetime. The obvious separation of the pump?s liquid end from the drive mechanism by diaphragms has been realized for years in small metering pumps. The development climbed to increasing power of about 10 kW, so that actually, there is a dominance of the diaphragm towards piston pumps. Recently, the development of very large diaphragm pumps for process service, with power up to 500 kW, shows very reliable performances. Together with the total leak-free design the remarkable increase of reliability compared with conventional multiplex plunger pumps is very important. Many difficult fluids, such as abrasive suspensions, nonlubricating solvents or liquids gases can be pumped troublefree at pressures up to 1000 bar. For process service, the application of resistant fluor plastomer or metal diaphragms is a mus. The design, calculation, sealing, champing, fatigue, lifetime, and especially the future development, which is expected to reduce the dimensions, are explained. Long term applications have shown that diaphragm pumps actually perform to trouble-and maintenance-free service of many months. The most important step towards total safety was the development of sandwich diaphragm rupture monitoring systems. The hydraulic system and the alternative designs are compared. This has developed towards automatic position-control of the diaphragm. Safety, venting and snifting valves and their control are very important. Some remarks deal with fatigue and wear problems at high pressure of components like thick walled parts and valves, and with design of the drive units and their control. An important condition for reliable service of high pressure diaphragm pumps is the restriction of pressure vibrations in the piping system and avoiding any cavitation. There is a significant influence of fluid compressibility on displacement characteristics and stimulation of pipe vibrations. A computation method including dampers is outlined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough fuzzy-ball {{drilling}} fluid {{has been successfully}} applied in CBM well drilling, {{it is necessary to}} study its anti-collapse mechanism so that adjustable coalbed sealing effects, controllable sealing strength, rational sealing cost and controllable reservoir damage degree can be realized. In this paper, laboratory measurement was performed on the uniaxial compressive strength of the plungers of No. 3 coalbed in the Qinshui Basin and the inlet pressure of Ø 38  mm coal plunger displacement. The strengths of coal plungers were tested and compared after 2 % potassium chloride solution, low-solids polymer {{drilling fluid}} and fuzzy-ball drilling fluid were injected into the coal plungers respectively. It is shown that coal strength rises by 38. 46 % after the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid is injected (in three groups); and that no fuzzy-ball drilling fluid is lost at the displacement pressures of 20. 73 and 21. 46  MPa, nor 2 % potassium chloride solution is leaked at such pressures of 24. 79 and 25. 64  MPa after the <b>plunger</b> was <b>sealed</b> by the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid. This indicates that the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid can increase the formation resistance to fluid. Indoor microscopic observation was conducted on the sealing process of the fuzzy-ball drilling fluid in sand packs with coal cuttings of three grain sizes (60 – 80, 80 – 100 and 100 – 120  mesh). It is shown that the leakage pathways of different sizes are sealed by the vesicles in the form of accumulation, stretch and blockage. And there are vesicles at the inlet ends of the flowing pathways in the shape of beaded blanket. The impact force of drilling tools on the sidewalls is absorbed by the vesicles due to their elasticity and tenacity, so the sidewall instability caused by drilling tools is relieved. It is concluded that the main anti-collapse mechanisms of the CBM fuzzy-ball drilling fluid are to raise the coal strength, increase the formation resistance to fluid, and buffer the impact of drill tools...|$|R
40|$|General {{calibration}} of the Vitaprint extruder Introduction Being tansferrable, the Vitaprint extruder {{is capable}} of printing structures, sliced by various free and open software, such as Slic 3 r or Cura. To allow this, however, certain settings need to be adjusted. Table of Contents Basic extrusion calculation Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Materials Procedure Basic extrusion calculation The first approximation of extrusion settings can be calculated theoretically, based on some simple assumptions. Due to its mechanical, piston driven nature, extrusion can be precisely controlled by motorized displacement of the piston (rotation vs thread, both of which is specified) and depends on {{the difference between the}} inner diameters of the syringe r s and the nozzle r n. If we assume non-elastic behavior and laminar flow, the displaced volume in the syringe should equal the extruded volume through the nozzle. If the printed stroke takes the cross-sectional shape of the nozzle, the length of the printed path can be calculated as follows: Where E equals the extrusion value (= displacement of the piston) and l path the length of the printed filament. This is useful for determining the amount of extrusion for custom designed geometries. When using slicing software Cura, the calculation differs somewhat, as certain parameters are calculated differently. We have determined an experimental nozzle width and correction factor for the use of a 5 ml syringe with a G 21 needle (inner diameter 0. 4 mm). The calculation {{can be found in the}} accompanied xls file titled "vitaprint_cura_filament_calc". Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Certain simplifications in the calculation cause small, yet significant discrepancies between the theoretical and real system. Therefore additional tuning is required. To do this, we developed a simple "pen and paper" protocol, to evaluate the characteristics of the printed path. It can be used to adjust extrusion, feedrate, layer height and material polymerization time upon deposition. Materials Basic Vitaprint set-up 5 ml syringe (optional with luer lock) blunt-end needle (e. g. G 21 with 0. 4 mm inner diameter) printing material (e. g. gelatin-alginate composite, see Vitaprint_methods) with colored dye (e. g. Pelikan 4001 blue ink) sheet of thick white paper adhesive tape Procedure A syringe containing the desired material with added coloring is mounted on the extruder. Step 1 - Rough calibration of material extrusion, where E determines the position change of the piston in mm. RUN " 01 _calE 1. gcode" EVALUATE created sample (Is it a full line? Is the line thickness even across the length? optional - use stereomicroscope/magnifying glass) MODIFY " 01 _calE 1. gcode" and repeat CHOOSE the best value for E and 4 values for F and modify " 02 _calE-F. gcode" Step 2 - Fine calibration F for optimum E+F properties RUN " 02 _calE-F. gcode" REPEAT "STEP 2 ", choose optimum value for F Choose best values for E + F and modify " 03 _cal_tdry. gcode" Step 3 - Determining material polymerization time and rough layer height. RUN " 03 _cal_tdry. gcode" EVALUATE created mesh to evaluate line drying time. The line is well dry when the needle doesn't make a smear while crossing it. Use table to calculate polymerization time. A time unit is calculated from: [1 min (60 s) for 1 mm of covered way]. The double line represents the extrusion step (phase 1), the single line represents the scratching step (phase 2). The numbers show the distance in mm from extrusion to scratch.

This concludes h = 2. 26 E/d. Move to layerS 2 - 4 and repeat (runs automatically) Step 4 - Fine adjustment of h (the solidification process can alter the basic layer height) MODIFY " 04 _cal_h. gcode" using previous parameters and the calculated h from "STEP 3 ", and define 4 new height parameters which use old h +/- 0. 005 - 0. 01 mm. RUN " 04 _cal_h. gcode" Backlash calibration PART 1 - Latency Determination Introduction When extruding materials with medium to high viscosity it can be observed that when the plunger movement is terminated the material still keeps flowing out of the syringe for some time. This happens due to mechanically elastic components in the system (air bubbles inside the material, syringe <b>seal,</b> <b>plunger</b> deformation under higher forces etc.). The removal of this phenomenon is not very feasible therefore we can compensate it with backlash. Thereby, the plunger not only stops when it's told to but instead it moves slightly backwards such that it pulls some of the material back into the syringe. The idea is to pull enough material back in that the outflow is stopped as soon as possible and yet, care must be taken not to pull the plunger so far back that the air comes into the syringe through the needle. Figure 1 : showing the displacement step and the observed outflow as a function of time. System latency is shown in red.

It is important to understand the workflow of the data processing. The raw data may contain some high frequency noise usually originating from the building vibration (people walking, door closing etc.). The raw data are therefore first low-pass filtered. Then they are blocked up in cycles (each cycles contains a dataset of mass values associated to one displacement step). Then, an exponential fit of a form f = aexp(-bx) + cexp(-dx) is fitted to each dataset. At the end, a 95 % point is found in every dataset and taken as the system latency. you can see the output signal after every stage in the Appendix below, for easier visualisation. Procedure Download the file for data processing (VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py) Copy the. txt file with your acquired data into the same folder as the data processing file. Open the VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py file in your Python environment and read the head of the file. Follow the instructions in the code header Run the code the Latency values should appear in your python command prompt as the programme output Important Notes and Tips In our setup this method proved to be repeatable and robust. However, depending on the hardware it may not be so. It is advisable to repeat this procedure several times to investigate whether you can rely on it.
