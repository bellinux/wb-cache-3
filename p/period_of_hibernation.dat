They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation</b> during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
25|$|Amargosa voles are a {{subspecies}} that {{is active}} year-round; {{they have no}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation.</b> Intraspecific interactions are frequent for Amargosa voles and {{can be attributed to}} their polygynous social system. They can found living in underground burrows in family groups of up to one male, several females, and their offspring. The female home range averages 0.02 acres and the male home range averages 0.03 acres, although the females generally travel longer distances than males throughout non-breeding season. Especially during peak breeding season in March and April, males tend to be territorial and make an effort to exclude other males from their home ranges. Male and female home ranges, however, may overlap. Daily ranges of these animals is substantially smaller, with individuals traveling only 16–17 feet from the burrow entrance to meet most of its life history needs. Daily movements and home range sizes vary somewhat with the environment and population density. Voles disperse throughout their lifetime, but dispersal is often limited by fragmentation of their habitat.|$|E

60|$|Many animals, however, find it {{convenient}} {{to assume a}} state of less complete suspended animation during certain special periods of the year, {{according to the circumstances}} of their peculiar climate and mode of life. Among the very highest animals, the most familiar example of this sort of semi-torpidity is to be found among the bears and the dormice. The common European brown bear is a carnivore by descent, who has become a vegetarian in practice, though whether from conscientious scruples or mere practical considerations of expediency, does not appear. He feeds chiefly on roots, berries, fruits, vegetables, and honey, all of which he finds it comparatively difficult to procure during winter weather. Accordingly, as everyone knows, he eats immoderately in the summer season, till he has grown fat enough to supply bear's grease to all Christendom. Then he hunts himself out a hollow tree or rock-shelter, curls himself up quietly to sleep, and snores away the whole livelong winter. During this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation,</b> the action of the heart is reduced to a minimum, and the bear breathes but very slowly. Still, he does breathe, and his heart does beat; and in performing those indispensable functions, all his store of accumulated fat is gradually used up, so that he wakes in spring as thin as a lath and as hungry as a hunter. The machine has been working at very low pressure all the winter: but it has been working for all that, and the continuity of its action has never once for a moment been interrupted. This is the central principle of all hibernation; it consists essentially of a very long and profound sleep, during which all muscular motion, except that of the heart and lungs, is completely suspended, while even these last are reduced to the very smallest amount compatible with the final restoration of full animal activity.|$|E

30|$|Muscle atrophy {{induced by}} disuse is an {{important}} clinical problem. Countermeasures that can prevent muscle atrophy as well as restore the exercise capacity (Boonyarom and Inui 2006; Williams et al. 2009) are regularly sought after. Despite long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation,</b> associated with muscle disuse, arousal of hibernators is associated with normal motion. During hibernation, hibernators are in a torpid state except for interbout-arousals. So skeletal muscle unloading causes its disuse. This model is applied to study treatment for muscle atrophy due to disuse (Ivakine and Cohn 2014; Gao et al. 2012). Their skeletal muscle mass may decrease slightly during hibernation, but limited or no changes in contractile performance have been demonstrated (Bodine 2013; James et al. 2013). This awakening with normal muscle function is important for obtaining food or escaping from predators. The mechanism by which these animals are able to preserve muscle function during hibernation is not clear.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hibernation</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{striking}} examples of mammals’ phenotypic flexibility, allowing them to survive at low temperatures and in the conditions of insufficient food and water. During the torpor there is a decrease in both body temperature and metabolic rate that is accompanied by slowing respiration, significant drop of oxygen consumption {{as well as by}} the reduction of cerebral blood circulation and heart rate. In spite of a number of physiological adaptations to hibernation, the arousal from torpor is accompanied by the oxidative stress caused by the enormous rise of oxygen consumption. In these conditions, the antioxidant defense system which provides harmless transfer from torpor to arousal and vice versa, i. e., without any tissues’ oxidative damage, becomes especially important.

40|$|Nectar-feeding insects find flowers by 2 means, innate {{preferences}} and learned associations. When insects that hibernate as imagos (i. e., adults) start foraging {{after a long}} winter break, what guides them to new nectar rewards? Are innate preferences kept over such a long period? And are learned associations useful after long breaks?

40|$|Study Objectives: It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that sleep is important for regulating body temperature and metabolic-rate. <b>Hibernation,</b> a state <b>of</b> acute hypothermia and reduced metabolic-rate, offers a promising system for investigating those relationships. Prior studies in hibernating ground squirrels report that, although sleep occurs during hibernation, it manifests only as non-REM sleep, and only at relatively high temperatures. In our study, we report data on sleep during hibernation in a lemuriform primate, Cheirogaleus medius. As the only primate known to experience prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation</b> and as an inhabitant of more temperate climates than ground squirrels, this animal serves as an alternative model for exploring sleep temperature/metabolism relationships that may be uniquely relevant to understanding human physiology. Measurements and Results: We find that during hibernation, non-REM sleep is absent in Cheirogaleus. Rather, <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> REM sleep occur during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> relatively high ambient temperature, a pattern opposite of that observed in ground squirrels. Like ground squirrels, however, EEG is marked by ultra-low voltage activity at relatively low metabolic-rates. Conclusions: These findings confirm a sleep-temperature/metabolism link, though they also suggest that the relationship of sleep stage with temperature/metabolism is flexible and may differ across species or mammalian orders.

40|$|The {{toxic gas}} H 2 S is {{produced}} by enzymes in the body. At moderate concentrations, H 2 S elicits physiological effects similar to hibernation. Herein, we describe experiments that imply that the phenomenon probably results from reversible inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), which reduces oxygen during respiration. A functional model of the oxygen-reducing site in CcO was used to explore the effects of H 2 S during respiration. Spectroscopic analyses showed that the model binds two molecules of H 2 S. The electro-catalytic reduction of oxygen is reversibly inhibited by H 2 S concentrations {{similar to those that}} induce hibernation. This phenomenon derives from a weak, reversible binding of H 2 S to the FeII porphyrin, which mimics heme a 3 in CcO's active site. No inhibition of CcO is detected at lower H 2 S concentrations. Nevertheless, at lower concentrations, H 2 S could have other biological effects on CcO. For example, H 2 S rapidly reduces FeIII and CuII in both the oxidized form of this functional model and in CcO itself. H 2 S also reduces CcO's biological reductant, cytochrome c, which normally derives its reducing equivalents from food metabolism. Consequently, it is speculated that H 2 S might also serve as a source <b>of</b> electrons during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation</b> when food supplies are low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract AIMS: This article {{summarizes}} {{discussion at}} the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) 2015 meeting of urine modification in the urinary tract by the urothelium. It considers {{the literature and}} proposes pertinent questions {{that need to be}} addressed to understand this phenomenon within a physiological context. METHODS: Following the ICI-RS meeting, publications in PubMed relating to urine modification in the renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder were reviewed. RESULTS: Historically, the urothelium has been simply considered as a passive, impermeable barrier, preventing contact between urine and the underlying cells. In addition to the ability of the umbrella cells to modify the surface area of the urothelium during bladder filling, the urothelium may also be involved in modifying urine composition. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that electrolytes and water can be reabsorbed by the urothelium and that this may have physiological relevance. Firstly, urothelial cells express several types of aquaporins and ion channels; the membrane expression of which is modulated by the extracellular concentration of ions including Na+. Secondly, studies of urine composition in the renal pelvis and bladder demonstrate urine modification, indicating that water and/or electrolyte transport has occurred. Thirdly, hibernating mammals, with urothelial and bladder wall histology similar to non-hibernating mammals are known to produce and reabsorb urine daily, during long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The phenomenon of urine modification by the urothelium may be physiologically important during normal bladder filling.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that protect against or limit muscle atrophy in hibernators during prolonged inactivity {{has important implications}} for its treatment. We examined whether external factors influence the pathways regulating protein synthesis and degradation, leading to muscle atrophy prevention in Daurian ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus). We investigated the effects of 14 -day hindlimb-unloading (HU) in different seasons and two-month hibernation on the soleus (SOL) muscle wet mass, muscle-to-body mass ratio, fiber cross sectional area (CSA), fiber distribution and muscle ultrastructure. We also measured changes in the protein expression and activation states of Akt, mTOR and FoxO 1 and the mRNA expression of atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1. Compared with the control groups, autumn and winter HU significantly lowered SOL muscle wet mass and muscle-to-body mass ratio, decreased type I and II fiber CSA and induced ultrastructural anomalies. However, these measured indices were unchanged between Pre-hibernation and Hibernation groups. Furthermore, phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR significantly decreased, while the phosphorylation level of FoxO 1 and mRNA expression of atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 increased after HU. During hibernation, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR significantly decreased, but the phosphorylation level of FoxO 1 and mRNA expression of atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 remained unchanged. Overall, our findings suggest that disuse and seasonality may not be sufficient to initiate the innate protective mechanism that prevents SOL atrophy during prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>hibernation</b> inactivity. The stable expression of atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 may facilitate to prevent SOL atrophy via controlling ubiquitination of muscle proteins during hibernation...|$|R
