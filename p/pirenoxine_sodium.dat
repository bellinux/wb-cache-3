40|$|We {{present a}} noninvasive method of {{detecting}} substance {{concentration in the}} aqueous humor based on dual-wavelength iris imaging technology. Two light sources, one centered within (392 nm) and the other centered outside (850 nm) of an absorption band of <b>Pirenoxine</b> <b>Sodium,</b> a common type of drugs in eye disease treatment, were used for dual-wavelength iris imaging measurement. After passing through the aqueous humor twice, the back-scattering light was detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD). The detected images were then {{used to calculate the}} concentration of <b>Pirenoxine</b> <b>Sodium.</b> In eye model experiment, a resolution of 0. 6525 ppm was achieved. Meanwhile, at least 4 ppm can be distinguished in in vivo experiment. These results demonstrated that our method can measure <b>Pirenoxine</b> <b>Sodium</b> concentration in the aqueous humor and its potential ability to monitor other materialsâ€™ concentration in the aqueous humor...|$|E
