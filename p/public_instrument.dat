They are also experts in the law of property with exclusive access to France's M.I.N. database which contains all property transfer and conveyance information. This gives notaries a singular advantage in gauging the property market, thus allowing them to appraise property, conduct transactions, and handle taxes and financing.In France, when a notarial act is passed before one notary subscribing, it is said to be ordinaire, or in simple form, and when before two notaries with the second attesting, then it is solennel, or in solemn form. Acts may be drawn up in public or private form, said en minute and en brevet respectively. When drawn in private form, the single executed original is issued to the client, and its particulars are logged in the notary's register. When in public form, one un-executed minute copy (minute) is retained of record in the notary's protocol, thereby constituting a <b>public</b> <b>instrument,</b> and a fully engrossed execution copy (called a grosse and now termed copie exécutoire) is issued to the client and is headed and footed with the same formule exécutoire or [...] "enactment clause" [...] used on court orders and writs. Minutes and engrossements are only drawn up once, and, should a past client lose their copy or need further copies, by law, said person may only receive exemplifications (expédition, now termed copie authentique) of the act. Notaries also issue detailed or summary abstracts of acts (extrait authentique) and make notarial certified copies (copie collationnée) of documents not in their custody.|$|E

The fourth chapter describes individual forms of testament, such as testament made by means of a private instrument, testament made by means of a <b>public</b> <b>instrument</b> and also concessions in the making of a testament.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the urban forest {{governance}} based on close co-operation between the local unit of the Slovenia Forest Service and the municipality of Celje, the third largest city in Slovenia, has evolved {{in the last two}} decades. Its results are manifested in the new recreational infrastructure, new areas of public urban forests, long-term oriented and prompt forest management for reasonable costs and established monitoring system. In recent years the urban development and demands towards forests around Celje have increased. Due to the prevailing private ownership in the area, conflicts with different forest users were becoming more prevalent. The case study explores possibilities for directing the increased recreational use and examines the willingness of private forest owners to allow organized recreational use in exchange for a certain amount of payment for ecosystem service (PES) by the municipality. The economic expectations of private urban forest owners were examined through detailed personal interviews with 112 forest owners in the area of four previously designated potential footpaths and mountain bike trails with a total length of 13. 6 km. The article deals with specific economic expectations of forest owners and compares proposed PES scheme with another instrument for balancing of private and <b>public</b> <b>instrument</b> in urban forests...|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} chapters {{discussed how}} poor people {{can try to}} protect themselves against poverty and vulnerability by building up their asset base or calling on friends and relatives. Other strategies include relying on public mechanisms, such as social assistance or social insurance (unemployment, health, and disability insurance; pensions). Social insur-ance is usually available only through formal labor markets. As a result, {{it is out of}} reach for most poor families—only about 30 percent of the em-ployed urban poor work in the formal sector in Latin America—making social assistance the key <b>public</b> <b>instrument</b> for helping the poor. Social assistance aims to help the poor cope with poverty and vulner-ability when private mechanisms and social insurance cannot—this is why it is commonly referred to as a social safety net. 1 Its design therefore needs to be informed by the availability of social insurance and private schemes. It also needs to respond to what is known {{about the nature of the}} deprivation and vulnerability affecting the target population.
