The System I, II and III tremolo systems were manufactured in Germany by Schaller.Sometimes parts of the tremolo system are lost and one common modification {{is to make the}} bridge function as a hardtail by locking the bridge into a non movable position and installing a string tree for the first and second strings so that the strings don't slip out of the nut slots.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} Whoopee! merged issue, Cheeky had the middle 16 pages (half the comic). Cheeky himself had 4 pages. Six Million Dollar Gran, renamed [...] "Robot Granny" [...] had 2 pages. Calculator Kid had 1 page. Stage School also had 2 pages. Paddywack had half a page. The letters page was renamed [...] "Whoopee Chit-Chat" [...] and usually {{occupied}} {{one and a}} half pages (the prize was £2 plus a Whoopee! logo'd T-shirt. Mustapha Million had 2 pages, though in 1981 many of these were reprints. On the 16 February 1980 issue a brand new single <b>page</b> comic strip <b>Chip</b> began. The other pages had advertising.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also created}} {{the comic strip}} Weary Willie and Tired Tim, {{inspired}} by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, which appeared on the front <b>page</b> of Illustrated <b>Chips</b> from 1896 to 1953. Browne played a major part {{in the evolution of}} the British comic style, influencing Bruce Bairnsfather, Dudley Watkins and Leo Baxendale. His strip 'Airy Alf and Bouncing Billy' first appeared in The Big Budget around 1900, and was later continued by Ralph Hodgson aka [...] "Yorick". His comic, Dan Leno, portrayed the Victorian English music hall comedian and appeared in Dan Leno's Comic Journal in 1898. Echoes of his impudent urchins can still be seen in The Beano and The Dandy today.|$|R

As a direct result ePassports are now being issued in several countries all over the world. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has developed the internationally applied standard for ePassports. The ICAO standard provides a guideline for what features that could or should be implemented in these passports. During the process of updating the standard several experts within security and privacy {{have argued that the}} standard is to weak. The ePassports include biometrics and other personal information on a RFID chip. The fact that the information is now available on an RFID chip provides more security concerns than if the information had only been available in the machine-readable zone and at the data <b>page.</b> The <b>chip</b> itself provides some possible security and privacy problems like issuance, encryption, read range and so on, but there are also other aspects to consider with implementation of RFID...|$|R
50|$|Some printer {{manufacturers}} set {{up their}} cartridges {{to interact with the}} printer, preventing operation when the ink level is low, or when the cartridge has been refilled. One researcher with the magazine Which? over-rode such an interlocked system and found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality <b>pages,</b> after the <b>chip</b> stated that the cartridge was empty. In the United Kingdom, in 2003, the cost of ink {{has been the subject of}} an Office of Fair Trading investigation, as Which? magazine has accused manufacturers of a lack of transparency about the price of ink and called for an industry standard for measuring ink cartridge performance. Which? stated that color HP cartridges cost over seven times more per milliliter than 1985 Dom Perignon.|$|R

We also show real time issues due to the Dalvik Virtual machine and how the supported libraries can also be the culprits...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to inkjet printers, toner {{cartridges}} may contain smart chips that {{reduce the number}} of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the {{toner cartridges}}. Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. [...] These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer—all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed <b>pages,</b> and the <b>chip's</b> only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.|$|R

In addition, it will greatly increase the difficulty of passport fraud. If this database is to be implemented it is highly important that the security around it is the best it can be. In our studies we have found that the continuous work with the ICAO standard for Machine Readable Travel Documents will probably give a thorough revised and considered result. Even though we find it somewhat disturbing {{that there are so many}} aspects brought to the group’s attention by other security and privacy experts. As the US has pushed for use of biometrics in passports through the US VISA-Waiver Program, more and more countries find it useful to implement biometrics. Biometric features in passports will give a fairly accurate identification rate; especially if the applied biometric is fingerprints or iris scan. All ICAO members have to implement Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) by 2010, and we believe that many of these countries, if not all, will enhance it with biometrics in that period of time...|$|R
