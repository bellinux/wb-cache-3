50|$|Pneumatic and servo-electric {{machines}} are typically used in lower tonnage applications. Hydraulic brakes produce accurate high quality products, are reliable, use little energy and are safer because, unlike flywheel-driven presses, {{the motion of}} the ram can be easily stopped at any time in response to a safety device, e.g. a light curtain or other <b>presence</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>device.</b> Recent improvements are mainly in the control and a device called a backgauge. A back gauge is a device {{that can be used to}} accurately position a piece of metal so that the brake puts the bend in the correct place. Furthermore, the back gauge can be programmed to move between bends to repeatedly make complex parts. Early brakes relied on the tooling to determine the bend angle of the bend. The animation to the right shows the operation of the back gauge, setting the distance from the edge of the material or previous bend to the center of the die.|$|E
50|$|After some {{contention}} by OSHA, {{an electronic}} safety device can {{fall under the}} PSD umbrella. One such device is the Laser Sentry press brake safety device, designed by Glen Koedding, CEO of Metal Tech Controls Corp, in 2003. The concept was challenged with OSHA by a competitor almost immediately. OSHA responded by issuing a letter of disapproval stating that the Laser Sentry {{did not meet the}} “safe distance” rule. The rule states that a presence sensing protective device must be a minimum of 6 inches away from the nearest pinch point. However, after further observation, Laser Sentry was deemed a <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensing</b> <b>Device</b> (PSD) in 2004, when used in conjunction with hydraulic press brakes. Laser Sentry features laser guides that ensure the safety of a press brake operator while employing the precision of lasers directly surrounding the die. OSHA's caveat to its approval of the device was that they be properly installed and inspected. Among other presence sensing devices available, this device {{can be used as a}} retrofit to aging machines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Presence</b> <b>Sensing</b> <b>Devices</b> (PSD) {{are one of}} {{the more}} common safety devices for press brake safety. It is {{difficult}} to protect the operator using a metal bending machine such as a press brake. Often the operator must hold the sheet metal work-piece in one place while another portion of the piece is being formed in the die. If a foreign object is detected, the laser, camera, or light curtain technology will immediately retract the die or stop the motion of the ram. PSDs protect the operator and other employees in the area.|$|R
5000|$|One {{category}} of <b>presence</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices</b> is Photoelectric Sensors. Light Curtains {{fall into this}} category. Light curtains use many infrared light beams to form a perimeter around machinery. When two or more consecutively adjacent beams are interrupted, a kill-switch stops the machine until the boundary is reset. Light curtains must be {{placed in front of}} the work area. This makes it difficult for press brake operators to work on small parts. One cannot help but disrupt the beam. The operator might [...] "mute" [...] the light curtain {{in order to get the}} job done. Certain parts of the beam can be muted. For example, muting the front and rear of the beam allows the middle to offer continued protection for the operator. Additionally, it may be necessary to use auxiliary light beams if the operator will reach between the main light beams and the edge of certain machines.|$|R
40|$|Indoor spaces {{accommodate}} large {{populations of}} individuals. The continuous range monitoring of such objects {{can be used}} as a foun-dation for a wide variety of applications, e. g., space planning, way finding, and security. Indoor space differs from outdoor space in that symbolic locations, e. g., rooms, rather than Euclidean posi-tions or spatial network locations are important. In addition, posi-tioning based on <b>presence</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices,</b> rather than, e. g., GPS, is assumed. Such devices report the objects in their activation ranges. We propose an incremental, query-aware continuous range query processing technique for objects moving in this setting. A set of critical devices is determined for each query, and only the obser-vations from those devices are used to continuously maintain the query result. Due to the limitations of the positioning devices, queries contain certain and uncertain results. A maximum-speed constraint on object movement is used to refine the latter results. A comprehensive experimental study with both synthetic and real data suggests that our proposal is efficient and scalable...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} type of injury {{associated}} with mechanical power presses is amputation. Such injuries are often the result of point of operation hazards. The point of operation is the area on a press where material is processed. Amputations may occur when the required point of operation guards and devices are not in place or are not properly installed and the operator is able to place a hand, finger or any other body part in the working area of the press while it is cycling. Press operators may also be injured if one of the safety components of the press fails and the clutch/brake control electrical circuit has not been constructed to provide for control reliability. Control reliability means the system’s components are integrated and function together as a unit; if one system component fails, the press will not initiate a successive stroke until the failure is corrected. This Safety and Health Information Bulletin (SHIB) describes an accident involving an amputation that occurred when the press double cycled. The operator was injured when he placed his hand in the point of operation area and the <b>presence</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> (PSD) failed. Had the system been control reliable, this failure should have stopped the machine from operating...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIndustrial {{injuries}} {{have been}} identified as one of the key economic development inhibitors in South Korea. Industrial injury rate during the last ten years was reported as 0. 7 %, and has been kept at around 0. 6 % from 2010 to the present. The number of industrial injury in 2010 was 90, 842 among total 98, 645 injuries, and 16, 881 injuries were from caught-in or between injuries. In 2008, the injuries from being caught-in or between by press machine was 1, 655, which was identified as the main of caught-in or between injuries. It needs various methods to prevent injuries by the press machine. To reduce the accidents from press machine analysis of related accidents during the last three years and surveys for workers’ safety consciousness were conducted. And, it sought a method to apply the protective principle of the safety devices to the mold. From the accident analysis, it was shown that many accidents occurred when small materials were handled by hands near the mold of the full revolution clutch type press, and hand operating types caused more accidents than foot operating types. From surveys, workers were found to operate pressing job ignoring safety from habit or/and for high productivity, though they are aware of the danger. As a means of injury prevention by the safety device's protective principle, it suggested sequential refusal type as an alternative to overcome seclusion type of risk zone. And, to secure fundamental safety, it suggested a way not for part of body to slide into the risk zone from the existing method in which material feeding was originally made by hands. In addition, it suggested of using <b>Presence</b> <b>Sensing</b> <b>Device</b> Initiation (PSDI) safety device instead of foot operating switch. Finally, it suggested more intensive inspection, education and management by safety supervision authorities...|$|E
