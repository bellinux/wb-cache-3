5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a <b>prophylactic</b> <b>and</b> it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Preterm prelabor rupture of {{membrane}} (PPROM) causes maternal <b>and</b> neonatal complications. <b>Prophylactic</b> antiobiotics {{were used}} in the management of PPROM. The objectives of this retrospective study were to compare clinical course and outcome of PPROM managed expectantly with <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotics <b>and</b> antenatal corticosteroids with those without <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotics <b>and</b> antenatal corticosteroids. Results A total of 170 cases of singleton pregnant women with gestational age between 28 – 34 [*]weeks suffering from PROM during January 1998 to December 2009 were included; 119 cases received <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotics <b>and</b> antenatal corticosteroids while 51 cases did not received <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotics <b>and</b> antenatal corticosteroids.

2500|$|Doxepin is a reuptake {{inhibitor}} of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and has additional antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic activities. It {{is specifically}} an antagonist of the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the α1-adrenergic receptor, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Similarly to other TCAs, doxepin {{is also a}} potent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, and this action {{is thought to be}} involved in both its lethality in overdose and its effectiveness as an analgesic (including in the treatment of neuropathic pain, as a migraine <b>prophylactic,</b> <b>and</b> as a local anesthetic).

60|$|I {{have pointed}} out, {{in an earlier}} part of this chapter, {{that the history of}} all {{branches}} of science proves that they must attain a considerable stage of development before they yield practical 'fruits;' and this is eminently true of physiology. It is only within the present epoch, that physiology and chemistry have reached the point at which they could offer a scientific foundation to agriculture; and it is only within the present epoch, that zoology and physiology have yielded any very great aid to pathology and hygiene. But within that time, they have already rendered highly important services by the exploration of the phenomena of parasitism. Not only have the history of the animal parasites, such as the tapeworms and the trichina, which infest men and animals, with deadly results, been cleared up by means of experimental investigations, and efficient modes of prevention deduced from the data so obtained; but the terrible agency of the parasitic fungi and of the infinitesimally minute microbes, which work far greater havoc among plants and animals, has been brought to light. The 'particulate' or 'germ' theory of disease, as it is called, long since suggested, has obtained a firm foundation, in so far as it has been proved to be true in respect of sundry epidemic disorders. Moreover, it has theoretically justified prophylactic measures, such as vaccination, which formerly rested on a merely empirical basis; and it has been extended to other diseases with excellent results. Further, just as the discovery of the cause of scabies proved the absurdity of many of the old prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of that disease; so the discovery of the cause of splenic fever, and other such maladies, has given a new direction to <b>prophylactic</b> <b>and</b> curative measures against the worst scourges of humanity. Unless the fanaticism of philozoic sentiment overpowers the voice of philanthropy, and the love of dogs and cats supersedes that of one's neighbor, the progress of experimental physiology and pathology will, indubitably, in course of time, place medicine and hygiene upon a rational basis. Two centuries ago England was devastated by the plague; cleanliness and common sense were enough to free us from its ravages. One century since, small-pox was almost as great a scourge; science, though working empirically, and almost in the dark, has reduced that evil to relative insignificance. At the present time, science, working in the light of clear knowledge, has attacked splenic fever and has beaten it; it is attacking hydrophobia with no mean promise of success; sooner or later it will deal, in the same way, with diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fever. To one who has seen half a street swept clear of its children, or has lost his own by these horrible pestilences, passing one's offspring through the fire to Moloch seems humanity, compared with the proposal to deprive them of half their chances of health and life because of the discomfort to dogs and cats, rabbits and frogs, which may be involved in the search for means of guarding them.|$|E
