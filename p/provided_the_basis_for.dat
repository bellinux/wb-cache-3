5|$|According {{to another}} historian, Justin Daniel King, radical {{democracy}} benefited people individually, but harmed the state. On the other hand, Donald Kagan {{asserts that the}} democratic measures Pericles put into effect <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> an unassailable political strength. After all, Cimon finally accepted the new democracy and did not oppose the citizenship law, after he returned from exile in 451BC.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1940s, one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> more films noir of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including Black Angel (1946), Deadline at Dawn (1946), and Fear in the Night (1947).|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Bisceglie {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI. At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, Supervisory Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings. Linguistic analysis determined that the author of the essay papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a search warrant.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the planned role as a tender for torpedo boats, she was also intended {{to serve as a}} test platform for the new self-propelled torpedo. Up to the mid-1870s, the German navy had only experimented with a handful of torpedo ships, all of which were equipped with the old spar torpedo. The ship's design <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> both later German avisosthe and all subsequent light cruisers, but also to numerous foreign designs, such as several classes of French, Italian, and Austrian avisos and torpedo craft.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{began to}} build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then {{reserved}} only for battleships. The first vessel, , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser , with a more powerful armament and heavier armor. She was followed by an improved cruiser, , which <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> an even larger ship, which was named Sankt Georg. Each iteration carried a heavier armament and had a higher top speed than the preceding design.|$|E
5|$|SMS Kaiser Karl VI ("His Majesty's Ship Kaiser Karl VI") was {{the second}} of three armored cruisers built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was {{commissioned}} into the fleet. Kaiser Karl VI represented a significant improvement over the preceding designbeing faster and more heavily armed and armored. She <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the third design, , which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.|$|E

5|$|The Nclass was {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the SECR Kclass 2-6-4 passenger tank engine, also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 3-cylinder N1class of 1922. Production was delayed by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914, and the first Nclass rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes.|$|E
5|$|The old Principate auxilia regiments <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> {{units at}} all three grades. The Notitia Dignitatum lists about 70 alae and cohortes that {{retained}} their 2nd-century names, mostly limitanei. But traces of other auxilia regiments {{can be found in}} the praesentales and comitatenses armies. For example, many of the new-style auxilia palatina infantry regiments, considered among the best units in the army, were probably formed from old-style auxiliary cohortes, which they appear to closely resemble.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E

5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, {{but it was also}} declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> all future German light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the ship arrived in Leningrad, only the two forward gun turrets had been {{installed}} and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E

Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> further development in the future.|$|E

5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for the fictional world. Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like silver-plated design in contrast to the traditional buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000, {{also known}} as the Sega Computer Videogame SG-1000, is a cartridge-based home video game console {{manufactured}} by Sega and released in Japan, Australia, and other countries.

Introduced in 1983, the SG-1000 was released {{on the same day that}} Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom for short) in Japan. The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the SC-3000 computer and the redesigned SG-1000 II, {{also known as}} the Mark II, released in 1984.|$|E
