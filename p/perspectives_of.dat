5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another. The potential motivations and <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E

5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E

Upon visiting each world for the first time, each character must go through a Dive section, in which characters freefall down a tube and must clear a certain objective, such as obtaining a certain amount of points, defeating a certain amount of enemies in a time limit, or defeating a boss character. In this mode, Sora and Riku can attack opponents, slow down their descent, or dodge attacks. They can also pick up magic spells which give them a limited supply of magical attacks to use against enemies.|$|E

40|$|This paper builds upon a {{foundational}} paper (under review) which {{explores the}} rudiments <b>of</b> the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning. The quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning uses {{the principles of}} exchange theory or borrowed theory {{from the field of}} quantum holism pioneered by quantum physicist David Bohm (1971, 1973) to understand learning in a new way. Bohm proposes that everything exists as wholes, rather than as parts, and that everything is connected. Similarly, the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning proposes that individuals learn in holistic ways as they interact with temporal and in infinitely extending virtual worlds. Further, according to the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning, learners have infinite potential. In this paper, the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning is examined utilizing a combination of Schunk’s (1991) and Ertmer and Newby’s (1993) definitive questions for aligning learning theory with instructional design. These seven definitive questions focus on how learning happens, influential factors in learning, the role of memory, transfer of knowledge, modalities of learning that can best explain the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning, applicable assumptions, and a discussion of how instruction can be organized to optimize learning. Examples of strategies that facilitate the quantum <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> learning are provided...|$|R

As the band prepares to play a show, a man has a conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E

5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E
