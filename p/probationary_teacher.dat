The randomly selected samples of school board policies were obtained from the Nebraska Department of Education in the Spring, 2006. ^ All 48 principals responding to the survey said they evaluate <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> at least one time per semester, which is the minimum requirement by law. ^ According to principals, tenured teachers are observed and evaluated less frequently than <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers.</b> Only 85 % of the principals surveyed said they discuss the evaluation system procedures yearly with their teachers, though 100 % of policies state that this is to be done. ^ Of the 48 principals responding to the survey, 83 % said procedures used to evaluate <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> and tenured teachers are the same. All 49 school board policies reviewed described the frequency of evaluations of a tenured teacher, though those frequencies varied from one time per semester to one time every three years. ^ While 98 % of the policies reviewed provided a description of the district plan for training evaluators, just over 41 % of the principals responded that they had ever received formal training on how to use the evaluation system employed by their school. ...|$|R

National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966 - 1967 (SN: 66031, 66032, 66033, 67032, 67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN: 14 <b>Probationary</b> <b>Teachers,</b> 1968 - 1969 and SN: 15 <b>Probationary</b> <b>Teachers,</b> 1969 - 1970.

These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project. SN: 15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable: Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 and B 2 to all probationers Sept-Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1 to those attending induction conference Oct-Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2 to those attending discussion meetings Jan-June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3 to those at optional topics courses July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4 to those at overview conference July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5 to all probationers July 1970 : Questionnaire A 3 to all probationers (Questionnaire A 1, A 2 and A 3 were essentially identical, B 1, B 2 and B 3 completely identical.)

The general outline of the programme around which it was built is as follows: 1. Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 (a slightly altered version of A 1 - see SN: 14) distributed to all probationers at the beginning of their probationary year, was designed to investigate their attitudes, opinions and judgements with respect to: placement, assessment and guidance; classroom and teaching experience, attitudes to various approaches to teaching; continuing education; job expectations and professional standards; professional organizations. Questionnaire B 2, a 'Survey of Opinions about Education', is the same as B 1 (see SN: 014). 2. Sept - Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1, distributed to all participants at a one-day conference of induction into the profession, the LEA and the area, asked for comments on the programme generally, on the topics covered and on the methods used. Suggestions for future programmes were also elicited. 3. Oct - Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2, distributed to all participants at a series of general discussion meetings designed to 'help the <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> identify their significant problems, the underlying causes of and solutions to these problems', covered participant's opinion on topics covered, topics preferred for future meetings, attitude toward helpfulness of methods and activities in course, suggestions for aims of future courses, opinions on relevance and frequency of meetings. 4. Jan - June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3, distributed to all participants at a series of optional courses on specific topics designed to help the probationer find practical solutions to a variety of professional problems and including both theoretical and practical topics, covered participant's opinions on topics covered and topics preferred, the helpfulness of various methods and activities in the courses, contact with other participants, helpfulness and relevance of such meetings in general, length and frequency of meetings and suggestions for future aims. 5. July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4, distributed to participants at an overview conference designed to allow probationers, tutors and course organizers to review their past year's experience in a systematic fashion and to review prospects and wider issues within the profession, elicited comments on topics, organization, method, activities, participants, helpfulness and relevance of aims of the overview conference. 6. July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5, distributed to all participants at the conference and posted to all <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers,</b> concerned attendance at all the courses and reasons for non-attendance, opinions on materials and documents provided during course work, attitudes to overall aims of courses, time scheduling during meetings, types of educationalists chosen as tutors for courses, attitude towards relevance of induction courses in general, scheduling and pattern of courses and location of future meetings. 7.

A total of 100 <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> in their first year of teaching were surveyed anonymously on one occasion. After controlling for a range of variables known to influence stress and burnout in teachers, the duration of a teacher’s pre-service teacher education program added significantly to the explanation of variance in Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization scores. Based on Hobfoll and Freedy’s (1993) conservation of resources theory, the results of the present study suggests that teachers who have completed significantly less than four years of pre-service teacher education may have commenced their careers lacking important internal resources for handling the high work demands characteristic of the profession. ...|$|R

A further series of questions establishes the probationer's feelings towards own teaching, including whether satisfied with the age- and ability-range of own classes, whether feels comfortable with the children, whether using the same approaches to teaching as used during teaching practice and, if not, reasons for changes made, ways in which probationer feels own teaching could be made more effective (such as provision of more space, more books or materials, smaller classes, wider age range and so on), and the sources of information on conventions, both written and unwritten, which govern the life of the school. The probationer is also asked whether any part-time work or study is undertaken in addition to teaching, and the nature of any such work or study, whether expects to continue in the same school during the next year and, if not, for what reasons, what position expects to have attained in five year's time and, if the interviewee is a woman who is leaving the profession for family reasons, whether expects to return to teaching when commitments permit. After a comparison of present experience of teaching with expectations aroused during training, the probationer is asked to choose, from lists provided, the three problems found most important in terms of teaching, school community life and personal life. A final question asks for ways in which the probationer feels entry into the teaching profession might have been improved or made smoother.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to collect information about the conditions, opportunities, problems and needs of teachers at the beginning of their career and to assist in the development of services to them. National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966 - 1967 (SN: 66031, 66032, 66033, 67032, 67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN: 14 <b>Probationary</b> <b>Teachers,</b> 1968 - 1969 and SN: 15 <b>Probationary</b> <b>Teachers,</b> 1969 - 1970. The phasing of the enquiry followed the timetable: Spring 1966 : Survey of Directors of Education in the 162 LEA's in England and Wales (SN: 66031) June 1966 : Survey of Head Teachers (SN: 66032) Sept 1966 : First survey of probationers (SN: 66033) March 1967 : Oral interviews with sub-sample of probationers (SN: 67032) May 1967 : Follow-up questionnaire to probationers who responded to first questionnaire (SN: 67033) SN: 14 includes two questionnaires (A 1 and B 1) distributed to probationers in one rural and three urban areas in July 1969. These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project. SN: 15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable: Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 and B 2 to all probationers Sept-Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1 to those attending induction conference Oct-Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2 to those attending discussion meetings Jan-June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3 to those at optional topics courses July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4 to those at overview conference July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5 to all probationers July 1970 : Questionnaire A 3 to all probationers (Questionnaire A 1, A 2 and A 3 were essentially identical, B 1, B 2 and B 3 completely identical.) The questionnaires therefore measured both response to various course programmes and discussion meetings, and the overall effect of such courses on the professional judgements, opinions and actions of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers.</b> Main Topics : Variables Headteachers of selected schools were asked for information in three general categories: 1. School: Name of LEA; type of school (infant, infant/junior, junior, secondary modern, etc.); school address; whether school is county, voluntary controlled, voluntary aided, special agreement, or other; number of pupils on roll; whether most classes are co-educational; whether any children are boarders; by how many teachers school is below establishment; number of expected teaching vacancies by year's end; number of teaching hours Head carries out; existence of Deputy Head and number of teaching hours he/she carries out; date of school building construction; existence of separate Head's, Deputy Head's and staff rooms; number of children affected by over-crowding in schoolroom; location of school playing fields, if any; whether school has PTA or other organised parents group; visual aids available for use in school; whether school has special classes for backward children or an organised unit for ascertained ESN children; whether school suspends or alters normal time-table for internal examinations; proportion of fathers of children who are employed in non-manual occupations and proportion of children from 'difficult' neighbourhoods. Secondary school Head teachers are asked, further, whether school possesses separate and purpose-built rooms for specialist classes such as science laboratories and gymnasiums, whether teaching groups exist as form classes, subject sets, house or tutor groupings or other groupings, what types of examinations are taken by children in schools (vocational guidance, CSE, GCE etc.). Primary school Heads are asked whether most teaching classes in school comprise children in one, two, three, four, or five age groups, whether nature of age-grouping is result of deliberate policy or forced on headteacher by school conditions, whether children are grouped according to ability and whether children in school take any standardised 11 + selection tests. 2. Staff: Concerning the headteacher: age; sex; qualifications; teaching experience; number of years as Head at present school or in previous schools; and likelihood of continuation in present position. Concerning the school as a whole: approximate composition of staff by age and sex; number of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> on staff at present; number of unqualified teachers; number of teaching units per week carried out by part-time staff; proportion of long-term staff (over 5 years at present school). 3. Appointment and Placement of Probationary Teachers: latest date by which names of new probationers for September appointment known by Head; whether probationers apply directly to school or to LEA; whether candidates are interviewed by Head and successful candidate meets any member of staff before beginning of September term and, if so, which member or members; date by which new probationers would be notified of age and ability groups they are expected to teach and would be sent the syllabus or scheme of work they would be expected to teach from; Head's attitude toward supervision of probationer's work and amount of control they exercise; intervals at which probationer submits reports to Head; whether report is received from training institutions on each probationer and the relative importance attached to various kinds of information in such reports; number of students carrying out full-time teaching practice at school during previous year, and where responsibility for welfare of probationers lies besides with Head. A series of questions at the end of the survey attempt to establish the Head's opinion as to most prevalent problems probationers face in terms of teaching, school community life and personal life. A final question asks for means Head uses to advise and assess <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> during first teaching term...|$|R
30|$|While {{the systems}} for conferring tenure across states are procedurally different, the {{outcomes}} are not – few {{teachers who are}} eligible for tenure are denied this status. In the 2009 report, The Widget Effect, researchers find that {{in five of the}} six school districts they studied, {{less than one percent of}} <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> were denied tenure. Since the time of the report, several states and districts have increased the standards required to receive tenure. For example, in the 2010 – 2011 school year, New York City introduced more stringent requirements in order for teachers to achieve tenure. Teachers are now rated under a four-point scale that must incorporate student test scores, classroom observations, and parental feedback (the previous rating system only measured two levels – unsatisfactory and satisfactory). The number of teachers who were denied tenure outright increased from 1 percent in 2006 (approximately the same time period of the data used in this research) to 3 percent in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Cox {{returned}} to Ropes, Gray {{with the intention}} of spending his professional career there. Instead, he lasted five weeks. Dean Landis of the Harvard Law School offered to hire Cox as a <b>probationary</b> <b>teacher</b> in the fall of 1945. Cox accepted, despite the substantial cut in salary he would take, but on the condition that he would not have to teach corporations or property. Landis agreed; his expectation was that Cox should become a nationally recognized expert in labor law. In addition to labor law, Cox started out teaching torts. Later he would also teach unfair competition, agency and administrative law. He was made a permanent professor during the 1946-47 academic year, a time when the law school greatly increased enrollment in the post-war boom. During the 1947-48 Term Cox also volunteered for appointment by the Supreme Court to represent indigent defendants and was appointed in two cases of prisoners from the Eastern Pennsylvania Penitentiary in Philadelphia. In one case he obtained a reversal on the ground that the defendant had been deprived assistance of counsel during sentencing phase, where a lawyer might have prevented a misreading of the defendants' previous record. In the other case the Court affirmed, over four dissents, the possibly erroneous application of Pennsylvania's habitual offenders statute, even though the defendant was unrepresented at sentencing. Cox also became a frequent panelist at legal and judicial conferences.|$|E

40|$|In most states, K- 12 {{teachers}} receive tenure {{after serving}} a probationary {{period of several}} years. Teachers with tenure, or a continuing contract, are guaranteed due process {{before they can be}} dismissed from their job. I use a restricted use version of the 2007 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) to estimate the effect of tenure on teacher behavior and time allocation at school and outside of school. Estimates are obtained by exploiting the cross-state variation in the probationary period length of novice teachers within a difference-in-difference framework. I find that in the year that teachers are evaluated for tenure, they spend significantly more of their own money on classroom materials. Relative to the tenure evaluation year, once teachers receive tenure, they communicate less with students and parents outside of class and participate less in school and district committees. In those districts where at least one <b>probationary</b> <b>teacher</b> is fired, I find that teachers reallocate their teaching time. Immediately after receiving tenure, they spend less time teaching math and more time teaching English. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} {{currently}} witnessing a dizzying {{change as a}} result of political, economic and especially technological developments. These developments have had a great impact on countries, communities and individuals. As an expected outcome of these influences, such issues as globalism, nationalism, locality, national culture, intercultural convergence, multiculturalism, multilingualism, intercultural conformity, tolerance among difference religions have started to be discussed. At this point, people, influenced by consciousness of democracy, existential philosophy and psychology, have started to give importance to each other just because they are human beings. Thus, accepting individuals as they are and improving their unique abilities and capabilities without stereotyping them has become the major goal of education. That’s why {{there is a need for}} educators who can tolerate biological, sexual, racial, religious, cultural, economic and political differences among students. This has become more of an issue in countries which are members or candidates of European Union because they are multicultural. Education is the most significant means to follow these changes. The new primary education programs which has been put into practice in Turkey place emphasis on multicultural education, which can be seen as an important act in the EU accession period. However, it is highly essential that teachers are inclined to multicultural education as they are the ones to carry the programs into effect. The study gains importance in this respect. This study aims to find out the probationary teachers’ level of inclination to multicultural education. The universe of the study comprises the students at Kocaeli University, Department of Education and the sample includes the final year students of Kocaeli University, Department of Education. The data will be collected using the ‚Multicultural Personality Questionnaire‛ that will be developed by Van Der Zee ve Van Oudenhoven. This is a descriptive study. The data will be analyzed through arithmetical average and ANOVA and t tests will be used to measure whether probationary teachers’ level of inclination to multicultural education changes according to some personal variables. The results of the research stated that <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> are adequate in terms of multi-cultural personality while they are not in terms of emotional balance, a sub-dimension of multi-cultural personality. This result indicates the training need of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers</b> on multi-cultural education...|$|R

Selection and Placement of Probationers: what kind of information the Authority receives on each probationer and the kind of information found most helpful in both selection and placement; whether probationers are excluded from any of five types of teaching (supply, 'floating', remedial, reception or very large classes); whether probationers are appointed to a particular school, and the latest date by which probationer is notified of appointment to the Authority and of placement in the school. 2. Services to Probationers: forms of guidance offered to the probationer and institutions invited to give guidance. 3. Assessment: intervals at which progress information is sought; where responsibility for making assessment lies; recommended number of class observations for assessment purposes; where responsibility for final recommendation on probationer's suitability for teaching lies, and the number of teachers, both those with teacher training qualifications and those with other qualifications, who were adjudged to have successfully completed their probationary year, the number whose probation was to be extended for a further six months, and the number deemed unsuitable for further employment as teachers.

40|$|Among {{the main}} issues of future technology-enhanced {{learning}} systems, we can mention the following ones: {{the ability to}} reuse learning resources (learning objects, tools and services) from large repositories, {{to take into account}} the context and to allow dynamic adaptation to different learners based on substantial advances in pedagogical theories and knowledge models. In our framework, the goal of scenarios is to describe the learning and tutoring activities to acquire some knowledge domain (for instance physics) and know-how to solve a particular problem. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive and context-aware model of scenario based on a didactical theory and closely related to a domain model, a learner model, a context model. These models are acquired from: i) the know-how and real practices of teachers in a problem-based learning approach in a particular framework: an institution IUFM, different categories of <b>probationary</b> <b>teachers,</b> a course about ?the air as gas in its static and dynamic aspects: properties, theory and applications?; ii) the theory in didactic anthropology of knowledge of Chevallard [1]; iii) a hierarchical task model...|$|R
