40|$|Presentation {{entitled}} : Ecosystem Analysis of Wetland and Riparian Zone restoration at the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge over Twenty Years / by Schyler Reis, Lisa Ellsworth and J. Boone KauffmanHart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (HMNAR) {{established in}} 1936, is 101, 000 ha in area. The refuge was grazed by domestic livestock from the 1870 s until their exclusion in 1990. Just {{prior to removal}} of livestock, <b>photopoints</b> were taken at various riparian and wetland locations throughout the refuge to document riparian condition following decades of use by domestic livestock. The objective {{of this study was}} to relocate and rephotograph these <b>photopoints,</b> collect associated stream channel data, estimate the change in channel width and depth and quantify stream side vegetation composition. <b>Photopoints</b> (N= 23) with sufficient distinct background features necessary to allow relocation were selected. Of the 23 <b>photopoints,</b> 13 pairs of stream channel data could be quantified using field data (current) and images (historical and current). In historical photos heavy use of riparian areas by livestock was evident. There were large areas of bare ground cover associated with trampling damage, and the stream banks were highly eroded. Following 21 years of livestock rest there is a dramatic reduction in exposed banks, a return of stream side vegetation including willows (Salix spp.), and a widening of riparian vegetation zone. In the uplands there are encroachment of Western Juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Over twenty years of cattle exclusion has lead to dramatic changes in stream channel width to depth ratios. The mean width to depth ratio of the remnant channels were found to be much higher (mean 16. 75, SD 13. 48) than the current channel's ratio (mean 4. 19 2. 47, p= 0. 007). The mean width of remnant channels were found to be much higher(mean 7. 6 m) than the current channels width(mean 1. 2 m), a reduction of 84 %. Current mean streamside vegetation composition of understory vegetation is as follows (N= 17) : Bare ground: 4. 8 %, Litter: 21. 7 %, Forbs: 16. 4 %, Grasses: 22 % and Sedges: 34. 1 %...|$|R

40|$|Maori-owned Motu-o-Kura, {{the only}} island on the Hawkes Bay coast, was infested with Norway rats for many decades. However, in winter 1990, a {{successful}} rat eradication operation was mounted. A monitoring programme {{was established to}} check on any rodent presence and to follow changes in the island's ecosystem. Although visiting the island {{on a regular basis}} has been difficult, the monitoring has shown dramatic recovery of lizard and invertebrate populations, and a major regeneration of the vegetation, following rat eradication. Meanwhile, there has been a decline of the titi (sooty shearwater) population breeding on the island, virtually to extinction. It is recommended that the monitoring programme be continued, but that it be adjusted so that the main ecosystem changes continue to be tracked annually, but the demand for formal measurement and on people's time is lessened.

The research reported on here has been designed to gain an understanding of the vegetation condition and trends and to assess whether the management was successful. Vegetation plots and <b>photopoints</b> were established and first surveyed in 1980, were resurveyed and expanded in coverage in 1987, and were reassessed and further extended in 1993. They show very clearly that forest health and survival are profoundly dependent on conservation management- chiefly control of domestic stock and feral mammals- and that the effectiveness of the management is patchy. Forest canopies are vulnerable to damage and death caused by storms, especially on exposed sites, and if unprotected, forests quickly collapse and disappear- within a few decades.

40|$|Radiative {{transitions}} between charmonium states {{offer an}} insight into the internal structure of heavy-quark bound states within QCD. We compute, {{for the first time}} within lattice QCD, the transition form-factors of various multipolarities between the lightest few charmonium states. In addition, we compute the experimentally unobservable, but physically interesting vector form-factors of the η_c, J/ψ and χ_c 0. To this end we apply an ambitious combination of lattice techniques, computing three-point functions with heavy domain wall fermions on an anisotropic lattice within the quenched approximation. With an anisotropy ξ= 3 at a_s ∼ 0. 1 fm we find a reasonable gross spectrum and a hyperfine splitting ∼ 90 MeV, which compares favourably with other improved actions. In general, after extrapolation of lattice data at non-zero Q^ 2 to the <b>photopoint,</b> our results agree within errors with all well measured experimental values. Furthermore, results are compared with the expectations of simple quark models where we find that many features are in agreement; beyond this we propose the possibility of constraining such models using our extracted values of physically unobservable quantities such as the J/ψ quadrupole moment. We conclude that our methods are successful and propose to apply them to the problem of radiative transitions involving hybrid mesons, with the eventual goal of predicting hybrid meson photoproduction rates at the GlueX experiment.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how photodynamic therapy (PDT) promotes stabilization and reduction of regional atherosclerosis. BackgroundPhotodynamic therapy, a combination of photosensitizer and targeted light to promote cell apoptosis, has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. MethodsForty New Zealand White rabbits were fed with cholesterol. The iliac arteries were balloon denuded and randomized to receive either <b>PhotoPoint</b> PDT treatment (photosensitizer and light) (Miravant Medical Technologies, Santa Barbara, California), photosensitizer (MV 0611) alone, or light alone and were then compared at 7 and 28 days. Arteries were examined for evidence of plaque volume, cell number, macrophage and smooth muscle cell (SMC) content, and plaque cell proliferation. ResultsCompared with contralateral iliac artery controls at 7 days, plaque progression was reduced by approximately 35 % (p < 0. 01); plaque progression was further reduced to approximately 53 % (p < 0. 01) by 28 days, leading to an increase in lumen patency (p < 0. 05). At 7 days after PDT, percent plaque area occupied by macrophages decreased by approximately 98 % (p < 0. 001) and SMCs by approximately 72 % (p < 0. 05). At 28 days after PDT, removal of macrophages was sustained (approximately 92 % decrease, p < 0. 001) and plaques were repopulated with non-proliferating SMCs (approximately 220 % increase, p < 0. 001). There was no evidence of negative or expansive arterial remodeling, thrombosis, or aneurysm formation. ConclusionsPhotodynamic therapy simultaneously reduces plaque inflammation and promotes repopulation of plaques with a SMC-rich stable plaque cell phenotype while reducing disease progression. These early healing responses suggest that PDT is a promising therapy for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to examine the}} effect of lanang onion extract to {{accelerate}} the reduction of erythema inflammation sign in contaminated wound. A true experimental with posttest only control group design was used. The variable observed was a photograph of wound taken throughout the experiment which was then processed by program corel <b>photopoint</b> suite graphic 12, so it could provide average value of the decrease of erythema inflammation sign. Samples consisted of 4 groups, each group was composed of five rats. A series of extract concentration were applied, e. g. 128 mg/ml, 256 mg/ml, and 512 mg/ml for the first, second and third group respectively. In addition, 10 % povidone iodine was used for the forth group. The result showed that by the eighth day, the average decrease of mean red color intensity or the erythema values were 49. 26, 45. 44, 45. 32 and 62. 96 in the first, second, third and forth group respectively. Statistical analysis employing one way ANOVA showed significant difference for all groups [o. ooo (0. 05) ], however, significant difference [0, 0000 < (0, 05) ] was found between group 1 and 3, group 1 and 4, group 2 and 3, group 2 and 4, group 3 and 4. Employing simple regression correlation, significance correlation of less than 0. 05 and R 0. 705 was found for the extract in reducing the erythema. It was concluded that Lanang onion extract was better in accelerating the reduction of erythema inflamation sign than that with povidone iodine. It was suggested that further studies particularly using microbiology method were still required to prove this finding...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Cattle (Bos taurus) were the most destructive agents of Hawaiian forests in the nineteenth century. Cattle continuously grazed in koa (Acacia koa) communities on Mauna Loa in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park from the early 1800 s to 1948. Park managers documented the deleterious impact of cattle grazing on koa regeneration in 1941 by establishing exclosures and vegetation plots. Prolific regeneration occurred with cattle exclusion. We relocated their exclosures in 1992 - 1994, re-photographed the stands from the same <b>photopoints,</b> counted koa and other trees by height and/or diameter classes, and determined cover of understory vegetation. We also located the exclosures on aerial photographs from 1954, 1965, 1977, 1986, and 1992. We found that koa has nearly disappeared from the adjacent ranch land where cattle grazing continued, whereas koa stands have expanded greatly by root suckering to form large stands of continuous forest in the Park. Koa stands expanded little in the 20 yrs following termination of grazing in 1948, probably {{because of the presence of}} stray cattle and building populations of feral goats (Capra hircus). By the mid- 1970 s stray cattle and feral goats were controlled and expansion of koa stands greatly accelerated. Koa forest canopy may become more open in the future. Dense mats of alien vegetation have developed in the koa understory and may be inhibiting koa regeneration, and a lethal vascular wilt disease has spread. We need to understand the current dynamics of koa forest that have developed in the absence of cattle and goats better before additional management of koa forests is undertaken.

40|$|Donatia novae-zelandiae, Abrotanella forsteroides, Dracophyllum {{minimum and}} Phyllachne colensoi are four superficially similar bolster species {{found in the}} Tasmanian alpine vegetation. The {{ecological}} differentiation of the ranges of these species, {{the dynamics of the}} formation and persistence of complex mosaics of two or more of these species and the functional significance of the bolster form were areas in which there were many hypothesis but few data. Growth studies undertaken in Tasmania showed significant seasonal differences in the competitive ranking of cushion species. Annual shoot production ranged from 426 - 709 g/m 2 for A. forsteroides; 359 - 477 g/m 2 for D. minimum; 322 - 572 g/m 2 for D. novae-zelandiae; and 282 - 285 g/m 2 for P. colensoi. These figures are greater than those reported from cushion communities in New Zealand and from physiognomically similar communities in the northern hemisphere, probably reflecting the maritime climate and the longer growing season of the Tasmanian alpine zone. Seed production was highly variable between sites with D. novae-zelandiae producing between 2, 370 - 38, 900 /m 2 and D. minimum between 0 - 17, 140 /m 2 over the 1982 / 83 summer. Estimates of the lateral growth rate of A. forsteroides in open situations on peat substrates ranged from 6. 7 - 14. 7 mm diameter increase/year. D. minimum seedlings on rocky and well drained mineral soils only achieved lateral growth rates of between 0 - 7 mm/year. Data from the growth studies showed that cushion distribution at Mt. Field could not be explained by either soil moisture or soil nutrient preferences. Growth was found to be highly variable from year to year and season to season both between species and within species over their altitudinal ranges. It was concluded that interspecific competition between bolster species plays little role in determining their overall distribution patterns. Climatic modelling suggests that distribution of the species is primarily controlled by the temperature (this is presumed to relate to competition from taller growing shrubs and graminoids) and past climatic history. Donatia ilovae-zelandiae, Abrotanella forsteroidel, and Dracophyllum minimum may still be expanding their ranges following the climatic amelioration since the height of the Last Glacial. Investigations into the dynamics of a bolster heath modified and improved the model proposed by Jackson (1981). Pathways of succession due to changes in water table appear to result from complex interactions between the water table level, propagule source and species already present on the site. Data from a peat core indicate that once bolster communities have become established, they can persist for very long periods. In the succession from bare ground to closed bolster communities there is a general lack of pioneering species. Results from the growth study, the patterns of reinvasion of drained tarns and studies of permanent <b>photopoints</b> are consistent with the view that succession in bolster communities is best described by inhibition or tolerance models (Connell and Slatyer 1977). Competition appears {{to play an important role}} at the establishment phase in mature bolster communities but once establishment has occurred it is much less important. Competition also appears to be of little importance in the building phase of bolster Communities in highly stressed environments. Attempts to elucidate dynamics by studying pattern in mosaic bolster communities using spectral analysis failed due to the inability of this technique to separate patch size and inter-patch distance. The roots of all cushion species freeze at temperatures between - 1 ° and - 5 ° C. Nonetheless the insulating properties of cushion peals are so effective that it is unlikely that root freezing ever occurs with adult plants in the field, at least under the present climatic conditions. Similarly the thermal characteristics of peat soils are such that seedling death due to root freezing would also be an extremely rare event. Short interval temperature measurements showed A. forsteroides capable of achieving cushion surface temperatures 10 ° C above ambient temperatures. It is suggested that this feature of cushion plants may allow them to undertake photosynthesis under otherwise limiting conditions and may significantly extend their growing season. Anatomical investigation of the four cushion species showed a highly variable internal structure. This diversity is difficult to interpret. The scleromorphic nature of most of the species may be related to nutrition. The xeromorphic features exhibited by the four species and the thermal characteristics of the cushion form are inconsistent with the hypothesis that these species suffer significant periods of water deficit...|$|R
40|$|On July 1, 1984 the Bonneville Power Administration and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to initiate fish habitat enhancement work in the Joseph Creek subbasin of the Grande Ronde River Basin in northeast Oregon. In July of 1985 the Upper and Middle Grande Ronde River, and Catherine Creek subbasins {{were included in the}} intergovernmental contract, and on March 1, 1996 the Wallowa River subbasin was added. The primary goal of ''The Grande Ronde Basin Fish Habitat Enhancement Project'' is to access, create, improve, protect, and restore riparian and instream habitat for anadromous salmonids, thereby maximizing opportunities for natural fish production within the basin. This project provided for implementation of Program Measure 703 (C) (1), Action Item 4. 2 of the Northwest Power Planning Council's Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (NPPC, 1987), and continues to be implemented as offsite mitigation for mainstem fishery losses caused by the Columbia River hydro-electric system. All work conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is on private lands and therefore requires that considerable time be spent developing rapport with landowners to gain acceptance of, and continued cooperation with this program throughout 10 - 15 year lease periods. This project calls for passive regeneration of habitat, using riparian enclosure fencing as the primary method to restore degraded streams to a normative condition. Active remediation techniques using plantings, off-site water developments, site-specific instream structures, or whole channel alterations are also utilized where applicable. Individual projects contribute to and complement ecosystem and basin-wide watershed restoration efforts that are underway by state, federal, and tribal agencies, and local watershed councils. Work undertaken during 2000 included: (1) Implementing 2 new projects in the Grande Ronde drainage, and retrofitting one old project that will protect an additional 1. 3 miles of stream and 298. 3 acres of habitat; (2) Conducting instream work activities in 3 streams to enhance habitat and/or restore natural channel dimensions, patterns or profiles; (3) Improving fish passage in Bear Creek to restore tributary and mainstem access; (4) Planting and seeding 6. 7 stream miles with 7, 100 plants and 365 lbs. of seed; (5) Establishing 18 new photopoints and retaking 229 existing <b>photopoint</b> pictures; (6) Monitoring stream temperatures at 12 locations on 6 streams; (7) completing riparian fence, water gap and other maintenance on 98. 7 miles of project fences.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{noticeable}} shift in focus in biodiversity research in New Zealand over recent decades. Research has traditionally focused on biodiversity protection on the public estate, which was comprised primarily of ecosystems with lower productive potential (generally over 500 m asl). Private lands generally have higher production potential and are often used for intensive cultivation and agricultural practices. They still however have significant potential for protecting biodiversity values. One of the key tools for protecting biodiversity values on privately owned lands in the Canterbury region are through legally binding QEII open space covenants and there is significant potential through industry certifications. QEII covenants are placed on the land in perpetuity and provide legally binding protection for biodiversity or landscape values within the covenant. This protection is voluntary and allows the land owner to continue to use the land for economic benefit providing it does not prove detrimental to biodiversity through monitoring outcomes. Case studies of QEII covenants that contain grazing clauses in the Canterbury region {{were used to determine}} what values are present and what monitoring is occurring in the field within these ecosystems. Photopoints and informal visual monitoring were the primary methods used by the QEII representatives to monitor vegetation in all of the covenants. Monitoring forms a critical feedback for all biodiversity protection. It is especially important to have an accurate feedback on vegetation condition and change from monitoring on properties that are grazed. Monitoring needs to be capable of providing sufficient information on vegetation change on these sites so that the most suitable grazing levels can be obtained by land managers. This thesis focuses on monitoring methods to ensure that this feedback is suitable and that the methods are cost effective. Current vegetation monitoring techniques were reviewed to determine which methods would be most suited to monitoring in these ecosystems where resources are tightly restricted and observers may not have existing skills and experience in monitoring these ecosystems. Methods reviewed were quadrats, transects, height-frequencies, photopoints, needle point, biomass, tagged plants, visual rank and remote sensing. Each method is described and then assessed on its suitability for monitoring tussock shrublands, with cost effectiveness being an important criterion. Of these methods quadrats, transects and height-frequencies were the most robust but also the most intensive and least cost effective methods. Visual rank, needle point and photopoints were the most cost effective, but are generally suited to monitoring single objectives. In most cases a combination of methods would be ideal to suit the objectives of the monitoring. QEII <b>photopoint</b> monitoring should follow guidelines more closely and include more complimentary information with their photographs. Clear monitoring objectives should be developed for every covenant that is grazed and these need to be determined before it is possible to accurately select appropriate monitoring methods. These objectives will also provide the monitoring program with more structure and direction. If possible a detailed management plan for each grazed covenant would be beneficial for values present. QEII are in a unique position, where they have the potential to develop a data base of biodiversity information for private land and contribute to other projects like the National Vegetation Survey (NVS) ...|$|E
