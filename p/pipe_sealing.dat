Plastic materials can be used, but metals typically have a higher bursting strength and so will produce more concussive force.

40|$|Roxtec is {{well-known}} {{as a company}} which designs and supplies cable and <b>pipe</b> <b>sealing</b> systems. The purpose of this thesis was to develop new solutions to verify the installed systems. We use some chemistry knowledge and modern technology, such as pressure sensors, etc. {{to meet the needs}} mentioned above. We have added some new function into the original stay plate, too. And it enables the stay plate to tell the tightness of the sealing system by measuring the lateral displacement of the modules. We also assumed that we can compress the system by a torque wrench with certain Nm instead of checking the sealed system by wedge clip. 072772415...|$|E

50|$|Water first {{enters the}} National Water Carrier through a several hundred meter long {{pipeline}} which is submerged under {{the northern part}} of Sea of Galilee. The water passes into a reservoir on the shore and then travels on to a pumping station. The pipeline is made up of nine pipes which are joined by an internal cable threaded through them. Each of these pipes includes twelve concrete pipes, each five meters long and three meters wide. As these pipes were cast, they were encased in steel <b>pipes,</b> <b>sealed</b> at the ends and floated out onto the lake. A winged star-shaped cap is mounted in a vertical section of the underwater pipe to allow water to be taken in from all directions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{technique}} {{took into}} account the high underground water level silty soil with stronger capillarity, subgrade soil easy water softened in Yellow River flood plain areas. It seriously affected the stability of subgrade. If lay a layer of gravel cushion in the ground, and then buried soft permeable pipes in {{the lower part of}} embankment, the permeable pipes filled with sand, the top of <b>pipes</b> <b>sealed</b> with geotextile, it would form the vertical drainage channel for the capillary water. So capillary water would along the vertical drainage channels formed by sand core soft permeable pipe and horizontal drainage channels formed by gravel cushion flowed out of the subgrade. The reliability of the method is verified by seep/w module in GEO-studio. This technique could effectively improve the strength and stability of subgrade, reduce the adverse effects of capillary water on the roadbed...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos and {{artificial}} mineral fibers were used actively at thermal power plants (TPP) as heat insulation of <b>pipes,</b> <b>seal</b> plates, electrical insulation, etc. But content of asbestos fibers {{in the air}} of working zone at TPP was not registered to date. Therefore, aim of the work was to assess asbestos containing dust in the air of working zone at steam turbine and gas turbine TPP in the east region of the country. It was found that old insulation at TPP is mixture of asbestoses that contains chrysotile asbestos and traces of amphibole asbestoses – crocidolite and anthophyllite. In the majority of investigated workplaces at the steam turbine TPP significant dust generation with exceed of maximum one-time exposure limits (2 mg/m 3) was observed.

40|$|The radon {{resistance}} of different residential construction features was evaluated for the Florida residential construction standard to distinguish regions requiring active radon controls from those where passive controls suffice. Radon resistance, {{defined as the}} ratio of reference indoor radon levels to levels with a particular construction feature, was estimated individually for candidate features using model simulations and indoor radon measurements. Active radon control by sub-slab ventilation (suction pit or ventilation mat systems) was most effective, followed by sub-slab vapor barriers, increased house ventilation, improved slab-foundation design, improved concrete quality, sealed slab cracks and openings, and <b>sealed</b> <b>pipe</b> penetrations. <b>Sealing</b> cracks related to slab reinforcement and soil compaction made little difference. For Florida residences, passive features reduce indoor radon {{by more than a}} factor of two, and active features give further reductions to exceed a factor of ten.

50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill <b>pipe</b> <b>seal</b> in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank fill pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|R
50|$|When making heat pipes, {{there is}} no need to create a vacuum in the pipe. One simply boils the working fluid in the heat pipe until the {{resulting}} vapour has purged the non-condensing gases from the <b>pipe,</b> and then <b>seals</b> the end.|$|R

Devices emitting {{loud noises}} {{have also been}} used, including broadcasts of killer whale sounds, pingers, and acoustic buzzers. These often employ shrill sounding screams broadcast between 12 and 17 kHz. Acoustic deterrent devices normally broadcast near 10 kHz and use high volume.
