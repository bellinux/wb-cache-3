40|$|Order pickers and {{individual}} {{differences between them}} could have a substantial impact on <b>picking</b> <b>performance,</b> but are largely ignored in studies on order picking. This paper explores the role of individual differences in <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> with various picking tools (pick by voice, RF-terminal picking and pick to light) and methods (parallel, zone and dynamic zone picking). A unique realistic field experiment with 101 participants (academic students, vocational students and professional pickers) is employed to investigate the influence of individual differences, especially the Big Five personality traits, on <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of productivity and quality. The results suggest that (PbV) performs better than RF-terminal picking, and that Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness {{and the age of}} the picker {{play a significant role in}} predicting <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> with voice and RF-terminals.

40|$|Order picking {{operations}} play {{a critical}} role in the order fulfillment process of distribution centers (DCs). Picking a batch of orders is often favored when customers? demands create a large number of small orders, since the traditional single-order picking process results in low utilization of order pickers and significant operational costs. Specifically, batch picking improves order <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> by consolidating multiple orders in a "batch" to reduce the number of trips and total travel distance required to retrieve the items. As more pickers are added to meet increased demand, order <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> is likely to decline due to significant picker blocking. However, in batch picking, the process of assigning orders to particular batches allows additional flexibility to reduce picker blocking. This dissertation aims to identify, analyze, and control, or mitigate, picker blocking while batch picking in picker-to-part systems. We first develop a large-scale proximity-batching procedure that can enhance the solution quality of traditional batching models to near-optimality as measured by travel distance. Through simulation studies, picker blocking is quantified. The results illustrate: a) a complex relationship between picker blocking and batch formation; and b) a significant productivity loss due to picker blocking. Based on our analysis, we develop additional analytical and simulation models to investigate the effects of picker blocking in batch picking and to identify the picking, batching, and sorting strategies that reduce congestion. A new batching model (called Indexed order Batching Model (IBM)) is proposed to consider both order proximity and picker blocking to optimize the total order picking time. We also apply the proposed approach to bucket brigade picking systems where hand-off delay as well as picker blocking must be considered. The research offers new insights about picker blocking in batch picking operations, develops batch picking models, and provides complete control procedures for large-scale, dynamic batch picking situations. The twin goals of added flexibility and reduced costs are highlighted throughout the analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} market for online grocery {{shopping}} requires improvement of operations and remaining {{ahead of the}} competition. The online supermarket {{is a relatively new}} market and has other challenges than regular warehouses due to order sizes and the products it handles; both fresh and preserved, but also fragile products. This influences several processes in the warehouse, of which order picking is the most expensive part of the operation. Therefore, ways to improve the order <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> have been examined, resulting in the following research question: How can the overall manual <b>picking</b> <b>performance,</b> from a human perspective, in a warehouse be measured and improved? There are six decision factors for order picking in a warehouse that influence the performance: layout design, storage assignment, zoning, batching, routing and technical equipment selection. Next, the following three types of human factors play a large role in the order picking performance: physical, cognitive and organizational factors. All these factors have been researched individually, but seldom in combination with each other. Therefore, the focus of this research is on the influence of technical equipment on the physical and cognitive factors. In the warehouse of Picnic, the picking process is a manual procedure, where order pickers walk around with (mainly) pick carts with totes on it. They receive order lines on the scanner which is attached to their wrist. There are significant differences in picking speed between different order pickers. The picking speed depends on experience, but also on the ease of performing a certain action like scanning a product or grabbing a product. The biggest challenges for Picnic are the reduction of the most time-consuming components of the pick process. The duration of each of these components can be measured with a time and motion study. A Predetermine Time and Motion Study is used to carry out the time and motion study. Order pickers walked their order pick rounds with an action camera attached to their heads to make recordings of the pick process. This footage is analysed by labelling the actions an order picker performs when picking an order line: looking at the scanner, grabbing the product, scanning the product, putting the product in the tote, scanning the tote, walking with the pick cart, walking without the pick cart, walking with the product, inputting the quantity into the scanner, searching for the product, making a mistake, talking to other pickers. The analysed footage is used to determine the times spent on each of the actions. After determination of the times spent per action, they were compared to the Methods Time Measurement (MTM- 1) required times to determine the points of improvement. The relationship between the human factors and the actions of an order pick round have been determined. The order pickers can be divided into three groups; slow, medium and fast. The slow pickers take more time per action, they take more time walking, reading their scanner and picking the product. Fast pickers tend to combine more actions and therewith reduce time. The study also showed that there is more variance within the groups of the slow and medium pickers. The faster pickers are more experienced pickers. The most time-consuming actions when picking an order pick line are looking at the scanner (± 15 %) and walking (± 25 %). Looking at the scanner takes slow pickers almost twice as much time as medium or fast pickers. The slow pickers also spend more of their time walking with their pick cart than the medium and fast pickers. Next, the slow pickers walk slower than faster pickers. This results in more walking time for the slow pickers. Five alternatives to decrease the time spent on looking at the scanner and walking have been determined: 1. Change the scanner interface, in the current interface the letters are too small and there is too much information displayed 2. Optical head-mounted display, the removal of the action to lift and tilt the arm {{to be able to read}} the scanner will decrease the time to read the scanner 3. More totes per pick cart, an increase in pick cart size results in shorter distances between consecutive picks and therewith reducing the total time spent on walking 4. Automated pick carts, when pickers do not have to pull the pick carts anymore, they can walk faster 5. Batching, batching products to totes and totes to pick carts based on location in the pick circuit, makes it possible to make short-cuts and thus reducing the time spent on walking The interest of both pickers and Picnic are taken into account to determine the best alternative. The human factors of the pickers, like physical inconvenience and learning curve, should be as low as possible. These are determined by comparing the alternatives to the current situation. The costs of implementing the alternative should also be as low as possible. The order lines per hour should increase as much as possible; the number of order lines per hour is determined by using a discrete event simulation model. The interest of the picker and of Picnic is determined for each of the alternatives. Trade-offs have been made between the human factors, costs and order lines per hour, resulting in quick-wins and long-term alternatives. The quick-wins are the improvement of the scanner interface and the increase of the number of totes per pick cart. The long-term alternatives are the optical head-mounted display and the use of automated pick carts. The two quick-wins have been implemented in the warehouse and the first results are promising, the increase of the number of totes per pick cart size seems to lead to a decrease in time per order line of 18 %. However, this is based on a single pick round so no conclusions can be drawn yet. Also, the implementation of the improved scanner interface seems to work out well, the first reactions of the order pickers are that they can more easily read the scanners. However, also no conclusions can be drawn here since this has not been researched extensively. The <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> is measured by determining the time spent on each element of an order line for an order picker. The most promising alternatives improve the <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> in a warehouse where the operation is not completely automated.

40|$|The {{importance}} of warehouses have on companies ’ supply chain {{has been increasing}} {{in the past few}} years. This pressures warehouses in attempting to decrease costs to become more efficient. In the supply chain a warehouse can serve many purposes such as taking advantage of forward buys, meet uncertainties in the supply chain and many more. While these tasks are beneficial for the supply chain, the very labor intensive operations inside the warehouse can mean significantly high operating costs. Therefore, any inefficiency {{can be seen as a}} major opportunity for cost reduction. Among the most vital decisions in warehouse planning is the storage assignment policy. The decision of where to locate the products inside the storage space of the warehouse has been proven to have a considerable impact in the overall warehouse productivity. To tackle this problem a methodology that can be used to select a best overall storage assign-ment policy was developed. The methodology combines simulation and optimization to design test and evaluate alternative policies. The first part of the methodology is used to characterize <b>picking</b> <b>performance,</b> next an optimization method is used measure the expected performance of each policy and afterwards the storage assignment policy is tested under uncertainty.

30|$|This {{category}} {{is among the}} highlighted aspects in the literature but only {{a small group of}} practitioners mentioned any related concern. One reason can be the possibility of different perspectives on warehouse problems. According to one of the interviewees, if storage and picking are not done efficiently, the problem might be perceived as a space problem. Various picking methods, e.g., single order picking, batch picking and zone picking, are suggested in the literature, but their performance for different warehouse designs is a matter of debate. In addition to traditional evaluation of <b>picking</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of travel/picking time, other criteria need to be investigated such as lead time, earliness and tardiness, which are important factors specifically when the warehouse is feeding a JIT system. Warehouse aisles are not usually very wide to let multiple pickers work together without interference. So, in case of planning picking operations for multiple pickers, one objective can be to minimize the congestion. One of the research streams in this {{category is}} to develop mathematical models for optimal picking path. The benefits of using optimized picking path for each pick list, versus having a generic route, can be investigated to understand when it is suitable to choose either of these two approaches. Considering the picking operations, one important task is to plan the sorting process, which is when items of different wave picks are traveling on conveyors and need to be sorted when coming to the accumulation point, so goods of each order list need to be sent to the assigned lane. Two decision problems should be investigated more: order of releasing picking waves and order-lane assignment.|$|E
