Sales data were collected from Jordan Cattle Auction and ten other auction barns and divided into two groups: 1) Premium (Jordan Cattle Auction), 2) Non-Premium (All other auction barns). Data were collected for 7 selected weeks from November 1999 to November 2000. 17, 958 premium cattle were compared to 28, 786 non-premium cattle to determine price differences between sex and weight groups.

40|$|The {{chapters}} of this dissertation explore related {{aspects of the}} procurement of conservation services from private landowners. In the first chapter, heuristic laboratory experiments reveal the impact of potential government regulation on strategic forces and efficiency properties in conservation procurement auctions. In the second chapter, data from past procurement auctions are analyzed to discover the existence and magnitude of <b>premiums</b> <b>received</b> by auction participants. The first Chapter, “Procurement Auctions Under Regulatory Threat,” examines how strategic forces and efficiency properties are impacted in auctions for the procurement of environmental services when a threat of regulation is levied. Laboratory experiments examining different regulatory environments demonstrate that a threat of regulation will {{reduce the amount of}} public funds necessary to purchase a given level of environmental services. However, adverse selection costs and equity are negatively impacted by threat implementation. The second Chapter, “Estimating Bid Inflation in Procurement of Environmental Services,” studies the size of <b>premiums</b> <b>received</b> by program participants in conservation programs. Predictions informed by economic literature and theory elicit the underlying value distribution for a unique dataset of procurement auctions. Average premiums for auction participants range from almost 50 percent to less than 1 percent across auction periods and institutions. The results demonstrate that both repetition and rule variation may improve the efficiency of procurement auctions. The auctions studied here are shown to yield efficiency improvements of more than 32 percent over standard fixed-payment schemes for service procurement...|$|R

50|$|The seller's {{potential}} loss on a naked put can be substantial. If the stock falls {{all the way}} to zero (bankruptcy), his loss is equal to the strike price (at which he must buy the stock to cover the option) minus the <b>premium</b> <b>received.</b> The potential upside is the <b>premium</b> <b>received</b> when selling the option: if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration, the option seller keeps the premium, and the option expires worthless. During the option's lifetime, if the stock moves lower, the option's premium may increase (depending on how far the stock falls and how much time passes). If it does, it becomes more costly to close the position (repurchase the put, sold earlier), resulting in a loss. If the stock price completely collapses before the put position is closed, the put writer potentially can face catastrophic loss. In order to protect the put buyer from default, the put writer is required to post margin. The put buyer does not need to post margin because the buyer would not exercise the option if it had a negative payoff.|$|E
