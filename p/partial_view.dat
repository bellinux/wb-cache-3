Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge {{presented}} an article at the 2005 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries {{with only a}} <b>partial</b> <b>view</b> of the network to infer which nodes {{are being used to}} relay the anonymous streams. These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user. Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.|$|E

Along the walkway are name plaques that local people funded to help towards raising the restoration funds. The modern pavilion structure at the pier head was designed by Liverpool architects Shed KM and cost £1.2 million; the building houses a cafeteria with airport style floor to ceiling windows overlooking the beach {{and a collection of}} vintage mechanical amusement machines and penny arcade. The exhibition of Edwardian and Victorian machines operates on pre-decimalisation pennies, available to purchase on-site at £1 for 10 old pennies.|$|E

Scott only had a <b>partial</b> <b>view</b> of the property from {{the road and the}} events portrayed in the novel, set {{at the end of the}} 12th century, are fictitious; Scott believed the castle to have been Saxon in origin, a view shared by many 19th-century commentators. Although the writer John Wainwright was still able to praise the [...] "picturesque view" [...] around the castle in 1826, the antiquarian Ecroyd Smith commented with concern in 1887 on the changing character of the location, in particular the factories that were growing up around the new railway line and the [...] "murky atmosphere" [...] the industrial works created.|$|E

30|$|Another {{advantage}} of using gossiping to implement <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> {{is that it}} provides a natural mechanism for tackling changes to the network by disseminating information about newly joined nodes or by gradually removing from <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> nodes that left the system. This is a desirable feature even considering that {{we are dealing with}} servers (and not end-user systems) and thus that it is fair to assume that churn will be very low. As further reported in our previous work (see, e.g., [29]), gossiping is ideal for effectively and efficiently handling the adverse effects of churn. Further investigations about effects of churn on our k-clique matching protocol with <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> is left for future research.|$|R

500|$|As the {{mountains}} of the Cascade Range were too far from Vancouver {{to serve as a}} location, the film crew settled on a nearby forest that had a <b>partial</b> <b>view</b> of {{the mountains}}. The set used for the exterior of the field base camp was later sold to the production company responsible for the TV series The Sentinel, while in the interior was shot inside a British Columbia hydro sub station. A set was built to represent the interior of the volcano, and footage filmed there was achieved {{through the use of a}} crane. Hiro Kanagawa, who portrays the character Peter Tanaka, would make two further appearances, in the fourth season episode [...] "Synchrony" [...] and tenth season episode [...] "My Struggle", as well as making appearances both in the spin-off series The Lone Gunmen and The X-Files sister show Millennium.|$|E
2500|$|The 18th Division of IX Corps {{attack on}} Bukovina Trench failed as did several later attacks and Fayolle sacked Pentel, despite the careful {{training}} {{he had given}} the corps before it entered the line. The 18th Division reported afterwards that ground observation posts had only a <b>partial</b> <b>view</b> over the trench, air observation was limited by frequent fog, rain and high winds. The French approach was up a [...] slope, full of shell-craters and mud dotted with hidden machine-gun nests, dominated by German artillery and observation aircraft. French light machine-guns jammed and the infantry struggled through knee-high mud. On 17 October an attack on Baniska Trench failed when the French barrage fell short onto the 32nd Infantry Regiment as it waited for zero hour in an advanced jumping-off trench. The German counter-bombardment caught the support waves in the French front line and the advanced troops were caught in crossfire from machine-gun nests set {{up in front of}} Baniska Trench. The troops furthest forward were forced under cover short of the trench and those on the flanks were unable to advance, which left the 32nd Infantry Regiment in a salient and bombarded by their artillery again, losing [...] in the attack. Baniska Trench was eventually captured by the 152nd Division (General Andrieu) on 1 November, after Fayolle over-ruled Andrieu and insisted on an attack, which apparently surprised the Germans, who did think that one could occur in such abysmal conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the approaches to the automatic recovery of a panoramic image from a set of <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> are suboptimal {{in the sense that}} the input images are aligned, or registered, pair by pair, e. g., consecutive frames of a video clip. These approaches lead to propagation errors that may be very severe, particularly when dealing with videos that show the same region at disjoint time intervals. Although some authors have proposed a post-processing step to reduce the registration errors in these situations, there have not been attempts to compute the optimal solution, i. e., the registrations leading to the panorama that best matches the entire set of <b>partial</b> <b>views.</b> This is our goal. In this paper, we use a generative model for the <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> of the panorama and develop an algorithm to compute in an efficient way the Maximum Likelihood estimate of all the unknowns involved: the parameters describing the alignment of all the images and the panorama itself. 1...|$|R

40|$|Gossip-based or {{epidemic}} algorithms {{rely on a}} peer-to-peer {{model for}} dissemination of multicast messages, and are simple, scalable and reliable. However, traditional gossip-based protocols suffer from two major drawbacks: (i) they rely on each peer having knowledge of the global membership and (ii) they are oblivious to the underlying network and impose a high load on core router links. In this paper we present a self-organizing hierarchical mem-bership protocol which attemps to solve these two issues. Nodes organize themselves into clusters reflecting the topol-ogy, and obtain <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> of the membership {{both within and outside}} the cluster. The size of the <b>partial</b> <b>views</b> is tuned automatically to achieve high reliability. Gossip messages are targeted mainly within clusters, thereby reducing net-work load. ...|$|R

60|$|Poets and moralists, {{judging from}} our English trees and fruits, {{have thought that}} small fruits always grew on lofty trees, so that their fall should be {{harmless}} to man, while the large ones trailed on the ground. Two {{of the largest and}} heaviest fruits known, however, the Brazil-nut fruit (Bertholletia) and Durian, grow on lofty forest trees, from which they fall as soon as they are ripe, and often wound or kill the native inhabitants. From this we may learn two things: first, not to draw general conclusions from a very <b>partial</b> <b>view</b> of nature; and secondly, that trees and fruits, no less than the varied productions of the animal kingdom, {{do not appear to be}} organized with exclusive reference to the use and convenience of man.|$|E
