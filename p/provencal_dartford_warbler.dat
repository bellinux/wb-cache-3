50|$|Coates Common and Lords Piece {{are areas}} of Sussex {{heathland}} containing breeding populations of heathland birds including Nightjar and <b>Dartford</b> <b>Warbler.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 116 {{species of}} bird have been recorded. The Common is a nationally {{important}} breeding area for European nightjar, woodlark and <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
50|$|Birds inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the avocet, grey phalarope, osprey, <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> yellow-browed warbler, serin, black-throated diver, hobby, {{peregrine}} falcon, wryneck, hoopoe and nightjar.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> - as a Mediterranean bird, it can {{be found}} in the heather and gorse as these offer {{relatively}} warm microclimates for them.|$|R
50|$|The type {{locality}} of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> is Provence in France. This species probably forms a superspecies with Tristram's warbler {{and this}} in turn seems close to Marmora's warbler and the Balearic warbler. Altogether, this group of typical warblers bears a resemblance to the wrentit, the only species of Sylviidae from the Americas. However the wrentit is less {{closely related to the}} genus Sylvia than to the parrotbills. Its visual similarity to the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> group is an example of convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The hoarse, {{a little}} bit nasal call sounds like wed-wed or woid-woid. The warning cry is long-pulled, rough tschehr which resembles that of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
50|$|These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall {{very similar}} to their close {{relatives}} in the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> group. Marmora's warblers are grey above and below, lacking the brick-red underparts of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b> Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red. The song is a fast rattle. Immature birds can be confused with young Dartford warblers, which are also grey below, but Marmora's have a paler throat. Their iris is dark.|$|R
50|$|Species seen: <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> Cetti's warbler, Montagu's harrier, great spotted woodpecker, redstart, spotted flycatcher, stonechat, linnet, tree pipit, nightjar, mute swan, chaffinch, {{reed warbler}} and Sandwich tern.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{breeding}} bird colonies can be found, {{with examples of}} the Red Data Book species <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia undata) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) being recorded on the site.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature park}} {{is home to}} various species of bird including: buzzard, great spotted woodpecker, stonechat, {{nightjar}} and the rare <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b> Other animals include roe deer, sand lizard and various species of bat.|$|R
40|$|Wildfires are {{the most}} {{extensive}} and severe disturbance affecting the shrublands where Sardinian and Dartford Warblers (Sylvia melanocephala and S. undata) abound. Estimating the long-term use of burned habitats by these species (i. e. their time-window of occurrence) is fundamental to understanding their regional distribution and to plan possible conservation measures for the near- threatened <b>Dartford</b> <b>Warbler.</b> In this study, we describe the post-fire time-window of occurrence and cover preferences of the two warblers using an abundance dataset, gathered by point counts over 22 consecutive years, and a density dataset, resulting from territory mapping of four different plots for up to 8 years. Both datasets span before and after fire. The two species colonized burned areas {{as soon as the}} second year after fire. The <b>Dartford</b> <b>Warbler</b> showed its highest abundance between 4 and 9 years after fire and disappeared after 16 years or more. The Sardinian Warbler had a peak of abundance at 9 years, but the study was not long enough to record its local extinction. Partial least squares regression showed that abundance at points and plot density of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>Warbler</b> were positively related to the plant cover between 0. 25 and 1 m, whereas vege- tation between 0. 5 and 4 m was important for the Sardinian <b>Warbler.</b> The <b>Dartford</b> <b>Warbler,</b> therefore, depends on the existence of dense and low shrublands, that are often the result of past firesPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Beaulieu {{village has}} {{remained}} largely unspoilt by progress, {{and is a}} favourite tourist stop for visitors to the New Forest, and also for birders seeking local specialities like <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> European honey buzzard and hobby.|$|R
50|$|Balearic warbler (Sylvia balearica) is {{a typical}} warbler, genus Sylvia. It is endemic to the Balearic Islands. It groups with the Marmora's warbler, Tristram's <b>warbler</b> and the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Helbig 2001, Jønsson & Fjeldså 2006).|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} a notable stronghold {{of the rare}} <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> which has {{successfully}} survived in this corner of Dorset when nearly wiped out elsewhere in southern England by prolonged periods of extreme winter cold.|$|R
50|$|Yately Common, and Kingsley Common {{include several}} {{priority}} bird {{species such as}} European nightjar, <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> woodlark and song thrush. Chilbolton Common supports important numbers of breeding common redshank, northern lapwings, common snipe and warblers.|$|R
50|$|Its {{breeding}} range lies west {{of a line}} from southern England to the heel of Italy (southern Apulia). The <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> is usually resident all year in its {{breeding range}}, {{but there is some}} limited migration.|$|R
50|$|In February 2005 a <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> {{spent six}} weeks at The Sanctuary, {{attracting}} {{large numbers of}} bird watchers. It had not been seen in Derbyshire since a pair were shot at Melbourne Common {{in the winter of}} 1840.|$|R

50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{remaining}} heathlands in Surrey. It is famed for its diverse wildlife. Whilst crossbill, red kite, woodlark and stonechat are regularly seen, birds such as <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> whinchat, wheatear, tree pipit and redstart are frequently encountered. Rarer birds include osprey, black redstart and great grey shrike.|$|R
50|$|Otters, red kites, common buzzards, peregrines and hen {{harriers}} can {{be found}} here together {{with a number of}} Welsh Mountain Ponies, and adder, badger, blackcap, <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> fallow deer, nightingale, nightjar, willow warbler, and woodcock. The site holds a population of rosy marsh moth, a very rare species in the UK.|$|R
50|$|It {{is also an}} {{important}} over wintering site for wildfowl including large numbers of Eurasian wigeon, common teal and a flock of greater white-fronted geese. In 2007, three marsh harrier chicks fledged from three nests and seven nightjars, 23 pairs of woodlark, seven pairs of <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> and three booming bitterns were recorded.|$|R
50|$|These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall {{very similar}} to their close {{relatives}} in the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> group. Balearic warblers are grey above and pale grey below, adding a pinkish tinge. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red.|$|R
50|$|Although {{primarily}} heathland habitat, {{the site}} has some wet mature oak woodland, and is home to rare species such as the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> stonechat, nightjar and the narrow headed ant. The reserve has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989. It became a Devon Wildlife Trust nature reserve in 2002 and a Local Nature Reserve in 2003.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant from two specimens that were shot in April 1773 on Bexley Heath near Dartford in Kent.
