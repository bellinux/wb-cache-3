40|$|The {{influence}} of surface quality, in particular surface topography and implant material, was evaluated by inserting titanium- and hydroxylapatite plasma-sprayed coated implants into the maxilla of 10 goats. Three types of plasma-spray coatings {{were applied to}} tapered, screw shaped implants; titanium <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> (TPS), titanium <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> with additional acid passivation (TPSA) and a bilayered coating (TPS/HA) consisting of titanium <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> (TPS) and a hydroxylapatite part (HA). In addition, as-machined implants (TiM) were used as control. A total of 40 implants were inserted according a balanced split plot design. At {{the end of a}} 3 -month healing period, it appeared that 5 implants (2 TPS, 1 TPSA, 1 TPS/HA and 1 TiM) were lost. Histological examination revealed a stronger bone response to TPS/HA coated implants. Even the TPS/HA coated implants induced bone formation {{on the part of the}} implant inserted into the sinus. No signs of delamination of the TPS coatings were visible. The HA part of the dual coating showed signs of degradation. Histomorphometrical analysis confirmed these findings. A significant difference in bone contact (P < 0. 05) was measured between the TPS/HA coated implants and the other types of implants. Linear regression (r = 0. 27) showed no correlation between the inscrew values at the base line and the bone contact measurements 3 months after healing. On the basis of these results, we can conclude that the chemical composition of the HA coating has a positive influence on the bone reaction.

The phase composition, surface and interface microstructure, coating thickness, surface roughness and bonding strength of the <b>plasma-sprayed</b> sphene <b>coating</b> were analysed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and the standard mechanical testing of the American Society for Testing and Materials, respectively.

30|$|Bioactive {{coatings}} are in {{high demand}} to increase the functions of cells for numerous medical devices. For example, to improve the performance of conventional titanium-based materials for orthopedic applications (i.e., fabricated by traditional metallurgy techniques and possibly surface-treated by mechanical methods such as grinding and polishing), hydroxyapatite has often {{been used as a}} coating [1]. By simulating the chemical composition of natural bone, hydroxyapatite coatings on titanium (Ti) greatly enhance osseointegration between the implant and juxtaposed bone [2, 3]. Commercially, hydroxyapatite is coated on Ti-based metals through a high-temperature plasma-spray deposition process, which transforms the initial nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite into micron grain size hydroxyapatite containing less crystalline calcium phosphates. <b>Plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> processes have, thus, often been criticized since they are not versatile enough to handle a wide range of chemistries and frequently alter the properties of the starting materials. Specifically, plasma-spray deposition of hydroxyapatite results in phase transformations which may lead to the formation of highly soluble calcium phosphates that delaminate during clinical use [1 – 3].|$|E

40|$|A {{paradigm}} shift {{has taken place}} in which bone implant materials has gone from being relatively inert to having immunomodulatory properties, indicating the importance of immune response when these materials interact with the host tissues. It has therefore become important to endow the implant materials with immunomodulatory properties favouring osteogenesis and osseointegration. Strontium, zinc and silicon are bioactive elements that have important roles in bone metabolism and that also elicit significant immune responses. In this study, Sr-, Zn- and Si-containing bioactive Sr 2 ZnSi 2 O 7 (SZS) ceramic coatings on Ti– 6 Al– 4 V were successfully prepared by a <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> method. The SZS coatings exhibited slow release of the bioactive ions with significantly higher bonding strength than hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. SZS-coated Ti– 6 Al– 4 V elicited significant effects on the immune cells, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis-enhancing factors, while upregulating the expression of osteogenic factors of macrophages; moreover, it could also inhibit the osteoclastic activities. The RANKL/RANK pathway, which enhances osteoclastogenesis, was inhibited by the SZS coatings, whereas the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) was significantly enhanced by the SZS coatings/macrophages conditioned medium, probably via the activation of BMP 2 pathway. SZS coatings are, therefore, a promising material for orthopaedic applications, and the strategy of manipulating the immune response by a combination of bioactive elements with controlled release has the potential to endow biomaterials with beneficial immunomodulatory properties...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the biological and mechanical response of bone to titanium plasma-sprayed implants of different roughnesses. Three types of titanium <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> were applied to beam-shaped implants: Ti 2, Ti 3, and Ti 4, with a Ra of 16. 5, 21. 4, and 37. 9 microm, respectively. An Al 2 O 3 grit-blasted implant (Ti-un) with a Ra of 4. 7 microm was used as a control. In total, 72 implants were inserted in the tibial cortical bone of nine adult female goats. These implants were evaluated histologically and mechanically 3 months after implantation. At the end of the experiment, of the 72 inserted implants, two implants (one Ti 2 and one Ti 4) were lost. Histological evaluation of the other retrieved implants revealed a uniform bone reaction for all implants. The unloaded plasma-spray coatings showed no signs of delamination at the implant-coating interface. Occasionally, particles of the Ti 4 coating broke free and were found near the implant. Histomorphometry revealed no difference in bone contact for the different implants (P > 0. 05). Furthermore, the push-out test showed no significant difference (P > 0. 05). Linear regression showed no interaction between the push-out values and the roughness values (r = 0. 5).

40|$|Ideal coating {{materials}} for implants {{should be able}} to induce excellent osseointegration, which requires several important parameters, such as good bonding strength, limited inflammatory reaction, balanced osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis, to gain well-functioning coated implants with long-term life span after implantation. Bioactive elements, like Sr, Mg and Si, have been found to play important roles in regulating the biological responses. It is of great interest to combine bioactive elements for developing bioactive coatings on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V orthopedic implants to elicit multidirectional effects on the osseointegration. In this study, Sr, Mg and Si-containing bioactive Sr 2 MgSi 2 O 7 (SMS) ceramic coatings on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were successfully prepared by <b>plasma-spray</b> <b>coating</b> method. The prepared SMS coatings have significantly higher bonding strength (~ 37 MPa) than conventional pure hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings (mostly in the range of 15 - 25 MPa). It was also found that the prepared SMS coatings switch the macrophage phenotype into M 2 extreme, inhibiting the inflammatory reaction via the inhibition of Wnt 5 A/Ca 2 + and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways of macrophages. In addition, the osteoclastic activities were also inhibited by SMS coatings. The expression of osteoclastogenesis related genes (RANKL and MCSF) in bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) with the involvement of macrophages was decreased, while OPG expression was enhanced on SMS coatings compared to HA coatings, indicating that SMS coatings also downregulated the osteoclastogenesis. However, the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs with the involvement of macrophages was comparable between SMS and HA coatings. Therefore, the prepared SMS coatings showed multidirectional effects, such as improving bonding strength, reducing inflammatory reaction and downregulating osteoclastic activities, but maintaining a comparable osteogenesis, as compared with HA coatings.
