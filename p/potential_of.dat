Asymptotic expansions for x → ± ∞ are derived for the Riesz <b>potentials</b> <b>of</b> the Airy function Ai(x) and the Scorer function Gi(x). Reduction formulas are provided that allow to compute Riesz <b>potentials</b> <b>of</b> the products of Airy functions Ai 2 (x) and Ai(x) Bi(x), where Bi(x) is the Airy function of the second type, via the Riesz <b>potentials</b> <b>of</b> Ai(x) and Gi(x). Integral representations are given for the function A 2 (a, b;x) = Ai (x − a) Ai (x − b) with a, b ∈ R, and its Hilbert transform. Combined with the above asymptotic expansions {{they can be used}} for obtaining asymptotics of the Hankel transform <b>of</b> Riesz <b>potentials</b> <b>of</b> A 2 (a, b;x). The study of the above Riesz fractional derivatives can be used for establishing new properties of Korteweg-de Vries-type equations...|$|R

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
