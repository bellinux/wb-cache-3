5000|$|The {{administrative}} {{weight of}} these <b>proclamations</b> is upheld {{because they are}} often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them [...] "delegated unilateral powers." [...] Presidential <b>proclamations</b> are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception of <b>proclamations</b> as largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. However, the legal weight of presidential <b>proclamations</b> suggests their importance to presidential governance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proclamations</b> {{were made}} by Presidents Reagan and George H.W.

Barack Obama has not made any <b>Proclamations</b> or Official Messages commemorating Polish American Heritage Month. He has made <b>Proclamations</b> for General Pulaski Memorial Day on October 11 each year of his presidency.|$|R

5|$|Once a <b>proclamation</b> {{had been}} issued {{ordering}} the Army Reserve {{to be called}} out for permanent service, the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to embody {{all or part of}} the Territorial Force. If no such order was forthcoming, however, then unless Parliament directed otherwise the Army Council was to issue a direction for the embodiment of the entire Force. If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the <b>proclamation,</b> it was to resume its session within ten days. The Crown was able to issue a <b>proclamation</b> disembodying the whole Force, and until such <b>proclamation</b> was issued the Army Council was permitted to embody or disembody such elements of the Force as they saw fit.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation <b>Proclamation</b> on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the <b>proclamation</b> earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's <b>proclamation</b> played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation <b>Proclamation</b> in January. Having composed the <b>Proclamation</b> some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without {{consulting}} his superiors in Washington, a <b>proclamation</b> {{of martial law}} in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's <b>proclamation.</b> Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{participation}} {{of these two}} annual ceremonies are considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times {{they are involved in}} some of the most important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal <b>proclamation</b> of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's <b>proclamation</b> recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the <b>proclamation</b> from the council in person. The <b>proclamation</b> is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken rope (in place of the ancient bar) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where the <b>proclamation</b> would be read. Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.|$|E
