40|$|TutorialTutorial 1 : The {{power and}} {{efficiency}} {{characteristics of a}} gas turbine {{are the result of}} a complex interaction of different turbo machines and a combustion system. In this tutorial, we will address the basic characteristics of each of the components in a gas turbine (compressor, gas generator turbine, power turbine) and the impact of typical control limits and control concepts. The goal is to provide explanations for the operational characteristics of typical industrial gas turbines, emphasizing the interaction between the gas turbine components. The concept of component matching is explained. Additionally, methods are introduced that allow the use of data for trending and comparison purposes. The impact of component degradation on individual component performance, as well as overall engine performance is discussed, together with strategies to reduce the impact of degradation. In particular, the following topics will be discussed: The gas turbine as a system, Thermodynamics and aerodynamics, Component matching, Off-design behavior of gas turbines, Low fuel gas <b>pressure,</b> <b>Accessory</b> loads, Single-shaft versus two-shaft engines, Variable inlet and stator vanes, Control temperature, Transient behavior, Thermo dynamical parameters of exhaust gases. The topics presented should enhance the understanding of the principles that are reflected in performance maps for gas turbines, or, in other words, explain the operating principles of a gas turbine in industrial applications. The concepts developed will be used to derive basic principles for successful condition monitoring and performance testing of gas turbines...|$|E

40|$|The {{fluidization}} {{characteristics of}} a prototype-fluidized bed laboratory reactor were understudied in order to investigate the suitable conditions at which the dehydrogenation reaction of butane could be carried out. To achieve this, a reactor with an effective volume of 1100 ml was fabricated and coupled with temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>accessories.</b> Zeolites {{were obtained from the}} market and clay obtained from different sources and pre-treated was used as catalyst. Airflow at high velocity between 3000 - 7000 ml/hr was used as the fluidising medium to obtain the bed characteristics while butane gas was used to obtain the dehydrogenation kinetics. The temperature of the reactor system was varied between 353 K and 413 K while maintaining constant pressure of 1. 5 105 N/m 2 through a manifold gauge and a constant catalyst weight. Various methods such as pressure fluctuations, visual observations, and bed expansion were used to determine the transition velocity at which fluidization begins. It was observed that this depends on factors such as mean particle size, particle size distribution, and column diameter. The minimum fluidizing velocity obtained for zeolite was 0. 0133 m/s and 0. 0102 m/s for treated clay materials both for a particle size of 250 µm. The conversion of butane over the catalysts showed an increase in both cases with a maximum at 0. 9813 at 413 K. This decreases as the reaction progresses...|$|R

25|$|Most {{high-pressure}} breathing {{gas compressors}} {{are designed to}} accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. {{and one of the}} usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric air, so it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric <b>pressure</b> in an <b>accessory</b> to the compressor called a mixing tube or blending stick. The mixing tube may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used.|$|R

40|$|Breathlessness {{and limited}} {{exercise}} tolerance {{are the principal}} symptoms of COPD. Bronchodilator therapy is directed towards the relief of these disabling symptoms but little is known of the mechanism of relief of dyspnoea or which tests best predict symptomatic benefit from bronchodilator. This thesis examines the appropriateness {{of a range of}} radiological and physiological tests in assessing disease severity and the symptomatic benefit derived from bronchodilators and examines the physiological mechanisms which result in reduced dyspnoea following their use. The estimation of lung volume radiographically was disappointing and was only comparable with other methods for group data. Agreement within individual patients was poor. My data suggests that radiological measures of lung volume are unsuitable for individual patient studies but it may still be useful in retrospective epidemiological studies where other lung volume data is not available. Inhaled oxitropium bromide and nebulised salbutamol both improved 6 minute walking distance, the improvement in exercise capacity being independent of improvements in FEVl or FVC. Resting breathlessness was significantly improved by both oxitropium and salbutamol, whilst end of walk breathlessness was improved following oxitropium. Both these measures of improvement were independent of spirometric improvement. However increases in peak inspiratory flow rate after oxitropium bromide correlated significantly with improvements in end of walk breathlessness. Improvements in breathlessness and walking distance were not explained by reductions in lung volume measured either by helium dilution or body plethysmography. Trapped gas volume proved to be an unreliable measurement and had no value in the prediction of functional benefit from bronchodilator. Large falls in resting airways resistance occured in these COPD patients following oxitropium bromide. The falls in airways resistance occurred independently of improvements in spirometry but were not quantitively related to improvements in either breathlessness or 6 minute walking distance. Mouth occlusion pressure was not a correlate of resting breathlessness neither did changes in PO. l correlate with reductions in breathlessness. The presence of severe airflow obstruction and PEEPi make the measurement of mouth occlusion pressure suspect in these patients. Oxitropium bromide caused a small fall in resting oxygen saturation, salbutamol had no effect on resting saturation. Corridor walking exercise produced brisk falls in oxygen saturation, but the severity of desaturation was unaffected by the bronchodilator. Recovery from desaturation {{at the end of the}} walk was rapid. Histamine challenge increased breathlessness but alterations in levels of breathlessness were not correlated with the increases in end expiratory lung volume provoked by the challenge. Oxitropium bromide reduced positive end expiratory <b>pressure</b> (PEEPi), respiratory <b>accessory</b> muscle activity and reduced pleural pressure swings during hypoxia and hypercapnia stimulated breathing. Thus the efficiency of ventilation was improved by their inhaled bronchodilator. There was no difference in the rate of change of breathlessness with increasing ventilation between isocapnic hypoxaemic and progressive hypercapnic stimulated breathing. In conclusion an anticholinergic bronchodilator can improve exercise capacity and breathlessness, independent of changes in conventional lung function tests or alterations in oxygen saturation. Alterations in these measurements which relate to dynamic changes occuring during respiration such as PEEPi, accessory muscle activity and pleural pressure swings may be more useful in assessing the response to bronchodilator drugs...|$|R
