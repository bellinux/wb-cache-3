40|$|<b>Poly(adenylic</b> <b>acids)</b> {{containing}} the antibiotic tubercidin (7 -deazaadenosine) form double strands with poly(uridylic acid) by Watson-Crick base pairing. The stability of these complexes {{is enhanced by}} an increasing adenosine content of the polymers. Whereas poly(tubercidylic acid) can bind only one poly(U) chain, the copolymers of adenylic and tubercidylic acid bind a second strand of poly(U). The melting temperatures imply a triple strand formation in a similar geometry as found for poly(A). 2 poly(U). The diminished hypochromicity of those complexes suggests semi-Hoogsteen base pairs, caused {{by the lack of}} N- 7 in the antibiotic. As found for poly(A). poly(U), the double-stranded poly(Tu). poly(U) is not hydrolyzed by nuclease S 1. In contrast to the four regular homopolyribonucleotides the single-stranded poly(Tu) is cleaved very rapidly. This may be due to a great flexibility of the polynucleotide chain. Moreover TuMP does not inhibit the enzymic digestion. Both phenomena imply a mechanism for the antibiotic action of tubercidin on the polymer level...|$|R

The disease-associated form of the prion protein (PrPSc), resulting from a conformational change of the normal (cellular) form of prion protein (PrPC), is considered central to neuropathogenesis and serves as the only reliable molecular marker for prion disease diagnosis. While the highest levels of PrPSc are present in the CNS, the development of a reasonable diagnostic assay requires the use of body fluids which characteristically contains extremely low levels of PrPSc. PrPSc has been detected in the blood of sick animals by means of PMCA technology. However, repeated cycling over several days, which is necessary for PMCA of blood material, has been reported to result in decreased specificity (false positives). To generate an assay for PrPSc in blood that is both highly sensitive and specific, the researchers used limited serial PMCA (sPMCA) with SOFIA. They did not find any enhancement of sPMCA with the addition of <b>polyadenylic</b> <b>acid,</b> nor was it necessary to match the genotypes of the PrPC and PrPSc sources for efficient amplification.|$|E

Based on experiments involving sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, pancreatic ribonuclease A resistance, ultraviolet mixing curves, and ultraviolet absorbance-temperature profiles, the explanation for this phenomenon was determined to be the formation of polynucleotide triplexes in the following way: poly(A) -poly(U) + poly(I) yields poly(A) -poly(U) -poly(I) poly(A) -poly(rT) + poly(I) yields poly(A) -poly(rT) -poly(I).

For this purpose, we designed and developed the single molecule ribosome motility assay. In this thesis, we discuss the related steps which we have taken to develop this assay: the instrumentation and four experiments. In the introduction, we illustrate the current experimental scheme and show the preliminary data of the single molecule ribosome translation. In the first two chapters, we discuss two interesting experiments dealing with stochastic problems. In the first chapter, we introduce {{the idea that the}} noise can be reduced in certain conditions. We show that the noise can be really reduced but only if added fluctuations have to drive the input into states with reduced intrinsic noise. In the second chapter, we investigate two-state processes experimentally using a simple physical system in which a microscopic bead is trapped in a double-well potential. We discuss how we can control the characteristics of the escape process by adding a periodic force and illustrate the characteristics in terms of the residence time distribution and the escape phase. As last two chapters, we discuss the elastic and structural properties of homopolymeric RNA, <b>polyadenylic</b> <b>acids</b> (poly(A)), polycytidylic acids (poly(C)), and polyuridylic acids (poly(U)). First, we investigate the elastic property of poly(U) as a random coil. We find that the force-extension data is well predicted by a classic worm-like chain model at high Na⁺ concentrations, whereas at low such concentrations the introduction of a scale-dependent persistence length is required. As single-stranded helices, poly(A) and poly(C) are studied. We stretch the molecules to induce the conformational transition from folded states to unfolded states and use the elastically coupled two-state model to acquire their structural information (about 9 bases per turn and 8 bases per turn, for poly(A) and poly(C) respectively, at neutral pH and 500 mM [Na⁺]) and the free energy differences between two states (20 pN·nm for poly(A) and 17. 5 pN·nm for poly(C)) ...|$|R

By means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antibodies to LPS were detected in antibodies to fraction II. Antibodies to fraction II could protect mice against a lethal challenge with P. aeruginosa. Absorption experiments demonstrated that the protective ability of antibodies to fraction II was due to antibodies to cell envelope antigens, whereas antibodies to ribosomal antigens did not contribute to the protection. Antibodies to LPS could be detected in mice 1 week after a single vaccination with fraction II.

Using freshly prepared scutellar tissues, it was demonstrated that α-amylase is synthesized de novo in the scutellar epithelium and secreted into endosperm. The synthesis of α-amylase directed by the <b>polyadenylic</b> acid-containing ribonucleic <b>acid</b> isolated from the scutellar tissues was also established using the translation system of either wheat germ extract or reticulocyte lysate. The immunoprecipitable product obtained in the in vitro translation system was smaller in molecular weight than that synthesized in vivo {{on the basis of}} mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results are discussed in relation to the processing of the nascent polypeptide precursor of the enzyme molecule and the introduction of the oligosaccharide chain to the cleaved polypeptide to make up the mature form of α-amylase...|$|R
