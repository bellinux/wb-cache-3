5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} Australia's finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was {{lean and}} {{relatively}} tall for a wicket-keeper, standing 180cm. Tallon's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style, rather than raw statistics. In 21 Tests, Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings, making 58 dismissals {{at an average of}} 1.41 per innings. Modern Australian glovemen such as Rod Marsh and Ian Healy, both of whom held the Test world record for dismissals, averaged closer to two. Tallon's Test batting average of 17.13 <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> that of contemporary wicket-keepers such as Australia's Adam Gilchrist and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, both of whom have made a double century and more than ten centuries. English wicket-keepers from two decades after World War II such as Godfrey Evans and Jim Parks scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon.|$|E

Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.|$|E

25|$|While UMass' {{rivalry with}} Penn State <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> {{the one with}} URI, it has {{nevertheless}} been a consistent presence throughout Minutemen program history as PSU, like UMass and URI, was {{a founding member of}} the ECWHL and has been in the league for all but two of its 14 seasons. The teams have met four times at the ECWHL playoffs (a scheduled fifth was nixed by a 2010 snowstorm), with UMass enjoying a 3–1–0 advantage in those games. None were better than the contest that took place on February 28, 2004 at Rhode Island's Brad Boss Arena. The wild affair saw Aleta Mills and Samantha Louras each score four times - yet it wasn't quite enough, as the Lady Icers' Katie King scored four of her own on the way to an 8–8 tie after regulation, where neither team ever led by more than two and with only three stretches of more than 5:00 without a goal being scored. In the second overtime, Mills' fifth tally sent the Minutemen to the first-ever league championship game.|$|E

The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.|$|E

500|$|Aurora was Disney's last princess created before Walt Disney's {{death in}} 1966. When Sleeping Beauty was first {{released}} in 1959, the film performed poorly {{at the box}} office while failing to impress critics. According to TheRichest, Aurora was partially responsible for Disney’s only overall loss that decade, thus the studio decided to avoid adapting fairy tales into feature-length animated films for several years; Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted in 1989, 30 years later. Mic's Melissa Hugel believes that the negative reception spawned by Aurora's passive role as a woman in Sleeping Beauty also contributed to this hiatus, earning the character {{a reputation as one of}} Disney's worst princesses. Meanwhile, David Nusair of About.com attributes the film's failure with [...] "the familiarity of its storyline, as the film boasts many of the elements contained within both of its predecessors – including the revelation that Princess Aurora can only be awoken from her deep slumber by a kiss from her one true love" [...] similar to Snow White. Hollywood.com ranked Sleeping Beauty Disney's worst princess film because its main character remains asleep for the majority of it. However, Aurora has since established herself as a popular character nonetheless due to her singing voice and beauty. At one point, the name [...] "Aurora" [...] became a popular baby name, with parents often naming their daughters after the character. However, despite being featured prominently in Disney merchandise, [...] "Aurora has become an oft-forgotten princess", and her popularity <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> those of Cinderella and Snow White. While creating the Disney Princess franchise, Disney Consumer Products decided that Aurora should be marketed wearing the pink version of her dress in order to further distinguish her from Cinderella, who also wears blue.
