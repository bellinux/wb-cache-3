25|$|Three {{days after}} Berdella had begun holding Sheldon captive, on April15, a workman came to perform some {{scheduled}} {{work on the}} roof of his home, leading Berdella to choose to fatally suffocate Sheldon by placing a sack over his head, which he then tightened with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> He later dissected Sheldon's body in the third floor bathroom.|$|E
25|$|By {{forming the}} two {{railways}} upon the original level line, {{in the manner}} above described, the bank-head of the empty waggons is several yards from the bank-head where the loaded waggons start: this distance is got the better of, {{by means of an}} additional <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> or chain, that is hooked off and on, as occasion requires. The breadth of each set of tracks on this line is 4 feet 3 inches; the weight of each of the waggons, when loaded, is between 2 and 3 tons. From 100 to 200 tons of coal pass down this line daily.|$|E

5000|$|The right hand, {{is placed}} palm up, {{underneath}} both <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and a middle point <b>of</b> the tail <b>piece</b> is pinch/gripped between the index and middle fingers, {{as if one}} were cutting the rope with scissors.|$|R
25|$|Jesus {{carrying}} the cross. Looking {{closely at the}} six soldiers, the one {{near the bottom of}} the cross where it is dragging on the ground holds a shield and sword. Then the man with his leg straddling the cross and seeming to add to Christ' difficulty in lifting the cross, has a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in his right hand and in his left hand what appears to be a form of maraca to add to the rhythm of the music being played. The sixth soldier also appears to be pushing the cross down to add to the weight.|$|E
25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
2500|$|Control of {{the bull}} may be done by holding the ring by hand, looping a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> through it, {{clipping}} on a lead rope, or clipping on a stiff bull pole (bull staff). [...] A rope or chain from the ring may be attached to a bull's horns or to a head-collar for additional control.|$|E

60|$|He {{went ahead}} with storm preparations, {{elevating}} the bed on old boards which he lugged from a disused barn falling to decay on the opposite bank of the creek. Upon the boards he heaped dry leaves for a mattress. He concluded by reinforcing the canvas with additional guys <b>of</b> odd <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and bailing-wire.|$|R
2500|$|... "Clown Stops" [...] or [...] "interludes" [...] are {{the brief}} {{appearances}} of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically {{made up of}} a few gags or several bits. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called [...] "reprises" [...] or [...] "run-ins" [...] by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of [...] "business" [...] usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> between and the clown trying to imitate the artiste by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.|$|E
2500|$|Freestyle slacklining (a.k.a. “rodeo slacklining") {{is the art}} and {{practice}} of cultivating balance on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about [...] apart and [...] off {{the ground in the}} center. This type of very [...] "slack" [...] slackline provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A freestyle slackline has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first written about on a website called the [...] "Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research" [...] in 2004. The article [...] "Old Revolution— New Recognition - 3-10-04" [...] describes these early developments in detail.|$|E
2500|$|In week seven, on Day 45 the housemates in {{the main}} House were given a silent disco dancing task, where they had to stay on a spot dancing along to three songs on repeat whilst blindfolded, the person who lasted the longest would win a prize from the Box of Good Things, the winner was Glyn who won a small trophy. Aisleyne had to decide which housemates to evict from the [...] "House Next Door", unaware she was sending them to the main House, she evicted Jayne on Day 46, and Michael and Jennie on Day 48. On Day 49, Aisleyne was told to evict either Jonathan or Spiral. She evicted Jonathan. On Day 50 the housemates had to work {{together}} to untangle themselves from a giant knot in the garden within 3 hours, each housemate was attached by a belt to an individual <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> A television screen displayed £672, double a luxury shopping budget, this money decreased by £10 every 3 minutes they carried out the task, housemates completed and passed in 44 minutes with a total shopping budget of £532. Richard and Lea were put up for eviction. Lea was evicted on Day 51 with 53.8% of the public vote.|$|E
6000|$|I remember, too, that {{a couple}} of {{companies}} of the Thirteenth Brooklyn, who rendezvou'd at the city armory, and started thence as thirty days' men, were all provided with <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> conspicuously tied to their musket-barrels, with which to bring back each man a prisoner from the audacious South, to be led in a noose, on our men's early and triumphant return! ...|$|R

2500|$|... “It {{frequently}} {{happens that}} men {{bleed to death}} before assistance can be procured, or lose so much blood {{as not to be}} able to go through an operation. In order to prevent this, it has been proposed, and on some occasions practised, to make each man carry about him a garter, or <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> yarn, in order to bind up a limb in case of profuse bleeding. If it be objected, that this, from its solemnity may be apt to intimidate common men, officers at least should make use of some precaution, especially as many of them, and those of the highest rank, are stationed on the quarter deck, which is one of the most exposed situations, and far removed from the cockpit, where the surgeon and his assistants are placed. This was the cause of the death of my friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far. As the Admiral on these occasions allowed me the honour of being at his side, I carried in my pocket several tourniquets of a simple construction, in case that accidents to any person on the quarter deck should have required their use.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pozzo {{controls}} Lucky {{by means}} of an extremely long rope which he jerks and tugs if Lucky is the least bit slow. Lucky is the absolutely subservient slave of Pozzo and he unquestioningly does his every bidding with [...] "dog-like devotion". He struggles with a heavy suitcase without ever thinking of dropping it. Lucky speaks only once in the play and it is a result of Pozzo's order to [...] "think" [...] for Estragon and Vladimir. Pozzo and Lucky have been together for sixty years and, in that time, their relationship has deteriorated. Lucky has always been the intellectually superior but now, with age, he has become an object of contempt: his [...] "think" [...] is a caricature of intellectual thought and his [...] "dance" [...] is a sorry sight. Despite his horrid treatment at Pozzo's hand however, Lucky remains completely faithful to him. Even in the second act when Pozzo has inexplicably gone blind, and needs to be led by Lucky rather than driving him as he had done before, Lucky remains faithful and has not tried to run away; they are clearly bound together by more than a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> {{in the same way that}} Didi and Gogo are [...] "ied to Godot". Beckett's advice to the American director Alan Schneider was: [...] " [...] is a hypomaniac and the only way to play him is to play him mad." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{ten minutes}} {{they arrived at}} the spot where the wreck had been; her keel {{remained}} there, but with this exception she had entirely disappeared. They took another look among the wreckage, cut off some lengths <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and coiled them up, and also a sail, which the sailor pronounced to be a top-gallant sail. This they rolled up, fastened it by short <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> and then, the sailor taking the middle and the lads the ends on their shoulders, they carried it to what they already called their “well”.|$|R

60|$|I do {{not know}} if it be so, but from what I have {{observed}} of the German character I should not be surprised to hear that when a man in Germany is condemned to death he is given a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> and told to go and hang himself. It would save the State much trouble and expense, and I can see that German criminal taking that <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> home with him, reading up carefully the police instructions, and proceeding to carry them out in his own back kitchen.|$|E

50|$|Chimney sweeps are {{a popular}} ludic element and appear every year. Their task {{has been to}} smear people with soot (nowadays {{replaced}} by shoe polish). It is usually applied with a gloved or naked hand on the targeted person's face, or by pretending to shake hands. In recent years the chimney sweeps have also used whips made from short <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> to whip {{the legs of the}} passers-by. These characters enliven the procession and chase the children.|$|R
6000|$|... "You might wrap up {{the goods}} before you deliver 'm," [...] the {{stranger}} said gruffly, and Manuel doubled a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> stout <b>rope</b> around Buck's neck under the collar.|$|R
60|$|The sailor {{led the way}} up the shrouds. Reuben {{found it}} much more {{difficult}} than it looked. He had seen the sailors running up and down, and it looked as easy as mounting a ladder; but the slackness of the ratlines--which, as the sailor told him, was the name <b>of</b> the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> which answered to the rounds of a ladder--made it at first awkward. When they reached the main top the sailor told him to sit down, and look round quietly, till he became accustomed to the height.|$|R

60|$|Gallwey did so, {{and the man}} busied {{himself for}} a minute or two with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> It was evident that he was acquainted with the secure hitches used in lashing a load on the pack-saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what, monsieur," [...] {{one of the}} other men said; [...] "if you take my advice you will have a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in {{readiness}} and tie it round her arms so as to prevent her struggling." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{but now we}} are here, {{there can}} be no use in our doing so.
