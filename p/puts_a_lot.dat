In their review, Loudwire elaborated, [...] "A concept album with different characters <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of pressure on the}} vocalist, and James LaBrie lives up to the challenge.

[...] The band as a whole were also praised, although AllMusic observed that Mangini and bassist John Myung weren't featured as prominently as usual.|$|E

[...] Levine also noted, however: [...] "There are times when Izzie becomes completely irrational during crisis situations, which may bother some."

500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stuart Levine of Variety {{reviewed}} {{the performances of}} the three cast members nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category. [...] "The ladies of Grey's Anatomy dominate the category, and it'd be far from a stretch to say {{at least two of}} those women rose to high dramatics last season", commented Levine, while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship, seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved. He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued, though [...] "by no means less well-executed". He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock, being the most level-headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation. He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson, by describing her as being [...] "flashy and over the top", which he considers better than being consistently good. Considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Levine assessed of her performance, by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through: [...] "Showrunner Shonda Rhimes <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge." [...] However, he also noted that Izzie's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering.|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN evaluated the episode as [...] "completely depressing", {{and added that}} the dark nature made the series excel. Goldman ultimately gave the episode an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal felt that the episode was the series' best installment. Writing for The Grand Rapids Press, John Serba opined that [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] was a delightful ending to the first portion of the season. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club stated that prior to its ending, the episode was [...] "the usual mix of pretty good and deeply irritating." [...] Handlen lauded the character development in the installment; [...] "The episode <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of effort into heightening the tensions between Hershel and Rick's people, and while it’s not exactly subtle, it makes enough sense to be effective. This is conflict that should've been building for a few episodes now, instead of arriving fully formed right before it explodes, but I'm willing to take what I can get." [...] Concluding his review, he issued the episode an A– grade. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey avouched that [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] was [...] "excellent", and added that the tension [...] "slowly ratchets up to an almost unbearable level." [...] Some critics were divided with the episode. Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that while the writers {{put a lot of}} substance into the characters, many of them are still underdeveloped. Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times felt that some parts of the episode lacked cohesion and direction.|$|E
