It {{is based on}} a finite element (FE) modeling of the latter's representative volume element (RVE). In contrast to most previously published homogenization approaches that are based on averaged quantities, the presented method uses a direct evaluation of the electromechanical enthalpy. Hence, for the linear orthotropic piezoelectric composite behavior full set of elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric material parameters, 17 load cases (LC) are used where each load case leads directly to one material parameter. This gives the possibility to elaborate a very strict and easy to program processing. In conjunction with the 17 LC, the enthalpy - based homogenization is particularly suitable for laminated composite <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>modules</b> with integrated electrodes. In this case, the electric load has to be given at the electrodes rather than at the RVE FE model boundaries.

Here we report results of process optimisation for high quality thin film PZT deposition using standard magnetron sputter equipment (Oerlikon Balzers) of up to 2 m thickness at a deposition rate of 45 nm/min. A reliable industrial production process was developed leading to optimised material quality for micromechanical applications. High quality films have been prepared on standard 8 '' silicon wafers using an Oerlikon CLN 200 tool with heated substrate holder. Ti/Pt bottom electrode configuration, deposition temperatures and process control have been varied for optimisation of thin film piezoelectric coefficients. Using Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffracti on (XRD) it was determined mat best material composition and crystalline structure was achieved using a wafer chuck temperature of 600 Â°C. Optimised PZT films of various thicknesses show a high dielectric constant 1 of about 1500.

40|$|The {{application}} of piezoelectric transducers to structural body parts of machines or vehicles enables {{the combination of}} passive mechanical components with sensor and actuator functions in one single structure. According to Herold et al. [1] and Staeves [2] this approach indicates significant potential regarding smart lightweight construction. To obtain the highest yield, the piezoelectric transducers need to {{be integrated into the}} flux of forces (load path) of load bearing structures. Application in a downstream process reduces yield and process efficiency during manufacturing and operation, due to the necessity of a subsequent process step of sensor/actuator application. The die casting process offers the possibility for integration of piezoelectric transducers into metal structures. Aluminum castings are particularly favorable due to their high quality and feasibility for high unit production at low cost (Brunhuber [3], Nogowizin [4]). Such molded aluminum parts with integrated piezoelectric transducers enable functions like active vibration damping, structural health monitoring or energy harvesting resulting in significant possibilities of weight reduction, which is an increasingly important driving force of automotive and aerospace industry (Klein [5], Siebenpfeiffer [6]) due to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws. In the scope of those developments, this paper focuses on the entire process chain enabling the generation of lightweight metal structures with sensor and actuator function, starting from the manufacturing of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>modules</b> over electrical and mechanical bonding to the integration of such modules into aluminum (Al) matrices by die casting. To achieve this challenging goal, piezoceramic sensors/actuator modules, so-called LTCC/PZT modules (LPM) were developed, since ceramic based <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>modules</b> are more likely to withstand the thermal stress of about 700 Â Â°C introduced by the casting process (FlÃ¶ssel et al., [7]). The modules are made of low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) tapes with an embedded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) plate and are manufactured in multilayer technique. For joining conducting copper (Cu) wires with the electrode structure of the LPM, a novel laser drop on demand wire bonding method (LDB) is applied, which is based on the melting of a spherical CuSn 12 braze preform with a liquidus temperature Tliquid of 989. 9 Â Â°C (Deutsches Kupfer-Institut DÃ¼sseldorf, [8]) providing sufficient thermal stability for a subsequent casting process.

Thermal characteristics of several LTCC green ceramic products were investigated, systematically, to obtain crack free ceramic modules. The advantages of a module with full integrated PZT ceramic tiles are the mechanical stabilisation of the piezoceramic, the electrical insulation and the shielding of external environmental influences.
