50|$|Conte {{and colleagues}} {{similarly}} modelled mental states following quantum mechanics while {{participants were asked}} to observe ambiguous figures. Although similar to Manousakis’ model, they consider the indeterminate perception (a patient isn’t sure about the shape) which resembles the mixed state. Although it is included in the model, it is represented as a wave-function, not as a third state as Paraan et al. suggested for the Manousakis model. Therefore, they argue that this is an inaccurate representation of indeterminate perception as it would mean the two states are superimposed onto each other; in actuality it is another activation of neural correlates of consciousness that is corresponding to the indeterminate <b>position</b> <b>state</b> and should be treated as such.|$|E

50|$|An alpha beta filter {{presumes that}} {{a system is}} {{adequately}} approximated by a model having two internal states, where the first state is obtained by integrating {{the value of the}} second state over time. Measured system output values correspond to observations of the first model state, plus disturbances. This very low order approximation is adequate for many simple systems, for example, mechanical systems where position is obtained as the time integral of velocity. Based on a mechanical system analogy, the two states can be called position x and velocity v. Assuming that velocity remains approximately constant over the small time interval ΔT between measurements, the <b>position</b> <b>state</b> is projected forward to predict its value at the next sampling time using equation 1.|$|E

50|$|The Cabinet of Georgia is an {{executive}} council of government ministers in Georgia. It {{is headed by}} the Prime Minister of Georgia. In the cases of utmost importance, the meetings may be led by the President of Georgia. The first Cabinet of Georgia was formed by Noe Zhordania in the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918. However, the first head of government was Noe Ramishvili, Zhordania succeeding him. Until 24 January 2008, the cabinet consisted of four State Ministers and thirteen Ministers. After the re-election of President Mikheil Saakashvili, significant changes {{were made to the}} structure of the cabinet by the then head of the Georgian Government Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze. As a result, currently there are five State Ministers and thirteen Ministers. In Georgian politics, a Minister enjoys seniority over a State Minister as in the British Cabinet where a State Minister is below a Minister by rank. As a consequence of 2008 changes, several new positions, such as State Minister for European Integration and State Minister for Diasporas, as well as State Minister for Reintegration, were introduced. The <b>position</b> <b>State</b> Minister for Reforms was abolished. The Ministers of Defense and Internal Affairs as well as the Prosecutor General were not members of the cabinet as such and were subordinated to the President of Georgia. But they are now considered to be the members of the cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|A quantum walk in {{discrete}} time is {{specified by}} a coin and shift operator, which are applied repeatedly. The following example is instructive here. Imagine a particle {{on a line}} (one-dimensional model) with an inner spin-1/2-degree of freedom, i.e. its state can be described by a product state of a spin state [...] (eigenstates of the z component of the spin operator with eigenvalues +1/2 (spin up) and -1/2 (spin down)) and a <b>position</b> <b>state</b> [...] The product of the states is achieved with the Kronecker product which separates these two degrees of freedom. The space with the spin states will be called coin space. Now a conditional jump of the particle on the line would be described by the operator , i.e. the particle jumps right if it has spin up and jumps left if it has spin down, e.g. if we start with a state like [...] and apply the conditional jump operation, we get the state [...] If we first rotate the spin with some unitary transformation [...] in , e.g. a Hadamard transformation, and then apply , we get a random motion on the line. Take e.g. the Hadamard coin : [...] If we at this point decided to measure the spin, we would either get an up spin at position 1 or a down spin at position -1 and repeating the procedure would correspond to a classical walk like e.g. Galton's board. Instead {{the idea of the}} quantum walk is that we do not measure the state at this point (and therefore do not force a collapse of the wave function) and then repeat the procedure of rotating spin and conditionally jumping. This way, quantum correlations (i.e. the non-collapsed wave function) are preserved and different positions can interfere. This gives a drastically different probability distribution compared to the classical walk (Gaussian distribution) as seen from the figure to the right. Espacially one sees that the distribution is not symmetric: even though the Hadamard coin gives both up and down spin with equal probability, the distribution tends to drift to the right when the initial spin is an up spin. This effect is, broadly speaking, {{due to the fact that}} the Hadamard coin gives more destructive interference of the positions for paths going left than for paths going right. One can get a symmetric distribution when using some other coin or when using an input state like [...] because the Hadamard coin does not introduce complex numbers which is why the spin up and spin down components are not mixed here.|$|E
