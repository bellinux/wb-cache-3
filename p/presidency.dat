5|$|Bombay <b>Presidency</b> {{was one of}} {{the three}} Presidencies of British India; the other two being Madras <b>Presidency,</b> and Bengal <b>Presidency.</b> It was in the centre-west of the Indian subcontinent on the Arabian Sea. It was bordered to the north-west, north, and {{north-east}} by Baluchistan, the British province of Punjab, and the Princely state of Rajputana; to the east by the Princely states of Central India Agency, the Central Provinces, Berar and Hyderabad; and to the south by Madras <b>Presidency</b> and Mysore State. The <b>Presidency</b> was established in the late 17th century and named after Bombay, the capital city and the island on which it was built. By 1906, the area under the jurisdiction of Bombay <b>Presidency</b> stretched from North Canara in the south to Sindh in the north, encompassing the now-Pakistani province of Sindh, some parts of the present-day state of Gujarat, northwestern part of Karnataka state, the British territory of Aden in Yemen, and the western two-thirds of modern-day Maharashtra.|$|E

He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} the <b>presidency</b> of the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was the <b>presidency</b> of the Oxford Union, an office frequently {{used as a}} stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the <b>presidency.</b> He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the <b>presidency</b> for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} a deputy in the {{legislature}} of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, during the <b>presidency</b> of Arturo Frondizi, and a national deputy during the <b>presidency</b> of Arturo Umberto Illia. He opposed {{both sides of the}} Dirty War, and several times filed a writ of Habeas corpus, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances, during the National Reorganization Process. He denounced the crimes of the military dictatorship of other countries, and opposed the actions of both sides in the Falklands War as well.

5|$|Hinduism was the {{predominant}} {{religion in the}} <b>presidency</b> and practised by around 88% of the population. The main Hindu denominations were Saivite, Vaishnavite and Lingayat. Among the Brahmins, the Smartha doctrine was quite popular. Worship of village gods was strong in the southern districts of the <b>presidency</b> while the mathas at Kanchi, Sringeri and Ahobilam were regarded as the centres of the Hindu faith. Of the Hindu temples, {{the largest and most}} important were the Venkateswara temple at Thirupathi, the Brihadeeswarar temple at Tanjore, the Meenakshi Amman temple at Madurai, the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, the Krishna temple at Udupi and the Padmanabhaswamy temple in the princely state of Travancore. Islam was brought to the southern part of India by Arab traders although most converts were made from the 14th century onwards, when Malik Kafur conquered Madurai. Nagore was the holiest city for the Muslims of the Madras <b>Presidency.</b> The <b>presidency</b> also had one of the oldest Christian populations in India. Branches of the Syrian church, contrary to historical evidence, are popularly believed to have been instituted by St. Thomas, an apostle of Jesus Christ who visited the Malabar coast in 52AD Christians were mainly concentrated in the Tinnevely and Malabar districts of Madras <b>Presidency</b> with native Christians forming over one–quarter of the total population of the princely state of Travancore.|$|E

40|$|Using a novel {{measure of}} {{industry}} exposure to government spending, we show predictable variation in cash flows and stock returns over political cycles.
