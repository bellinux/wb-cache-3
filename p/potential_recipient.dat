25|$|The {{level of}} {{sensitization}} to donor HLA antigens {{is determined by}} performing a panel reactive antibody test on the <b>potential</b> <b>recipient.</b> In the United States, up to 17% of all deceased donor kidney transplants have no HLA mismatch. However, HLA matching is a relatively minor predictor of transplant outcomes. In fact, living non-related donors are now almost as common as living (genetically)-related donors.|$|E
25|$|In all of {{the above}} situations, {{immunity}} is directed at the transplanted organ, sustaining lesions. A cross-reaction test between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the <b>potential</b> <b>recipient</b> that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed. The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate. Global databases of donor information enhance the search for compatible donors.|$|E
25|$|Marketing for organ {{donation}} must walk {{a fine line}} between stressing the need for {{organ donation}} and not being too forceful. If the marketing agent is too forceful, then the target of the message will react defensively to the request. According to psychological reactance theory, a person will perceive their freedom threatened and will react to restore the freedom. According to Ashley Anker, the use of transportation theory has a positive effect on target reactions by marketing attempts. When public service announcements use recipient-focused messages, targets were more transported. Individuals who watched recipient-focused messages were more transported because potential donors experience empathy for the <b>potential</b> <b>recipient.</b> Future public service announcements should use recipient-focused stories to elicit relationship formation between potential donors and recipients.|$|E

40|$|In organ donation, the donor, recipient, and {{transplant}} team {{must all}} accept potential health {{risks to the}} donor and any uncertainties. To gauge these risks, we surveyed general altruism and risk-taking behaviors in 112 potential donors, 111 <b>potential</b> <b>recipients,</b> and 51 transplant professionals. Next, participants indicated their risk thresholds for long-term donor hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure that would stop them from pursuing living donation and their willingness to proceed when risks were uncertain. The three groups had similar general altruism and risk-taking behaviors. Potential donors were significantly more willing to accept greater long-term donor risks than <b>potential</b> <b>recipients</b> and transplant professionals. Moreover, these potential donors {{were significantly more likely}} to agree that living donation was acceptable when long-term donor risks were uncertain. Potential kidney donors readily accept high long-term risks, whereas <b>potential</b> <b>recipients</b> were the most averse to donor risk. Our study shows that transplant professionals facilitate the best decisions by appreciating the willingness of their patients to accept donor health risks along with their own risk tolerance...|$|R

50|$|Means testing <b>potential</b> <b>recipients</b> of cash {{transfers}} is {{the more}} politically acceptable, as money is not perceived to be wasted by including {{those who do not}} have a desperate need for the money ("leakage").

Yet there are also many problems associated with this method as the transaction costs of screening are very high, due to the need to pay for assessment, the travelling cost of candidates to and from the assessment and also the potential risks for corruption. There also may be a negative effect on social capital as resentment develops of those who receive support by those who do not.|$|R
