This article reports on a study of the design and use of <b>portable</b> <b>field</b> tent <b>shelters</b> being deployed in Antarctica and other circumpolar areas. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the effect of the shelters on health and well-being of their users from an environment-behavior perspective. Preliminary analysis indicates that although the design and use of <b>field</b> tent <b>shelters</b> were generally satisfactory, there are areas in which the shelters had some adverse bearing on health and well-being of a considerable number of shelter users. This article concludes with suggestions that can be used for future design and manufacture of <b>portable</b> <b>field</b> tent <b>shelters...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Polyface raises pastured meat chickens, egg layers, pigs, turkeys, and rabbits. The {{diversity}} in production better utilizes the grass, breaks pathogen cycles, and creates multiple income streams. The meat chickens {{are housed in}} <b>portable</b> <b>field</b> <b>shelters</b> that are moved daily to a fresh [...] "salad bar" [...] of new grass and away from yesterday's droppings. All manure is distributed by the chickens directly onto the field. His egg-laying chickens are housed in mobile trailer-style coops (called [...] "eggmobiles") that follow {{four days after the}} cattle, when flies in the manure are pupating; the chickens get 15% of their feed from this. While scratching for pupae, the chickens also distribute the cow manure across the field.|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} for in situ measurements of leaf biochemistry is very useful for applications in agriculture, forestry or ecology. A <b>portable</b> <b>field</b> radiometer, RAMIS (RAdiomètre portatif de Mesure In Situ) {{has been developed}} by the University of Paris 7 − Denis Diderot for this purpose. Unlike the SPAD- 502 (Minolta) and CCM- 200 (Opti-Sciences) devices which were only designed to determine total chlorophyll concentration, RAMIS should additionally estimate the leaf equivalent water thickness and the leaf mass per area (or specific leaf area) by measuring leaf transmittance at five wavelengths in the VIS-NIR-MIR and inversion of the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model. In order to validate it, a collaborative field campaign organized in June 2003 in the INRA of Angers (France) led us to build a database, gathering 324 leaf samples: 222 maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) leaves coming from trees grown under glass in variable environmental conditions (light intensity, nitrogen content, water supply, etc.) and 102 leaves of about forty different species collected outdoors. The chlorophyll concentration, equivalent water thickness and leaf mass area were determined for each sample by classical methods. In parallel, radiometric measurements have been performed using RAMIS, SPAD- 502, and a <b>portable</b> <b>field</b> spectrophotometer, FieldSpec-FR (Analytical Spectral Devices) ...|$|R
