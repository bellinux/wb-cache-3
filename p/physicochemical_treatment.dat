To improve the process of bone regeneration {{it is necessary to}} obtain {{a better understanding of the}} influence of the surfaces on the early stages of osseointegration. This work aims to investigate the dynamic interaction between simulated body fluid (SBF) and titanium surfaces (Ti cp) immediately after their first contact. METHODS: Ti cp samples were passed through <b>physicochemical</b> <b>treatments</b> after immersion in acid solution, alkaline solution and solutions containing TiO 2 and Ca 2 +, to obtain three different surfaces. These were characterized by electron microscopy and free energy estimates. The evaluation of the interaction with SBF was performed by measuring the dynamic contact angles after contacting the surfaces. RESULTS: The effects of SBF wettability were more significant on surfaces according to high energy estimates. A comparative analysis of the three types of surfaces showed that fluid spreading was greater in samples with greater polar components, indicating that the surface nature influences interactions in the early stages of osseointegration. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the influence of polar interactions in the dynamic wettability of the SBF. It is possible that these interactions can also influence cellular viability on surfaces.

The photocatalytic oxidation of triglyme in an aqueous suspension of TiO 2 has been studied, proving the concept to be feasible. Characterization of the light distribution in the reactor has been carried out and related to the influence of catalyst load.

A nisin-inducible sigV gene construction used in complementation assays restored the wild phenotype of the sigV mutants, confirming the involvement of SigV in the heat shock, ethanol, and acid stress responses. Northern blot analysis carried out with the three mutant strains revealed the inhibition of sigV expression by the related anti-sigma factor gene rsiV. In addition, putative candidates of the sigV regulon determined by computer search for the sigV promoter sequence were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|ECUVal {{system is}} based on the in situ {{degradation}} of organic compounds contained in saline effluents. ECUVal achieves the partial or total degradation of organic compounds by means of an electrochemical treatment combined with ultraviolet irradiation. The removal of organic matter is carried out only by means of electricity, without the addition of chemical reagents because the salts contained in the effluents are used as an electrolyte. After the electrochemical+UV treatment, the effluent still contains all the initial salts and it can be reused in a new production process. Thus, ECUVal process enables to reduce both water and salt consumption, with the subsequent economical and environmental benefits: saving of raw materials and process water, diminution of wastewater salinity and reduction of wastewater discharge taxes. ECUVal system can be applied to remove organic compounds from any type of industrial wastewater with a high content of salts. The use of ECUVal process to treat textile wastewater is especially interesting because dyeing and washing effluents contain chemical additives and residual dyes, which cannot be easily degraded. In general, treatments based on biological processes are inefficient to remove dyes due to their low biodegradability. <b>Physicochemical</b> <b>treatments</b> such as coagulation-flocculation or membrane filtration are used with this purpose but these treatments generate a waste that requires a further treatment. In this sense, the main advantages of the ECUVal system are that no residues are generated and no chemicals are should be added. In addition, the reuse process allows saving 70 - 100...|$|R
40|$|Effluents {{discharged}} from {{wastewater treatment plants}} are possible sources of pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, in the freshwater environment, and determining the possible selection of pathogens is important. This study evaluated the impact of activated sludge and <b>physicochemical</b> wastewater <b>treatment</b> processes on the prevalence of potentially virulent E. coli. A total of 719 E. coli isolates collected from four municipal plants in Qu 9 bec before and after treatment were characterized by using a customized DNA microarray to determine the impact of treatment processes on the frequency of specific pathotypes and virulence genes. The percentages of potentially pathogenic E. coli isolates in the plant influents varied between 26 and 51...|$|R
