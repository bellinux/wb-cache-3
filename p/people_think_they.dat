"The D'oh-cial Network" [...] also parodies the 2010 drama film The Social Network, which {{portrays the}} {{founding}} of Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg and the subsequent lawsuit by American rowers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea. The Social Network, like the episode, features {{a scene in which}} the Winklevoss twins are seen rowing. In July 2011, it was announced in Entertainment Weekly that American actor Armie Hammer would make a guest appearance in [...] "The D'oh-cial Network", playing the Winklevoss twins. Hammer previously attained that role in The Social Network. According to The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, the staff of the show decided not to ask the [...] Winklevoss twins to guest star in the episode as themselves because [...] "We [...] were like, 'Wait, [...] played them, that's who <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are, we should just get him.'" [...] Hammer met with the producers of the series in May 2011 to record his lines.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, or your teacher, or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} stylized dancing bears was drawn by Bob Thomas {{as part of}} the back cover for the album History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice) (1973). Thomas {{reported}} that he based the bears on a lead sort from an unknown font. The bear is a reference to Owsley [...] "Bear" [...] Stanley, who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, [...] "the bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'.

2500|$|The {{consensus}} view is {{that these}} are important, although Mamlet and VanDeVelde feel the scores [...] "don't count as much as <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> do." [...] There are many reports that admissions departments consider only the highest test results in different test subsections, sometimes called superscore results or superscoring, so if a student takes a standardized test during multiple sittings, for example, admissions officers consider the highest math and verbal scores, regardless of test date. Two sources in the Washington Post suggested that colleges routinely superscore the SAT test but rarely the ACT, possibly because of difficulty processing five separate rounded numbers.|$|E

Reidelbach, an {{unsuccessful}} independent candidate for Congress in the 15th District in 1992 who also failed to win appointment to Gray's seat, withdrew from the race despite filing nominating petitions. [...] Johnson received 15,271 votes in the primary. [...] On November 8, he faced Democratic nominee Christina L. Cox, a 38-year-old township trustee in Blendon Township. [...] Cox had also been unopposed in her primary. [...] Cox {{filed a complaint with}} the Ohio Elections Commission because Johnson ran television advertisements calling for voters to [...] "re-elect" [...] him. [...] "A key issue in this campaign is the fact that Bruce Johnson has never been elected to anything," [...] Cox told The Columbus Dispatch. [...] "He was appointed by the Downtown influence peddlers, but he's trying to make the <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> elected him." [...] Johnson won the endorsement of The Columbus Dispatch, which described him as [...] "a longtime political activist within the Republican Party" [...] with [...] "a firm grasp of legal, tax and job-development issues." [...] Johnson won the general election, 53,290 (61.78%) to 38,974 (38.22%).|$|E
