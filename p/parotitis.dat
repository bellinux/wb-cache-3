2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. [...] Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, <b>parotitis</b> and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.|$|E
60|$|Just {{think of}} it. A {{hundred years ago}} there were no bacilli, no ptomaine poisoning, no diphtheria, and no appendicitis. Rabies was but little known, and only imperfectly developed. All of these we owe to medical science. Even such things as {{psoriasis}} and <b>parotitis</b> and trypanosomiasis, which are now household names, were known only to the few, and were quite {{beyond the reach of}} the great mass of the people.|$|E

50|$|Inflammation {{of one or}} both parotid glands {{is known}} as <b>parotitis.</b> The {{most common cause of}} <b>parotitis</b> is mumps. Widespread {{vaccination}} against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps <b>parotitis.</b> The pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous capsule.|$|E
5000|$|Acute viral <b>parotitis</b> (mumps): [...] The {{most common}} viral cause of <b>parotitis</b> is mumps. Routine vaccinations have dropped the {{incidence}} of mumps to a very low level. Mumps resolves on its own in about ten days.|$|E

50|$|Apart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial, {{can cause}} <b>parotitis</b> (acute {{suppurative}} <b>parotitis</b> or chronic <b>parotitis).</b> These infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external compression. Parotid gland swellings {{can also be}} due to benign lymphoepithelial lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sjögren syndrome. Swelling of the parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating {{the look of a}} heavy jaw line. With the inflammation of mumps or obstruction of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.|$|E

5000|$|Mumps(epidemic <b>parotitis)</b> {{may result}} in {{profound}} sensorineural hearing loss (90 dB or more), unilaterally (one ear) or bilaterally (both ears).|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} {{that have already}} been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, Heerfordt syndrome can be inferred from the major symptoms of the syndrome, which include <b>parotitis,</b> fever, and facial nerve palsy. In cases of <b>parotitis,</b> ultrasound-guided biopsy is used to exclude the possibility of lymphoma. There are many possible causes of facial nerve palsy, including Lyme disease, HIV, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, schwannoma, and Bell's palsy. Heerfordt syndrome exhibits spontaneous remission. Treatments for sarcoidosis include corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.|$|E

50|$|Medial relations: The {{parotid gland}} comes {{into contact with}} the {{superior}} pharyngyeal constrictor muscle at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet. Hence, a need exists to examine the fauces in <b>parotitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Parotitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} {{of one or}} both parotid glands, the major salivary glands located {{on either side of}} the face, in humans. The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Pneumoparotitis (also termed pneumosialadenitis wind <b>parotitis,</b> {{surgical}} mumps, or anaesthesia mumps), {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} parotid gland swelling which occurs when air is forced through the parotid (Stenson) duct resulting in inflation of the duct.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{its role}} in {{supplying}} digestive enzymes, saliva has a cleansing action for the teeth and mouth. It also has an immunological role in supplying antibodies to the system, such as immunoglobulin A. This is seen to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands, importantly that of <b>parotitis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Prognosis is {{generally}} poor. If a patient survives, recovery may be prompt and complete, or protracted with sequelae, such as orchitis, hepatitis, uveitis, <b>parotitis,</b> desquamation or alopecia. Importantly, MARV {{is known to}} be able to persist in some survivors and to either reactivate and cause a secondary bout of MVD or to be transmitted via sperm, causing secondary cases of infection and disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Parotitis</b> as Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis: The {{mycobacterium}} {{that cause}} tuberculosis {{can also cause}} parotid infection. Those infected tend to have enlarged, nontender, but moderately painful glands. The diagnosis is made by typical chest radiograph findings, cultures, or histologic diagnosis after the gland has been removed. When diagnosed and treated with antitubercular medications, the gland may return to normal in 1-3 months.|$|E
5000|$|A salivary {{diverticulum}} (plural diverticuli) {{is a small}} pouch or out-pocketing of {{the duct}} system of a major salivary gland. Such diverticuli typically cause pooling of saliva and recurrent sialadenitis, especially <b>parotitis.</b> A diverticulum may also cause a sialolith to form.The condition can be diagnosed by sialography. Affected individuals may [...] "milk" [...] the salivary gland to encourage flow of saliva through the duct.|$|E
5000|$|Eye {{involvement}} {{occurs in}} about 10-90% of cases. Manifestations {{in the eye}} include uveitis, uveoparotitis, and retinal inflammation, which may result in loss of visual acuity or blindness. The most common ophthalmologic manifestation of sarcoidosis is uveitis. The combination of anterior uveitis, <b>parotitis,</b> VII cranial nerve paralysis and fever is called uveoparotid fever or Heerfordt syndrome (...) [...] Development of scleral nodule associated with sarcoidosis has been observed.|$|E
5000|$|Anaerobes can be {{isolated}} from most types of {{upper respiratory tract}} and head and neck and infection and are especially common in chronic ones. These include tonsillar, peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, chronic otitis media, sinusitis and mastoiditis, eye ocular) infections, all deep neck space infections, <b>parotitis,</b> sialadenitis, thyroiditis, odontogenic infections, and postsurgical and nonsurgical head and neck wounds and abscesses., [...] The predominant organisms are of oropharyngeal ﬂora origin and include AGNB, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.|$|E
50|$|Sjögren's syndrome: Chronic {{inflammation}} of the salivary glands may also be an autoimmune disease known as Sjögren's syndrome. The disease most commonly appears in people aged 40-60 years, but it may affect small children. In Sjögren syndrome, the prevalence of <b>parotitis</b> in women versus men is approximately 9:1. The involved parotid gland is enlarged and tender at times. The cause is unknown. The syndrome is often characterized by excessive dryness in the eyes, mouth, nose, vagina, and skin.|$|E
50|$|Pain is {{the most}} common reason for people with TMD to seek medical advice. Joint noises may require {{auscultation}} with a stethoscope to detect. Clicks of the joint may also be palpated, over the joint itself in the preauricular region, or via a finger inserted in the external acoustic meatus, which lies directly behind the TMJ.The differential diagnosis is with degenerative joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, otitis media, <b>parotitis,</b> mandibular osteomyelitis, Eagle syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, oromandibular dystonia, deafferentation pains, and psychogenic pain.|$|E
50|$|Recurrent <b>parotitis</b> of childhood:An {{uncommon}} syndrome {{in which}} recurring episodes clinically resembling mumps. Generally, episodes begin by age 5 years, {{and virtually all}} patients become asymptomatic by age 10-15 years. The duration of attacks averages 3-7 days but may last 2-3 weeks in some individuals. The spectrum varies from mild and infrequent attacks to episodes so frequent that they prevent regular school attendance.Local heat applied to the gland, massaging the gland from back to front, and taking penicillin usually cure individual episodes. Treatment of individual infections may prevent injury to the gland parenchyma. Severe disease may be treated by parotidectomy.|$|E
