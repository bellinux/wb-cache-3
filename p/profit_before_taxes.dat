40|$|Income {{smoothing}} is {{the intentional}} reduction of reported earnings fluctuations {{with respect to}} some "target" level or trend. This study investigates whether auditor quality or the presence of audit committees is associated with income smoothing by managers of Australian firms. It is motivated {{by the lack of}} evidence of an association between income smoothing and corporate governance structures. Discretionary accruals, estimated using a :- cross-sectional accruals model, are used as a proxy for earnings management, and smoothing is measured as the excess of (a) the difference between actual reported operating <b>profit</b> <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> and targeted operating <b>profit</b> <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> over (b) the difference between targeted operating <b>profit</b> <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> and pre-managed earnings. The smaller the excess, the more smoothing takes place. This study is mostly inconclusive about whether auditor quality is associated with income smoothing. In contrast, the presence of an audit committee has no association with smoothing. While they are inconclusive, the results generally do not support predictions that the more firms use audit committees and high quality auditors, in combination, the less likely they are to smooth reported income. Australian firms tend to smooth reported earnings more than their US counterparts. While the difference may be attributable to international differences in requirements for the use of an audit committee, again the results are not conclusive...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the banking}} {{sector in the}} UK {{is one of the}} most open and it is {{characterized}} by an increasing foreign bank presence, it remains relatively under-researched compared to studies for other countries. The objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of the UK banking sector focusing on the performance of the domestic banks as opposed to the performance of the foreign banks in order to test the hypothesis of higher performance of the domestic banks in a developed market. For this purpose, the UTADIS multicriteria methodology is employed to compare domestic and foreign banks’ performance over multiple criteria, such as profitability, liquidity, risk and efficiency, using a data sample covering 26 domestic and 32 foreign banks operating in the UK over the period 1998 to 2001. The results of the study, support the home advantage hypothesis, suggesting that the higher performance of domestic banks compared to foreign banks is also the case in the UK.

One important drawback of the shift from a focus on congressional intent to a focus on the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s intent and the prospect of pre-tax profit is a doctrine that is much easier for taxpayers to manipulate.

This Article therefore argues that the modern economic substance doctrine should be abandoned and replaced with a direct inquiry into congressional intent.
