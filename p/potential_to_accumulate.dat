40|$|This is {{the second}} of two papers which screen the {{environmental}} fate of sludge or sludge organic contaminants when applied to agricultural land. A simple screening model has been developed to assess the likelihood of organic contaminants accumulating into the food-chain following the application of sludge onto arable and pasture land. The purpose of this exercise is to highlight those compounds that have the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> into plants and animal tissues using data on physico-chemical properties of the compounds of interest. Over 300 organic compounds or groups of compounds which {{have been identified as}} potential pollutants in sludge have been screened for their potential to transfer from sludge-amended soils to plants via retention by root surfaces, root uptake and translocation, foliar uptake and animal intake via soil and herbage ingestion. Various organic contaminants have been identified as having a high potential to transfer into the food-chain through plant and animal accumulation. Two priority lists have been produced to include (a) those compounds which are shown as being of sufficient or suspected importance, but for which further sludge concentration data and fate studies would be necessary to check on their status, and (b) those compounds which have been highlighted in the screening processes as having a high <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> up the food-chain.

40|$|Background: Dependence {{on fossil}} resources, for the {{production}} of fuels and energy, has resulted in environmental and financial problems, which require our immediate action in order to reverse the situation. Use of renewable sources {{for the production}} of fuels and energy is an important alternative with biodiesel remains as one of the promising options. Aim of this work is to evaluate the fungus Fusarium oxysporum for its <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> microbial lipids when grown on synthetic media and saccharified sweet sorghum stalks. Results: The effect of different carbon sources, nitrogen sources and C/N ratio on the lipid production was initially examined, which resulted in a lipid concentration of 4. 4  g/L, with lipid content of 42. 6 % w/w. Sweet sorghum stalks were able to support growth and lipid production of the fungus, both as carbon source and as nitrogen source. It was also shown that saccharification of the dried stalks is an important step to increase lipid production. Removal of the remaining stalk solids enabled the lipid production during cultivation in increased initial solids of up to 16 w/w. This resulted in a lipid production of 3. 81  g/L. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that F. oxysporum can be used as an efficient oleaginous microorganism, with sweet sorghum serving as an excellent raw material for the cultivation of the fungus.

Assuming that conifers could be relevant models under cold climates, we investigated cadmium tolerance of the hybrid larch Larix × eurolepis Henry (L. decidua × L. kaempferi) and the efficiency of this species to store this metal. In vitro grown larches were chosen in order to reduce time of exposure and to more rapidly evaluate their <b>potential</b> efficiency <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> Cd. One-month-old plantlets were exposed for 2 and 4 weeks to 250 and 500 µM Cd. Results showed that they tolerated a four-week exposure to 250 µM Cd whereas the content of photosynthetic pigment strongly dropped in plantlets growing in presence of 500 µM Cd. In presence of 250 µM Cd, shoot growth slightly decreased but photosynthetic pigment and total soluble carbohydrate contents were not modified and no lipid peroxidation was detected. In addition, these plantlets accumulated proline, particularly in shoots (2 - 3 times more than control). In roots, Cd concentration in the intracellular fraction was always higher than in the cell wall fraction contrary to shoots where Cd concentration in the cell wall fraction increased with time and Cd concentration in the medium. In shoots, Cd concentration was lower than in roots with a ratio of 0. 2 after 4 weeks of exposure but stayed around 0. 2 mg g- 1 dry weight, thus a value higher than the threshold requested for Cd-hyperaccumulators.

However, challenges exist in the application of nanomaterials due to knowledge gaps in the production of ingredients such as nanopowders, stability of delivery systems in meat products and health risks caused by the same properties which also offer the benefits. For the success of nanotechnology in meat products, challenges in public acceptance, economics and the regulation of food processed with nanomaterials which may have the <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> persist, <b>accumulate</b> and lead <b>to</b> toxicity need to be addressed. So far, the most promising area for nanotechnology application seems to be in meat packaging, but the long term effects on human health and environment due to migration of the nanomaterials from the packaging needs to be studied further. The future of nanotechnology in meat products depends on the roles played by governments, regulatory agencies and manufacturers in addressing the challenges related to the application of nanomaterials in food...|$|R
