25|$|According {{to local}} tradition, John Hendrix (1865–1915), an {{eccentric}} local resident {{regarded as a}} mystic, prophesied the establishment of Oak Ridge some 40 years before construction began. Upset {{by the death of}} his young daughter and the subsequent departure of his wife and remaining family, he became religious and told his neighbors he was seeing visions. When he described his visions, <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was insane; for this reason, he was institutionalized for a time. According to several published accounts, one vision that he described repeatedly was considered to be a description of the city and production facilities built 28 years after his death, to be used in World War II.|$|E

He would later recall that <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was mad for travelling to England {{in view of the fact}} that he considered the state of English cooking at the time was horrific. [...] In 1967 they opened their first restaurant, Le Gavroche at Lower Sloane Street in London. The opening party was attended by celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin and Ava Gardner. For the following week, Chaplin was reportedly shuttled across London so he could eat there. In 1972 the Roux brothers opened a second restaurant, the Waterside Inn, in Bray, Berkshire, and launched a catering business. In 1974, when Michelin stars were first awarded in the UK, Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn were both amongst those restaurants to win a star, and when a number of restaurants won two Michelin stars for the first time in 1977, both Roux restaurants were among them. Le Gavroche would move to a new location in Mayfair in 1982, and in the same year became the first restaurant in the UK to be awarded three Michelin stars. The same rating for the Waterside Inn would follow in 1985, but Le Gavroche would go back down to two stars in 1993 has not regained the three star level. In 2010, the Waterside Inn became the first restaurant outside France to hold three Michelin stars for a period of 25 years.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} missteps, his popularity grew {{from the time}} he took office, particularly among whites. In 1994, a survey for The Times-Picayune showed that 84% of Jefferson Parish residents had a favorable impression of the sheriff, including 91% of whites. The same poll showed that, while almost nine out of 10 <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> [...] "tells it like it is", six of 10 thought he should sometimes keep his mouth shut.|$|E

[...] Previously, he noted, that many in Laredo were [...] "fearful of doing the wrong thing or of getting fired if they voted for the wrong person or if they said or did the wrong thing." [...] In this sense, [...] "wrong" [...] meant taking a position counter to that of the former power elite.|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle epitomised his {{adversarial}} {{relationship with}} Churchill in these words: [...] "When I am right, I get angry. Churchill gets angry {{when he is}} wrong. We are angry at each other much of the time." [...] On one occasion in 1941 Churchill spoke {{to him on the}} telephone. De Gaulle retorted that the French <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a reincarnation of Joan of Arc, to which Churchill replied that the English had had to burn the last one. Clementine Churchill, who admired de Gaulle, once cautioned him, [...] "General, you must not hate your friends more than you hate your enemies."

2500|$|Falco {{has been}} {{described}} by those who knew him as having a complex personality. He has been called ambitious, eccentric, caring, egotistical and deeply insecure. Thomas Rabitsch, a keyboardist who met Falco when the aspiring pop star was only 17 years old, said he was a quiet young man and precise bass player, but also arrogant and with a [...] "very high opinion of himself." [...] Markus Spiegel, the manager who discovered Falco, admitted that the pop star was, [...] "an extremely difficult artist" [...] and known womanizer. Peter Vieweger, a guitarist who knew Falco before his success and continued to play in Falco's touring band and on his albums, remembers Falco as being [...] "scared he would fail or be unmasked and not be as good as <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was." ...|$|E

[...] A bout of poliomyelitis left Farmer with his left leg shorter than his right leg. According to Farmer, he was nicknamed [...] "Polly the Parrot" [...] as a six-year-old because <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> chattered away like a parrot.

2500|$|The {{history of}} Oz prior to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (often called the {{prehistory}} of Oz {{as it takes}} place before Baum's [...] "histories") is often the subject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the title character recounts {{that he was a}} ventriloquist and a circus balloonist from Omaha, and during one flight the rope for his parachute vent became tangled, preventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find that he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them of this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city with a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses so it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds. However, in the later Oz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green materials. The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz, and grew old while he was there. Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and the East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room of his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the arrival of Dorothy in the first book.|$|E

Rory is incensed that Daniel is trying to seduce his recently estranged girlfriend, Laura. Estelle discovers that her new job disappeared during a managerial restructuring of her company and leaves a vague message on Rory's phone that leads Paul to suspect that she is a lesbian.

Fairholme saluted very solemnly, for Agatha bowed to him with marked seriousness. But when his gravity and his stiff silk hat were at their highest point she darted a mocking smile at him, and he too blushed, all the deeper because he was enraged with himself for doing so.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, {{he won the}} {{national}} championship in 1983 and 1985.

60|$|Mrs. Mackenzie {{was in a}} {{state of}} great {{happiness}} and glory during this winter. She had a carriage, and worked that vehicle most indefatigably. She knew a great deal of good company at Brussels. She had an evening for receiving. She herself went to countless evening-parties, and had the joy of being invited to a couple of court balls, at which I am bound to say her daughter and herself both looked very handsome. The Colonel brushed up his old uniform and attended these entertainments. M. Newcome fils, as I should judge, was not the worst-looking man in the room; and, as these young people waltzed together (in which accomplishment Clive was very much more skilful than Captain Goby) I dare say many <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> and Rosey made a pretty couple.|$|E
60|$|Stannard knew {{much about}} snow {{cornices}} and Deering wondered {{whether he could}} not have found some grounds for throwing off the rope and letting Jimmy venture on the dangerous overhang. He had obviously not done so; moreover he had brought his companions up the buttress. If Deering himself had meant to let somebody fall, he thought he would have tried at the awkward slab. In fact, he admitted that to picture Stannard's weighing a plan like that was theatrically extravagant. Yet he knew Stannard, who was not the man <b>people</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> was very clever and if he plotted to get rid of Jimmy, he would not do so soon after he had taken him into the mountains. He would wait until he had nearly carried out his job and was bringing his party down from the rocks. Anyhow, Deering's business was to overtake the party. To wonder whether he exaggerated Jimmy's danger would not help.|$|E
6000|$|After that, the Commission got {{itself into}} {{systematic}} working order, and for weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous stream. Individuals {{and all sorts}} of organizations levied upon themselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund, graduated according to their means, and there was not another grand universal outburst till the famous [...] "Sanitary Flour Sack" [...] came our way. Its history is peculiar and interesting. A former schoolmate of mine, by the name of Reuel Gridley, was living at the little city of Austin, in the Reese river country, at this time, and was the Democratic candidate for mayor. He and the Republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man should be publicly presented with a fifty-pound sack of flour by the successful one, and should carry it home on his shoulder. Gridley was defeated. The new mayor gave him the sack of flour, and he shouldered it and carried it a mile or two, from Lower Austin to his home in Upper Austin, attended by a band of music and the whole population. Arrived there, {{he said he did not}} need the flour, and asked what the <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had better do with it. A voice said: ...|$|E

HE, I promise, did not decline the obsequious invitation of the landlords to alight and refresh himself in the neat country towns. Having partaken of a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at Southampton, he had so far rallied at Winchester as to think a glass of sherry necessary. At Alton he stepped out of the carriage at his servant's request and imbibed some of the ale for which the place is famous. At Farnham he stopped to view the Bishop's Castle and to partake of a light dinner of stewed eels, veal cutlets, and French beans, with a bottle of claret. He was cold over Bagshot Heath, where the native chattered more and more, and Jos Sahib took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into town he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and tobacco as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton, whither the affectionate fellow drove first, and before hieing to the apartments secured for him by Mr. Dobbin at the Slaughters'.|$|E
