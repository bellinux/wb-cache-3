5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer.</b> Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E
5|$|Following Game4, {{after the}} Yankees took a 3–1 series lead, The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> accidentally printed a three-quarters-page Macy's {{advertisement}} congratulating the Phillies {{for winning the}} World Series, along {{with a picture of}} a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Along with promotions, Tierney would {{advocate}} {{on behalf}} of his clients when targeted by news reporters. Tierney would sometimes contact news editors to complain about coverage of his clients, accusing news reporters of being biased, incompetent and unprofessional. The most notable of Tierney's complaints to reporters was directed at The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> and Inquirer reporter Ralph Cipriano.|$|E
5|$|As a junior, Arcidiacono guided Neshaminy to a 22–7 record while {{averaging}} 20.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.2 steals. He {{surpassed the}} 1,000 point mark {{in a game}} against Pennsbury, scoring 29 points in a 83–52 win. The Neshaminy Redskins reached the state quarterfinals in 2011 before losing to Penn Wood. At the conclusion of his junior season, he was named the Bucks County Courier Times player of the year. The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> selected him to the first-team all-Southeastern Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent {{a letter}} to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> with {{information}} that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> is {{a morning}} daily {{newspaper}} {{that serves the}} Philadelphia metropolitan area of the United States. The newspaper was founded by John R. Walker and John Norvell in June 1829 as The Pennsylvania Inquirer and is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States. Owned by Philadelphia Media Network, The Inquirer has the eighteenth largest average weekday U.S. newspaper circulation and has won twenty Pulitzer Prizes. It is the newspaper of record in the Delaware Valley.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty {{held out}} of {{renewing}} their {{contracts with the}} team. Other {{members of the team}} had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, Flick and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year. The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> reported that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick's help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started.|$|E
5|$|Jolie's career {{prospects}} {{began to}} improve after {{she won a}} Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), {{about the life of}} the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> considered a highlight of the film. George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association {{was still}} {{struggling}} in its 16th season, {{not yet a}} major sports league and less established than college basketball. The league was hardly national, with only one team, the Los Angeles Lakers, west of St. Louis. The NBA received low television ratings, and this game was not televised. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) considered not renewing the league's television contract. No members from the New York press were present as reporters were in Florida covering spring training for the New York Yankees and the expansion New York Mets. With few in the media present, the Warriors' publicist was tasked this night with being the stringer for the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer.</b> Only two photographers were at the game.|$|E
5|$|While Cipriano {{worked on}} the piece, he and his editors, Jonathan Neumann and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Rosenthal, were {{contacted}} by Tierney. Tierney accused Ralph Cipriano of using inaccurate facts, trespassing and creating a protest at the Archdiocese's vacation home in Ventnor City, New Jersey, all of which Cipriano denies. Cipriano says that Tierney indicated to {{him that it was}} the Archdiocese that had gotten him removed from the religion reporter position, a position Cipriano says he thought he left on his own. Also according to Cipriano, Tierney indicated that if Cipriano was involved in any story about the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Tierney would start a public relations campaign to ruin Cipriano and The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer,</b> a charge that Tierney denies.|$|E
5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to run for mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former assistant district attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F. Goldhaber, a local lawyer who {{had worked in the}} state attorney general's office and in private practice. He was unopposed in the primary. The split in the Democratic leadership made the district attorney's race the liveliest of the campaign, according to <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> writer Joseph H. Miller.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for six Black Reel Awards, winning only Best Actress for Palmer. Out of five NAACP Image Awards nominations, Akeelah and the Bee won Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Writing in a Feature Film/Television Movie - Comedy or Drama. At the Black Movie Awards, it won the five awards it {{was nominated for}}. The same happened during the Young Artist Awards where it was nominated for two categories and won two awards, and at the CAMIE Awards where it was nominated for and won an award. The film was also nominated for but did not win any award from the BET Awards, Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, Chicago Film Critics, and Satellite Awards. National Board of Review elected it among the best ten independent films produced in 2006. Additionally, two film critics, Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun and Carrie Rickey of The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer,</b> added the film on their list of the ten best films of the year. St. Petersburg Timess Steve Persall elected it the best family film of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Under Moses Annenberg, The Inquirer turned around. Annenberg added new features, {{increased}} {{staff and}} held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 Inquirers weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During {{that same period}} the Records circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg's death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over. Not long after, in 1947, the Record {{went out of business}} and The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> became Philadelphia's only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the Evening Bulletin, The Inquirer continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for The Inquirer and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg's other properties, Seventeen and TV Guide. In 1957 Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Daily News and combined the Daily News facilities with The Inquirers.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC was an American {{holding company}} located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded by Brian Tierney in 2006, the company owned The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> and Philadelphia Daily News. After The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder in 2006, it {{announced}} it would sell, among other newspapers, The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Inquirer</b> and Philadelphia Daily News. Interested in buying the papers, Brian Tierney assembled a group of Philadelphia businesspeople and investors to make a bid. In May 2006 Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the papers for US$515 million plus the assumption of the newspapers' liabilities. Declining circulation and ad revenue for The Inquirer and Daily News caused financial strain, {{which resulted in the}} filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company's creditors acquired the newspapers at auction and established a new holding company, Philadelphia Media Network, in 2010.|$|E
