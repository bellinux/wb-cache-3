40|$|A {{review article}} is {{presented}} {{of the research}} results obtained by the author on the properties of amorphous silica surface. It {{has been shown that}} in any description of the surface silica the hydroxylation of the surface is of critical importance. An analysis was made of the processes of dehydration (the removal of physically adsorbed water), dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups from the silica surface), and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hydroxyl covering). For each of these processes a probable mechanism is suggested. The results of experimental and theoretical studies permitted to construct the original model (Zhuravlev model- 1 and model- 2) for describing the surface chemistry of amorphous silica. The main advantage of this physico-chemical model lies in the possibility to determine the concentration and the distribution of different types of silanol and siloxane groups and to characterize the energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface {{as a function of the}} pretreatment temperature of SiO 2 samples. The model makes it possible to determine the kind of the chemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activated or slow, strongly activated) under the restoration of the hydroxyl covering and also to assess of OH groups inside the SiO 2 skeleton. The magnitude of the silanol number, that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface area, aOH, when the surface is hydroxylated to the maximum degree, is considered to be a <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>constant.</b> This constant has a numerical value: aOH,AVER 4. 6 (least-squares method) and aOH,AVER 4. 9 OH n...|$|E

40|$|The heave of {{the central}} pillars of a railway bridge, founded on large-diameter bored piles, is a {{consequence}} of gypsum crystal growth in an anhydritic claystone stratum underlying the tip of the piles. The heave mechanism is explained by the presence of circulating water in the fractured anhydritic level. The model developed to reproduce the observed phenomena integrates a set of balance equations that includes two soluble species (gypsum and anhydrite) in addition to the inert minerals, kinetic equations for dissolution and precipitation, mechanical equilibrium, and the effect of precipitated mass on induced volumetric strains. Model calculations are compared with measured long-term field records of heave.

40|$|Mobility of the electroosmotic flow is an {{important}} quantity in capillary electrophoresis because its value {{is needed to determine}} the effective electrophoretic mobility of analytes. The effective electrophoretic mobility is used for electrophoretic determination of <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>constants,</b> such as dissociation constants or stability constants, but it is also important in analytical chemistry because identification of analytes is based on the value of the effective mobility. The most common way to measure electroosmotic flow is to add a neutral substance to the sample. However, the neutral substance can gain electrophoretic mobility due to interactions with the components of the background electrolyte. This may cause an inaccurate determination of the velocity of the electroosmotic flow. The aim of this work was to measure the mobility of several common and less frequently used markers in the background electrolyte containing different anions and to find suitable marker - anion combinations in order to avoid major measurement errors. Relative mobility of eight markers in the pure background electrolyte and in the background electrolyte containing a salt of the studied anion - sodium chloride, sodium perchlorate or sodium sulphate - was measured and related mobility of thiourea.

Pharmacology studies on P. oleracea have also showed its significant antibacterial effects on the enteropathogenic bacteria, which might reveal the treatment of P. oleracea in cases of bacillary dysentery to some extent. To date, however, the therapeutic basis of P. oleracea treating on bacillary dysentery remains unknown. We determined the antibacterial effective fraction of P. oleracea in a previous study.

40|$|Micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography is {{a widely}} used analytical separation technique. To achieve separation, it uses interaction of analytes with charged micelles present in the background electrolyte (BGE). Not only the mobilities of analytes but also mobilities of small inorganic ions, usually contained in the BGE, {{are influenced by the}} presence of micelles. Description of interactions between inorganic ions and micelles is needed for better understanding electrophoretic separations in BGEs containing micelles. Determination of <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>constants</b> (interaction constants, mobilities of complexes) by capillary electrophoresis is based on accurate determination of effective mobilities. For this reason, accurate determination of mobility of electroosmotic flow (EOF) is also necessary but complicated in BGEs containing charged micelles, because the neutral EOF marker can be mobilized by interaction with the micelles. In this work a new two-detector method for determination of effective mobility in interacting BGEs was proposed. In this method the analyte is placed in the BGE containing charged micelles, while the marker zone is in the BGE without micelles and so the possible interaction is avoided. Using this method, dependence of sodium cation mobility on concentration of lithium [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEver {{since the}} {{interest}} in organic environmental contaminants first emerged 50 years ago, {{there has been a}} need to present discussion of such chemicals and their transformation products using simple abbreviations so as to avoid the repetitive use of long chemical names. As the number of chemicals of concern has increased, the number of abbreviations has also increased dramatically, sometimes resulting in the use of different abbreviations for the same chemical. In this article, we propose abbreviations for flame retardants (FRs) substituted with bromine or chlorine atoms or including a functional group containing phosphorus, i. e. BFRs, CFRs and PFRs, respectively. Due to the large number of halogenated and organophosphorus FRs, it has become increasingly important to develop a strategy for abbreviating the chemical names of FRs. In this paper, a two step procedure is proposed for deriving practical abbreviations (PRABs) for the chemicals discussed. In the first step, structural abbreviations (STABs) are developed using specific STAB criteria based on the FR structure. However, since several of the derived STABs are complicated and long, we propose instead the use of PRABs. These are, commonly, an extract of the most essential part of the STAB, while also considering abbreviations previously used in the literature. We indicate how these can be used to develop an abbreviation that can be generally accepted by scientists and other professionals involved in FR related work. Tables with PRABs and STABs for BFRs, CFRs and PFRs are presented, including CAS (Chemical Abstract Service) numbers, notes of abbreviations that have been used previously, CA (Chemical Abstract) name, common names and trade names, as well as some fundamental <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>constants...</b>|$|R

The FAs analysis was performed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The potential relationships between FAs and micro-organisms were tested through redundancy analysis (RDA) which allowed to keep all <b>physico-chemical</b> factors <b>constant,</b> including salinity. The results showed a great diversity of FAs from 10 to 24 carbon atoms, which Could be saturated, unsaturated, linear or branched. The predominant saturated FAs were 14 : 0, 16 : 0 and 18 : 0, and might originate from diatoms, Dinophyceae and flagellates for the first ponds and from Chlorophyceae, heterotrophic bacteria (HB) in hypersaline ponds. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid, DHA: docosahexaenoic acid) were detected in small quantities. The branched fatty acids (18 : 0 12 Me or 18 : 2 12 Me) might be attributed primarily to bacteria and archea.
