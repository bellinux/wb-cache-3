25|$|Sharks inhabit all {{the coastal}} waters and estuarine {{habitats}} of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species {{from the family}} Heterodontidae: the <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>shark,</b> the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very {{little is known about}} this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.|$|E
60|$|In some few cases, indeed, {{among the}} shark and ray family, the {{mechanism}} for protection goes {{a step or}} two further than in these simple kinds. That well-known frequenter of Australian harbours, the <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>shark,</b> lays a pear-shaped egg, with a sort of spiral staircase of leathery ridges winding round it outside, Chinese pagoda wise, so that even if you bite it (I speak in the person of a predaceous fish) it eludes your teeth, and goes dodging off screw-fashion into the water beyond. There's no getting at this evasive body anywhere; when you think you have it, it wriggles away sideways, and refuses to give any hold for jaws or palate. In fact, a more slippery or guileful egg was never yet devised by nature's unconscious ingenuity. Then, again, the Antarctic chimæra (so called from its very unprepossessing personal appearance) relies rather upon pure deception than upon mechanical means for the security of its eggs. The shell or case in this instance is prolonged at the edge into a kind of broad wing on either side, so that it exactly resembles one of the large flat leaves of the Antarctic fucus in whose midst it lurks. It forms the high-water mark, I fancy, of protective resemblance amongst eggs, for not only is the margin leaf-like in shape, but it is even gracefully waved and fringed with floating hairs, as is the fashion with the expanded fronds of so many among the gigantic far-southern sea-weeds.|$|E

As many as eight pairs can be laid during this period. The eggs mature for 10-11 months before the hatchlings, known as neonates, can break out of the egg capsule. The eggs have been assessed in recent studies as having an 89.1% mortality rate, mostly from predation.|$|R

50|$|Australian {{sea lions}} have been {{described}} as opportunistic, benthic foragers.

Regurgitate and stomach samples from Australian sea lions at Seal Bay contained hard parts consisting predominantly of benthic taxa. This supports previous evidence that this species forages primarily on neritic, benthic prey, many of which are non-migratory. For the cephalopod component of the Australian sea lion diet, octopus and giant cuttlefish made up the greatest biomass of prey taxa. Although the Australian sea lion feeds off seasonally available prey such as semelparous cephalopods, it also exploits prey species that are available throughout the year, such as rock lobster and many of the fish species.|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} with sea lice infestations of other farmed fishes, attached larval stages of sea lice on ranched {{southern bluefin tuna}} (Thunnus maccoyii) are rarely detected. In this study, we monitored sea lice on ranched T. maccoyii and surveyed wild fishes adjacent to ranching sea cages over a 3 -month period in early 2009. Prevalence of the adult Caligus chiastos on tuna within a day of arrival at the ranching site was 10 %; prevalence then increased significantly and peaked almost 25 days later to 75 %; by harvest (after a further 18 – 28 days), prevalence decreased significantly to 0 %. We collected and examined a total of 502 wild fishes outside T. maccoyii sea cages, comprising 307 Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets (Thamnaconus degeni), 136 yellowtail horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae), 31 sand trevally (Pseudocaranx wrighti), 10 West Australian salmon (Arripis truttacea), 6 <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>sharks</b> (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), and a single blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus) and pilchard (Sardinops sagax); we also examined an additional 10 pilchards that were collected from the centre of Spencer Gulf and stored fresh in a T. maccoyii feed bin. Of these potential hosts, we identified adult C. chiastos only from Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets; of the many larvae also occurring on this host, molecular comparison of five specimens analysing cytochrome C oxidase I region of mitochondrial DNA and five specimens analysing partial D 1 –D 2 domains of 28 S rDNA confirmed that these were C. chiastos. In {{contrast with}} the decline in infections of C. chiastos on ranched T. maccoyii {{near the end of}} March, on Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets there was a significant increase in prevalence and abundance over the study period, with a peak prevalence of 97. 14 % and a mean abundance reaching 11. 17 lice per fish near the end of April. The percentage of chalimus larvae on Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets increased over the study period, ranging from 0 % near the start of sampling to over 93 % on the final sample date. We also recorded additional copepod infestations, including Orbitacolax williamsi on Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets, Caligus sp. on sand trevally, and Dissonus nudiventris on <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>sharks.</b> We conclude that Degen&# 039;s leatherjacket, which is a major scavenger of excess tuna feed, is likely to contribute to sea lice infestations of T. maccoyii...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{lateralization}} is an evolutionarily deep-rooted trait, ubiquitous {{among the}} vertebrates and present even in some invertebrates. Despite {{the advantages of}} cerebral lateralization in enhancing cognition and facilitating greater social cohesion, large within population laterality variation exists in many animal species. It is proposed that this variation is maintained due links with inter-individual personality trait differences. Here we explored for lateralization in <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>sharks</b> (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) using T-maze turn and rotational swimming tasks. Additionally, we explored for a link between personality traits, boldness and stress reactivity, and cerebral lateralization. Sharks demonstrated large individual and sex biased laterality variation, with females demonstrating greater lateralization than males overall. Stress reactivity, but not boldness, was found to significantly correlate with lateralization strength. Stronger lateralized individuals were more reactive to stress. Demonstrating laterality in elasmobranchs {{for the first time}} indicates ancient evolutionary roots of vertebrate lateralization approximately 240 million years old. Greater lateralization in female elasmobranchs may be related enhancing females’ ability to process multiple stimuli during mating, which could increase survivability and facilitate insemination. Despite contrasting evidence in teleost fishes, {{the results of this study}} suggest that stress reactivity, and other personality traits, may be linked to variation in lateralization. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) {{possess a}} highly {{sensitive}} electrosensory system that {{enables them to}} detect weak electric fields, such as those produced by potential prey organisms. Despite several comparative anatomical studies, the functional significance of interspecific variation in electrosensory system morphology remains poorly understood. In the present study, we directly tested the electrosensitivity of two benthic elasmobranchs that share a similar habitat and feed on similarly sized prey items (<b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>sharks,</b> Heterodontus portusjacksoni, and western shovelnose rays, Aptychotrema vincentiana), but differ significantly in their electrosensory system morphology. Aptychotrema vincentiana possesses almost five times the number of electrosensory pores of H. portusjacksoni (∼ 1190 and ∼ 239 respectively), yet both species are able to initiate feeding responses to electric-field gradients below 1 nV cm⁻¹, similar to other elasmobranch species tested. However, A. vincentiana showed a greater ability to resolve the specific location of electrosensory stimuli, because H. portusjacksoni would more often overshoot the target and have to turn around to locate it. These results suggested that differences in abundance and distribution of electrosensory pores have little to no effect on the absolute electrical sensitivity in elasmobranchs, and instead, may reflect species-specific differences in the spatial resolution and directionality of electroreception. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 25 - 29. Understanding genetic {{population}} {{structure and the}} reproductive ecology of marine species is becoming increasingly important when developing conservation plans, due to the anthropogenic threats now facing marine ecosystems and species. Population structure in <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>Sharks,</b> Heterodontus portusjacksoni, was investigated using ten polymorphic microsatellites and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (adults: n = 89; embryos: n = 75) from two locations in New South Wales (NSW) – Sydney (SYD) and Jervis Bay (JB). MtDNA diversity was moderately low and nuclear DNA diversity was intermediate for all NSW adults. Significant structure was detected between SYD and JB using mtDNA but not microsatellites. Mean AIc values were significantly higher for females compared to males in JB but not SYD. These results reveal population genetic substructure in NSW. Females and males migrate inshore during the austral winter for breeding, however only females exhibit reproductive philopatry. Therefore, it appears the males are facilitating gene flow between populations. This study did not detect fine-scale structure within JB, however further research focusing on localized structure is needed to accurately assess this. Philopatric behaviour in H. portusjacksoni means the breeding sites and mating behaviours of this species should be considered when developing conservation management strategies.

Includes bibliographical references. Despite {{hundreds}} {{of studies on}} personality in fishes, there remains a striking lack of research on personality in the elasmobranchs. Given the heritability of personality and elasmobranchs’ extensive evolutionary history, {{it is unlikely that}} personality has been evolutionarily stagnant in elasmobranchs. Personality influences every day risk-reward decisions that cause variation in individual life history fitness traits, and is shown to link to various aspects of behaviour and cognition, such as cerebral lateralization. Studying personality and lateralization in elasmobranchs is crucial to understanding species flexibility in coping with a changing environment. Using boldness and stress reactivity assays we tested for individual personality differences in <b>Port</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>sharks</b> (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Additionally, we aimed to examine the expression of cerebral lateralization using swimming directionality and examined how inter-individual variation relates to personality in sharks. Our results show individual personality differences that are consistent through time, as well as large inter-individual variation in lateralization strength and direction. Little evidence was found that personality relates to lateralization, but stress reactivity was found to correlate with strength of lateralization. These results demonstrate individual personality and lateralization differences in sharks for the first time, suggesting ancient evolutionary origins of personality and lateralization in vertebrates.
