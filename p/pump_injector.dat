30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a 900 -bed teaching hospital providing vascular surgical services as well as a regional renal medicine unit over a 12 -year period. The contrast-enhanced MRI angiography (CE-MRA) service was initially introduced in June 1998 after a CE-MRA-capable MRI system was installed—a 1.5 -T Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT MRI Scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands), including a contrast <b>pump</b> <b>injector</b> (Medrad Spectris, Medrad, Indianola, PA). Following an upgrade in 2002, the scanner was enhanced with a software and table upgrade to allow moving table peripheral angiography plus phased array coils enabling implementation of parallel imaging techniques. A second MRI scanner was added in 2009 —a 1.5 -T Siemens Magnetom Avanto (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), again with a Medrad contrast <b>pump</b> <b>injector</b> and a dedicated peripheral vascular phased array coil. Several generations of CT scanners have been employed in this time, the single detector row scanner initially installed in 1997 that was effectively unable to perform extended CTA studies being supplemented by a four-detetctor row Siemens Somatom 2 in 2002 upon which lower limb angiographic studies could be performed, although with limited slice resolution. A 64 -detector row Toshiba Aquilion CT scanner (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi-ken, Japan) equipped with a Medrad Stellant dual-head contrast <b>pump</b> <b>injector</b> was installed in 2007, replacing the original single-detector-row machine and allowing thin collimation peripheral run-off studies. A second identical 64 -slice Toshiba scanner was installed in 2009, bringing the complement of CT scanners to three: one 4 detector row and two 64 detector row.|$|E
30|$|The size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) {{was performed}} on gel-permeation chromatography/High-performance liquid chromatography (GPC/HPLC) combination; the HPLC (1260 infinity from Agilent) consisted of HPLC solvent degasser, Quaternary <b>pump,</b> <b>injector,</b> and a UV detector. The GPC detectors were an 18 -angle light scattering detector the DAWN® HELEOS® II (Wyatt Technology) and the Refractive Index detector Optilab® T-REX (Wyatt Technology). The data acquisition {{was carried out in}} 0.5  s intervals with the ASTRA 6.1 software (Wyatt Technologies Corp.). The mobile phase 0.5  % LiCl/DMAc was filtered through 0.25  µm pore filters Millex LCR (Millipore) prior to use.|$|E
30|$|The MR {{study should}} be done on high-field MR machine, either a 1.5 -T or 3.0 -T unit. Torso-phased array coils and breath-hold {{technique}} should be advocated. Parallel imaging {{should be used to}} improve SNR by decreasing acquisition time. 3.0 -T MRI offers higher SNR than 1.5 [*]T but more vulnerable to susceptibility artifacts [18 – 20]. Conventional anatomical MR imaging should include axial FSE T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 -WI) with and without fat saturation with controlled breathing, axial gradient-recalled echo (GRE) DIXON T 1 -weighted imaging (T 1 -WI). Multiplanar imaging is optional. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is obtained by a free-breathing monopolar- 3 D Diagonal planar echo-pulse sequence (EPI) using parallel imaging. Multiple b values (at least two b values: 0 and 800 [*]s/mm 2) are used to generate ADC map and extract the ADC value. DWI has several limitations, e.g., poor SNR and susceptibility to several artifacts, including blurring, ghosting, and distortions especially for left lobe focal lesions. Also, the non-uniform fat suppression is one of the limitations of DWI on 3.0 [*]T. Multiple solutions were offered to overcome these limitations, e.g., multichannel coils, strong gradients, high magnetic fields, breath-hold and ECG-gated techniques (if feasible), and advanced software [20 – 23]. Axial 3 D fat-suppressed GRE T 1 -weighted imaging before and after dynamic injection of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agents with an MR compatible <b>pump</b> <b>injector</b> was proposed. The dynamic study is performed with breath-hold in triphasic fashion: arterial phase (by bolus-tracking technique), portal venous phase (90 [*]s), and delayed (equilibrium) at 3 [*]min. Subtracted images mainly from the arterial phase dynamic study could be extrapolated to highlight subtle enhancing parts and {{to get rid of the}} signal from any hemorrhagic or fatty elements. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR (DCE-MR) could be also performed.|$|E

Modern large diameter PCP systems utilize through flow booster pumps, {{also known as}} jet <b>pump</b> <b>injectors.</b> These create the pressure differentials required to propel multiple capsules through a pipeline, while allowing both terminals at atmospheric pressure.

40|$|As NASA, the Department of Defense and the {{aerospace}} industry in general strive to develop capabilities to explore near-Earth, Cis-lunar and deep space, the need to create more cost effective techniques of propulsion system design, manufacturing and test is imperative in the current budget constrained environment. The physics of space exploration have not changed, but {{the manner in which}} systems are developed and certified needs to change if {{there is going to be}} any hope of designing and building the high performance liquid propulsion systems necessary to deliver crew and cargo to the further reaches of space. To further the objective of developing these systems, the Marshall Space Flight Center is currently in the process of formulating a Liquid Propulsion Systems testbed, which will enable rapid integration of components to be tested and assessed for performance in integrated systems. The manifestation of this testbed is a breadboard engine configuration (BBE) with facility support for consumables and/or other components as needed. The goal of the facility is to test NASA developed elements, but can be used to test articles developed by other government agencies, industry or academia. Joint government/private partnership is likely the approach that will be required to enable efficient propulsion system development. MSFC has recently tested its own additively manufactured liquid hydrogen <b>pump,</b> <b>injector,</b> and valves in a BBE hot firing. It is rapidly building toward testing the pump and a new CH 4 injector in the BBE configuration to demonstrate a 22, 000 lbf, pump-fed LO 2 /LCH 4 engine for the Mars lander or in-space transportation. The value of having this BBE testbed is that as components are developed they may be easily integrated in the testbed and tested. MSFC is striving to enhance its liquid propulsion system development capability. Rapid design, analysis, build and test will be critical to fielding the next high thrust rocket engine. With the maturity of the BBE testbed, MSFC propulsion engineering will bring forward a national capability that enables growth of both commercial and government interests...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{propose a}} {{diagnostic}} algorithm for preoperatively predicting {{the need for}} surgical intervention. METHODS: The study included 56 patients (27 men and 29 women) with a final diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions. The following materials were used: ultrasonic equipment with 3. 5 and 7 MHz linear, convex and biopsical transducers. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) investigations were performed using a 16 -slice scanner. Images were obtained following the oral administration of 200 mL water and 100 mL intravenous iopamidol (300 mg/mL) administered by <b>pump</b> <b>injector</b> {{at a rate of}} 3 mL/s (40 and 60 s post-injection, respectively) using 0. 5 mm detectors, reconstructed at 1 mm (pancreatic phase) or 2 mm (portal venous phase) increments. The table feed was 10 mm per rotation. Images were acquired in the pancreatic and portal venous phases of contrast enhancement. The &#x 201 C;Chiba&#x 201 D; needles 18, 20, 22, 23 G and an automatic aspiration system were used in conjunction with the following methods of guiding the interventional procedures: (1) &#x 201 C;free-hand&#x 201 D; biopsy and puncture method under ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) control; (2) guiding method using biopsical transducer. RESULTS: All 56 patients in this study underwent at least two cuts imaging survey methods, such as US, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common preoperative diagnostic examination was US scan - 56 patients (100 %). MDCT studies were conducted in 49 (87. 50 %) and MRI in 13 (23. 21 %). More than half of patients surveyed (37) underwent some type of interventional procedure: 25 -fine-needle aspiration and 29 -fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), as part of the examination. Thirty-four patients of all 56 patients underwent surgery because of histological evidence of malignancy after the FNAB for cystic lesions of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was the most common operative approach in 13 patients, followed by Whipple resection in 11 and distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy in 7. Three patients were treated with total pancreatectomy due to the presence of a multifocal mucinous neoplasm. Comparing the diagnostic results of US examination with those of MDCT examination and histological verification true positive results were found in 31 patients, true negative in 11 patients, false positive in 5 and false negative in 9 patients. Accordingly we estimated the power of the diagnostic imaging methods for cystic lesions of the pancreas. A specificity of 68. 75 %, sensitivity of 79. 48 %, accuracy of 75. 00 %, positive predictive value of 86. 11 % and negative predictive value of 55 % were obtained. The power increased after applying invasive procedures with immunohistochemical analysis of CEA and P- 53 (Fig. 4). In 15 patients with cytological feature of malignant tumour cells, the tumour markers were positive. In our opinion the higher the percentage of reacting cells the higher the percent of malignancy. In patients with clear symptoms and/or clear imaging features of malignant or premalignant cystic neoplasm, the need for surgery was confirmed by histological verification in 34 (60. 71 %) of cases. CONCLUSION: By using the proposed algorithm, cystic mucinous tumors of the pancreas were detected and proper operative interventions would have been rendered with fewer diagnostic examinations...|$|E

5000|$|In the Jumo, these {{problems}} were avoided {{to some degree}} by taking power primarily from the [...] "upper" [...] shaft, somewhat offset upwards on the engine's front end. All of the accessories, such as fuel <b>pumps,</b> <b>injectors</b> and the scavenging compressor, were run from the lower shaft, meaning over half of its power was already used up.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{performance}} upgrades for both of these vehicles is the MOPAR Performance Stage II Computer (Logic Module).This increased the boost to 14.7 psi under wide-open throttle, and output was raised to a claimed 205 hp and [...] of torque.Another popular mod was the [...] "super 60 kit", which was named so because at full output the fuel pump as part of this kit could pump 60 gallons per hour. It included a computer, fuel <b>pump,</b> <b>injectors,</b> turbocharger and camshaft. The fuel injectors were highly sought after by not only GLH/S and later on SRT4 owners, but for Corvette, Camaro and Mustang owners because they were far better than anything that was offered on the market and were a direct fit.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{resembles a}} typical {{spring-loaded}} check valve, {{with a small}} addition for the anti-dribble function.

50|$|Diesel fuel is also {{prone to}} waxing or gelling in cold weather; both are terms for the {{solidification}} of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. The crystals {{build up in}} the fuel line (especially in fuel filters), eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running. Low-output electric heaters in fuel tanks and around fuel lines are used to solve this problem. Also, most engines have a spill return system, by which any excess fuel from the <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> and <b>injectors</b> is returned to the fuel tank.

50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> and <b>injectors</b> adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical <b>injector</b> <b>pumps</b> generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|R
25|$|The 1970s {{brought about}} many {{developments}} in hardware and instrumentation. Researchers began using <b>pumps</b> and <b>injectors</b> {{to make a}} rudimentary design of an HPLC system.

50|$|Check valves {{are often}} used with some types of pumps.

Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed <b>pumps</b> or <b>injectors</b> which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.|$|R

50|$|LPDI was {{developed}} and released to the market in 2006. The Vialle LPDI system is designed for modern direct injection engines like the Ford EcoBoost, Volkswagen FSI, TSI and Hyundai GDI engines. The LPDI system utilizes the OEM high-pressure fuel <b>pump</b> and <b>injectors</b> to deliver either gasoline or autogas to the engine. The solution works on lean-burn, turbo boosted and standard direct injection engines. Direct Injection engines will become more prevalent in the market due to tighter emissions standards for greenhouse gases and particulates {{and the desire for}} further fuel savings.|$|R
5000|$|Careful {{design of}} the <b>injector</b> <b>pump,</b> fuel <b>injector,</b> {{combustion}} chamber, piston crown and cylinder head can reduce knocking greatly, and modern engines using electronic common rail injection have very low levels of knock. Engines using indirect injection generally have lower levels of knock than direct injection engine, due to the greater dispersal of oxygen in the combustion chamber and lower injection pressures providing a more complete mixing of fuel and air. Diesels actually do not suffer exactly the same [...] "knock" [...] as gasoline engines since the cause {{is known to be}} only the very fast rate of pressure rise, not unstable combustion. Diesel fuels are actually very prone to knock in gasoline engines but in the diesel engine there is no time for knock to occur because the fuel is only oxidized during the expansion cycle. In the gasoline engine the fuel is slowly oxidizing all the time while it is being compressed before the spark. This allows for changes to occur in the structure/makeup of the molecules before the very critical period of high temp/pressure.|$|R
