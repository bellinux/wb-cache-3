40|$|High {{resolution}} 3 D models {{produced from}} photographs acquired with consumer-grade cameras {{are becoming increasingly}} common {{in the fields of}} geosciences. However, the quality of an image-based 3 D model depends on the planning of the photogrammetric surveys. This means that the geometric configuration of the multi-view camera network and the control data have to be designed in accordance with the required accuracy, resolution and completeness. From a practical application point of view, a proper planning (of both photos and control data) of the <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>survey</b> especially for terrestrial acquisition, is not always ensured due to limited accessibility of the target object and the presence of occlusions. To solve these problems, we propose a different image acquisition strategy and we test different geo-referencing scenarios to deal with the practical issues of a terrestrial <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>survey.</b> The proposed <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>survey</b> procedure is based on the acquisition of a sequence of images in panorama mode by rotating the camera on a standard tripod. The offset of the pivot point from the projection center prevents the stitching of these images into a panorama. We demonstrate how to still take advantage of this capturing mode. The geo-referencing investigation consists of testing the use of directly observed coordinates of the camera positions, different ground control point (GCP) configurations, and GCPs with different accuracies, i. e. artificial targets vs. natural features. Images of the test field in a low-slope hill were acquired from the ground using an SLR camera. To validate the photogrammetric results a terrestrial laser scanner survey is used as benchmark...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques and their integration with the established procedures of classic stereoscopic <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>survey</b> {{have provided a}} very effective tool {{for the production of}} three-dimensional textured models. Such models are not only aesthetically pleasing but can also contain metric information, the quality of which depends on both survey type and applied processing methodologies. An open research topic in this area refers to checking attainable accuracy levels. The knowledge of such accuracy is essential, especially in the integration of models obtained through SfM with other models derived from different sensors or methods (laser scanning, classic photogrammetry [...] .). Accuracy checks may be conducted by either comparing SfM models against a reference one or measuring the deviation of control points identified on models and measured with classic topographic instrumentation and methodologies.

30|$|This paper reviews photogrammetric error {{sources and}} their impacts on {{modeling}} and surveying for construction quantity takeoff, quality control, and site safety monitoring applications. These error sources include camera internal parameters (i.e., type, principal point, principal distance, and camera lens distortion coefficients), imaging settings (i.e., shooting distances, baselines, percentage of photo overlaps, number of overlapping photos, camera intersection angles, and angles of incidence), and processing software programs. To augment {{the body of}} knowledge on photogrammetric modeling errors, this paper further conducts experiment, which concerns characterization {{of the behavior of}} different strategies in selecting reference lines for fixing absolute scale of photogrammetric models. In construction <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>surveying,</b> it is imperative to convert the relative scale of a 3 D model into absolute measurements so geometric measurements can be taken. Previous work suggests this can be done through the determination of a reference line in absolute units; however, the position and quantity of reference lines has not been investigated. This experiment attempts to tackle this issue. The result shows that one horizontal reference line {{in the middle of the}} object performed with consistent accuracy, but if a specific area on the object needs more accurate measurements, it is best to select a reference line in that area. The review and the experimental findings may help construction professionals better understand the performance of the <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>surveying</b> and apply it in their real-world projects.|$|R

30|$|<b>Photogrammetric</b> <b>surveying</b> {{has been}} widely applied in medical surgery, 3 D modeling, engineering, {{manufacturing}} and map production. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) researches have resorted to photos as the most straightforward and cost-effective means for field data collection in the construction management domain (Kamat et al. 2011). Due to the computational complexity of <b>photogrammetric</b> <b>surveying,</b> construction engineering and management researchers attempted {{to reduce the number}} of photos used by imposing geometric constraints and automating the modeling process based on pattern recognition and feature detection (Golparvar-Fard et al. 2009). (El-Omari and Moselhi 2008) integrated both photogrammetry and laser scanning to reduce time required for collecting data and modeling. (Golparvar-Fard et al. 2011) used site photos to generate the point cloud, then match and pair the images to generate the as-planned and as-built models enabled by the technique of structure from motion (SfM). (Golparvar-Fard et al. 2011) further reduced the modeling time and cost by generating the point cloud from both photos and SfM. Successful point cloud applications were demonstrated in (Golparvar-Fard et al. 2011) and (Bhatla et al. 2012). The point cloud based application is aimed to reduce the effort in 3 D as-built modeling. However, the model object must be stationary during the laser scanning process while removing the noise data (redundant or irrelevant information) requires considerable time and expertise. Thus, “point-cloud” based techniques are not suitable for modeling a particular moving object on a near real-time basis in the field.|$|R
