5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed.</b> The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the Crimson Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the Crimson Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the Crimson Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E
