2500|$|The [...] "value-added tax" [...] {{has been}} criticized as the burden of it falls on {{personal}} end-consumers of products.

Defenders argue that relating taxation levels to income is an arbitrary standard, and that the value-added tax is in fact a <b>proportional</b> <b>tax</b> in that people with higher income pay more in that they consume more. The effective progressiveness or regressiveness of a VAT system can also be affected when different classes of goods are taxed at different rates. To maintain the progressive nature of total taxes on individuals, countries implementing VAT have reduced income tax on lower income-earners as well as instituted direct transfer payments to lower-income groups, resulting in lower tax burdens on the poor.|$|E

50|$|This led to {{a complex}} {{patchwork}} of different taxes {{in different parts of}} the empire, and between different communities. In the Fertile crescent, the Ottomans inherited muqasama (sharing), a <b>proportional</b> <b>tax</b> on agricultural output, from the Mamluks; it was distinctly different from the uniform tax rates in other newly conquered territories. As farmers reacted to locally varying taxes on different farm products, this increased variations in agricultural output between areas, or even between villages; farms subject to the highest taxes switched to alternative crops.

30|$|Three {{measures}} for suppressing CO 2 emission are compared {{from the viewpoint}} of Pareto efficiency: a unilateral <b>proportional</b> carbon <b>tax,</b> a bilateral or trilateral emission trading, and a universal <b>proportional</b> carbon <b>tax.</b> Heightened consumption within a country increases its utility at the cost of scattering more voluminous CO 2 {{all over the world and}} accelerating global warming.

50|$|In a <b>proportional</b> <b>tax,</b> the {{tax rate}} is fixed and the average tax rate equals this tax rate. In case of tax brackets, {{commonly}} used for progressive taxes, the average tax rate increases as taxable income increases through tax brackets, asymptoting to the top tax rate.

Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%).

30|$|This article {{compared}} the static {{efficiency of the}} consumption/emission allocation of three alternative emission control measures (<b>proportional</b> carbon <b>tax</b> (unilateral or universal) and emission trading)f. A unilateral carbon tax, akin to a symmetric Nash equilibrium of the worldwide consumption/emission game, is less efficient than bilateral carbon emission trading. Although a universal <b>proportional</b> carbon <b>tax,</b> into which the entire negative externalities of the emissions of a country are woven, achieves the Pareto efficient allocation, realizing such an ideal tax system at this time appears very difficult. That is because the tax rate would become extremely high, {{much higher than the}} incumbent tax rate or price of emission right. As such, gradualism seems inevitable. The transition from bilateral to multilateral emission trading is desirable. Thus, a universal <b>proportional</b> carbon <b>tax</b> should be considered as the ultimate solution, and an enabling political arena is needed to gradually establish the system.|$|R
30|$|Throughout this example, we use {{a couple}} of {{simplifications}} that are common in the papers we reviewed. First, we implement all <b>tax</b> types as <b>proportional</b> <b>taxes.</b> This is reasonable for corporate income taxes and dividend <b>taxes</b> which are <b>proportional</b> in most countries. However, as for wage taxation, progressive tax schemes are prevailing in practice. Second, we do not consider the possible impact of (wage) taxation on the agent’s reservation utility U_ 0. Third, the above model is a single-period model, and thus {{does not allow for}} analyzing typical multi-period tax issues like tax loss carryforwards.|$|R
50|$|The dual {{income tax}} system levies a <b>proportional</b> <b>tax</b> rate on all net income (capital, wage and pension income less deductions) {{combined}} with progressive tax rates on gross labour and pension income. This implies that labour income is taxed {{at higher rates}} than capital income, and {{that the value of}} the tax allowances is independent of the income level. The dual income tax system deliberately moves away from the comprehensive income tax (global income tax) system which taxes all or most (cash) income less deductions (net income) according to the same rate schedule. The dual income tax was first implemented in the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through a number of tax reforms from 1987 to 1993. The dual income tax is therefore also known as the Nordic tax system or the Nordic Dual Income Tax.|$|E

Others point out that the more important question to ask is not whether GST is regressive, but whether GST is more regressive than the alternative indirect taxes, namely, sales, excise and turnover tax (not income tax because that is a direct tax). In addition, they argue that what affects poverty and fairness is not the impact of any particular tax, but the impact of the tax structure as a whole, and how tax revenues are redistributed. When GST is combined with progressive taxes, and the revenues distributed to the poor, the total fiscal structure can be progressive.|$|E

The model incorporates intragenerational heterogeneity and detailed specification of alternative tax systems. It predicts significant long-run increases in output from the wholesale replacement of the progressive federal income-tax with a low-rate <b>proportional</b> consumption <b>tax.</b> In the long run, middle- and upper-income groups gain from this policy. But their gains {{come at the expense}} of the current and future poor, who suffer from the removal of the current tax structure's progressivity, and the wealthiest members of initial, older generations, who are hurt by the policy's implicit capital levy. The flat tax adds a standard deduction to the consumption tax. This feature improves outcomes for the current and future poor. But it does so at an additional cost; long-run output increases less than half as much as under the <b>proportional</b> consumption <b>tax,</b> and middle-income groups experience a welfare loss, even in the long run. Moreover, the flat tax continues to leave some of the initial elderly worse off. Although one can insulate these individuals through transition relief, doing so further reduces the long-run gains from tax reform.
