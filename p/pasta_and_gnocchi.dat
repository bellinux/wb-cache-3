500|$|Unlike its two predecessors, Mediterranean Food and French Country Cooking, David's Italian Food (1954) drew {{little from}} {{anything}} {{she had already}} written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the manuscript. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her prose, and interspersed the recipes with her own essays and introductions to the various sections.

In a description of the 2009 edition, the publisher wrote: Even in the 1963 edition Elizabeth David felt the need to explain that a courgette was [...] "a tiny marrow" [...] and lamented the difficulty of finding basil and pine nuts. Yet she refused to participate in what she called the [...] "censorship" [...] of assuming English cooks were too timid or stupid to try anything different; she included recipes for wood pigeon <b>and</b> squid-ink <b>pasta</b> alongside aromatic marinades, wholesome soups and delicious breads. … Britishsupermarket aisles were not always filled with packets of fresh herbs, dried porcini and regional olive oils. Elizabeth David was among those responsible for the change, because she inspired a generation with her own curiosity and appreciation for the mouth-watering variety of authentic Italian food.|$|R
