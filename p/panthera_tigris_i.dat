40|$|Chemical {{communication}} {{plays an}} integral part of conserving tigers. Tigers, elephants, lions, and many other mammals use marking fluid (MF) and other excrements as means {{to communicate with each other}} and their ecosystem. This research focuses on understanding which compounds eluted in tiger (MF) contribute to the overall odor of MF. Specifically, which compounds are responsible for behavioral responses. This study collected MF samples from four, sixteen year old <b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> tigris from South Khayerbari Tiger Rescue Center in West Bengal, India. In this work, MF has been studied to gain a perspective on how tigers utilize MF for territorial and reproductive communication. Specifically, this study expanded upon previous research methodologies that characterized the odor of MF, of <b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> tigris, based on thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was utilized for the separation and identification of lipid compounds. Alkali was added to the TLC paper for the identification of compounds, specifically 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline (2 -AP). This research study compared the concepts of TLC against solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and multidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry-olfactometry (mdGC-MS-O) for detection of odorous volatile organic compounds. TLC analysis of the samples was performed at the University of Calcutta and mdGC-MS-O work was performed at Iowa State University. The mdGC-MS-O technique uncovered 19 odorous compounds including 2 -AP, suggesting that 2 -AP is not the only contributing odor to the smell of <b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> tigris M...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> sudanensis is a claimed {{subspecies}} of tiger, not scientifically recognised, allegedly {{living in}} Africa. It {{was described in}} 1951 by Paul E. P. Deraniyagala, based on a fur he saw in a Cairo bazaar. When he asked the seller for information, Deraniyagala was told the animal {{was shot in the}} Sudan. As Mazák wrote in 1980, it was either a joke or the seller felt obliged to be polite and answer any question, whether with truth or an invention. Deraniyagala took a picture of the specimen's fur, which, when published, made the scientists say, according to the pattern of stripes, it was most likely a fur of the Caspian tiger (<b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> virgata) and the fur must have been smuggled from Iran or Turkey. At that time, the Caspian tiger was nearly extinct. If a photo were enough for a scientific description, <b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris</b> sudanensis would now be one of the Caspian tiger's synonyms; as Mazák wrote, [...] "the situation is half-humorous, half-ironic." [...] Tigers are not known to have ever inhabited Africa.|$|R
