The present study was performed to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant like activities of the K. parviflora rhizome extract. Aged male Wistar rats were orally administered the alcoholic extract of this plant at various doses ranging from 100, 200 and 300 mg kg¯ 1 BW once daily for 7 days. The anxiolytic and antidepressant activities were performed after both single and repetitive treatment for 7 days using elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests respectively. The {{results showed that the}} extract decreased immobility time with the increase swimming time. However, no changes in number of open arm entries and time spent in open arm were observed.

40|$|Depression is a {{widespread}} psychiatric disorder affecting about 5 % of the population. Emblica officinalis contains tannic acid as its main ingredient and this compound {{has been shown to}} have non-selective mono-amine oxidase activity. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to evaluate the anti depressant activity of emblica officinalis using an actophotometer. Three groups(i. e control, test & standard) of albino mice weighing 25 - 30 g were used in the study. The hydroalcoholic extract of emblica officinalis was suspended in 1 % gum acacia and a dose of 250 mg/kg was used as test. Phenobarbitone sodium (20 mg/kg), a very prominent depressant drug was used to induce depression. Using the actophotometer the mobility readings were taken for the mice for 10 minutes and was used as control. After accurate calculation of the dose of standard and test drug sample for each mice, the test drug was administered orally and the standard drug was administered i. p [...] After 30 minutes of drug administration, the mobility readings were again taken using the same actophotometer, and was compared with the control and standard.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{assessing}} stimulated phosphoinositide turnover by {{measurement of the}} liponucleotide CDP-diacylglycerol is presented. The phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway consists of a sequence of reactions in which the second messengers Inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate and diacylglycerol are recycled back to phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), which then serves to replenish the initial hydrolyzed substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bis-phosphate. Receptor-stimulated inositol lipid turnover is most commonly assessed by measurement of the accumulation of [3 H]inositol-labeled inositol phosphates {{in the presence of}} Li+. The latter blocks Inositol monophosphatase and thus can lead to a depletion of intracellular inositol. Because inositol is required for resynthesis of PtdIns, the immediate precursor of PtdIns, CDP-diacylglycerol, also accumulates in the presence of agonist and Li+. Measurement of radiolabeling of this liponucleotide following Incorporation of [3 H]cytidine thus forms the basis for an alternative assay for Inositol lipid turnover. The general applicability of this method may be limited, since, In brain slices, not all receptors exhibit CDP-diacylglycerol responses that are consistent with their inositol phosphate responses. In addition, in cultured neural cells, growth in inositol-free, chemically defined medium is required to maximize the Li+ -dependent CDP-diacylglycerol response. A major advantage of this method may be its ability to provide insight Into the regulation of phosphoinositide turnover since this method uniquely reflects slowing of the regenerative cycle. Such in vitro studies may have relevance to the in vivo action of Li+ as a <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the results of}} establishing a station at which patients can report {{the side effects of}} drugs. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: Since 1 April 2003, patients may submit reports of possible adverse drug reactions directly to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. The reports submitted during the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 were analysed and compared with the reports submitted by doctors and pharmacists. RESULTS: In the first year, 276 reports were submitted by patients and 3131 by doctors and pharmacists. The reports from patients usually contained sufficient medical information and more frequently referred to serious adverse reactions than reports by health professionals. The reports from patients relatively often concerned <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agents,</b> notably antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Based on the positive results during the first year, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb has decided to continue the reporting station for patients.

40|$|Background: Depression is a {{major public}} health problem. It causes {{clinically}} significant distress, impairment of social, occupational or other important areas of function. Objective: To evaluate the prescribing pattern of antidepressant agents in patients attending psychiatry OPD at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Method: A prospective study was carried out at psychiatry outpatient department (OPD) at VS General Hospital for 6 months. Patients who were prescribed any of the antidepressant medications irrespective of clinical indication either as monotherapy or {{in combination with other}} <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> were included in the study.

40|$|Objective: The {{most widely}} {{utilized}} pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the psychostimulant methylphenidate (MPH). Most MPH formulations consist of the racemic mixture of d-threo-(R, R) -MPH and l-threo-(S, S) -MPH isomers. MPH {{is characterized by}} its low bioavailability and short half-life (2 ? 3 hours). Additionally, significant inter-individual variability in MPH pharmacokinetics has been consistently documented. Accordingly, efforts have been directed at developing alternatives to MPH as therapeutic agents. A wide range of MPH analogues (dl-α-[2 -piperidyl]-phenylacetic acid esters) have been synthesized with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) as principle neuropharmacological targets. The present study investigated the metabolic profiles and pharmacological activity of the isopropyl ester derivative of MPH, dl-isopropylphenidate (IPH), both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The synthesis, monoaminergic transporter binding, cellular uptake profiles, and assessment of metabolic hydrolysis and transesterification {{in the presence of}} ethanol are described using MPH as a comparator. Additionally, an in vivo assessment of IPH stimulant effects (vs. saline) in rats was performed with locomotor activity as a pharmacodynamic outcome. Results: IPH displayed unique pharmacological characteristics including greater DAT than NET binding and cellular uptake activity, and greater resistance to hydrolysis and transesterification via carboxylesterase 1 relative to MPH. Further, sustained psychostimulant properties offer the prospect of an enhanced duration of action. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with IPH exhibiting attributes distinguishing it from MPH and warranting further study and development of IPH as a novel <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the effect of selected crude extracts namely, Methanol (ME I), Chloroform Extract (CE II) and Ethyl Acetate (EAE II) extracts of Pilea microphylla on depression in mice. In the present study, the antidepressant effect of P. microphylla was examined due to its rich flavonoid contents in the Urticaceae family using two behavioral models, the Forced Swimming Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST) in mice. Selected crude extracts from Pilea microphylla produced an antidepressant-like effect, since the acute treatment of mice with extracts by intraperitoneal (i. p.) route significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST (50 and 100 mg kg - 1) and TST (50 and 100 mg kg - 1), as compared to positive controls (haloperidol and fluoxetine) at 1 and 10 mg kg - 1, respectively. The results showed that ME I, CE II and EAE II at dose of 100 mg kg - 1 of body weight decreased immobility time with the increase swimming time {{with respect to the}} first day (p - 1 to as much as 75. 97 % for 100 mg kg - 1. Similar results of increased antidepressant effect, that was, of immobility time depending on the concentration administered, were obtained with the TST method. However, EAE II and CE II extract at dose of 100 mg kg - 1 were obtained as best to choose an antideprssant activity. However, amounts of phenolic and flavonoid groups were found in CE II extract. As a conclusion treatment using selected crude extracts of P. microphylla had an antidepressant-like effect across models. Reduced immobility and decreasing freezing were observed in FST and TST tests. Therefore, P. microphylla may be served as a potential resource for natural <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> against depression. The present study clearly demonstrated that Pilea microphylla exerts an antidepressant effect in these two behavioural models. It may be due to present of flavonoids. This is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced uptake of flavonoids groups might have antidepressant-like effects. However, further studies are still required...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of meditation as a <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> on three selected indices of human potential: (1) self-concept, (2) aggression, and (3) psychophysiological response. ^ Specifically, meditation was operationally defined as the Relaxation Response. Self-concept was operationally defined by the subject 2 ̆ 7 s self-description as measured by the Piers-Harris Children 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Concept Scale (CSSC). Two aspects of aggression were operationalized. First, violent aggression was defined by the subject 2 ̆ 7 s observed and recorded violent aggressive incidents as measured by the Violent Aggressive Incident Report (VAIR). Second, direction of aggression was defined by the subject 2 ̆ 7 s self-description as measured by the Impunitiveness Scale of the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Form of the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study (P-F Study). Two aspects of psychophysiological response were also defined. Vasodilation-vasoconstriction was operationalized as the subject 2 ̆ 7 s mean distal palmar phalanx Fahrenheit temperature as measured by the Autogen 2000 b Feedback Thermometer. Electrodermal activity was operationally defined as the subject 2 ̆ 7 s mean distal palmar phalanx skin conductance level as measured by the Autogen 3400 Feedback Dermograph. ^ A Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design in which subjects (elementary school-aged operationally defined antisocial aggressors) were randomly assigned to treatment (meditation, N = 10) and control (behavior charting, N = 11) conditions was employed. All hypotheses were tested by means of the analysis of covariance F test. This test was applied to determine which differences in adjusted posttest group means were statistically significant. The. 05 level of confidence was accepted as significant in all analyses. ^ The results of this study supported two of the five hypotheses employed to investigate the effect of meditation on the development of human potential. Meditators scored significantly higher than non-meditators on adjusted posttest self-concept (CSCS). Meditators scored significantly lower than non-meditators on adjusted posttest violent aggression (VAIR). The data indicated meditators were not significantly higher on adjusted posttest verbal Impunitiveness (P-F Study) than non-meditators. Meditators did not score significantly higher than non-meditators on adjusted posttest vasodilation-vasoconstriction (skin temperature). The data also failed to support that meditators scored significantly lower on adjusted posttest electrodermal activity (skin conductance). The investigator indicated the data warranted the consideration of meditation as an educational methodology for enhancing human potential. ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} a combined photophysical, photochemical and photobiological study of three drugs (<b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agents)</b> of the phenothiazine series: perphenazine, fluphenazine hydrochloride and thioridazine hydrochloride. The excited-state properties were first investigated by stationary and time-resolved fluorimetry and by laser flash photolysis. The spectral description was assisted by quantum-mechanical calculations with the INDO/ 1 -Cl method. In organic media the lowest excited singlet state {{was found to}} decay by fluorescence (small quantum yield) and mainly by intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state, {{which is responsible for}} oxygen photosensitization (high yields of singlet oxygen production) and photodegradation. A further decay pathway in aqueous solutions was the photoionization process, which {{led to the formation of}} the phenothiazine radical cations and the solvated electron. After the preliminary study of the photobehavior in organic solvents and in water, the phototoxicity of the three drugs was investigated on various biological substrates through a series of in vitro assays under UVA irradiation. Photohemolysis of mouse erythrocytes and phototoxicity on cultured murine fibroblasts were observed for all three compounds. Lipid photoperoxidation was then investigated using linoleic acid as the unsaturated lipid model and isolated red blood cell membranes. The drug-induced photodamage was also evaluated on proteins by measuring the photosensitizing cross-linking in erythrocyte ghosts. The combined approach proved to be useful in understanding the mechanism by which these phenothiazine derivatives induce skin photosensitization. In particular, the photophysical properties of the compounds under investigation and the results of the study on their phototoxicity are in agreement with a mechanism that involves the radical cation of the drugs as a main intermediate...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} psychotherapeutic drugs has enabled {{management}} {{of mental illness}} and other neurological problems such as epilepsy in the general population, without requiring hospitalization. The success of these drugs in controlling symptoms has led to their widespread use in the vulnerable population of pregnant women as well, where the potential embryotoxicity of the drugs has to be weighed against the potential problems of the maternal neurological state. This review focuses on the developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of five broad categories of widely available psychotherapeutic drugs: the neuroleptics, the antiepileptics, the antidepressants, the anxiolytics and mood stabilizers, and a newly emerging class of nonprescription drugs, the herbal remedies. A brief review of nervous system development during gestation and following parturition in mammals is provided, {{with a description of}} the development of neurochemical pathways that may be involved in the action of the <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>agents.</b> A thorough discussion of animal research and human clinical studies is used to determine the risk {{associated with the use of}} each drug category. The potential risks to the fetus, as demonstrated in well described neurotoxicity studies in animals, are contrasted with the often negative findings in the still limited human studies. The potential risk for the human fetus in the continued use of these chemicals without more adequate research is also addressed. The direction of future research using psychotherapeutic drugs should more closely parallel the methodology developed in the animal laboratories, especially since these models have already been used extremely successfully in specific instances in the investigation of neurotoxic agents...|$|R
