At high population densities, animals run into double trouble: they might concurrently suffer from overexploitation {{of resources and}} also from negative interference among individuals regardless of resource availability, referred to as crowding. Animals are able to adapt to resource shortages by exhibiting a repertoire of life history and <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticities.</b> In addition to resource-related plasticity, crowding might lead to reduced fitness, with consequences for individual life history. We explored how different mechanisms behind resource-related plasticity and crowding-related fitness act independently or together, using the water flea Daphnia magna as a case study. For testing hypotheses related to mechanisms of plasticity and crowding stress across different biological levels, we used an individual-based population model {{that is based on}} dynamic energy budget theory. Each of the hypotheses, represented by a sub-model, is based on specific assumptions on how the uptake and allocation of energy are altered under conditions of resource shortage or crowding. For cross-level testing of different hypotheses, we explored how well the sub-models fit individual level data and also how well they predict population dynamics under different conditions of resource availability. Only operating resource-related and crowding-related hypotheses together enabled accurate model predictions of D. magna population dynamics and size structure.

40|$|Understanding how {{climate change}} affects natural populations {{remains one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges for ecology and management of natural resources. Animals can remodel their physiology to compensate for the effects of temperature variation, and this <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity,</b> or acclimation, can confer resilience to climate change(1, 2). The current lack of a comprehensive analysis of the capacity for <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> across taxonomic groups and geographic regions, however, constrains predictions of the impacts of climate change. Here, we assembled the largest database to date to establish the current state of knowledge of <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> in ectothermic animals. We show that acclimation decreases the sensitivity to temperature and climate change of freshwater and marine animals, but less so in terrestrial animals. Animals from more stable environments have greater capacity for acclimation, and there is a significant trend showing that the capacity for thermal acclimation increases with decreasing latitude. Despite the capacity for acclimation, climate change over the past 20 years has already resulted in increased physiological rates of up to 20 %, and we predict further future increases under climate change. The generality of these predictions is limited, however, because much of the world is drastically undersampled in the literature, and these undersampled regions are the areas of greatest need for future research efforts...|$|E

Herein, we evaluated {{the relative importance of}} morphological and <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> of young sugarcane plants grown under water deficit, testing the hypothesis that high phenotypic plasticity is associated with drought tolerance. IACSP 95 - 5000 is a high yielding genotype and IACSP 94 - 2094 has good performance under water limiting environments. Plants were grown in rhizotrons for 35 days under three water availabilities: high (soil water matric potential [Ψm] higher than - 20 kPa); intermediate (Ψm reached - 65 and - 90 kPa at the end of experimental period) and low (Ψm reached values lower than - 150 kPa). Our data revealed that morphological and physiological responses of sugarcane to drought are dependent on genotype and intensity of water deficit. In general, IACSP 95 - 5000 showed higher <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> given by leaf gas exchange and photochemical traits, whereas IACSP 94 - 2094 showed higher morphological plasticity determined by changes in leaf area (LA) and specific LA. As IACSP 94 - 2094 accumulated less biomass than IACSP 95 - 5000 under varying {{water availability}}, it is suggested that high morphological plasticity does not always represent an effective advantage to maintain plant growth under water deficit. In addition, our results revealed that sugarcane varieties face water deficit using distinct strategies based on physiological or morphological changes.

While {{changes in the}} underwater light field {{and the ability to}} associate with different photosynthetic symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium explain some of the variation, the limits to <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> are unknown for most corals. In the central Red Sea, colonies of the branching coral Pocillopora verrucosa are most abundant in shallow high light environments and become less abundant in water depths below 10 m. To further understand what determines this narrow distribution, we conducted a cross-depths transplant experiment looking at <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> and acclimation in regard to depth. Colonies from 5, 10, and 20 m were collected, transplanted to all depths, and re-investigated after 30 and 210 d. All coral colonies transplanted downward from shallow to deep water displayed an increase in photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments, which resulted in higher photosynthetic efficiency. Shallow-water specimens transplanted to deeper water showed a significant decrease in total protein content after 30 and 210 d under low light conditions compared to specimens transplanted to shallow and medium depths. Stable isotope data suggest that heterotrophic input of carbon was not increased under low light, and consequently, decreasing protein levels were symptomatic of decreasing photosynthetic rates that could not be compensated for through higher light-harvesting efficiency. Our results provide insights into the <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> of P. verrucosa in changing light regimes and explain the observed depth distribution pattern. Despite its high abundance in shallow reef waters, P. verrucosa possesses limited heterotrophic acclimation potential, i. e., the ability to support its mainly photoautotrophic diet through heterotrophic feeding.

40|$|Background and Aims: Fluctuations in [CO 2] {{have been}} widely studied as a {{potential}} driver of plant evolution; however, {{the role of a}} fluctuating [O 2]:[CO 2] ratio is often overlooked. The present study aimed to investigate the inherent <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> of early diverging, extant species following acclimation to an atmosphere similar to that across the Triassic–Jurassic mass extinction interval (TJB, approx. 200 Mya), a time of major ecological change. Methods: Mature plants from two angiosperm (Drimys winteri and Chloranthus oldhamii), two monilophyte (Osmunda claytoniana and Cyathea australis) and one gymnosperm (Ginkgo biloba) species were grown for 2 months in replicated walk-in Conviron BDW 40 chambers running at TJB treatment conditions of 16 % [O 2]– 1900 ppm [CO 2] and ambient conditions of 21 % [O 2]– 400 ppm [CO 2], and their <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> was assessed using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence methods. Key Results: TJB acclimation caused significant reductions in the maximum rate of carboxylation (VCmax) and the maximum electron flow supporting ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate regeneration (Jmax) in all species, yet this downregulation had little effect on their light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat). Ginkgo was found to photorespire heavily under ambient conditions, while growth in low [O 2]:[CO 2] resulted in increased heat dissipation per reaction centre (DIo/RC), severe photodamage, as revealed by the species' decreased maximum efficiency of primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and decreased in situ photosynthetic electron flow (Jsitu). Conclusions: It is argued that the observed photodamage reflects the inability of Ginkgo to divert excess photosynthetic electron flow to sinks other than the downregulated C 3 and the diminished C 2 cycles under low [O 2]:[CO 2]. This finding, coupled with the remarkable <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> of the ferns, provides insights into the underlying mechanism of Ginkgoales' near extinction and ferns' proliferation as atmospheric [CO 2] increased to maximum levels across the TJB...|$|E

In such context, plants that maximize physiological performance under favorable conditions, such as Cistus spp., are generally reported {{to have a great}} cost in terms of plasticity (i. e., a high short-term <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity)</b> due to the severe reduction of physiological performance when stress factors occur. However, Cistus spp. also show a noticeable resilience ability in response to stress factors. We hypothesized that in Cistus species the short-term physiological response to stress and that to subsequent recovery can show a positive trade-off to offset the costs of the photosynthetic decline under drought. Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water relations were measured in C. salvifolius, C. monspeliensis, and C. creticus subsp. eriocephalus during an imposed experimental drought and subsequent recovery. Plants were grown outdoor in common garden conditions from seeds of different provenances. The short-term physiological response to stress and that to recovery were quantified via phenotypic plasticity index (PIstress and PIrecovery, respectively). A linear regression analysis was used to identify the hypothesized trade-off PIstress-PIrecovery. Accordingly, we found a positive trade-off between PIstress and PIrecovery, which was consistent across species and provenances. This result contributes in explaining the profit, more than the cost, of a higher <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> in response to short-term stress imposition for Cistus spp because the costs of a higher PIstress are payed back by an as much higher PIrecovery. The absence of leaf shedding during short-term drought supports this view. The trade-off well described the relative variations of gas exchange and water relation parameters. Moreover, the results were in accordance with the ecology of this species and provide the first evidence of a consistent trade-off between the short-term physiological responses to drought and recovery phases in Mediterranean species...|$|E

Rapid light curve-derived parameters, light harvesting pigments, photoprotective pigments and nutrient and carbohydrate concentrations exhibited few differences among depth strata, but showed some (albeit limited) adjustment between the seasons. It was inferred that some <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> is possible in P. sinuosa but that differences in the depthrelated gradient of long-term light availability were not sufficient to induce physiological differences, even at the depth limit. Shoot density reductions, which reduce the effects of self-shading, possibly offset depth-related light reductions.

Using different stages of coralline algae, we tested the hypothesis that populations living in environments with higher environmental variability and exposed to higher levels of pCO 2 would be less affected by high pCO 2 than populations from a more stable environment experiencing lower levels of pCO 2. Our results show that spores are less sensitive to elevated pCO 2 than adults.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that the ovarian cycle is {{accompanied}} by a fall in the axosomatic synapses on randomly selected neurons of the arcuate nucleus by the morning of estrus, with a return to the preovulatory levels by the morning of metestrus, indicating a possible role in positive feedback. However, it remains to be proven that the circulating estradiol is the actual regulator of this <b>physiological</b> synaptic <b>plasticity,</b> or that estrogen- induced synaptic retraction precedes in the surge of gonadotropins at midcycle. To resolve these questions, we used an estradiol- immunoneutralization protocol and studied arcuate nucleus axosomatic synapses during the critical points of the estrous cycle. In addition to blocking positive feedback, estrogen immunoneutralization abolished synaptic retraction in the arcuate nucleus. As a positive control, the nonbinding estrogen diethylstilbestrol maintained the gonadotropin surge and synaptic retraction in the anti-estradiol-treated animals. Furthermore, in the diluent-treated cycling control females, the synaptic retraction was found to precede the preovulatory LH surge. We demonstrated that the midcycle synaptic retraction of arcuate nucleus synapses is induced by the preovulatory estradiol surge, and that these morphological events precede the preovulatory gonadotropin surge. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the hypothalamic mechanism underlying the physiological disinhibition of gonadotropins at midcycle (positive feedback) requires estrogen-induced synaptic retraction in the arcuate nucleus.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the {{alterations in}} motor response that complicate levodopa therapy of Parkinson's disease remains obscure. Several experimental and clinical observations {{strongly suggest that}} changes in striatal activity may be crucial for this physiopathological condition. Accordingly, it has been postulated that dyskinesia {{might be due to}} abnormal activity of the corticostriatal pathway. Here, we review the physiological and pharmacological mechanisms underlying glutamatergic regulation of striatal neurons by the corticostriatal projection. In particular, we discuss the role of both (RS) -alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the control of the short- and long-term efficacy of corticostriatal transmission. Indeed, repetitive cortical activation can generate either long-term depression or long-term potentiation (LTP) at corticostriatal synapses depending on the subtype of glutamate receptor activated during the induction phase of these forms of synaptic plasticity. Dopamine plays an important function in the regulation of both forms of synaptic plasticity. Dopamine denervation abolishes the <b>physiological</b> corticostriatal <b>plasticity</b> by producing biochemical and morphological changes within the striatum. We have recently observed a 'pathological' form of LTP at the corticostriatal synapse during energy deprivation. We speculate that this 'pathological' LTP, depending on the activation of NMDA glutamate receptors located on spiny striatal neurons, might {{play a role in the}} generation of levodopa-induced dyskinesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{of the central}} nervous system has a specific structure and protein composition that are different from those in other organs.

Over the last two decades, {{a growing body of research}} evidence has been collected, suggesting an important role of ECM proteolysis in synaptic plasticity of the brain. So far the majority of data concern two large families of proteases: the serine proteases and the matrix metalloproteinases. The members of these families are localized at the synapses, and are secreted into the extracellular space in an activity-dependent manner. The proteases remodel the local environment as well as influencing synapse structure and function. The structural modifications induced by proteases include shape and size changes, as well as synapse elimination, and synaptogenesis. The functional changes include modifications of receptor function in the postsynaptic part of the synapse, as well as the potentiation or depression of neurotransmitter secretion by the presynaptic site.

Fish were exposed to a daily hypoxia challenge of 6 h below 62 % saturation, down to a minimum of 10 ± 5 % saturation, followed by a return to normoxia. Respiratory and haematological variables were assessed after 8 and 16 days of daily hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia tolerance (measured as the critical oxygen tension; [O 2]crit) was not different between populations and not different from control fish after 8 days ([O 2]crit = 20. 7 ± 2. 8 % saturation), but improved similarly in both populations after 16 days ([O 2]crit = 16. 5 ± 3. 1 % saturation). This improvement corresponded with increases in haematocrit and haemoglobin, but not {{an increase in the}} mean cell haemoglobin concentration. Given the similarity of the response between these two geographically distinct populations, we conclude that hypoxia tolerance for barramundi may be more dependent on <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> than inherent variability between populations...|$|E

The lower epidermis of kudzu showed a higher frequency of stomata (147 – 19 stomata mm- 2) than the upper epidermis (26 – 17 stomata mm- 2). The average number of trichomes per square milimeter was 8 for both the upper and the lower epidermis.

Permanent labeling of SVZ precursor cells with a lentiviral vector for green fluorescent protein did not reveal any migration from the SVZ into CA 1 in the intact murine brain. However, in a nestin-GFP reporter mouse we found proliferating cells within the corpus callosum/alveus region expressing nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to precursor cells in the neighboring neurogenic region of the adult dentate gyrus. Within 3 weeks of BrdU administration, BrdU-positive nestin-GFP-expressing protoplasmic astrocytes emerged in CA 1. Similar to precursor cells isolated from the dentate gyrus and the SVZ, nestin-GFP-expressing cells from corpus callosum/alveus were self-renewing and multipotent in vitro, whereas cells isolated from CA 1 were not. Nestin-GFP-expressing cells in CA 1 differentiated into postmitotic astrocytes characterized by S 100 beta expression. No new neurons were found in CA 1.

NogoA is mainly expressed by oligodendrocytes, but also by subpopulations of neurons, in particular in plastic regions of the CNS, e. g., in the hippocampus where it is found at synaptic sites. We analyzed synaptic transmission as well as long-term synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) {{in the presence of}} function blocking anti-NogoA or anti-Nogo receptor (NgR) antibodies and in NogoA KO mice. Whereas baseline synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity and long-term depression were not affected by either approach, long-term potentiation was significantly increased following NogoA or NgR 1 neutralization. Synaptic potentiation thus seems to be restricted by NogoA. Surprisingly, synaptic weakening was not affected by interfering with NogoA signaling. Mechanistically of interest is the observation that by blockade of the GABA(A) receptors normal synaptic strengthening reoccurred in the absence of NogoA signaling. The present results show a unique role of NogoA expressed in the adult hippocampus in restricting <b>physiological</b> synaptic <b>plasticity</b> on a very fast time scale.

40|$|The {{refinement}} and plasticity of neuronal connections require synaptic {{activity and}} neurotrophin signalling; their specific contributions and interplay are, however, poorly understood. We show here that {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) increased spine density in apical dendrites of CA 1 pyramidal neurones in organotypic slice cultures prepared from postnatal rat hippocampal slices. This effect was observed also {{in the absence of}} action potentials, and even when miniature synaptic transmission was inhibited with botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C). There were, however, marked differences in the morphology of individual spines induced by BDNF across these different levels of spontaneous ongoing synaptic activity. During both normal synaptic transmission, and when action potentials were blocked with TTX, BDNF increased the proportion of stubby, type-I spines. However, when SNARE-dependent vesicular release was inhibited with BoNT/C, BDNF increased the proportion of thin, type-III spines. Our results indicate that BDNF increases spine density irrespective of the levels of synaptic transmission. In addition, miniature synaptic transmission provides sufficient activity for the functional translation of BDNF-triggered spinogenesis into clearly defined morphological spine types, favouring those spines potentially responsible for coordinated Ca 2 + transients thought to mediate synaptic plasticity. We propose that BDNF/TrkB signalling represents a mechanism of expression of both morphological and <b>physiological</b> homeostatic <b>plasticity</b> in the hippocampus, leading to a more efficient synaptic information transfer across widespread levels of synaptic activity...|$|R

Sugar maple did not display significant <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity,</b> but showed variation with tree size in both crown morphology and whole-tree biomass allocation. When sugar maple was small, {{a greater proportion of}} whole-tree biomass was allocated to roots. However, physiological differences between the species decreased with decreasing light and most morphological and allocational differences tended to disappear with increasing tree size, suggesting that many species differences in shade-tolerance are expressed mainly during the seedling stage. Understory trees of both species survived for 4 years under shade nets, possibly because of higher plasticity when small and the use of stored reserves when taller...|$|E
40|$|Of all {{the main}} types of {{mosquito}} living {{to a greater}} or lesser extent in association with man—urban invaders, infiltrators and colonizers—the most formidable and successful is probably Culex fatigans. Able to use man-made breeding-places, breeding freely in highly contaminated water and possessing the genetical and <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> to resist insecticides, this mosquito has increased extensively in urban environments in recent years. Considering that it merits greater study than it has hitherto received, the author discusses its principal characteristics in relation to those of other man-associated mosquitos and suggests a number of lines of research which should be followed for the development of effective control methods...|$|E
40|$|When roots {{encounter}} nutrient-rich zone or patch, {{they tend}} to proliferate within it and also enhance their ion uptake capacities compared to roots of the same plant outside the patch. These plastic responses in the root system {{seem to be a}} major mechanism adapted by plants to cope with the naturally occurring heterogeneous supplies of nutrients in soil (Hodge, 2004). Fast-growing species from fertile habitats seems to be more morphologically plastic in contact with nutrient patches than slow-growing species from infertile habitats (Grime, 1979; Chapin, 1980). A pot experiment was conducted to assess the morphological and <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> of Lolium perenne, a fast-growing plant from fertile habitats, when plants were exposed to heterogeneous supply of phosphorus. Each plant was exposed to P heterogeneity with a specially designed set up which included 4 plastic pots held together by clamping a small PVC tube in the middle. Each pot was filled up with P-fertilized or unfertilized soils giving 6 treatments altogether. The results indicated that even though plants were P limited, they did not show any concentration of roots into P fertilized soils compared to unfertilized soils. The biomass allocation pattern into shoots and roots also showed no significant difference among treatments. Interestingly, Lolium has shown a significantly greater <b>physiological</b> <b>plasticity</b> by increasing the specific P uptake rates when roots were exposed to unfertilized soils. It seems that L. perenne is more plastic physiologically than morphologically, and this conclusion is in contrast with the assumption that fast-growing plants are more plastic morphologically than physiologically. Key words: Plasticity, Lolium perenne, soil heterogeneity and root proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the role of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in corticostriatal long-term depression induction in a model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in experimental parkinsonism. Moreover, we have also analysed the possibility of targeting striatal phosphodiesterases to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia. To study synaptic plasticity in sham-operated rats and in 6 -hydroxydopamine lesioned animals chronically treated with therapeutic doses of levodopa, recordings from striatal spiny neurons were taken using either intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes or whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Behavioural analysis of levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements was performed before and after the treatment with two different inhibitors of phosphodiesterases, zaprinast and UK- 343664. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia was associated with the loss of long-term depression expression at glutamatergic striatal synapses onto spiny neurons. Both zaprinast and UK- 343664 were able to rescue the induction of this form of synaptic plasticity via a mechanism requiring the modulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels. This effect on synaptic plasticity was paralleled by a significant reduction of abnormal movements following intrastriatal injection of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that drugs selectively targeting phosphodiesterases can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesia, possibly by restoring <b>physiological</b> synaptic <b>plasticity</b> in the striatum. Future studies exploring the possible therapeutic effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease and the involvement of striatal synaptic plasticity in these effects remain necessary to validate this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to varying nutrient availability in soil, plants display {{a high degree}} of <b>physiological</b> and developmental <b>plasticity</b> that relies on both local and systemic signaling pathways to coordinate the expression of genes involved in adaptive responses. The integration of these responses at the whole-plant level requires long-distance signaling mechanisms communicating the information between the two indispensable organs, the shoot and the root, which respectively provide photosynthates and mineral nutrients. Although such long-distance signaling is not well understood at the molecular level, several molecules, including hormones, sugars, and nutrients themselves or their metabolites, have been suggested to function as the systemic signals. Moreover, recent discoveries of the phloem-mobile microRNA 399 s as key components mediating the plant responses to phosphorus stress reveal a novel biological role of small RNA in the long-distance signaling of nutrient status...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{invasive}} brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is {{typically associated with}} neuroprosthetic applications aiming to recover loss of motor function. However, BMIs also represent a powerful tool to address fundamental questions in neuroscience. The observed subjects of BMI experiments {{can also be considered}} as indirect observers of their own neurophysiological activity, and the relationship between observed neurons and (artificial) behavior can be genuinely causal rather than indirectly correlative. These two characteristics defy the classical object-observer duality, making BMIs particularly appealing for investigating how information is encoded and decoded by neural circuits in real time, how this coding changes with <b>physiological</b> learning and <b>plasticity,</b> and how it is altered in pathological conditions. Within neuroengineering, BMI is like a tree that opens its branches into many traditional engineering fields, but also extends deep roots into basic neuroscience beyond neuroprosthetics...|$|R
