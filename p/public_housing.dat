5|$|The Near South Side {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic of Chicago's communities.

5|$|The lack of good <b>public</b> <b>housing,</b> poor sanitation, {{and high}} {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|A Group Representation Constituency (GRC) {{is a type}} {{of electoral}} {{division}} or constituency in Singapore in which teams of candidates, instead of individual candidates, compete to be elected into Parliament as the Members of Parliament (MPs) for the constituency.
