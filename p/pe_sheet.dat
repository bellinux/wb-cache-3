40|$|Melons {{are highly}} demanding, thermophilous plants, {{which is why}} they are unpopu-lar among fruit growers. Melon {{cultivation}} requires special treatment methods for the im-provement of microclimatic conditions. Seven Polish melon cultivars are presently grown on the domestic market. They are well adapted to the local climate. The growth rate, vi-gor, fruit shape, fruit size, rind color and flesh thickness of those cultivars vary. The objec-tive {{of this study was to}} determine the mineral content of edible parts of four field-grown melon cultivars in the Warmia region (NE Poland). This study discusses the mineral con-tent of melon fruit subject to the investigated cultivar and cultivation method. In Poland, melon production is difficult and unreliable. The main problem is the selection of an ap-propriate cultivar and cultivation method. The analyzed material consisted of four Polish melon cultivars: Malaga F 1, Melba, Oliwin, Seledyn F 1, grown in a field experiment witho-ut protective cover, under polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>sheet</b> cover, under non-woven polypropylene (PP) cover, with soil mulching, as well as with soil mulching under <b>PE</b> <b>sheet</b> cover or non-woven PP cover.

40|$|Polyethylene (PE) foils were {{modified}} by irradiation with Ar+ and Xe+ ions to different fluences and different physico-chemical {{properties of the}} irradiated PE were studied in relation to adhesion and proliferation of keratinocytes on the modified surface. Changes in the PE surface roughness were examined using the A FM technique, the production of conjugated double bonds and oxidized structures by UV-VIS and FTIR techniques respectively. The surface polarity was determined by measuring surface contact angle and two-point technique {{was used for the}} de termination of <b>PE</b> <b>sheet</b> resistance. Adhesion and proliferation of keratinocytes was characterized using the MTT-test. The ion irradiation leads to creation of conjugated double bonds which, together with progressive carbonization, contribute to the observed decrease of sheet resistance. Oxidation of the irradiated PE surface layer during the ion implantation is observed. Besides oxidation, the P E surface polarity is affected by other factors. The observed increase of the P E surface roughness due to the ion irradiation is inversely proportional to the ion size. The adhesion and proliferation of keratinocytes on the ion irradiated PE is significantly higher than on the pristine PE. Distribution of results in keratinocyte cultivation and the number of cells is related to the ion fluence applied and to ion species as well...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Temperature {{modification}} in soil {{of plastic}} greenhouse caused by solarization was measured {{during the summer}} in the Subtropical Central Region of the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a 10 m x 25 m greenhouse covered with low density transparent polyethylene (PE). Four 6 m x 4 m plots were mulched with 100 µm thickness <b>PE</b> <b>sheets,</b> from December 12, 1992 to March 7, 1993. Four other plots (same size) without the cover were used as control (bare soil). Results indicated that solarization incrased the maximum soil temperature. The average was 11. 9, 10. 8, 9. 8, and 8. 6 °C over uncovered control soil at 2, 5, 10, and 20 cm depth, respectively. The soil temperature reached values of up to 54. 4 °C at 2 cm and 50. 2 °C at 5 cm depth. Temperatures exceeding 45 °C and 50 °C in solarized soil have also occurred in several days.

Double polyethylene (DPE) <b>sheets,</b> regular polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>sheets,</b> and virtually impermeable films (VIF) were compared to examine their effects on soil temperature, disease severity, and plant growth. Results showed that {{in comparison to the}} control, PE, DPE, and VIF treatments increased the mean maximum soil temperatures by 10. 2, 14. 1, and 8. 8 °C, respectively, in 2008 and by 10. 2, 12. 6, and 8. 3 °C respectively, in 2009. The longest length of time recorded for temperature above 45 °C under DPE sheets were 220 hours in 2008 and 218 hours in 2009. The treatments reduced the pathogen population by 86 % and the disease by 43 % under the DPE treatment in 2009 {{and to a lesser extent}} by the other treatments.

40|$|An {{antimicrobial}} polyethylene (PE) {{film was}} obtained by coating a nisin-based antimicrobial solution. <b>PE</b> <b>sheets</b> were coated {{on both sides and}} were used for the packaging of beefsteaks to be stored in air or modified atmosphere packaging (MAP, 60 % O(2) - 40 % CO(2)). Microbial populations, species diversity, headspace volatile organic compounds, colour and sensory properties were monitored after 0, 1, 7 and 12 days of storage at 4 °C. The viable counts showed that there was an effect of MAP and antimicrobial film on the development of all the spoilage associated microbial populations. Carnobacterium spp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas fragi and Rhanella aquatilis were found in most of the samples. C. maltaromaticum was identified in MRS bulk cells from samples stored in air as well as MAP. Quantitative data of headspace-SPME-GC/MS analysis showed that during storage the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was affected by the use of the treated film and the MAP storage. Compounds such as phenylethylalcohol, nonanal, decanal and ethylbutanoate were produced only from 7 to 12 day of storage and only in the samples stored in air. In agreement with the microbiological and VOCs data, the meat stored in active packaging scored the best rankings in the sensory evaluation. Principal component analysis of microbial, sensory and instrumental data showed that beefsteaks stored with the combination of MAP and active packaging for 12 days at 4 °C differed from the other samples that were more associated to high microbial loads, VOCs concentration and meat off odour perception. In conclusion, the antimicrobial sheets in combination with MAP storage at 4 °C were effective for the storage of beefsteaks by retarding the growth of spoilage bacteria, determining lower concentration of VOCs and keeping acceptable levels of colour and other sensory parameters for more than 10 days...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} aid in the {{determination}} of the hazards posed by hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in sediment beds, a method for the use of polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>sheets</b> as passive sampling devices for measuring chemical activities was explored. A model which depends on a concentration gradient and two mass transfer limiting zones in series was used. Internal tracer chemicals within the polyethylene devices (PEDs) were used to calibrate the mass transfer model which can have different mass transfer coefficients depending on the site and target chemicals being investigated. The model allowed for the measurement of HOC chemical activities by measuring the change of mass of tracer and target chemical within the PED, and knowing the PE-water partitioning coefficient, [...] ., and the liquid solubility, [...] ., of the target chemical. The method was tested using PEDs impregnated with dlO-phenanthrene and dlO-pyrene. First, PEDs were used to measure known concentrations of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in stirred seawaters. Seeing that the PEDs performed well, returning results which were within 25 % of the known chemical activities, PEDs were then tested for measuring phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene in Boston Harbor sediments. (cont.) Porewaters of Boston Harbor sediments were extracted as a benchmark against which to assess the performance of three methods for measuring sediment chemical activities: (1) PEDs using impregnated tracers exposed for 52 and 92 days to simulated sediment beds, (2) sediment extractions and an equilibrium partitioning model as recommended by EPA for determining sediment benchmarks, and (3) PE samplers brought to equilibrium with sediment slurries. The results of this study showed that the two methods using PE passive samplers produced measurements which were within a factor of 2 of the porewater extraction results. The equilibrium partitioning model, however, produced results which were at least an order of magnitude different from the measurements of the other methods. Future work on PEDs is needed to develop faster response times and internal standards which will allow for the measurement of a more diverse set of HOCs. by Loretta A. Fernandez. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the hazards posed by hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in sediment beds, the following areas of research were explored: (1) the use of polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>sheets</b> as passive sampling devices in sediments, using performance reference compounds (PRCs) in order to reduce deployment times to the order of days, (2) the use of limited PRC data to calibrate mass-transfer models for the exchange of a suite of compounds between polymer strips and sedimentary porous media, and (3) the use of in-situ passive sampling methods to deduce chemical activities of HOCs in sediments and the tissues of soft shelled clams (Mya arenaria), in order to measure bioaccumulation potential. First, the use of PE passive samplers, in-situ, to measure freely dissolved HOC concentrations, is demonstrated. PRCs, impregnated into the PE before use, allow porewater concentrations to be deduced after exposure times much shorter than would be required for sampler equilibration (days instead of months). Next, the method is expanded for measuring suites of compounds of the same class. A one-dimensional diffusion model of chemical exchange between a polymer sheet of finite thickness and an unmixed sediment bed is employed. Porewater concentrations for seventeen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are measured using samplers deployed for 3 to 10 days in homogenized sediment from a coal-tar contaminated site. Finally, the samplers are used to determine the potential for HOCs to bioaccumulate in Mya arenaria in sediments from six sites near Boston, MA. PE-deduced porewater PAH concentrations are compared to lipid-normalized tissue PAH concentrations in samples taken from twelve stations distributed throughout the sites. Additionally, tissue concentrations are compared to bulk sediment concentrations and porewater concentrations deduced from equilibrium partitioning models that include sorption to both organic carbon and black carbon fractions. Results show correlations only between PE-deduced porewater concentrations and tissue concentrations, illustrating the usefulness of PE passive samplers for gauging risk to benthic organisms associated with HOC contaminated sediments. Also, porewater concentrations estimated using equilibrium partitioning methods overestimated porewater concentrations by one to three orders of magnitude at all but one site. by Loretta A.

40|$|Dielectric {{insulators}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} laboratory settings when performing experiments in rock mechanics, petrology, and electromagnetic studies of rocks in the fields of geophysics,material science, and civil engineering. These components may be used to electrically isolate geological samples from the experimental equipment, to perform a mechanical compliance function between brittle samples and the loading equipment, to match ultrasonic transducers, or perform other functions. In manyexperimental configurations the insulators bear the full brunt of force applied to the sample but do not need to withstand high voltages, therefore the insulators are often thin sheets of mechanically tough polymers. From an instrument perspective, transduction from various types of mechanical perturbation has beenqualitatively compared for a number of polymers [1, 2] and these error sources are readily apparent duringhigh-impedance measurements if not mitigated. However even when following best practices, a force dependent voltage signal still remains and its behavior is explored in this presentation. In this experimenttwo thin sheets (0. 25 mm) of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were set up in a stack, held alternatelybetween three aluminum bars; this stack was placed on the platen of a 60 T capacity hydraulic testingmachine. The surface area, A, over which the force is applied to the <b>PE</b> <b>sheets</b> in this sandwich is roughly 40 square cm, each sheet forming a parallel-plate capacitor having roughly 320 pF [3], assuming therelative dielectric permittivity of PE is approximately 2. 3. The outer two aluminum bars were connected to the LO input ofthe electrometer and the central aluminum bar was connected to the HI input of a Keithley model 617 electrometer. Once the stack is mechanically well-seated with no air gaps, the voltage offset is observed tobe a linear function of the baseline voltage for a given change in applied force. For a periodically appliedforce of 66. 7 kN the voltage offsets were measured as a function of initial voltage, and these data were fitwith a linear function that was constrained to pass through the origin. The best fit solution had a correlation coefficient of R= 0. 85 and a slope of approximately - 0. 0228 volts/volt. The voltage offset when normalizedis demonstrated to be constant - 2. 28 % for both positive and negative polarities over nearly 3 orders ofbaseline voltage magnitude. From this, the voltage-force coefficient is derived to be - 0. 34 ppm/N. Thiscorrelates well to a first-order parallel plate capacitor model that assumes constant area, and smalldeformation such that the polymer may be mechanically modeled by a spring that obeys Hookes law. Thissimple model predicts that the coefficient of proportionality is a function of Youngs modulus E= 0. 8 GPaand surface area of the insulator, theoretically - 1 EA= - 0. 31 ppm/N.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} morphological and mechanical properties of hot gas butt-welds on polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets for four different procedures, which are single and double V-welds with and without a welding shoe. Design/methodology/approach: Welding energy (Ew), which is transferred onto weld surfaces, was calculated to evaluate weld quality. Morphology of welds was analyzed by polarized light, stereo, and scanning electron microscopy. Findings: Polarized light microscopy studies indicated that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) consists of welding rod core, molten zone, and deformed spherulitic zone. The results of tensile, bending, and impact tests indicated that the weld strengths of PVC sheets are {{lower than those of}} <b>PE</b> and PP <b>sheets.</b> When the welding shoe was used, weld strength increased significantly for each material due to the presence of sufficient welding pressure and the effective heating on surfaces.

40|$|A unique {{strategy}} for scavenging free radicals in situ on exposure to gamma irradiation in polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites is presented. Blends of ultra-high molecular weight PE and linear low-density PE (PEB) and their nanocomposites with graphene (GPEB) were prepared by melt mixing to develop materials for biomedical implants. The effect of gamma irradiation on the microstructure and mechanical properties was systematically investigated. The neat blend and the nanocomposite {{were subjected to}} gamma-ray irradiation {{in order to improve}} the interfacial adhesion between <b>PE</b> and graphene <b>sheets.</b> Structural and thermal characterization revealed that irradiation induced crosslinking and increased the crystallinity of the polymer blend. The presence of graphene further enhanced the crystallinity via crosslinks between the polymer matrix and the filler on irradiation. Graphene was found to scavenge free radicals as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Irradiation of graphene-containing polymer composites resulted in the largest increase in modulus and hardness compared to either irradiation or addition of graphene to PEB alone. This study provides new insight into the role of graphene in polymer matrices during irradiation and suggests that irradiated graphene-polymer composites could emerge as promising materials for use as articulating surfaces in biomedical implants...|$|R
40|$|The uniform {{dispersion}} of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, {{together with an}} enhancement of interfacial adhesion is indispensable toward achieving better mechanical properties in the nanocomposites. In the context to biomedical applications, the type and amount of nanoparticles can potentially influence the biocompatibility. To address these issues, we prepared high-density polyethylene (HDPE) based composites reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) by melt mixing followed by compression molding. In an attempt to tailor the dispersion and to improve the interfacial adhesion, we immobilized polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> onto GO <b>sheets</b> by nucleophilic addition elimination reaction. A good combination of yield strength (ca. 20 MPa), elastic modulus (ca. 600 MPa), and an outstanding elongation at failure (ca. 70 %) were recorded with 3 wt % polyethylene grafted graphene oxide (PE-g-GO) reinforced HDPE composites. Considering the relevance of protein adsorption as a biophysical precursor to cell adhesion, the protein adsorption isotherms of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were determined to realize three times higher equilibrium constant (K-eq) for PE-g-GO-reinforced HDPE composites as compared to GO-reinforced composites. To assess the cytocompatibility, we grew osteoblast cell line (MC 3 T 3) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on HDPE/GO and HDPE/PE-g-GO composites, in vitro. The statistically significant increase in metabolically active cell over different time periods in culture for up to 6 days in MC 3 T 3 and 7 days for hMSCs was observed, irrespective of the substrate composition. Such observation indicated that HDPE with GO or PE-g-GO addition (up to 3 wt %) {{can be used as}} cell growth substrate. The extensive proliferation of cells with oriented growth pattern also supported the fact that tailored GO addition can support cellular functionality in vitro. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that the PE-g-GO in HDPE can effectively be utilized to enhance both mechanical and cytocompatibility properties and can further be explored for potential biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Two {{time-dependent}} kinetic {{models of}} superthermal electron transport are combined to conduct global calculations of the nonthermal electron distribution function throughout the inner magnetosphere. It is {{shown that the}} energy range of validity for this combined model extends down to the superthermal-thermal intersection at a few eV, allowing for the calculation of the en- tire distribution function and thus an accurate heating rate to the thermal plasma. Because of the linearity of the formulas, the source terms are separated to calculate the distributions from the various populations, namely photoelectrons (<b>PEs)</b> and plasma <b>sheet</b> electrons (PSEs). These distributions are discussed in detail, examining the processes responsible for their formation in the various regions of the inner magnetosphere. It is shown that convection, corotation, and Coulomb collisions are the dominant processes {{in the formation of}} the PE distribution function and that PSEs are dominated by the interplay between the drift terms. Of note is that the PEs propagate around the nightside in a narrow channel at the edge of the plasmasphere as Coulomb collisions reduce the fluxes inside of this and convection compresses the flux tubes inward. These distributions are then recombined to show the development of the total superthermal electron distribution function in the inner magnetosphere and their influence on the thermal plasma. PEs usually dominate the dayside heating, with integral energy fluxes to the ionosphere reaching 10 (exp 10) eV/sq cm/s in the plasmasphere, while heating from the PSEs typically does not exceed 10 (exp 8) eV/sq cm/s. On the nightside, the inner plasmasphere is usually unheated by superthermal electrons. A feature of these combined spectra is that the distribution often has upward slopes with energy, particularly at the crossover from PE to PSE dominance, indicating that instabilities are possible...|$|R
40|$|Nanocomposite {{materials}} are currently attracting much interest {{due to their}} possibility of global property improvement – mechanical strength, toughness, electrical breakdown strength, electrical erosion resistance and flame retardancy. In order to disperse montmorillonite clay (MMT) into polyethylene (<b>PE),</b> the clay <b>sheets</b> need to be rendered organophilic. Masterbatches {{with a high level}} (~ 40 %wt) of organomodified clay can then be dispersed into a host by a simple mechanical process. Two chemically different masterbatches were purchased: Nanoblend 2101 from PolyOne Corp. and C 30 PE from Nanocor Inc. These were let down using a RandcastleTM single screw extruder with a patented mixing device to provide elongational flow. Wide angle X-ray diffraction was used together with transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the particle dispersion, which consisted of intercalated clay organised in clusters up to one micron in diameter. The performance of these materials was assessed in terms of AC ramp breakdown statistics, dielectric spectroscopy, dynamic and tensile mechanical properties. Nanoblend masterbatch consistently improved the breakdown statistics, more than overcoming the inherent demerit of extrusion, which mildly aged the unfilled material (as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.) On the other hand, even low loading levels of Nanocor could result in reduced breakdown strength and increased scatter. Furthermore, both sets of materials demonstrated large dielectric losses at power frequencies and poorer performance under mechanical tension. These materials would therefore require considerable development before they could confidently be used commercially. The nature of the PE-MMT interactions was examined by investigating the crystallisation kinetics and resulting morphologies with differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. By varying the masterbatch type, loading level and crystallisation temperature, it was possible to study a wide range of supercrystalline morphologies using a permanganic etching technique. This is a useful contribution to the field of nanocomposites research. It is known that the morphologies of polymers can affect their mechanical properties and electrical treeing behaviour, and so it is possible that controlled crystallisation could provide a route toward designer materials with optimised behaviour.
