It is done from the graph of desire that Lacan proposes in his Seminar V. Indeed, the presence of the Other in the destinies that knowledge has in a teenager is crucial to understand the subjective positions of the adolescents. Thus, when an adolescent raises the question “what is my place in the desire of the Other?”, in relation with the school knowledge, he or she may respond with the ego Ideal I(A); with the fantasy, (S ◊ a); with the symptom, s(A); or with the signifier of the barred Other, S(A) ...|$|E

All of the compounds exhibit a pressure-induced and/or temperature-induced phase transition between the two polymorphs adopted by AMoO 4 compounds (A = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). For the FeMoO 4 compound, for both the α and the β allotropic forms, the structural features have been correlated to the magnetic properties, the Mössbauer signals, and the optical absorption properties {{to gain a better}} understanding of the phenomena at the origin of the piezo(thermo) chromic behavior. The different contributions of the Mössbauer signals were attributed to the different Fe(2 +) ions or Fe(3 +) ions from the structural data (Wyckoff <b>positions,</b> <b>bond</b> distances and angles) and were quantified. Furthermore, the low Fe(3 +) concentration (9 and 4 mol %, respectively, in the α and the β allotropic forms) was also quantified based on the magnetic susceptibility measurements. The net increase in the Fe(3 +) quantity in the α-form in comparison to the β-form, which is associated with the occurrence of Fe-Mo charge transfer, is at the origin of the important divergence of coloration of the two forms. To design new piezo(thermo) chromic oxides and to control the pressure (temperature) of this first-order phase transition, FeMoO 4 -MgMoO 4 solid solutions were synthesized. The optical contrast between the two allotropic forms was increased due to magnesium incorporation, and the phase transition (β → α) pressure increased steadily with the Mg content.

40|$|Lipids are {{the main}} {{structural}} component of biological membranes and are important in complex biochemical processes including cellular signalling. Using electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), information regarding fatty acid chain length and degree of unsaturation can be gained for complex lipids. Determining double <b>bond</b> <b>position,</b> however, remains challenging. To address the limitations of collision-induced dissociation (CID) for structural characterisation, the use of ozonolysis chemistry in conjunction with mass spectrometry was explored. Initial experiments concentrated on performing ozonolysis within the electrospray source of conventional mass spectrometers; referred to here as ozone electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (OzESI-MS). In OzESI-MS experiments, two ozonolysis product ions, assigned as an aldehyde and α-methoxyhydroperoxide, are observed from the cleavage of lipid carbon-carbon double bonds. Importantly, the massto- charge ratio of the two ozonolysis product ions allows the unambiguous assignment of double <b>bond</b> <b>position.</b> OzESI-MS was successfully applied {{to a wide range}} of lipid standards including glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins and triacylglycerols, demonstrating the wide utility of OzESI-MS for determining double <b>bond</b> <b>position.</b> While OzESI-MS provides clear information on double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> for pure, isolated lipids, determining double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> for lipids present in complex mixtures is difficult and, in many cases, unambiguous assignment of double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> is not possible. This presents a major limitation to the OzESI-MS technique. To overcome the problems associated with in-source ozonolysis, instrument modifications were made to a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer in order to allow ozonolysis to be performed on mass-selected lipid ions within the ion trap. Ozonolysis at the site of carbon-carbon double bonds resulted in the formation of two primary ozonolysis product ions, namely an aldehyde and a so-called Criegee ion. This method, referred to as ozone-induced dissociation (OzID), was applied {{to a wide range of}} lipid ions including; the deprotonated ions of the acidic phospholipid classes; protonated, lithiated and sodiated ions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids; and sodium adducts of triacylglycerols. As expected, the observed ozonolysis product ions allow the unambiguous assignment of double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> in all cases. Furthermore, in a significant advancement over OzESI-MS, OzID was successfully applied to lipids from a range of complex biological mixtures. OzID was also used in conjunction with CID in the MS 3 method referred to as CIDOzID. This approach was used to assign double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> in both the ester and ether-linked chains of an unsaturated ether phosphatidylethanolamine. Moreover, it was found that the [M+Na- 183]+ CID product ion from sodiated PC lipids was highly reactive towards ozone. Interestingly, the observed ozonolysis product ions provide further evidence in support of the substitution mechanism proposed by Hsu and Turk for the formation of this ion. In addition, CID-OzID of the sn-positional isomers, PC(16 : 0 / 9 Z- 18 : 0) and PC(9 Z- 18 : 1 / 16 : 0), revealed striking differences in product ion distributions that may be used to determine fatty acid sn-position...|$|R

This is especially problematic given the importance of double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> in determining the biological function of lipid classes. 6 Previous attempts to identify double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> in intact phospholipids using mass spectrometry employ either MS 3 or offline chemical derivatization. 7 - 11 The former method requires specialized instrumentation and is rarely applied, while the latter methods suffer from complications inherent in sample handling prior to analysis. In this communication we outline a novel on-line approach for the identification of double <b>bond</b> <b>position</b> in intact phospholipids. In our method, the double bond(s) present in unsaturated phospholipids are cleaved by ozonolysis within the ion source of a conventional ESI mass spectrometer to give two chemically induced fragment ions that may be used to unambiguously assign the position of the double bond. This is achieved by using oxygen as the electrospray nebulizing gas in combination with high electrospray voltages to initiate the formation of an ozoneproducing...|$|R
