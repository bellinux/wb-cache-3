5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The bony palate was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony <b>protuberance,</b> the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|Xu Xing, another Chinese paleontologist, named a {{new species}} of Psittacosaurus in 1997, based on a {{complete}} skull with associated vertebrae and a forelimb. This material was recovered in Gansu Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. This species is named P. mazongshanensis after the nearby mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been described in a preliminary manner. Unfortunately, the skull was damaged while {{in the care of}} the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), and several fragments have been lost, including all of the teeth. The remains were found in the Lower Xinminbao Formation, which have not been precisely dated, although {{there is some evidence that}} they were deposited in the late Barremian through Aptian stages. Sereno suggested in 2000 that P. mazongshanensis was a nomen dubium, with no unique features that separate it from any other species of Psittacosaurus. However, more recent authors have noted that it can be distinguished by its proportionally long snout compared to other species of Psittacosaurus, as well as a prominent bony <b>protuberance,</b> pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary <b>protuberance</b> is also now missing. Other features originally used to distinguish the species have been recognised as the results of the deformation of the skull after fossilisation. Sereno (2010) remained unconvinced of its validity.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like <b>protuberance</b> usually {{surrounding}} the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E

The interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse.

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine, Pennatomys {{is known}} {{from a number}} of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and postcranial bones are represented. Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known only from fragments. The nasal bones extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the maxillary, frontal, and lacrimal bones meet, and have a blunt back margin. The nasals extend slightly further back than the premaxillaries. The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes Pennatomys from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals). The interorbital region of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper molar (M1). The incisive foramina, openings in the bony palate, extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process—a <b>protuberance</b> at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower incisor. Below the molars, the upper and lower masseteric ridges (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes conjoined towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1). The conjoined crests are one of the synapomorphic (shared-derived) characters of the Nectomys subclade.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{its size}} the {{humpback}} whale is extremely maneuverable. This has {{been attributed to}} their use of pectoral flippers, along which <b>protuberances</b> are present along the leading edge. There has been speculation that the <b>protuberances</b> along {{the leading edge of the}} pectoral flipper act as a form of passive flow control. To examine the effects of <b>protuberances</b> on hydrofoil performance, the lift, drag, and pitching moments of two-dimensional hydrofoils with leading edge sinusoidal <b>protuberances</b> were measured in a water tunnel and compared to those of a baseline NACA 634 - 021 hydrofoil. The amplitude of the <b>protuberances</b> ranged from 2. 5 % to 12 % of the mean chord length and the spanwise wavelengths were 25 % and 50 % of the mean chord length. This corresponds to the morphology found on the leading edge of humpback whale’s flippers. Flow visualization using tufts and dye was also performed to examine the near surface flow patterns surrounding the hydrofoils. At angles of attack lower than the stall angle of the baseline the modified foils revealed reduced lift and increased drag. However, above this angle the lift generated by the modified foils was up to 50 % greater than the baseline foil with little or no drag penalty. The amplitude of the <b>protuberances</b> has a large effect on the performance of the hydrofoils whereas the wavelength has little. Corroborating lift and drag measurements, visualizations show attached flow on the peaks of the <b>protuberances</b> and separation in the valleys at angles beyond the stall angle of the baseline foil. i...|$|R
