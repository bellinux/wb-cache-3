40|$|Background: Facial {{soft tissue}} {{injuries}} are frequently encountered in trauma patients {{with or without}} fractures of the facial bones. Traumatic facial soft tissue injuries may have profound social impact due to their effects on aesthetics, {{as well as on}} functions of the face. Important structures such as branches of the facial nerve and parotid duct are relatively unprotected by hard tissue and are prone to injury with trauma to the <b>parotid</b> bed <b>region</b> resulting in functional impairments. In these cases, primary repair of severed soft tissue structures provides the best outcome in terms of functional recovery. Objectives: Clinical presentation and operative management of a patient with laceration to the <b>parotid</b> bed <b>region</b> involving all branches of facial nerve and the parotid duct will be presented. A review of anatomy in this region especially anatomical landmarks leading to the identification of the parotid duct, and the facial nerve branches will be discussed. Conclusion: A detailed knowledge of anatomy in the <b>parotid</b> bed <b>region</b> is imperative when performing primary reanastomosis of lacerated soft tissue structures in this area. This knowledge is not only useful in managing injuries due to trauma, but also applicable in the management of other maxillofacial lesions in the <b>parotid</b> bed <b>region.</b> Griffith Health, School of Dentistry and Oral HealthNo Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|In most cases, local {{excision}} with {{a margin}} of normal tissue is the appropriate form of biopsy for a major salivary gland tumor. In the <b>parotid</b> <b>region,</b> this requires identification of the facial nerve. For submandibular tumors, the entire submandibular triangle is cleared. In contrast, minor salivary gland tumors have a higher likelihood of being malignant, and an incisional biopsy is performed initially so that definitive treatment can be planned. In the <b>parotid</b> <b>region,</b> the presence of pain, recent rapid enlargement of a preexisting nodule, skin involvement, or facial nerve paralysis suggests cancer. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes in association with a salivary gland tumor are considered a manifestation of cancer until proved otherwise.

40|$|Automatic {{suspected}} lesion extraction is {{an important}} application in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). In this paper, we propose a method to automatically extract the suspected <b>parotid</b> <b>regions</b> for clinical evaluation in head and neck CT images. The suspected lesion tissues in low contrast tissue regions can be localized with feature-based segmentation (FBS) based on local texture features, and can be delineated with accuracy by modified active contour models (ACM). At first, stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is introduced. The derived wavelet coefficients are applied to derive the local features for FBS, and to generate enhanced energy maps for ACM computation. Geometric shape features (GSFs) are proposed to analyze each soft tissue region segmented by FBS; the regions with higher similarity GSFs with the lesions are extracted and the information is also applied as the initial conditions for fine delineation computation. Consequently, the suspected lesions can be automatically localized and accurately delineated for aiding clinical diagnosis. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing with the results outlined by clinical experts. The experiments on 20 pathological CT data sets show that the true-positive (TP) rate on recognizing parotid lesions is about 94 %, and the dimension accuracy of delineation results can also approach over 93 %...|$|R
5000|$|Phyllodes {{tumors are}} a fibroepithelial tumor {{composed}} of an epithelial and a cellular stromal component. They {{may be considered}} benign, borderline, or malignant depending on histologic features including stromal cellularity, infiltration at the tumor's edge, and mitotic activity. [...] All forms of phyllodes tumors are regarded as having malignant potential. A large series from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre reported the incidence of each as benign (58%), borderline (12%), and malignant (30%). Malignant phyllodes tumours behave like sarcomas and can develop blood-borne metastases. Approximately 10% of patients with phyllodes tumours develop distant metastases and this can go up to 20% in patients with histologically malignant tumours. The commonest sites for distant metastases are the lung, bone, and abdominal viscera. Rare sites of metastasis like to <b>parotid</b> <b>region</b> have also been described.|$|E

40|$|The platysma myocutaneous flap (PMF) is {{a common}} {{reconstructive}} option for defects {{in the head and}} neck region. Its applications have expanded from the reconstruction of intraoral defects to include laryngo-pharyngeal, lip, and cheek defects. The platysma flap can be superiorly, posteriorly, or inferiorly-based. The superiorly-based flap has a robust arterial blood supply but less efficient venous drainage, whereas the opposite is the case with the posteriorly-based flap. We present our results of using a superiorly based PMF flap for reconstruction of defects in the parotid, auricular/mastoid, and cheek regions after resection for squamous cell carcinoma. Of 11 patients, eight had no postoperative complications. The remaining three developed venous congestion of their flaps, in two of whom it led to secondary epidermolysis and limited skin loss.

Guttural pouch empyema is a disease of any age mostly associated with bacterial infection while guttural pouch tympany is a condition of young foals. The goal of this study is to document the occurrence of guttural pouch disorders among foals admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at King Faisal University, Al-Ahssa, Saudi Arabia. Three foals were referred between November 2005 and April 2006. The first foal was about 6 months old Arabian colt that had a history of intermittent bilateral nasal discharges. The foal was diagnosed with guttural pouch empyema based on physical and endoscopic examinations and treated with combined procaine penicillin and dehydrostreptomycin sulphate (Pen and Strep, Norbrook, Newry, North Ireland), for two weeks. Recovery was achieved and the foal came to full activity. The second two foals were five months old colt and one month old Arabian filly respectively that were admitted with a history of bilateral swelling at the <b>parotid</b> gland <b>region.</b> They were diagnosed with guttural pouch tympany based on physical and endoscopic examinations and radiographs. The first foal was recommended for surgery however it developed post surgery complications and died a month later. The second was operated and recovered fully after the surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extramedullary plasmacytomas are uncommon. Although {{approximately}} 90 % {{occur in}} the head and neck <b>region,</b> <b>parotid</b> gland localization is extremely rare. CASE: This report describes fine needle aspiration and histopathologic findings in an extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the left parotid gland of a 62 -year-old man. Aspiration smears showed multiple amorphous clumps of material admixed with ductal epithelial cells, multinucleated giant cells and inflammatory cells rich in plasma cells, suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. In surgical material, excessive amyloid deposition was observed. Six months later the tumor recurred, and in the second surgical specimen clusters of atypical plasma cells among amyloid deposits was noted. Clinical and laboratory examination excluded multiple myeloma. After local recurrence, radiotherapy was applied. Ten months later the patient was well and without systemic involvement. CONCLUSION: Two points are important. First, in the salivary gland region, because of the focal metachromasia of amyloid with Giemsa stain, amyloid can be confused with the chondromyxoid matrix of pleomorphic adenoma. Second, although localized forms of amyloid tumor exist, one should keep in mind that amyloid may be so abundant that it may mask an underlying plasma cell neoplasm, as in our case...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) - {{also known as}} hypernephroma or grawitz tumor - accounts for 3 % of the adulthood malignancies. Approximately 30 - 40 % of the patients have metastasis {{at the time of}} the diagnosis and most common sites for metastasis are lung, regional lymph nodes, bone and liver. A total of 8 - 14 % of the patients with RCC has head and neck metastasis. However, metastasis to major salivary glands is rarely seen. In this paper, we aimed to report a RCC case with metastasis to parotid and submandibular glands that has the same sonographic and sonoelastographic findings with the primary tumor. CASE REPORT: 66 -year old woman with RCC history was referred to our radiology department for neck ultrasound (US) with painful swelling in the right <b>parotid</b> gland <b>region.</b> A well-defined, 37 × 21 mm sized hypoechoic heterogeneous solid mass was detected in the superficial-deep lobe of the right parotid gland. The mass was prominently hypervascular in color Doppler ultrasonography scan. Coincidentally, a 13 × 13 mm hypoechoic lobulated solid mass was detected in the right submandibular gland with similar sonographic findings. Real-time sonoelastography (SEL) was performed to the masses and both of them were blue-green colored that indicates hard tissue. An US and SEL evaluation was also performed to the renal mass (RCC) of the patient. The primary mass was also similar in sonographic and SEL appearance as salivary gland masses. In the patient history, she revealed chemotherapy-radiotherapy treatment 1. 5 years ago due to inoperable mass in the mid-lower pole of the left kidney diagnosed as clear cell RCC with vascular invasion, liver, lung and brain metastasis. Because of known primary tumor, the masses in the salivary glands were suspected to be metastatic and a tru-cut biopsy was performed. Pathological result was reported as clear cell RCC metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of RCC is still unknown and metastatic involvement can be seen at unexpected tissue and organs. Metastatic disease should be considered when a salivary gland mass detected in patients with RCC history. SEL examination would be helpful in differentiation of the origin of the metastatic lesion with known SEL features...|$|R
