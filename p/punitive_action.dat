40|$|Using {{data from}} {{automobile}} dealers in the Netherlands, the authors find that dealers 2 ̆ 7 <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> toward their key suppliers {{are affected by}} {{their perceptions of their}} own and their supplier 2 ̆ 7 s interdependence and punitive capabilities, {{as well as by the}} supplier 2 ̆ 7 s <b>punitive</b> <b>actions.</b> <b>Punitive</b> <b>actions</b> are affected by interdependence, but a more complete picture is achieved by also examining punitive capability. The authors test hypotheses based on bilateral deterrence, conflict spiral, and relative power theories, but none of these comprehensively explains the effects of both total power and power asymmetry. Dealer <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> are inhibited as total interdependence increases, but are promoted as total punitive capability increases. Using spline regression, the authors find that interdependence asymmetry has no direct effect on <b>punitive</b> <b>actions,</b> whereas <b>punitive</b> capability asymmetry does. As dealers 2 ̆ 7 punitive capability advantage as compared with their suppliers 2 ̆ 7 increases, dealers make greater use of <b>punitive</b> <b>actions,</b> whereas they use fewer <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> as their <b>punitive</b> capability deficit increases. The authors also find that dealers with a relative advantage in dependence or punitive capability are more likely to reciprocate their supplier 2 ̆ 7 s <b>punitive</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rational actor {{models have}} {{examined}} the effects of increasing punishment or the probability of apprehension on terrorists activities including hostage‐taking. This paper attempts to introduce a policy tool {{in the form of a}} reward so as to examine the impact of a policy‐mix of penalties and rewards on the behavior of hostage‐takers. The results reached show that given hostage‐taking behavior and government cost, a policy‐mix of punishment and reward may have a greater impact on reducing hostage‐taking than any individual policy of pure <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> or pure reward. The penalty‐reward combination is likely to be Pareto superior to a policy depending completely on <b>punitive</b> <b>actions.</b> PublishedN/...|$|R
5|$|As of June 23, 2013, the United States Office of Special Counsel is {{investigating}} reports that two schedulers at the Ft. Collins facility were reassigned to Wyoming after {{they refused to}} comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times. The VA Office of Medical Inspector has substantiated a report that <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> was taken against employees who scheduled appointments {{in a way that}} honestly showed that appointments would take place outside of the 14-day window, and the OMI also substantiated reports of other problems at the facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments.|$|E
5|$|The Nasserists still {{maintained}} {{a relatively high}} level of strength in the military, despite the purges, and on 18 July, {{under the leadership of}} Jassem Alwan and the help of Egyptian intelligence, they attempted to launch a daytime coup against the new government. The Army Headquarters, personally defended by al-Hafiz, and the broadcast station were attacked, and the ensuing battle left hundreds of people dead, including several civilian bystanders. The coup attempt failed and 27 participating officers were arrested and executed. The executions were a rare <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> used to deal with the participants of a failed coup in Syria, with the typical punishment being exile, imprisonment or reassignment to a foreign diplomatic post. President Lu'ay al-Atassi subsequently resigned, signalling his disapproval of the executions. After evading the authorities for a short period, Alwan and his chief co-conspirators Raef al-Maarri and Muhammad Nabhan were apprehended and brought to military trial, where they were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. They were released exactly a year later and exiled, after lobbying by Nasser and Iraqi President Abdul Salam Arif.|$|E

40|$|Two {{forms of}} {{consumer}} response to corporate wrongdoing are constructive <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> (i. e., those designed to induce firms {{to change their}} behavior but {{with the hope of}} sustaining relationships with consumers) and destructive <b>punitive</b> <b>actions</b> (i. e., those intended to discredit or harm firms, ultimately leading to disengagement from firms). This study investigates the conditions under which one or the other actions are taken and shows that anger regulates the former, whereas contempt governs the latter. Hypotheses are tested in two studies: a laboratory experiment and a naturalistic field study with an actual instance of recent corporate malfeasance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The British held Scott as a {{prisoner}} of war. They considered Irish-American prisoners of war British subjects and traitors, and executed 13 who were captured at Queenston Heights.

The Senate wrote a bill after this urging, but President James Madison believed the summary execution of prisoners of war unworthy of civilized nations, and so refused to enforce the act.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, the {{increased}} tensions around the Poona ashram, along with criticism of its activities and threatened <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> by the Indian authorities, provided an {{impetus for the}} ashram to consider {{the establishment of a}} new commune in the United States. According to Susan J. Palmer, the move to the United States was a plan from Sheela. Gordon (1987) notes that Sheela and Rajneesh had discussed the idea of establishing a new commune in the US in late 1980, although he did not agree to travel there until May 1981.|$|E
25|$|Tensions between as-Salih and his mamluks {{came to a}} head {{later in}} 1249 when Louis IX of France's forces {{captured}} Damietta in their bid to conquer Egypt during the Seventh Crusade. As-Salih believed Damietta should not have been evacuated and was rumored to have threatened <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> against the Damietta garrison. The rumor, accentuated by the execution of civilian notables who evacuated Damietta, provoked a mutiny by the garrison of his camp in al-Mansurah, which included numerous Salihi mamluks. The situation was calmed after the intervention of the atabeg al-askar (commander of the military), Fakhr ad-Din ibn Shaykh al-Shuyukh.|$|E
25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} to what she perceived was an apparent lack of <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However she seemed to be unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E

While expected to return to action on January 26, Griffin was instead ruled out for an estimated {{four to six weeks}} due to a right hand injury he sustained on January 23 from hitting a member of the team's equipment staff, who was also his friend, during an argument at a restaurant in Toronto. The Clippers were sternly critical of Griffin, and indicated that further <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> would follow. According to the Toronto Police Service, a police report was not filed.|$|E
25|$|By November 15, 1861, Camp Douglas housed about 4,222 {{volunteer}} {{soldiers from}} 11 regiments. By February 1862, the recruits suffered 42 deaths by disease.

A 1960 history by Eisendrath estimated the number of recruits as 25,000 based on his sources at the time. Colonel Tucker's job as camp commander was not easy; he had to use increasingly hard measures to curb considerable drunk and disorderly conduct by recruits in camp. He also had to supervise their conduct and sometimes take <b>punitive</b> <b>action</b> against them for acts in the city of Chicago, where the soldiers abused pass privileges.|$|E
50|$|Internationally, Ayurbarwada {{continued}} his ancestors' imperialistic policies.
