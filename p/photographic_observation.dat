50|$|From 1969 to 1981 Rooney {{turned his}} {{attention}} to systematic <b>photographic</b> <b>observation</b> in a conceptual art mode, prior to which, from 1954 to 1963 he had used a Box Brownie camera to take photographs as references for his paintings, drawings and prints. Rooney, who stopped taking the serial photographs in 1975, said ‘I don’t particularly like photographer’s photographs.’. After this period he returned to painting In 1982 with ‘The Red Card, Australia’, 1944—45’ based on a Communist Party membership card he found in a book 20 years earlier. He continued plays on such printed ephemera, and it was included by Paul Taylor in 'Popism, a major exhibition at the NGV of Post-Pop art.|$|E

Through the figure of Aida, Rino researches and recounts moments in Italian history with a completely original, almost <b>photographic,</b> <b>observation.</b> While on tour, Gaetano was joined by the emerging band, Crash, and he produced their album Exstasis and wrote their song [...] "Marziani noi" [...] (Us Martians). With his increasing rise in popularity, he made his first major television appearance on the entertainment programme, Domenica in (Sunday), presented by the legendary Italian TV presenter Corrado Mantoni, singing [...] "" [...] and on 19 August, he was invited to appear on a programme with Gino Paoli where he famously appeared bearing a petrol pump and wearing a striped T-shirt and a colonial style safari hat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the postwar}} period Jakov E. Gordon (1912-1978) was {{appointed}} to the post of director of the observatory (in 1951). In 1955, Repsold Meridian Circle was transported to Nikolaev from Pulkovo after reconstruction and a number of upgrades, on which different observational programs were carried out during 40 years. In 1961, Zonal Astrograph made by the “Carl Zeiss” firm was transferred from Pulkovo to NAO and the history of photographic astrometry has begun. Nikolaev photographic observations of Solar system bodies are among some of the most accurate in the World. In 1957-1969 visual and <b>photographic</b> <b>observation</b> satellites were carried out to determine their orbits. In 70 - 80s, the observatory was the initiator and main administrant of several scientific expeditions for observations upon conditions of Polar night and high mountains in the Caucasus on the West Spitsbergen island. In total, nearly 35 different catalogs were created by NAO with the positions of celestial bodies. In 1978 Rima Timofeevna Fedorova (1934 born) became director of the observatory. Gennady Pinigin (current director, 1943 born) took up the position of director in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Observations of the (then unidentified) Delta Aquariids (δ Aquariids) were {{recorded}} by G. L. Tupman in 1870, who plotted 65 meteors observed between July 27 and August 6. He plotted the radiant's apparent {{beginning and ending}} points (RA=340°, DEC=−14°; RA=333°, DEC=−16°). This was corrected later. Ronald A. McIntosh re-plotted the path, based on {{a greater number of}} observations made from 1926 to 1933. He determined it to begin at RA=334.9°, DEC=−19.2° and end RA=352.4°, DEC=−11.8°. Cuno Hoffmeister and a team of German observers were the first to record the characteristics of a Northern Aquariid radiant within the stream around 1938. And Canadian D. W. R. McKinley observed both branches in 1949, but did not associate the two radiants. That was accomplished by astronomer Mary Almond, in 1952, who determined both accurate velocity and orbit of the δ Aquariids. She used a [...] "more selective beamed aerial" [...] (echo radio) to identify probable member meteors and plotted an accurate orbital plane. Her paper reported it as a broad [...] "system of orbits" [...] that are probably [...] "connected and produced by one extended stream." [...] This was confirmed in the 1952-1954 Harvard Meteor Project, via <b>photographic</b> <b>observation</b> of orbits. The Project also produced the first evidence that the stream's evolution was influenced by Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Photographic</b> {{multi-station}} <b>observations</b> of 18 Leonid meteors {{obtained by}} the Spanish Photographic Meteor Network are presented. For each meteoroid the radiant position, trajectory data and orbital parameters are discussed and compared to theoretical radiant positions and orbital elements of particles ejected from 55 P/Tempel–Tuttle in 1899. We discuss the role of mean velocity imprecision in the dispersion of some orbital parameters, specially the semimajor axis. Finally, by applying the dust trail theory we have adjusted the 1999 Leonid storm orbits to a defined semimajor axis value to test the quality of <b>photographic</b> <b>observations...</b>|$|R
