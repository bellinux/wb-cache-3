5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise.

Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E

5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{parody of}} the game {{designer}} Peter Molyneux.

Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
