40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an environmental impact}} assessment (EIA) controversial case, which was finally settled by the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> The sentence enforced a payment {{to compensate for the}} economic damage caused to a fish farm through local environmental changes in Urola river estuary, located in the Basque Country. The damage was allegedly caused by a breakwater extension built at the mouth of an estuary nearby the farm, and linked to a recreation port project located within the estuary. While the sentence settled the meaning of compensation from an economic perspective, it raised by contrast some questions on the difficulty of undertaking ecological compensation within EIA practice, using of this particular case. Maybe these difficulties account for the lack of compensation in coastal development projects, which we have observed in a variety of cases in Spain, particularly for coastal development projects...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is <b>an</b> issue <b>of</b> the {{conditional}} cumulative sentence under art. 89 of the penal code (p. c.) particularly focusing on amendments to this provision introduced by the statute of 5 November 2009 which came into force on 8 June 2010. In the paper an effort has been made to show that amendments to art. 89 (p. c) had not removed <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> unclear issues and interpretation ambiguities and in some cases they had created new problems. As long as it clearly results from provisions of art. 89 (p. c.) that in <b>a</b> cumulative <b>sentence</b> it is possible to join sentences of the same kind of which at least one is passed but is conditionally suspended and deprivation of liberty sentences, it is still not clear if it is possible to join sentences of restricting liberty or fines, conditionally suspended. The same doubt concerns sentences of various types both when they are compiled as “absolute sentences and conditionally suspended” and when they all have been passed as conditionally suspended. It is true that it has been accepted that only one-type sentences or liberty deprivation sentences together with sentences of restricting liberty of which at least one is conditionally suspended are subject to the cumulating of the sentences whose service may be conditionally suspended (arg. ex art. 87 p. c.). But it is still ambiguous and not clear. It has not either been decided unambiguously if in case of enforcement means <b>of</b> reaction to <b>a</b> crime in combinations mentioned directly in § 1 and 1 a art. 89 p. c. as well as in those admitted when applying a maiori ad minus reasoning their cumulating is <b>a</b> duty <b>of</b> the court or its right which it can exercise e. g. when conditions to suspend <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> are satisfied (specified in art. 69) and the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cumulative <b>sentence</b> will not aggravate a convict’s situation. Though the legislator has resolved that in case of liberty deprivation sentence conditionally suspended the court may pass <b>an</b> absolute <b>sentence</b> it is still not certain if the conditional cumulative <b>sentence</b> is only <b>a</b> possibility (or perhaps <b>a</b> duty <b>of</b> the court) when there is <b>a</b> different combination <b>of</b> enforcement means. There is also <b>an</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conditional cumulative <b>sentence</b> when all individual <b>sentences</b> are absolute. <b>A</b> question arises if <b>a</b> possibility <b>of</b> applying this institution may be admitted under art. 89 p. c. and if not, then perhaps under general provisions. In the paper it has been decided that neither the first nor the second solution is correct. The issue of the conditional sentence has still not been decided in <b>a</b> situation <b>of</b> ruling {{at the same time as}} of all crimes that are in real concurrence. In this issue the “November amendment” which restricted the provision under art. 89 p. c. to the cumulative <b>sentence</b> only caused <b>a</b> return to times when the previous codes had been in force and which had not absolutely referred to the issues in question and opposing solutions had been being accepted (both in literature and in judicature) – (i. e. applying the institution of the conditional sentence either at the stage <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> individual sentences or at the stage <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> the cumulative sentence) of which every one now poses quite serious practical problems...|$|R

40|$|In the Japanese language, as a {{predicate}} {{is placed}} at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> the con-tent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> cannot be inferred until reaching the end. However, when the con-tent is complicated and the sentence is long, {{people want to know}} at an earlier stage in the sentence whether the content is negative, affirmative, or interrogative. In Japanese, the grammatical form called the KO-OU relation exists. The KO-OU relation is <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> concord.
