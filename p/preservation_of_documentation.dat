Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E

The main goal of this project is to create an integrated archive of the recordings, documents, and pho-tographs that would be accessible online and would provide multifaceted search capabilities (spoken content, biographical information, relevant time period, etc.). The recordings contain retrospect interviews with witnesses of the totali-tarian regimes in Czechoslovakia; the other documents are copies of relevant text material and photographs mainly from home archives. This paper focuses on the processing of the historical documents with the optical character recogni-tion and describes the initial experiments...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of artists drawing {{on their own}} and other archives is not a new one, but {{over the past few years}} there has undoubtedly been a significant increase in attention, among both artist and art historians, given to the archive as part of the creative process, as well as to archive practice. Archives have also become contested territory, caught up in discourses about the nature of museums and individual anxieties about the significance and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation.</b> From an archivist's point of view, archives have a positive and fertile role as both a resonant collective memory resource and a site of creative regeneration through revisiting the traces of earlier ideas and actions. Archive theory also emphasizes the importance of context in the assessment of the meaning of a document within a body of archive material. Consideration of the archives of Prunella Clough and Helen Chadwick within this wider context of archival theory and practice reveals in both cases a distinctly archival attitude to the documentation of the creative process, one which provides a rewarding insight into their work...|$|E
40|$|According to statistics, only 18 {{percent of}} museum {{holdings}} in Croatia have been computer processed. Museums lack both hardware and software. Our {{goal is to}} provide easier access to museum object information in Croatian museums through systematic acquisition of hardware and software, its installation and monitoring of museum holdings processing. In 2004 the Ministry of Culture gave funds to MDC {{to act as a}} mediator and coordinator of the computerisation of Croatian museum network. An opportunity was given to 24 museums in Croatia to get M++, an integrated information system for museum documentation management, developed by the Link 2 company. Furthermore, 27 museums that already have M++were offered a free upgrade to a newer version and a full support and consulting service. Twenty-three out of 24 museums accepted the offer and cooperated with Link 2 and MDC. M++ was installed on 97 computers and curators were trained on how to use the newly acquired software. Also, user support and consulting service are established. It is very important that all museum requirements are now systematically acquired and future development is coordinated by MDC. The next step is to work on the coordination of controlled terminology development. Our Þ nal goals are to establish continuous development of documentation systems that would support museological research, preservation and communication, to establish continuous <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> in digital environment and especially to encourage online access to information and knowledge about the museum objects...|$|E
40|$|As {{geospatial}} missions age, one of {{the challenges}} for the usability of data is the availability of relevant and updated metadata with sufficient documentation that can be used by future generations of users to gain knowledge from the original data. Given that remote sensing data undergo many intermediate processing steps, for example, an understanding of the exact algorithms employed and the quality of that data produced, could be key considerations for these users. As interest in global climate data is increasing, documentation about older data, their origins, and provenance are valuable to first time users attempting to perform historical climate research or comparative analysis of global change. Incomplete or missing documentation could be what stands {{in the way of a}} new researcher attempting to use the data. Therefore, <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> and related metadata is sometimes just as critical as the preservation of the original observational data. The Goddard Earth Sciences - Data and Information Service Center (GES DISC), a NASA Earth science Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), that falls under the management structure of the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS), is actively pursuing the preservation of all necessary artifacts needed by future users. In this paper we will detail the data custodial planning and the data lifecycle process developed for content preservation, our implementation of a Preservation System to safeguard documents and associated artifacts from legacy (older) missions, as well as detail lessons learned regarding access rights and confidentiality of information issues. We also elaborate on key points that made our preservation effort successful; the primary points being: the drafting of a governing baseline for historical data preservation from satellite missions, and using the historical baseline as a guide to content filtering of what documents to preserve. The Preservation System currently archives documentation content for High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and the 1960 's era Nimbus mission. Documentation from other missions like the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) are also slated to be added to this repository, as well as the other mission datasets to be preserved at the GES DISC...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} how documentation analysis with a neo-documentalist lens can help us explore variations (and stabilities) in conceptions and materialities of documents, as intertwined with disciplinary and sub-disciplinary practices of informing and knowing. Drawing on documentation theory, and with previous research on archaeological documentation as a background, by means of autoethnographic vignettes we explore contemporary conceptions <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> in five areas in or related to archaeology (Intra-site 3 D documentation, Development-led archaeology, Aggregating documentation for use outside the organization, Mediating documentation – or documentation mediation, and Documenting and displaying archaeology in a changing environment). Digitization, and how digitization has spurred renegotiations of what counts as documentation, functions as a common denominator discussed in all of the vignettes. The analysis highlights simultaneously ongoing renegotiations <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> serving each area’s unique epistemic purposes, and pushing document materialities in different directions. This operationalization <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> analysis creates an understanding for intra-disciplinary variations in documentation but is importantly also a practical tool to uncover documentation-related premises of disciplinary knowledge-making. This tool can be applied for example in processes of information policy development (regulating what purposes documentation should serve, and what it should be like), information systems design (e. g. for creation and communication <b>of</b> <b>documentation),</b> and infrastructure development (e. g. for <b>preservation</b> and accessibility <b>of</b> <b>documentation).</b> ARKDIS Arkeologisk information i det digitala samhälle...|$|R
