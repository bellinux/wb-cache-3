25|$|Judges {{must be able}} to {{research}} and process extensive lengths of documents and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time; {{by the nature of the}} job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity. Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum, and federal judges earn $205,100-$263,300 per annum.|$|E

He ended each letter with the words [...] "They paid a great sacrifice", which was later used as the title of a book published in 2010 that details the wartime service records of men from Cork. [...] Much of his time was spent answering letters from families in Ireland concerned about the wellbeing of their sons and husbands. [...] At times the task almost overwhelmed him and this is evident in his personal diary when he wrote, in June 1915, [...] "I got 12 letters today; just after reading them.

2500|$|When first {{presented}} with the Monty Hall problem, {{an overwhelming majority of}} people assume that each door has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter (Mueser and Granberg, 1999).

2500|$|William Matthew Scott {{was born}} at 128 Camp Road (now Oatland Lane) in Little London, Leeds, Yorkshire on 30 September 1893. Camp Road was {{demolished}} in the 1960s. His place of birth was next to the poor Jewish immigrant area of tailors and shoemakers, called the Leylands, in the All Souls district of Leeds. At least until 1911 Scott lived in the working-class areas of Little London and Woodhouse, next to Meanwood Beck. The area {{has a history of}} poverty, and within living memory were the Woodhouse cholera epidemic of the 1840s, and the typhoid epidemic in nearby Headingley of 1889. When Scott was born, the middens and ashpits which had nurtured the diseases were being replaced by communal water closets. That meant that inhabitants of the back-to-backs had to walk {{to the end of the}} row to use the lavatory or empty a chamber pot but they would not catch cholera; communal outside lavatories and cobbled streets with washing lines overhead persisted while Scott lived there. However it should be remembered that street communities were strong, public transport was efficient and good quality education and libraries were available for working <b>people.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> addresses at which Scott lived in his youth were demolished in the early 1960s slum clearances to make way for new council estates, but it should be remembered that many of these buildings were known to be repairable, so that [...] "slum" [...] was often a misnomer.|$|E

6000|$|There is a base {{democracy}} just {{as there}} is a base aristocracy, the swaggering, aggressive disposition of the vulgar soul that admits neither of superiors nor leaders. Its true name is insubordination. It resents rules and refinements, delicacies, differences and organization. It dreams that its leaders are its delegates. It takes refuge from all superiority, all special knowledge, in a phantom ideal, the People, the sublime and wonderful People. [...] "You can fool some of the <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, and all the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time," [...] expresses I think quite the quintessence of this mystical faith, this faith in which men take refuge from the demand for order, discipline and conscious light. In England it has never been of any great account, but in America the vulgar individualist's self-protective exaltation of an idealized Common Man has worked and is working infinite mischief.|$|E
