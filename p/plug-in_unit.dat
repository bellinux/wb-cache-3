40|$|The authors propose {{solutions}} for constructing mechanical structures for electronic equipment {{in terms of}} <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and subracks, allowing to increase the layout characteristics of electronic modules, sections and desktop devices and increase their functional capacity without changing the architecture of standard mechanical structures. The paper shows effectiveness of the developed solutions. There {{is a problem of}} restraining of mass redundancy of mechanical structures for electronic equipment in relation to the weight of the electronic components. On the other hand, the weight is an indicator of structural strength, providing of which is not less important problem. These problems can be solved in different ways, the main of which are the following: a) development of new mechanical structures for electronic equipment taking into account the development of the electronic components; b) improving layout characteristics of mechanical structures for electronic equipment without significant changes in their architecture. The aim {{of the study was to}} research mechanical structures of the first level (<b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and modules of the second level) of subracks to improve layout characteristics, and to develop methods for the use of connections for surface mounting and for the use of printed circuit boards of smaller dimensions without changing the architecture of the mechanical structures in order to improve layout characteristics. The research allowed the authors to develop the following solutions: 1. The design of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> in which instead of one printed circuit board (PCB) may be two, three or more PCBs of smaller dimensions to compensate a decrease in PCB fill factor in time and to increase the functional capacity of electronic modules. 2. Construction of block designs with a bilateral arrangement of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and the organization of the electrical connections by way of backplanes with electrical connectors for surface mounting, which allows performing independent installation of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> on both sides of the backplane and creates conditions for increasing the number of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units.</b> The proposed solutions do not lead to a change in the architecture of standard mechanical structures for electronic equipment or any performance degradation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work is {{a result}} of studies done at Saab Surveillance, with the {{objective}} to evaluate cooling technologies and find out which of them that are or are not suited to be implemented on a generic house and plug-in units, meeting the higher thermal demands of the future. This task includes five products, all with their own pros and cons created by Thermacore, a company of advanced cooling technologies with its European head office located in Ashington, England. First up was to realize under which circumstances these products were supposed to operate. This included application areas like land, sea and air which all have different grades of requirements set for today’s generic houses and plug-in units. To find the answers for these factors a trip to England and Thermacore was made and together with their engineers, hypothetical thermal simulations could be developed but also gather a wide understanding of each technology´s possibilities and limits. When all the information was assembled an extended evaluation process could be completed. The result showed that the superior cooling technology differed depending on mainly two things. The first one was taken in regard of which application area it was supposed to operate in but also where it is being implemented either in a generic house or on a <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit.</b> In conclusion of this report it showed that for the <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit</b> the recommended technology for land and sea units was to be a heat pipe assembly. The construction contains four flattened heat pipes encapsulated in an aluminum plate. Regarding air applications and foremost the fighter jets, the most suited technology was the k-Core. It will endure the exposure of both high vibrations and shocks but above all in an effective way cool the system. For the generic houses and those operating on land and sea it would once again be a heat pipe assembly that is the optimal solution, though those working in air applications the loop heat pipe is the better fit. These results will be discussed and visualized in the report...|$|E
40|$|At the Fermilab A 0 photoinjector facility, bunch-length {{measurements}} of the laser micropulse and the e-beam micropulse {{have been done in}} the past with a fast single-sweep module of the Hamamatsu C 5680 streak camera with an intrinsic shot-to-shot trigger jitter of 10 - 20 ps. We have upgraded the camera system with the synchroscan module tuned to 81. 25 MHz to provide synchronous summing capability with less than 1. 5 ps FWHM trigger jitter and a phase-locked delay box to provide phase stability of ~ 1 ps over 10 s of minutes. These steps allowed us to measure both the UV laser pulse train at 263 nm and the e-beam via optical transition radiation (OTR). Due to the low electron beam energies and OTR signals, we typically summed over 50 micropulses with 0. 25 - 1 nC per micropulse. The phase-locked delay box allowed us to assess chromatic temporal effects and instigated another upgrade to an all-mirror input optics barrel. In addition, we added a slow sweep horizontal deflection <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit</b> to provide dual-sweep capability for the streak camera. We report on a series of measurements made during the commissioning of these upgrades including bunch-length and phase effects using the emittance exchange beamline and simultaneous imaging of a UV drive laser component, OTR, and the 800 nm diagnostics laser.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: a) to obtain and evaluate equipment for bio-acoustical analysis for this work and for future work {{in the analysis of}} insect sounds, b) to study the acoustical and sexual behavior of Acheta domesticus L., and c) to determine methods for analyzing the changes effected by Dieldrin, Parathion, and Sevin. Various instruments were evaluated for use as analytic equipment. An Ampex PR- 10 tape recorder, a dynamic F- 91 Sony microphone, a Tektronix 547 oscilloscope with a dual beam type lAl <b>Plug-in</b> <b>Unit,</b> and a Fairchild 751 -A oscilloscope camera were among the equipment evaluated and found to be satisfactory. The acoustical and sexual behavior of A. domesticus were investigated and found to be closely correlated. A. domesticus has a song repertoire consisting of calling, pre-courtship, courtship, and aggressive sounds. In addition, there is a "threat" sound produced by a male courting an unresponsive female. This sound may be the same as the aggressive sounds produced when a courting male is interrupted by another male. The spermatophore is produced prior to or during the eliciting of the calling song. If the male succeeds in attracting a responsive female, a complex set of behavior patterns ensue, in which the male maneuvers the female into position for attachment of the spermatophore. During this time the male may elicit either the pre-courtship or courtship songs. Once the spermatophore has been accepted by the female, the male displays a watching behavior to prevent detachment of the spermatophore before it has emptied. Noticeable changes in the acoustical and sexual behavior occur when male crickets are treated with pesticides. Treatment with sublethal doses of Dieldrin and Sevin result in an increase in pulse rate, chirp rate, the number of pulses per chirp, and the frequency range in the calling song. Treatment of crickets with Parathion has the effect of disrupting the rhythm pattern of the calling and courtship songs, and increasing the range of frequencies elicited in the chirps of the calling songs. In addition, Parathion has the effect of inhibiting certain phases of the copulatory behavior. There appears to be a conflict of copulatory and post-copulatory behavior patterns...|$|E
