5|$|Another {{encounter}} {{connected to}} the narrative that was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After Angle lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, Angle assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended a casualty of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent. On the October30 episode of Impact!, a contest between Angle and Abyss ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning <b>Point.</b> <b>Angle</b> won the bout at the show.|$|E

25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press.

This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{emission}} {{measurements of}} the earth's stratospheric limb from space platforms require an accurate knowledge of the observation angles for retrieval of temperature and constituent distributions. Without the use of expensive stabilizing systems, however, most observational instruments {{do not meet the}} required pointing accuracies, thus leading to large errors in the retrieval of atmospheric data. This paper describes a self-constituent method of correcting errors in <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> by using information contained in the observed spectrum.

Vergara's use of the technique was not exclusive; indeed, Vergara made other pictures, including of residents and smaller details. [...] Beginning with The New American Ghetto, Vergara increasingly interwove these photographs, along with quotes from outside writers, fragments of comments by citizen-dwellers in the cityscapes he developed, and his own writing.

[...] The exhibit was shown later in 1999 at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. [...] "The New American Ghetto," [...] an earlier exhibition, opened at the National Building Museum and was later shown at The Municipal Arts Society in New York City. [...] After the publication of his second major work, American Ruins, Vergara's reputation was fully established; he won a MacArthur Foundation [...] "genius grant" [...] in 2002 and served as a fellow at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities (MARCH) at Rutgers University in 2003–2004.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} normally rely on GPS {{to provide}} pose information for navigation. In this work, we examine stereo visual odometry (SVO) {{as an alternative}} pose estimation method for situations in which GPS in unavailable. SVO is an incremental procedure that determines ego-motion by identifying and tracking visual landmarks in the environment, using cameras mounted on-board the vehicle. We present experiments demonstrating how SVO performance varies with camera <b>pointing</b> <b>angle,</b> for a robotic helicopter platform. Our results show that an oblique camera <b>pointing</b> <b>angle</b> produces better motion estimates than a nadir view angle, and that reliable navigation over distances of more than 200 meters is possible using visual information alone...|$|R

The intensive mode clean vs. clutter AGC calibration problem is analytically resolved. The use clutter AGC data in the intensive mode is confirmed as the correct calibration set for the sigma computations...|$|R

The geographical coordinates of the tangential points of the solar illumination boundaries were also calculated.

50|$|In general, {{a pointed}} {{projectile}} {{will have a}} better drag coefficient (Cd) or ballistic coefficient (BC) than a round nosed bullet, and a round nosed bullet {{will have a better}} Cd or BC than a flat point bullet. Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower <b>point</b> <b>angle,</b> will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. Hollow point bullets behave much like a flat point of the same point diameter. Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a boat tail, which reduces air resistance in flight. Cannelures, which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.|$|E
50|$|The tire {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims.

The load wheel advances to contact the tire and apply the set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates the tire to the test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by the tire. The force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract the measurement parameters. Tires are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high <b>point</b> <b>angle,</b> side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|E

The measured pointing deviations are determined to be well within the pointing requirements of the NASA Laser Communications Transceiver (LCT) program. A computer-controlled Mach-Zehnder phase-shifter interferometer is used to characterize the wavefront quality of the laser.

A constant incremental <b>pointing</b> <b>angle</b> is ruled out {{and a set of}} three <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> for different sub-areas of scan are defined. A two-dimensional smoothing algorithm is described for estimating slopes.

5000|$|A {{more general}} {{statement}} {{would be to}} say it will exactly fit four constraints. Each constraint can be a <b>point,</b> <b>angle,</b> or curvature (which is the reciprocal of the radius of an osculating circle). Angle and curvature constraints are most often added {{to the ends of}} a curve, and in such cases are called end conditions. Identical end conditions are frequently used to ensure a smooth transition between polynomial curves contained within a single spline. Higher-order constraints, such as [...] "the change in the rate of curvature", could also be added. This, for example, would be useful in highway cloverleaf design to understand the rate of change of the forces applied to a car (see jerk), as it follows the cloverleaf, and to set reasonable speed limits, accordingly.|$|E

He suggested carrying locking knives in checked luggage on airplanes, and on your person in trains and subways since they could be confiscated if found in a bag.
