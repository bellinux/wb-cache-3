Microbial deterioration of sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> stored in three different storage structures was studied. The sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> initially cured for 7 and 14 days were stored in traditional, pit, and clamp stor-age structures for a maximum of 28 days. For the 7 days-cured sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots,</b> the bac-teria population in the three different storage structures increased by 1. 2 - 2. 3 log cfu/g where-as for the 14 days-cured roots, the bacteria population was 0. 1 - 1. 0 log cfu/g within 28 days of storage. The fungal population in the 14 days-cured sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> was {{higher than in the}} 7 days-cured sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> by 0. 6 - 1. 6 log cfu/g for 28 days of storage. For both the 7 and 14 days-cured sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots,</b> the sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> stored for 28 days in the three different storage structures had a higher microbial count compared to the sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> stored for 14 days. Aspergillus flavus was the most dominant fungal species occurring in all of the three different storage structures fol-lowed by A. niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Tricho-derma viride, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium digitatum, Cladosporium herbarum, and Aspergillus ochraceus, in that order...|$|R

40|$|Previously we {{have shown}} that flagella and the O-specific {{polysaccharide}} of lipopolysaccharide {{play a role in}} colonization of the <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> by plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas strains WCS 374 and WCS 358. In this paper, we describe a novel cell surface-exposed structure in Pseudomonas putida WCS 358 examined with a specific monoclonal antibody. This cell surface structure appeared to be a polysaccharide, which was accessible to the monoclonal antibody at the outer cell surface. Further study revealed that it does not contain 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate, heptose, or lipid A, indicating {{that it is not a}} second type of lipopolysaccharide. Instead, the polysaccharide shared some characteristics with K antigen described for Escherichia coli. From a series of 49 different soil bacteria tested, only one other potato plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas strain reacted positively with the monoclonal antibody. Mutant cells lacking the novel antigen were efficiently isolated by an enrichment method involving magnetic antibodies. Mutant strains defective in the novel antigen contained normal lipopolysaccharide. One of these mutants was affected in neither its ability to adhere to sterile <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> pieces nor its ability to colonize <b>potato</b> <b>roots.</b> We conclude that the bacterial cell surface of P. putida WCS 358 contains at least two different polysaccharide structures. These are the O-specific polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide, which is relevant for <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> colonization, and the novel polysaccharide, which is not involved in adhesion to or colonization of the <b>potato</b> <b>root...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{symbiosis}} between plant {{roots and}} arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi {{has been shown}} to affect both the diversity and productivity of agricultural communities. In this study, we characterized the AM fungal communities of Solanum tuberosum L. (<b>potato)</b> <b>roots</b> and of the bulk soil in two nearby areas of northern Italy, in order to verify if land use practices had selected any particular AM fungus with specificity to potato plants. The AM fungal large-subunit (LSU) rRNA genes were subjected to nested PCR, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. One hundred eighty-three LSU rRNA sequences were analyzed, and eight monophyletic ribotypes, belonging to Glomus groups A and B, were identified. AM fungal communities differed between bulk soil and <b>potato</b> <b>roots,</b> as one AM fungal ribotype, corresponding to Glomus intraradices, was much more frequent in <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> than in soils (accounting for more than 90 % of sequences from potato samples and less than 10 % of sequences from soil samples). A semiquantitative heminested PCR with specific primers was used to confirm and quantify the AM fungal abundance observed by cloning. Overall results concerning the biodiversity of AM fungal communities in roots and in bulk soils from the two studied areas suggested that <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> were preferentially colonized by one AM fungal species, G. intraradices...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that living and heat-killed cells of the rhizobacterium Rhizobium etli strain G 12 induce in <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> {{systemic}} resistance to infection by the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida. To better understand the mechanisms of induced resistance, we focused on identifying the inducing agent. Since heat-stable bacterial surface carbohydrates such as exopolysaccharides (EPS) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are essential for recognition in the symbiotic interaction between Rhizobium and legumes, their role in the R. etli-potato interaction was studied. EPS and LPS were extracted from bacterial cultures, applied to <b>potato</b> <b>roots,</b> and tested for activity as an inducer of plant resistance to the plant-parasitic nematode. Whereas EPS did not affect G. pallida infection, LPS reduced nematode infection significantly in concentrations as low as 1 and 0. 1 mg ml− 1. Split-root experiments, guaranteeing a spatial separation of inducing agent and challenging pathogen, showed that soil treatments of one half of the root system with LPS resulted in a highly significant (up to 37 %) systemic induced reduction of G. pallida infection of <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> in the other half. The results clearly showed that LPS of R. etli G 12 act as the inducing agent of systemic resistance in <b>potato</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R
40|$|Post-translational {{regulation}} {{plays an}} important role in cellular metabolism. Earlier studies showed that the activity of plastidial starch phosphorylase (Pho 1) may be regulated by proteolytic modification. During the purification of Pho 1 from sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots,</b> we observed an unknown high molecular weight complex (HX) showing Pho 1 activity. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and reverse immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HX is composed of Pho 1 and the 20 S proteasome. Incubating sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> at 45 °C triggers a stepwise degradation of Pho 1; however, the degradation process can be partially inhibited by specific proteasome inhibitor MG 132. The proteolytically modified Pho 1 displays a lower binding affinity toward glucose 1 -phosphate and a reduced starch-synthesizing activity. This study suggests that the 20 S proteasome interacts with Pho 1 and is involved in the regulation of the catalytic activity of Pho 1 in sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> under heat stress conditions...|$|R

40|$|Extracting of a {{root system}} from the soil without losses is the main {{difficulty}} in investigations of the <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> system. In the years 1992 - 1998 at The Potato Research Institute, Jadwisin (Poland) an original method for <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> system investigation was developed. A special pot (40 cm in diameter, 100 cm high) made of zinc coated steel sheet 0, 8 mm was constructed. This device may be opened lengthwise to obtain the whole intact <b>root</b> system of <b>potato</b> plant. Soil profile in the pot is formed in 10 horizontal layers separated by circles made of plastic mesh which enable distinguishing of roots related to certain soil horizons.

40|$|Bacteriophage-resistant mutant {{strains of}} the root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains WCS 358 and WCS 374 lack the O-antigenic side chain of the {{lipopolysaccharide}}, as was shown {{by the loss of}} the typical lipopolysaccharide ladder pattern after analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These strains differed from their parent strains in cell surface hydrophobicity and in cell surface charge. The observed variation in these physicochemical characteristics could be explained by the differences in sugar composition. The mutant strains had no altered properties of adherence to sterile <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> compared with their parental strains, nor were differences observed in the firm adhesion to hydrophilic, lipophilic, negatively charged, or positively charged artificial surfaces. These results show that neither physicochemical cell surface properties nor the presence of the O-antigenic side chain {{plays a major role in}} the firm adhesion of these bacterial cells to solid surfaces, including <b>potato</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} [L-lactate: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 27] {{was isolated}} from sweet <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> tissues. Two {{species of the}} enzyme (isozymes I and II) were separated by DE- 52 cellulose column chromatography from healthy, cut, and black-rot diseased tissues. Isozymes I and II were purified from healthy and diseased tissues, respectively. Reduction of pyruvate by NADH with either isozyme I or II was inhibited by pyruvate at high concentrations, by NAD + and by several mononucleotides. Isozyme I was inhibited by a lower concentration of adenine nucleotide than isozyme n, and Km for pyruvate was increased markedly at acidic pH {{in the case of}} isozyme I, but only slightly in the case of isozyme n. The molecular weights of both isozymes were determined to be 150, 000 and they were found to be charge isomers by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity increased in response to infection by black-rot fungus but decreased in response to cutting. Many papers on NAD-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from animals, fungi, and bacteria have been published. In contrast, few studies have appeared (i) on plant LDH, because alcohol is the main product of plants under anaerobic conditions. The nature of LDH isozymes and the role of each iso-zyme in carbohydrate metabolism have been studied only in animal tissues (2, 3).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} frequency on soil water distribution, <b>potato</b> <b>root</b> distribution, <b>potato</b> tuber yield and water use efficiency was studied in 2001 and 2002 field experiments. Treatments consisted of six different drip irrigation frequencies: N 1 (once every day), N 2 (once every 2 days), N 3 (once every 3 days), N 4 (once every 4 days), N 6 (once every 6 days) and N 8 (once every 8 days), with total drip irrigation water equal {{for the different}} frequencies. The results indicated that drip irrigation frequency did affect soil water distribution, depending on potato growing stage, soil depth and distance from the emitter. Under treatment N 1, soil matric potential (ψ m) Variations at depths of 70 and 90 cm showed a larger wetted soil range than was initially expected. <b>Potato</b> <b>root</b> growth was also affected by drip irrigation frequency to some extent: the higher the frequency, the higher was the root length density (RLD) in 0 - 60 cm soil layer and the lower was the root length density (RWD) in 0 - 10 cm soil layer. On the other hand, <b>potato</b> <b>roots</b> were not limited in wetted soil volume even when the crop was irrigated at the highest frequency. High frequency irrigation enhanced potato tuber growth and water use efficiency (WUE). Reducing irrigation frequency from N 1 to N 8 resulted in significant yield reductions by 33. 4 and 29. 1 % in 2001 and 2002, respectively.

40|$|The {{increase}} in o-diphenol oxidase activity and polyphenol con-tent {{was investigated in}} slices excised from sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roots.</b> o-Diphenol oxidase activity increased in a sigmoidal fashion over a 100 hour period. The {{increase in}} polyphenols occurred over a shorter {{period of time and}} was evident before an increase in o-diphenol oxidase activity could be detected. Thus, it seemed that the increase in polyphenol content might be involved in the enhancement of o-diphenol oxidase activity. However, the above correlation was not found in different kinds of experiment including pretreatment with either vacuum infiltration or wet conditioning. It has been observed by many researchers that the activity of o-diphenol oxidase (polyphenol oxidase) [EC 1. 10. 3. 1 o-quinol: 02 oxidoreductase] in-creases in the tissue of many plants following cutting or infection by pathogens (1).
