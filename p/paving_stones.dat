40|$|A {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in Concrete and Construction Laboratory of Petra Christian University in Surabaya. The purpose of this research is to obtain information about the effect of <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> type (fly ash/cement ratio) and curing period on <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> strength using two Factorial Design Analysis. From the research, paving block type 0 (0 % fly ash and 100 % cement) gives the highest mean strength, 377. 93 kg/cm 2 after 90 days of curing. The lowest mean strength, 155. 05 kg/cm 2 given by paving block type 3 (30 % fly ash and 70 % cement), after 28 days of curing. Two factor design analysis gives result that <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> type gives greater effect to compressive strength than curing period and there is no significant interaction between <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> type and curing period...|$|R
5|$|The {{galvanization}} of Mogadishu's {{real estate}} sector {{was in part}} facilitated by {{the establishment of a}} local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent. With 50 construction trucks and machines imported from Turkey, the yard produces concrete, asphalt and <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> for building projects. The Istanbul Municipality was also scheduled to bring in 100 specialists to accelerate the construction initiative, which ultimately aims to modernize the capital's infrastructure and serve it over the long-term.|$|E
5|$|The {{men were}} met with jeers by a crowd of 2,000 to 4,000. This {{escalated}} into <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> thrown {{through the door and}} windows of the building. Soldiers who subsequently arrived were beaten and driven away. Additional police were sent for in hopes of clearing the way and relieving the troops of the need to use force against the crowd, but those who arrived were unable to effect any order, and were forced to shelter in the armory along with the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{industrialization}} in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force expanded in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded the ridges. Traprock and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> and architectural brownstone, either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.|$|E

First a small layer of coarse concrete, the rudus, then a little layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or statumen. Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square <b>paving</b> <b>stones,</b> called the summa crusta. The crusta was crowned for drainage.|$|E

Men endeavoured to raise barricades of three to four feet in height using the <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> of the Saint-Gabriel and Notre-Dame streets. The authorities were informed {{of what was going on}} and a detachment of the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fusiliers) was sent to undo the work before the barricades could be armed. Some of the men who ran off when the army showed up regrouped and decided to attack the houses of Lafontaine and the boarding house where Baldwin was residing.|$|E
25|$|Granite {{from the}} Wicklow Mountains {{has been used}} as a {{material}} for many buildings in Wicklow and Dublin and beyond.

Similarly, quarries at Glencullen provided stone for such buildings as the G. P. O. on O'Connell Street and the Industry and Commerce building on Kildare Street in Dublin.

25|$|The Graphic Novel Gilmore By the Sea by Ed Cameron {{describes}} 1980s Nye Beach as a {{rough and}} tumble neighborhood. But by the twenty-first century, Nye Beach {{was on its way}} to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar Archway Place with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of Cozy Corner Confectionery (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.|$|E
25|$|When {{the police}} left without their prisoners, the {{fighting}} {{stopped for a}} few moments. The truce lasted only {{an hour or two}} as fighting resumed near The Tombs, supposedly brought about by a group of women from the Five Points who had provoked the Dead Rabbits into attacking the Bowery gangs. Bringing reinforcements, the participants were estimated at between 800 and 1000, armed with bludgeons, <b>paving</b> <b>stones,</b> brick bats, axes, pitchforks, and other weapons. Several hundred other criminals also arrived in the area, mostly burglars and thieves, who were not affiliated with either side and simply took the opportunity for looting. Residents and store owners all along the Bowery were forced to barricade their buildings and protect themselves with pistols and muskets.|$|E
25|$|A few {{remains of}} the Middlebere Plateway are still visible. The quay at Middlebere Creek has {{gradually}} fallen into disrepair and almost vanished. Some of the stone sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed, whilst others have been reused as <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> at various locations. Others {{can be found in}} the walls at Middlebere farm. In many places the route across Hartland moor can be traced. The tunnel under the Wareham to Corfe road is now used by a stream draining the former clay working and is a listed building, although the north portal was buried when the road was realigned in the 1980s. The iron bridge over the main line railway, first built for the plateway and then used by Fayle's Tramway, still stands.|$|E
