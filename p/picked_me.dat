500|$|In 1966, Dylan told Ralph Gleason: Rolling Stone's {{the best}} song I wrote." [...] In 2004, {{speaking}} to Robert Hilburn, Dylan still {{felt that the}} song had {{a special place in}} his work: [...] "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that, it gives you the song and it goes away. You don't know what it means. Except that the ghost <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> to write the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the two sellout concerts, all the {{participants}} attended a celebratory party in a basement club known as Ungano's. Dylan was so elated, Harrison recalled 16 years later, [...] "He <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> up and hugged me and he said, 'God! If only we'd done three shows!'" [...] Like Harrison, the experience of playing at Madison Square that day {{did not lead to}} Dylan immediately re-embracing the concert stage; only a brief guest appearance with the Band on New Year's Eve 1971–72 and sitting in during a John Prine club gig eventuated before he returned to touring in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his dissatisfaction, Dylan wrote 20 pages of verse he later described as a [...] "long piece of vomit". He reduced this to a song with four verses and a chorus—"Like a Rolling Stone". He told Hentoff that writing and recording the song washed away his dissatisfaction, and restored his enthusiasm for creating music. Describing the experience to Robert Hilburn in 2004, nearly 40 years later, Dylan said: [...] "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that... You don't {{know what it means}} except the ghost <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> to write the song." ...|$|E

500|$|For its 1937 {{aerial survey}} program, the RAAF formed the Communications and Survey Flight under No.1 Aircraft Depot's Recruit Training Squadron at Laverton on 3May. [...] The flight {{was divided into}} Western and Eastern Air Detachments, the former under Hely. Flying a Tugan Gannet, Hely's first task became searching for survey {{director}} Sir Herbert Gepp, whose Rapide (A3-2, the same one Hely crash landed the previous year) had gone missing on an inspection flight in the Northern Territory between Tennant Creek and Tanimi. Hely located the downed Rapide on 23May, guiding in a ground party that was able to clear a makeshift runway and allow Gepp and his team to take off and resume their journey. On 25September, Hely was again diverted from survey work {{to search for a}} lost plane, this time the de Havilland Gipsy Moth of flying doctor Clyde Fenton, who had gone missing north-east of Newcastle Waters. Hely, once more piloting Rapide A3-2, found the Moth three days later and landed to rescue the lost doctor. Fenton was subsequently quoted as saying [...] "I have only the highest praise for the efficient manner in which Hely conducted a difficult search and the skilful way in which he located me and <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> up". [...] The rescue efforts made Hely one of the RAAF's best-known public figures. Completing his posting to the survey flight, he served as adjutant at Laverton in 1938. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 9June for [...] "zeal and initiative in searching for Sir Herbert Gepp's party and later for Dr. Fenton when lost in Central Australia". On 29November 1938, he married secretary Jean McDonald at St Aidan's Anglican Church in Launceston, Tasmania; the couple would have two daughters. [...] Hely spent the following year in Britain, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and was promoted to squadron leader in September.|$|E
2500|$|Hauserman {{was also}} a {{contestant}} on the second season of VH1's Rock of Love with Bret Michaels. Megan said that she discovered the show from an advertisement on Craigslist: [...] "I had just seen an ad on Craigslist and I went to an open call in Chicago {{at a restaurant in}} which the casting people were traveling {{all over the country and}} accepting videos from all over the world. And they <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> out of thousands of applicants." [...] She appeared on eleven of the fourteen episodes in the second season. Megan was eliminated in the ninth episode because Michaels never felt a real [...] "connection" [...] with her, leaving her in fifth place.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I think this will be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know I can get the gold medal. [...] That's what they <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> to be on the team for, so I need to be confident about that." ...|$|E
