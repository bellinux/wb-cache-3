5000|$|With 100BASE-TX hardware, the raw bits (4 bits wide clocked at 25 MHz at the MII) {{go through}} 4B5B binary {{encoding}} {{to generate a}} series of 0 and 1 symbols clocked at 125 MHz symbol rate. The 4B5B encoding provides DC equalization and spectrum shaping (see the standard for details).

By {{using the}} dynamic {{reconfigurable}} transceiver in {{high speed interface}} design, designer can solve critical technology problems such as ensuring signal integrity conveniently, with lower error binary rate. In this paper, we designed a high speed XAUI (10 Gbps Ethernet Attachment Unit Interface) to transparently extend the physical reach of the XGMII. The following points are focused: (1) IP (Intellectual Property) core usage. Altera Co. offers two transceiver IP cores in Quartus II MegaWizard Plug-In Manager for XAUI design which is featured of dynamic reconfiguration performance, that is, ALTGX_RECONFIG instance and ALTGX instance, we can get various groups by changing settings of the devices without power off. These two blocks can accomplish function of PCS (Physical Coding Sub-layer) and PMA (<b>Physical</b> <b>Medium</b> <b>Attachment),</b> however, with higher efficiency and reliability. (2) 1 + 1 protection. In our design, two ALTGX IP cores are {{used to work in}} parallel, which named XAUI 0 and XAUI 1. The former works as the main channel while the latter redundant channel. When XAUI 0 is out of service for some reasons, XAUI 1 will start to work to keep the business. (3) RTL (Register Transfer Level) coding with Verilog HDL and simulation.

40|$|Abstract—Secure data {{deletion}} {{is the task}} of deleting data ir-recoverably from a <b>physical</b> <b>medium.</b> In the digital world, data is not securely deleted by default; instead, many approaches add secure deletion to existing <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> interfaces. Interfaces to the <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> exist at different layers, such as user-level applications, the file system, the device driver, etc. Depending on which interface is used, the properties of an approach can differ significantly. In this paper, we survey the related work in detail and organize existing approaches {{in terms of their}} interfaces to physical media. We further present a taxonomy of adversaries differing in their capabilities as well as a systematization for the characteristics of secure deletion approaches. Characteristics include environmental assumptions, such as how the interface’s use affects the <b>physical</b> <b>medium,</b> as well as behavioural prop-erties of the approach such as the deletion latency and physical wear. We perform experiments to test a selection of approaches on a variety of file systems and analyze the assumptions made in practice.
