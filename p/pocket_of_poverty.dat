This area of poverty would spread {{in part due to}} an illegal practice known as blockbusting and to Robert Moses building several housing projects in the neighborhood. The poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as white flight, reaching a peak in the 1960s when the socioeconomic North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. At this time a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{heartland of}} the CGIAR’s renewed vision {{is to reduce}} poverty and food insecurity, {{particularly}} in the marginal environments that have largely been bypassed by previous research. The constraints of harsh environments and limited farm resources of the poor in many ways present a greater challenge than even the heroic achievements of the Green Revolution. But {{it is the most}} direct path to poverty reduction. The accomplishments of ICRISAT’s partnership-based chickpea research-fordevelopment thrust over the past quarter century constitute a strong validation of this bold new direction. Over 100 improved varieties have been released, including a new type of adaptation that has enabled the crop to extend its range far south of its historical zone; adding a second crop – where previously only one crop per year was grown – through varieties that mature on residual soil moisture alone; resistance to the fusarium wilt disease; integrated control options for botrytis gray mold disease; enhanced root mass for drought resistance; an understanding of resistance mechanisms against an intractable pest, the helicoverpa pod borer insect; and molecular marker and gene transformation techniques to significantly accelerate breeding progress in the coming years. All these scientific and development accomplishments have been underpinned by intensive partnerships that have built national capacities that will enhance payoffs for decades to come. Chickpea {{is by far the most}} important leguminous food grain, or pulse, in the diets of the peoples of South Asia. This is the world’s most concentrated <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> home to over half a billion desperately poor [...] ...|$|E
