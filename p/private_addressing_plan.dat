40|$|Most {{operating}} systems execute programs in <b>private</b> <b>address</b> spaces communicating through messages or files. The traditional <b>private</b> <b>address</b> space model {{was developed for}} 16 - and 32 -bit architectures, on which virtual addresses are a scarce resource. The recent appearance of architectures with flat 64 -bit virtual addressing opens an opportunity to reconsider our use of virtual address spaces. In this paper we argue for an alternative addressing model, in which all programs and data reside in a single global virtual address space shared by multiple protection domains. Hardware-based memory protection exists within the single address space, providing firewalls as strong as in conventional systems. We explore the tradeoffs {{in the use of}} a global virtual address space relative to the <b>private</b> <b>address</b> space model. We contend that a shared address space can eliminate obstacles to efficient sharing and exchange of data structures that are inherent in <b>private</b> <b>address</b> space systems.

50|$|It {{is common}} for packets {{originating}} in <b>private</b> <b>address</b> spaces to be misrouted onto the Internet. Private networks often do not properly configure DNS services for addresses used internally and attempt reverse DNS lookups for these addresses, causing extra traffic to the Internet root nameservers. The AS112 project attempted to mitigate this load by providing special blackhole anycast nameservers for <b>private</b> <b>address</b> ranges which only return negative result codes (not found) for these queries.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of NATs map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address. In a typical configuration, a local network uses {{one of the}} designated [...] "private" [...] IP address subnets (RFC 1918). A router on that network has a <b>private</b> <b>address</b> in that address space. The router is also connected to the Internet with a [...] "public" [...] address assigned by an Internet service provider. As traffic passes from the local network to the Internet, the source address in each packet is translated on the fly from a <b>private</b> <b>address</b> to the public address. The router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port). When a reply returns to the router, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine the <b>private</b> <b>address</b> on the internal network to which to forward the reply.|$|R

50|$|<b>Private</b> <b>addresses</b> {{are also}} {{commonly}} used in corporate networks, which for security reasons, are not connected directly to the Internet. Often a proxy, SOCKS gateway, or similar devices are used to provide restricted Internet access to network-internal users.|$|R

5000|$|A {{network address}} is an {{identifier}} for a node or network interface of a telecommunications network.
