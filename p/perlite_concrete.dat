40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an extensive study of two thermal energy storage (TES) systems. The goal of the research is to make solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity. A small-scale TES system was first built. The inner to outer layers were made of firebrick (FB), autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and reinforced concrete brick (CB). The experiments were conducted at temperatures of up to 1000 °C for sustained periods of time. AAC was found to be prone to cracking at temperatures exceeding 900 °C; as a result, AAC was eliminated from the second TES system. The second, larger-scale TES system was subsequently built of multiple layers of readily available materials, namely, insulating firebrick (IFB), <b>perlite</b> <b>concrete</b> (PC), expansion joint (EJ), and CB. All of the surfaces were instrumented with thermocouples to estimate the heat loss from the system. The temperature was maintained at approximately 800 °C to approximate steady state conditions closely. The steady state heat loss was determined to be approximately 4. 4 % for a day. The results indicate that high-temperature TES systems can be constructed of readily available materials while meeting the heat loss requirements for a falling particle receiver system, thereby contributing to reducing the overall cost of concentrating solar power systems...|$|E
40|$|Effect of shading, ventilation, and a {{combination}} of these for cooling honey bee, Apis mellifera L., hives during summer months were studied under field conditions at Tucson, Arizona. Mean brood nest temperatures during day hours, 0800 to 2000 hrs., were significantly lower in shaded and ventilated colonies than those of all other treatments. Neither shading alone nor ventilation alone had a significant effect on brood nest temperatures compared with control treatment. Nectar and pollen carrier proportions were significantly larger in shaded colonies than those of unshaded colonies at 1400 hrs. Ventilation had insignificant effect on nectar carrier proportions in both locations, whereas it significantly decreased and increased pollen carrier proportions in shaded and unshaded colonies, respectively. Mean volumes of nectar, however, were not significantly different from each other in all treatments. Proportions of water carriers and water volumes were significantly smaller in shaded colonies without significant difference between means of ventilation and no ventilation than those of unshaded colonies with ventilation had significantly smaller means. All treatments were not significantly different from each other regarding mean numbers of departing bees at 0900, 1100, and 1400 hrs and mean sealed brook areas. Mean colony weight of control colonies differed insignificantly from those of all other treatments. In another study, empty bee hives made of pine wood, <b>perlite</b> <b>concrete,</b> and sun-dried adobe and subjected to different combinations of shading and painting were tested to determine the effect of these materials thermal properties in cooling and heating the hives during summer and winter, respectively. The walls of the wooden hive were 1. 9 cm-thick while those of the other two hives were 5. 0 cm-thick. Under all treatment conditions, the areas under the curves for inside air temperatures of the wooden hive were larger than those of the other two hives for a 10 -hour period, from 0700 to 1700 hrs. The calculated "temperature areas" for the other two hives were very close to each other. Shading was more effective than white paint in reducing hive temperatures in summer. Hives painted black during winter had remarkably higher temperatures than white-painted hives...|$|E
40|$|The thermal conductivity, k, of low density {{concretes}} {{made from}} Portland cement and perlite has been measured near room temperature using an unguarded linear heat flow apparatus. <b>Perlite</b> based <b>concretes</b> having densities from 44. 3 lb/ft 3 to 66. 6 lb/ft 3 {{were found to}} have thermal conductivities from 1. 55 Btu?in/ft 2 ?h??F to 2. 89 Btu?in/ft 2 ?h??F. The measured k can be correlated against density and the results agree with previously published results. The thermal resistance, R-value, of concrete blocks made with low density concretes and having core regions filled with perlite powder is calculated to be in the range of 7 to 12 ft 2 ?h??F/Btu. The material, therefore, has potential for energy conservation applications. The compressive strength of concretes generally decreases with density and this is true for the perlite products. The very low density concretes had measured compressive strengths below 500 lb /in 2 and such material is unsuitable for many applications. Intermediate density products, however, have compressive strengths above 2000 lb /in 2. Applications for the <b>perlite</b> <b>concretes</b> will, therefore, have to compromise between load bearing capability and energy conservation objectives...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:expanded perlite; {{light-weight}} aggregate concrete; homogeneity Abstract. The {{segregation of}} lightweight aggregate {{is a big}} problem in research of lightweight aggregate concrete. This paper discusses the reason of segregation of expanded <b>perlite</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete,</b> the segregation problem of the lightweight concrete has been resolved successfully by adding fly ash, high performance admixture and expansive perlite prewetting treatment and other technical measures. The pores rate and the permeability rate tests were carried on comparatively between air entraining prewetted lightweight aggregate concrete and the ordinary concrete under the same condition. The results showed that the pores rate in air entraining prewetted lightweight aggregate concrete is 4. 6 times as much as in the ordinary concrete, while the permeability rate of the ordinary concrete is 1. 6 times and 2. 3 times as against this material in the vertical and horizontal direction respectively. The expanded <b>perlite</b> lightweight <b>concrete,</b> CL 5 -CL 10, was confect with good workability, homogeneity, no bleeding and segregation, easy casting and excavation...|$|R

Bending experiments revealed that lightweight concrete panels with a core of textile waste fiber have less density than water and high energy absorption and ductility. Furthermore, these composite panels by having appropriate thermal insulation characteristics could be used for partitioning in the buildings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a laboratory {{investigation of the}} resistance to freezing and thawing of Expanded <b>Perlite</b> Aggregate (EPA) <b>concrete,</b> {{compared with that of}} natural aggregate concrete. The effects of EPA ratios on High Strength Concrete (HSC) properties were studied for 28 days. EPA replacements of fine aggregate (0 – 2  mm) were used: 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. The properties examined included compressive strength, Ultrasound Pulse Velocity (UPV), porosity, microstructure and the Relative Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity (RDME) of HSC. Results showed that the compressive strength, UPV and RDME of samples were decreased with an increase in EPA ratios. Test results revealed that HSC was still durable after 100, 200 and 300 cycles of freezing and thawing in accordance with the ASTM C 666. After 300 cycles, reduction in compressive strength and RDME ranged from 7 % to 29 % and 5 % to 21 %, respectively. In this paper, feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) techniques were used to model the relative change in compressive strength and UPV in cyclic thermal loading. Genetic algorithms were applied in order to determine optimum mix proportions subjected to 300 thermal cycling. The best performance was obtained from HSC with about 10 % EPA...|$|R
