40|$|In {{order to}} clarify and {{understand}} hazards lurking in playground equipment, visualization of the hazard is effective way. Therefore, {{we developed a}} method to construct hazard maps of playground equipment, calculated from simulations, by using computer models of children falling on a <b>playground</b> <b>slide.</b> This method {{makes it possible to}} understand the hazards of playground equipment easily. Full-body multi-body models of children, based on Japanese data, were constructed. The hazard map of a <b>playground</b> <b>slide</b> was constructed to provide an example of possible hazard maps of playground equipment. Simulations of children falling on the <b>playground</b> <b>slide</b> were carried out by using both the multi-body models for children and the <b>playground</b> <b>slide</b> models, which were constructed from CAD data of an actual slide. The calculated head injury hazard values were mapped on the <b>playground</b> <b>slide</b> model so as to easily identify hazards. As the results, the maps made it possible to understand easily that the hazard varies greatly due to initial falling position on the spiral staircase and also children ages...|$|R

5000|$|There were 12 main {{slides in}} the park, and one small water {{playground}} that contains other small slides for children. The slides were all white in colour, {{except for the}} <b>playground</b> <b>slides.</b> While facing the park from the entrance, there was a left tower, a middle tower, and a right tower.|$|E
50|$|<b>Playground</b> <b>slides</b> are {{associated}} with several types of injury. The most obvious is that when a slide is not enclosed and is elevated above the playground surface, then users may fall off and incur bumps, bruises, sprains, broken bones, or traumatic head injuries. Some materials, such as metal, may become very hot during warm, sunny weather. Plastic slides can also be vulnerable to melting by arson.|$|E

50|$|The {{lower jaw}} often forms a huge arch in some species, {{sometimes}} extending above the rostrum in a shape comparable to a <b>playground</b> <b>slide.</b> Every species has large (sometimes tusk-like) teeth of variable size, shape, and position.

5000|$|<b>Playground</b> <b>slides</b> {{are found}} in parks, schools, playgrounds and backyards. The slide may be flat, or half {{cylindrical}} or tubular to prevent falls. Slides are usually constructed of plastic or metal {{and they have a}} smooth surface that is either straight or wavy. The user, typically a child, climbs {{to the top of the}} slide via a ladder or stairs and sits down on the top of the slide and slides down the chute.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one version}} called [...] "Hot Lava Monster", usually played on playgrounds, players must {{stay off the}} ground (sand, rubber, woodchips, etc.) and on the play equipment. The person who is posing as 'monster' {{can be on the}} 'lava' with the {{objective}} of attempting to tag another player. 'Monster' must try to tag or catch the other players. In some versions, 'monster' is not allowed to touch certain obstacles, such as wooden platforms or may only touch objects of a certain colour. The [...] "Monster" [...] player must navigate across structures such as across <b>playground</b> <b>slides,</b> Monkey bars, Ropes courses, etc. instead of the main platform.|$|E

5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life.

5000|$|Safety efforts {{sometimes}} paradoxically {{increase the}} likelihood and severity of injuries because of how people choose to use playground equipment. For example, older children may choose to climb {{on the outside of}} a [...] "safe" [...] but boring play structure, rather than using it the way the designers intended. Similarly, rather than letting young children play on <b>playground</b> <b>slides</b> by themselves, some injury-averse parents seat the children on the adult's lap and go down the slide together. [...] This seems safer at first glance, but if the child's shoe catches {{on the edge of the}} slide, this arrangement frequently results in the child's leg being broken. [...] If the child had been permitted to use the slide independently, then this injury would not happen, because when the shoe caught, the child would have stopped sliding rather than being propelled down the slide by the adult's weight.|$|E
5000|$|Inclined {{planes are}} widely used {{in the form of}} loading ramps to load and unload goods on trucks, ships, and planes. [...] Wheelchair ramps are used to allow people in wheelchairs to get over {{vertical}} obstacles without exceeding their strength. [...] Escalators and slanted conveyor belts are also forms of inclined plane. [...] In a funicular or cable railway a railroad car is pulled up a steep inclined plane using cables. Inclined planes also allow heavy fragile objects, including humans, to be safely lowered down a vertical distance by using the normal force of the plane to reduce the gravitational force. Aircraft evacuation slides allow people to rapidly and safely reach the ground from the height of a passenger airliner.Other inclined planes are built into permanent structures. Roads for vehicles and railroads have inclined planes in the form of gradual slopes, ramps, and causeways to allow vehicles to surmount vertical obstacles such as hills without losing traction on the road surface. [...] Similarly, pedestrian paths and sidewalks have gentle ramps to limit their slope, to ensure that pedestrians can keep traction. [...] Inclined planes are also used as entertainment for people to slide down in a controlled way, in <b>playground</b> <b>slides,</b> water slides, ski slopes and skateboard parks.|$|E
40|$|Friction is an {{important}} phenomenon in everyday life. All children are familiar with <b>playground</b> <b>slides,</b> which may thus be {{a good starting point}} for investigating friction. Motion on an inclined plane is a standard physics example. This paper presents an investigation of friction by a group of 11 -year olds. How did they plan their investigations? What aspects of friction could they discern? What {{understanding of the nature of}} science was revealed—and developed—during their investigation and subsequent discussion with the teacher...|$|E

Inside the massive sculpture were a 12-seat cinema theater, a milk bar inside a breast, a fish pond, and a brain built by Tinguely, with moving mechanical parts.

50|$|My Baby 3 & Friends is a 2010 Nintendo DS game {{developed}} by Dancing Dots {{and published by}} Majesco Entertainment. As a toddler, the player's son or daughter is exposed to activities like swimming, the swing set at the local playground, and even a <b>playground</b> <b>slide</b> for stimulation and development. Players are also expected to allow their babies to socialize with either another baby or with a puppy. The timeline of the baby's development starts the baby off at 15 months (1 year and three months) and ends it at 30 months (2 years and six months). Thirty new skills can be developed in a non-linear fashion; making the parenting aspects of the game {{more in tune with}} the child's actual development.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a two-story}} indoor <b>playground</b> with <b>slides,</b> rock {{climbing}} wall, gym equipment for children, and more.

In an interview with Tubefilter, Williams said of Fanboy Funhouse: “Shows like The Mighty Boosh and Pee-wee's Playhouse are a big inspiration for me. There’s no shortage of geek culture news on the internet, so {{my goal was to}} present it in a wild and unpredictable way -- with a cast of crazy characters.
