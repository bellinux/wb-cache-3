25|$|The {{solution}} was to mount the guns, still on their carriages, on rail cars to increase their strategic mobility. The gun's firing platform (Bettungslafette) {{was used as a}} model for the mount on the rail car. A metal ring was fixed to the surface of the car on which the wheels rested. At the center of this ring was a large <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> from which tension rods extended to the carriage's trail which rested against a circular section of rail. The gun was traversed by means of a gear that engaged pins on the outside of the rail. The trail rested on two spring-supported rollers, which would compress during firing and allow the shock of recoil to be transmitted to the floor of the car. To prevent damage to the trucks during firing cast-steel wedges were placed on the railroad ties under matching wedges on the car and the car was moved up on them. Some sources quote its maximum elevation as 47.5°, but Miller says that the sight on the gun itself was only calibrated to 45°. If more traverse was needed the gun's original firing platform was carried on a separate car and the gun could be dismounted to use it.|$|E
50|$|A center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> {{is bolted}} to the body bolster. The center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> runs down {{vertically}} {{through the center of}} the bogie bolster through the center pivot. It allows for rotation of the bogie when the coach is moving on the curves. A silent block, which is cylindrical metal rubber bonded structure, is placed in the central hole of the bogie bolster through which the center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> passes. It provides the cushioning effect.|$|E
50|$|A razor is well {{balanced}} if when {{opened it}} balances about its <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> {{indicating that the}} torques about the pivot point, caused by the corresponding weight distributions of the blade and the handle about the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> counterbalance each other. A well-balanced razor is both safer to handle when open and easier to shave with.|$|E
50|$|The {{expander}} system {{consists of}} patented {{products that are}} intended {{to take the place}} of conventional <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> in heavy machinery and equipment. Conventional <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called line boring. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.|$|R
5000|$|Tang: The base of {{the blade}} where the handles are {{attached}} with <b>pivot</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sandwich {{constructed}} balisong knives are {{assembled in}} layers that are generally pinned or screwed together though may sometimes use a ball-bearing system. They allow the <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> {{to be adjusted}} more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.|$|R
5000|$|Link joining <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> to lever (5) with pins {{to allow}} joint rotation.|$|E
50|$|The bogies {{consist of}} the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The {{transfer}} of pulling and braking power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> to the bogie. The pivot pins are mounted with a slight slant to enable {{the formation of a}} right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about 40 mm to the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced.|$|E
50|$|There were early {{reports of}} {{problems}} with the Steyr Scout rifle relating to breakage of the bipod <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> The affected part was subsequently redesigned to improve its strength. Some shooters complained that the bipod was too tall.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the <b>pivoting</b> <b>pins</b> and bushes, not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|R
40|$|Release {{mechanism}} ensures reliable {{separation of}} structural members while imparting minimal impulse to members. Includes {{set of three}} hooks and pistons holding toggle and thereby clamp plate to body of mechanism. In locked position, pistons down, and hooks held against toggle. In unlocked position, pistons up. Notches in pistons let hook swivel on <b>pivot</b> <b>pins.</b> Functions even when two of its three key elements fail...|$|R
50|$|The sweep {{itself was}} a long, tapered pole of about twenty-foot length. Six feet of the length at the small end {{projected}} across the <b>pivoting</b> <b>pin</b> onto the deck. The larger end lay out over the water. To the water end had been attached a broad wooden blade nearly ten feet long. To swing the heavy sweep and guide the cumbersome ark required the strength of two men {{at each of the}} sweep handles.|$|R
50|$|The current Opinel knife {{consists}} of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> (axle), and (except {{in the case of}} the smaller models) a stainless steel Virobloc locking collar, which locks the blade open or closed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a rolling}} block action the {{breechblock}} {{takes the form of}} a part-cylinder, with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> through its axis. The operator rotates or [...] "rolls" [...] the block to open and close the breech; it is a simple, rugged and reliable design. Rolling blocks are most often associated with firearms made by Remington in the later 19th century; in the Remington action the hammer serves to lock the breech closed at the moment of firing, and the block in turn prevents the hammer from falling with the breech open. An interesting variation of the rolling block was the Austrian M1867 Werndl-Holub, in which the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> was parallel to the barrel and the block rotated sideways.|$|E
50|$|A {{bogie bolster}} {{is the central}} section of the bogie that carries the entire weight of a coach's under frame. The bogie pivots around it using the center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> It couples to the bogie frame at each end using the {{secondary}} suspension system (typically coil springs and spring plank).|$|E
50|$|As {{all other}} types of the Einheitslokomotiven program, the class E 10 / class 110 had 2-axle pivoted bogies/trucks as welded box {{construction}} with <b>pivot</b> <b>pins,</b> and welded superstructure with fan grills. The class 110.3 used {{the body of the}} E 10.12 with the pulled-forward frontal area, also called the “crease” (Bügelfalte). The frame is propped up over the bogies by coil springs and rubber elements. Originally a bumpy ride at higher speeds was noticeable, which required repeated rework of the bogies. In two locomotives (110 475 and 476) a flexicoil suspension was tested.|$|R

50|$|The tow-ball {{is popular}} for lighter loads, readily {{allowing}} swivelling and articulation of a trailer. A tow pin and jaw with a trailer loop {{are often used}} for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> allows the same movements. A pintle and lunette is a very heavy duty hitching combination used in construction and the military.|$|E
50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|E
5000|$|This {{design was}} {{built around the}} Blackhawk, but it takes its styling cues from the Remington Model 1858 cap and ball pistol. This {{is due to the}} frame being longer in front to {{accommodate}} the loading lever and <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> Earlier models listed as [...]44 caliber, later as [...]45, but all use a [...]457” round balls or [...]454” conical bullets of pure lead.|$|E
50|$|To {{develop the}} {{components}} for the Eco2001, ABB Henschel used two Class 120 prototype locomotives, 120 004 and 005, {{which had been}} converted by ABB in 1992, {{in order to test}} new technologies in service. 120 005 received new electric power converters based on GTO-Thyristors, as well as new on-board electronics. 120 004 additionally received flexi-float bogies adapted from ICE units with driving rods instead of <b>pivot</b> <b>pins,</b> disc brakes, and utilising a new biodegradable polyol-ester cooling agent for its main transformer. Both of these reconfigured locomotives covered large distances in regular IC service without disruption.|$|R
25|$|The fence was not {{continuous}} {{and could be}} crossed {{at a number of}} points other than the official border crossings. Gates were installed to enable border guards to patrol up to the border line and to give engineers maintenance access to the outward-facing side of the barrier. Like the fence itself, the gates were designed to be escape-proof. They were hinged from the outside but opened inwards and the <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> were welded to prevent their removal. They were chained and locked with heavy-duty padlocks, and a sharp saw-toothed steel strip was bolted {{to the top of the}} gates to prevent them from being climbed.|$|R
50|$|A three-piece {{version of}} the above uses a tiny {{pivoting}} arm held under tension inside the hinge. Pulling on the handle from any direction lifts the <b>pivoting</b> arm's <b>pins</b> out of the zipper teeth so that the slider can move.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainsets}} are 4-unit {{multiple units}} capable of operating in pairs, designed for medium-distance high-speed services. The inner axle of each carriage bogie {{is powered by}} a body mounted three phase asynchronous traction motor via a cardan shaft final drive. The electrical power is regulated by IGBT devices with one converted per carriage. The bogies are of welded steel construction with primary coil springs and secondary air suspension. Tractive forces are transmitted by a drag <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Quoted {{directly}} from the Snakeboard patent Abstract and Claims: [...] "This invention relates to a skateboard comprising two footboards each of the footboards including a foot platform and wheel-set which carries two wheels in axial alignment fixed to {{the underside of the}} platform, a spacer element for holding the footboards in a spaced relationship and a pivot arrangement having a vertical pivot axis connecting each footboard to the spacer element to enable both footboards to pivot relatively to the spacer element, each wheel set including a wheel body, wheel axles which are fixed to and project from the opposite sides of the body with the wheels being journaled for rotation on the axles, a first <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> being attached to the wheel body with its axis in a vertical direction, a support member on the wheel body, a second <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> pivotally connecting the foot platform to the support member with its pivot axis normal to the wheel axis, and resilient suspension means between the support member and the underside of the foot platform for holding the platform horizontal, said pivot arrangement being pivotally engaged with the first pivot pin." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or tow bar) is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle wheels {{were not}} strong enough for cars [...] until the {{development}} of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These wheels were deeply dished so that steering <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires. Their second feature was that they were easily detachable [...] being mounted on splined false hubs.|$|R

5000|$|Indicator needle axle. This has a {{spur gear}} that engages the sector gear (7) and extends through the face to drive the {{indicator}} needle. Due to the short distance between the lever arm link boss and the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> {{and the difference between}} the effective radius of the sector gear and that of the spur gear, any motion of the Bourdon tube is greatly amplified. A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.|$|E
50|$|On {{the hollow}} shafts {{there are two}} {{ventilated}} disc brakes, {{for which there is}} enough room due to the missing cross beam and <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> as mentioned above. The disc brakes are separate and are ventilated from the inside. They can be serviced or replaced from below, without needing to take out the entire axle. During regular braking, primarily the regenerative brake is used, and the traction motor serves as the generator. The cooperation between disc brakes and regenerative brakes is controlled by a dedicated brake control computer.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{locomotive}} has two {{electrical converter}} units with three IGBT based, water cooled output inverters per converter. Two of the inverters power the traction motors; the third unit supplies head-end and auxiliary power. The HEP/auxiliary inverters are dual-redundant and identical (rated [...] ), allowing the locomotive {{to remain in}} service should one inverter fail en route. The locomotive bogies are fabricated steel designs, with low-lying traction links and center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> The traction motors are frame-mounted, with torque transmitted via a hollow shaft drive. Locomotive braking is facilitated by cheek mounted disc brakes on each wheel.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a hatch and more particularly to a hatch for a space vehicle where the hatch {{has a low}} volume sweep and can be easily manipulated from {{either side of the}} hatch. The hatch system includes an elliptical opening in a bulkhead and an elliptical hatch member. The hatch cover system includes an elliptical port opening in a housing and an elliptical cover member supported centrally by a rotational bearing for rotation about a rotational axis normal to the cover member and by <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> in a gimbal member for pivotal movement about axes perpendicular to the rotational axis. Arm members support the gimbal member pivotally by pivot members so that upon rotation and manipulation the cover member can be articulatedly moved from a closed position to the port opening to an out of the way position with a minimum of volume sweep by the cover member...|$|R
50|$|The trigger assembly, which {{includes}} the trigger, hammer, sear, and trigger body with guard, can be removed by pushing out one retaining pin and pulling downwards on the guard (if a pistol grip is installed, it usually must be removed first as virtually all such grips obstruct {{the removal of the}} trigger body). The elevator can be removed by putting the gun on safety and squeezing the sides together, freeing the <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> from the receiver. The fore-end can then be moved to the rear, allowing the bolt and bolt carrier to drop out, and then the forend can be removed by moving it forward. The cartridge stop and interrupter will then fall free, leaving just the ejector and the safety in the receiver, held in by screws. The magazine spring and follower may be removed by unscrewing the tube from the receiver (this may be difficult on some new 500s). This level of field stripping is sufficient to allow all components to be cleaned.|$|R
500|$|NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, {{priced at}} C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, {{arriving}} in December. They replaced the Adams. Irvine liked {{them so much}} that, {{in one of his}} final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the [...]476 round being too potent. The first batch was stamped NWMP-CANADA (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or double-action, and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn spindle arms would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between [...] diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.|$|R
