At present, seam <b>puckers</b> are usually evaluated by human inspectors, which is subjective, unreliable and time-consuming. With the developments of image processing and pattern recognition technologies, an automatic vision-based seam <b>pucker</b> evaluation system becomes possible. This paper presents a new approach based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to establish the relationship between seam <b>pucker</b> grades and textural features of seam <b>pucker</b> images. The evaluation procedure is performed in two stages: features extraction with the co-occurrence matrix approach, and classification with ANFIS.

500|$|Each face {{appears on}} the {{sculpture}} {{for a total of}} 5minutes using various parts of individual 80-second videos. A 40-second section is played at one-third speed forward and backward, running for a total of 4minutes. Then, there is a subsequent segment, where the mouth is <b>puckering,</b> that is stretched to 15seconds. [...] This is followed by a section, in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth, that is stretched to last for 30seconds. [...] Finally, there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth, that is slowed to extend for 15seconds. Of the original 1,051subjects filmed, 960videos were determined to be usable for the project. Originally, the set of images was presumed to {{be the beginning of a}} work in progress, but as of 2009 no additional videos are planned.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve the}} effect in which water {{appears to be}} flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to {{correspond}} to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains. Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible. Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides, an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize {{the need for the}} movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming. Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate <b>puckering</b> in the exact proper location on the video. [...] Many of the faces had to be stretched {{in order to get the}} mouths properly positioned. [...] Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation. [...] Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.|$|E

Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of landscapes such as [...] waterfalls, [...] most intriguing [...] are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation, the order determined using a Barco show controller. Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit. [...] As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer. [...] However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of <b>puckering</b> is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each. [...] The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes. [...] If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days.

2500|$|In early May 1593 several {{bills were}} posted about London {{threatening}} Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands who {{had settled in}} the city. One of these, the [...] "Dutch church libel", written in rhymed iambic pentameter, contained allusions to several of Marlowe's plays and was signed, [...] "Tamburlaine". On 11 May the Privy Council ordered the arrest of {{those responsible for the}} libels. The next day, Marlowe's colleague Thomas Kyd was arrested. Kyd's lodgings were searched and a 3-page fragment of a heretical tract was found. In a letter to Sir John <b>Puckering,</b> Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe, with whom he had been writing [...] "in one chamber" [...] some two years earlier. In a second letter, Kyd described Marlowe as blasphemous, disorderly, holding treasonous opinions, being an irreligious reprobate, and ‘intemperate & of a cruel hart'. At that time they had both been working for an aristocratic patron, probably Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange. A warrant for Marlowe's arrest was issued on 18 May, when the Privy Council apparently knew that he might be found staying with Thomas Walsingham, whose father was a first cousin of the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's principal secretary in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the Privy Council. Marlowe duly presented himself on 20 May but, there apparently being no Privy Council meeting on that day, was instructed to [...] "give his daily attendance on their Lordships, until he shall be licensed to the contrary".

40|$|Abstract: Recently, the {{importance}} of proline ring <b>pucker</b> conformations in collagen has been suggested {{in the context of}} hydroxylation of prolines. The previous molecular mechanics parameters for hydroxyproline, however, do not reproduce the correct <b>pucker</b> preference. We have developed a new set of parameters that reproduces the correct <b>pucker</b> preference. Our molecular dynamics simulations of proline and hydroxyproline monomers as well as collagen-like peptides, using the new parameters, support the theory that the role of hydroxylation in collagen is to stabilize the triple helix by adjusting to the right <b>pucker</b> conformation (and thus the right � angle) in the Y position...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pucker</b> {{whistling}} is {{the most}} common form in much Western music. Typically, the tongue tip is lowered, often placed behind the lower teeth, and pitch altered by varying the position of the tongue. In particular, {{the point at which the}} tongue body approximates the palate varies from near the uvula (for low notes) to near the alveolar ridge (for high notes). Although varying the degree of <b>pucker</b> will change the pitch of a <b>pucker</b> whistle, expert <b>pucker</b> whistlers will generally only make small variations to the degree of <b>pucker,</b> due to its tendency to affect purity of tone. <b>Pucker</b> whistling can be done by either only blowing out or blowing in and out alternately. In the 'only blow out' method, a consistent tone is achieved, but a negligible pause has to be taken to breathe in. In the alternating method there is no problem of breathlessness or interruption as breath is taken when one whistles breathing in, but a disadvantage is that many times, the consistency of tone is not maintained, and it fluctuates.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} of macular <b>pucker</b> and macular holes {{is poorly}} understood. Anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and vitreoschisis {{have been proposed}} as possible mechanisms. This study used clinical imaging to seek vitreoschisis and study the topographic features of macular <b>pucker</b> and macular holes. Methods: Combined optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (OCT/SLO) was performed in 45 eyes with macular hole and 44 eyes with macular <b>pucker.</b> Longitudinal imaging was used to identify vitreoschisis and measure retinal thickness. The topographic features of eyes with macular hole with eccentric macular contraction were compared to 24 eyes with unifocal macular <b>pucker</b> using coronal plane imaging. Results: Vitreoschisis was detected in 24 of 45 eyes (53. 3 %) with macular hole and 19 of 44 (43. 2 %) with macular <b>pucker.</b> Retinal contraction was detected eccentrically in the macula of 18 of 45 eyes (40 %) with macular hole. In eyes with macular hole with unifocal retinal contraction, the average surface area of contraction (23. 12 ± 18. 79 mm 2) was significantly smaller than in eyes with macular <b>pucker</b> (63. 20 ± 23. 68 mm 2; P =. 006). The distance {{from the center of}} retinal contraction {{to the center of the}} macula was significantly greater in eyes with macular hole (8. 64 ± 2. 33 mm) than eyes with macular <b>pucker</b> (4. 45 ± 1. 90 mm; P =. 0001). Conclusion: Vitreoschisis was detected in about half of all eyes with macular hole and macular <b>pucker.</b> The topographic and structural features in eyes with macular hole with retinal contraction differed in comparison to eyes with macular <b>pucker</b> alone, suggesting that although each condition may begin with anomalous PVD, differences in subsequent cell migration and proliferation probably result in the different clinical appearances detected in this study.

Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion.

He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by <b>puckering</b> his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a bowel movement.

2500|$|The [...] "unique" [...] {{care for}} {{precision}} and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a {{paradigm of the}} care for quality in luxury products. In particular, {{a lot of attention}} is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece. [...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum <b>puckering</b> and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut {{from the surface of the}} oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a [...] "slim fit" [...] line.|$|E
