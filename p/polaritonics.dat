50|$|<b>Polaritonics</b> is an {{intermediate}} regime between photonics and sub-microwave electronics (see Fig. 1). In this regime, signals are carried by an admixture of electromagnetic and lattice vibrational waves known as phonon-polaritons, rather than currents or photons. Since phonon-polaritons propagate with frequencies {{in the range}} of hundreds of gigahertz to several terahertz, <b>polaritonics</b> bridges the gap between electronics and photonics. A compelling motivation for <b>polaritonics</b> is the demand for high speed signal processing and linear and nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. <b>Polaritonics</b> has distinct advantages over electronics, photonics, and traditional terahertz spectroscopy in that it offers the potential for a fully integrated platform that supports terahertz wave generation, guidance, manipulation, and readout in a single patterned material.|$|E

50|$|Direct {{observation}} of phonon-polariton propagation {{was made possible}} by real-space imaging, in which the spatial and temporal profiles of phonon-polaritons are imaged onto a CCD camera using Talbot phase-to-amplitude conversion.

Real-space imaging is the preferred detection technique in <b>polaritonics,</b> though other more conventional techniques like optical Kerr-gating, time resolved diffraction, interferometric probing, and terahertz field induced second harmonic generation are useful in some applications where real-space imaging is not easily employed. For example, patterned materials with feature sizes on the order of a few tens of micrometres cause parasitic scattering of the imaging light.

The nanocomposites systems studied included QDs doped within a <b>polaritonic</b> PC, an excitonic waveguide coupler, and a metamaterial waveguide. Also addressed are systems consisting of MNRs paired with biological labelling dye or QDs. The application of a strain field, known as the acousto-optic effect, was found to control photon transmission in <b>polaritonic</b> PC, and through that, the spontaneous emission of a QD doped within the crystal. Furthermore, a theory of reservoir induced-transparency (RIT) was developed in the QD-exciton-polaritonic coupler and QD-metamaterial waveguide nanocomposites. Transparent states in the absorption spectrum of the QD can be induced via the presence of bound polariton states in the coupler/waveguide. The nature of the states could be controlled by the separation of the couplers or the thickness of the metamaterial. Energy transfer is found and an explanatory theory is developed for MNRs with QD/biological labelling dye nanocomposites. Decrease in fluorescence lifetime from the dye is shown to be greater for excitation through that two-photon process.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} the foundational work behind {{the field of}} <b>polaritonics.</b> Corresponding to a frequency range from roughly 100 gigahertz up to 10 terahertz, <b>polaritonics</b> bridges the gap between electronics and photonics. In this regime, signals are carried by an admixture of electromagnetic and lattice vibrational waves known as phonon-polaritons, rather than currents or photons. Impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) is employed for phonon-polariton generation, whereby lattice vibrations are driven by optical femtosecond laser pulses directed into ferroelectric LiNbO 3 or LiTaO 3. The vibrational amplitude {{is proportional to the}} intensity of the excitation pulses. Due to the high dielectric constants of these crystals, phonon-polaritons travel in a predominantly lateral direction away from the excitation region. Lateral propagation is further facilitated by employing crystals whose thickness is on the order of the phonon-polariton wavelength, such that propagation occurs within {{one or more of the}} slab waveguide modes of the crystal. Direct observation of phonon-polaritons is achieved using real-space imaging, which monitors and records the spatiotemporal evolution of phonon-polaritons within a ferroelectric crystal. The details of both broadband and narrowband phonon-polariton generation and propagation in bulk and thin film crystals are presented. Additionally, robust polaritonic waveform generation is illustrated that relies on temporal or spatial shaping of the optical excitation pulses. Guidance, control, and other types of signal processing are demonstrated by patterning of the host crystal using femtosecond laser micromachining. (cont.) Waveguides that direct propagation, resonators that confine polaritonic signals, reflectors that direct, shape, and focus polaritonic waveforms, and periodic photonic crystal structures that restrict phonon-polaritons to a narrow band of frequencies are fabricated and their functionality demonstrated. The details of the laser micromachining employed for fabrication of these structures in a variety of crystal thicknesses are also presented here. Experimental measurements are supported by a novel implementation of finite-difference- time-domain (FDTD) simulations that accurately model both phonon-polariton generation and propagation in bulk, thin film, and patterned crystals. Additionally, numerical experiments are performed to predict functionality that will enable advanced polaritonic bistable devices for use in digital <b>polaritonics</b> and negative refractive polaritonic materials for unique waveform generation, signal processing, and sub-diffraction terahertz imaging. <b>Polaritonics</b> offers lower signal-to-noise than photonics and higher bandwidth signals than electronics, with generation, propagation, guidance, and control integrated into a single all- optical platform. Direct visualization of signal propagation makes device design and testing substantially easier than in either electronics or photonics. With continued development, fabrication of polaritonic materials should prove less demanding than traditional photonic structures, as it requires feature sizes on the order of micrometers rather than nanometers. Due to the high terahertz electric field strengths associated with ISRS phonon-polariton generation and the robust signal processing tool chest presented here, <b>polaritonics</b> promises to be useful in various spectroscopic applications including, but not limited to, linear and nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz near field microscopy. by David W.

40|$|The THz <b>polaritonics</b> {{system is}} an on-chip {{platform}} for THz generation, detection, and control. THz-frequency electromagnetic waves are generated directly {{in a thin}} slab of lithium niobate crystal {{where they can be}} amplified and guided. Time-resolved phase-sensitive imaging lets us capture movies of THz waves as they propagate at the light-like speeds. I developed <b>polaritonics</b> methodologies and used the platform to study various microstructures interacting with THz waves. I began technique development by deriving a quantitative model explaining THz wave propagation in an anisotropic slab waveguide. From this model, I extracted the frequency-dependent wave velocity and used this knowledge to design an optical pumping geometry that phase-matches and coherently amplifies a selected THz frequency. This geometry can generate high-amplitude THz waves with a tunable center frequency and bandwidth. Much like the generation, the detection was also revamped. New optical designs, acquisition procedures, and hardware let us quantitatively measure THz field strengths. The image resolution was improved from ~ 50 [mu]m to 1. 5 [mu]m, and measurement noise was reduced by 50 -fold. Using the improved generation and detection methods, we studied two classes of microstructures: laser-machined air gaps and deposited metal antennas. Air gaps cut into the lithium niobate slab effectively reflect, waveguide, and scatter THz waves. We fabricated structures that demonstrate wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference and captured movies of THz waves interacting with these structures. The movies can be useful tools in lectures on electromagnetism because they beautifully illustrate the fundamental effects and bring cutting-edge research into the classroom. In addition to air structures, we studied metal antennas, which are interesting because of their ability to enhance optical fields and localize electromagnetic waves well below the diffraction limit. The <b>polaritonics</b> platform enabled incisive study of fundamental antenna behavior and scaling because we could map the antenna's near-field with [lambda]/ 100 spatial resolution and we could quantify large THz electric field amplitudes and enhancements in a deeply sub-wavelength gap between antennas.

In my thesis work, I investigated and developed two of these features: photonic structures and strong light-matter coupling. In the first phase, we developed a fabrication procedure to pattern high-aspect ratio, optical-quality air holes into slabs of LN and LT, which has been historically difficult to achieve. We then studied the nature of THz wave propagation in the slabs when the size of these air holes was either much smaller or comparable to the THz wavelength. In the long-wavelength limit, where the structures are normally approximated as homogenous media, our findings {{were used to determine}} a cutoff-wavelength for operation and design of gradient refractive index devices. In the short wavelength limit, where the structures are termed photonic crystals, our work challenged the universally used definition of the Brillouin zone and presented an alternative definition that was valuable in understanding wave propagation in periodically ordered systems. In the second phase, we demonstrated a novel form of light-matter interaction in the strong coupling regime, where phonons and magnons where strongly coupled to the electric and magnetic fields of THz light, respectively. Our experiments, performed in both waveguide and cavity geometries, conclusively proved the formation of new quasiparticles we termed magnon-phonon-polaritons. We believe our results open up the possibility of using <b>polaritonics</b> for facile and coherent ultrafast control and conversion between photonic, phononic, and spin degrees of freedom, and thereby provides a promising avenue through which to explore THz wave-based computing.
