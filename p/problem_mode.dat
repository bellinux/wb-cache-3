40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{presents an}} input method {{to estimate the}} unknown time-varying strength on the sources of a primer applied at this on-line inverse heat conduction problem. We use the input method to recursively predict both the impulse strength acting {{on the front of}} thin copper foil and the transient temperature-time curves from the thin copper foil with the rapid combustion of different charge designs for primers. The input method includes the extended Kalman filter and weighted recursive least squares estimator. The purpose of the extended Kalman filter is to generate the recursive innovation sequence and the weighted recursive least squares estimator is used to identify the unknown time-varying strength. The results of simulation and experiment show that the input method can estimate the unknown time-varying heat flux on-line with more accuracy in the inverse heat conduction <b>problem</b> <b>mode.</b> The test experiments, namely different conductive thickness designs for primers with time-varying heat flux input, are solved to illustrate the effectiveness and good accuracy of the presented method...|$|E

40|$|Purpose â Research {{in gender}} and {{development}} (GAD) remains largely preoccupied with women's issues and ignores the gendered nature of masculine experience. While exposing this inconsistency in gender research, {{the present paper}} highlights the gendered nature of men, and sets an agenda for their inclusion in gender research and planning. Design/methodology/approach â To engage with the issue, the paper resists an unproblematic understanding of men as a singular formation, and instead builds on cultural and historical approaches which locate masculinity within modes of production. Findings â Instead of casting men in the <b>problem</b> <b>mode</b> and theorizing masculinity as an ahistorical universal, an attempt is made to delink men from patriarchy. For development to be truly transformative, men's issues should be addressed not just as instruments for women empowerment, but also as subjects in themselves. Practical implications â The paper, at a very broad level, pleads for a need to re-vision and âmenâ stream development that does not ignore women, but accommodates men as gendered subjects. Originality/value â In this context, power {{may be seen as}} embedded in specific modes of production, and not inherent in patriarchy. The paper argues that development agenda should go beyond categorical thinking, include men in gender planning, and create conditions for social justice.
