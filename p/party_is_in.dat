25|$|However {{the power}} that a prime {{minister}} has over his or her cabinet colleagues is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} support that they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Also when a party is divided into factions a Prime Minister may be forced to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The Prime Minister's personal power is also curtailed if their <b>party</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).|$|E

25|$|Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramírez {{were elected}} {{president}} and vice-president, and the FSLN won an overwhelming 61 out of 96 {{seats in the}} new National Assembly, having taken 67% of the vote on a turnout of 75%. Despite international validation of the elections by multiple political and independent observers (virtually all from among U.S. allies), the United States refused to recognize the elections, with President Ronald Reagan denouncing the elections as a sham. According to a study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> countries of the East Bloc. Daniel Ortega began his six-year presidential term on January 10, 1985. After the United States Congress turned down continued funding of the Contras in April 1985, the Reagan administration ordered a total embargo on United States trade with Nicaragua the following month, accusing the Sandinista government of threatening United States security in the region.|$|E
