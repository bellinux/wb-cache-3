Biomass charcoal produces domestic energy from non-upgraded biomass, other than wood, in particular agricultural residues non-consumed by animals. By reducing the dependence on wood, biomass charcoal protects forests and as a consequence fights against desertification.

5000|$|In Chile, {{where the}} habit of {{drinking}} mate had taken firm ground during colonial times, its popularity gave way after independence to drinks popular in Europe, coffee and tea that entered the country through its increasingly busy ports. The spread of tea and coffee consumption in Chile, {{to the detriment of}} mate, began in the upper classes. The first coffee shop in Chile appeared in Santiago in 1808. German botanist Eduard Friedrich Poeppig described in 1827 a wealthy family in Chile where the old people drank yerba mate with bombilla while the younger preferred Chinese tea. The trend of decreasing mate consumption was noticed in 1875 by the British consul Rumbold who said that [...] "imports of Paraguayan tea" [...] were [...] "steadily falling off". Yerba mate was overall cheaper (<b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> from 1871 to 1930) than tea and coffee and it remained popular in rural areas of Chile.|$|E

The two chains show an expected “complementary” sustainability performance. In other words, the local chain shows a better performance on spheres where the global is more constrained, and vice versa. The global chain shows a good performance in relation to all attributes that are positively correlated to scale. Moreover, the global chain has an advantage in terms of environmental impact (resource use and pollution, see Barilla 2012) and constraints in terms of food safety. It also relies on pervasive marketing communication strategies and continuous innovation investments, to safeguard its market performance. Furthermore, it shows good affordability for the consumer in terms of low <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> and accessibility of the product, marketed mainly through mass distribution.

There is a legend, created from the text of Suetonius and Polybius, which claims that Hannibal went to Allevard to manufacture his weapons. The history of Allevard is closely linked to the alpine steel industry. In 1450, Pierre and Arthur Boisson had a trip hammer in Allevard town which still existed in 1724. During a tour of the factory by special commissioners of the king in 1724 [...] "it was determined to be the oldest {{of its kind in the}} kingdom" [...] (E. Chabrand). Another Trip hammer at the same era was in operation in the village of Pinsot which is upstream on the Breda. A study of the remains indicated that the Allevard community had, between 1643 and 1727, a total of 76 works on the [...] "Bredal" [...] stream: 3 blast furnaces, 21 Trip hammers, 36 flour mills, 2 hemp beaters, 6 presses, 6 water-powered saws, 1 nail factory, and 1 fuller's earth plant. The steel industry was highly profitable because at the same time, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> hundred <b>kilos</b> for the melting furnace - total production in Allevard was 54,255 kg - went from 4 livres 5 sols to 9 livres 10 sols.|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. The {{fish market}} {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in economic literature. Many authors refer to it when they want to investigate the organisation of exchanges, whether {{from the point of view}} of equilibrium or disequilibrium. This market constitutes a kind of economic paradox in the sense that, in many cases, first observations may lead one to the conclusion that these markets are pure competitive markets. But the empirical analyses always reveal strong price dispersion for homogeneous or very similar goods. So, the problem is to explain this price dispersion. Several authors have tried to explain it by taking into account the differences in organisation, the characteristics of the good, and the influences of social interactions between buyers and sellers. In line with the last of these three approaches, we show here, through an empirical analysis of the fish market of Marseilles, that according to their characteristics, buyers and sellers will specialise in some kind of prices (high or low) according to some specific characteristics, and we explain why there can be a stable equilibrium. The data are collected daily using an electronic device. For each transaction, the data reports the exact date of the transaction, the weight, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilo,</b> the identification number of sellers and buyers and the type of fish.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three different papers summarized as follows. In The political economy of environmental regulation, I study how enforcement of national environmental legislation differ across municipalities in Sweden depending on the local political situation. While the legislation is national, enforcement is decentralized. I find that municipalities where the Green Party joins the ruling political coalition issue more environmental fines than other municipalities. In pricing on the fish market I use Swedish data to study how size affects the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> of fish for several species. In traditional fishery biomass models, fish stocks are treated as homogenous. New theoretical heterogeneous fishery models, where size is allowed to differ in a fish stock, {{have important implications for}} regulation, for example that it is optimal to regulate on numbers of fish instead of weight. However, prices in these models are assumed to be constant. My estimates can be used to shed some light on how prices change when the size composition of the catch changes. In my third and final chapter, Settlement under the threat of conflict - The cost of asymmetric information, I present a theoretical model where two players can divide a good peacefully or engage in a contest in order to obtain the entire good. I assume that one player's valuation of the good is private information and show how this affects the expected cost of the contest and thus the probability of peaceful settlement...|$|E

40|$|RESUMEN. A igualdad de esfuerzo de tracción ejercido, las barras corrugadas de 500 MPa de límite elástico son más económicas que las de 400, ya que sus respectivos precios comerciales no están en la proporción 500 / 400 de sus correspondientes capacidades mecánicas, sino en otra mucho menor (1. 06 como término medio). No obstante, cuando se emplean barras de más de 12 mm de diámetro, la anchura de las fisuras {{que aparecen}} en el hormigón, es tan grande, que se precisa reducir los alargamiento de las armaduras para no dejar desprotegido al propio acero. Esta adicional limitación resulta tanto más restructiva, cuanto mayor es el diámetro de las barras, mayor la calidad del acero, y menor la cuantía de la armadura {{principal}} en tracción. En el caso particular de que el recubrimiento de las barras sea de 30 mm, la máxima anchura admisible de fisuras en el hormigón de 0, 2 mm, y suponiendo que el precio del kilogramo de acero 500 (incluido doblado y colocación en obra), es de 1, 06 veces el precio de las barras de 400 MPa, de igual diámetro y peso, se deduce que las barras de acero 500 son más económicas que las de acero 400 en los tres siguientes casos: a) cuando el diámetro de las barras empleadas es menor que 20 mm. b) cuando, disponiéndose barras 0 20 para la armadura principal, la cuantía geométrica de esta armadura es superior al 1 %. c) cuando, utilizándose barras 0 25, la cuantía de la armadura principal en tracción es superior al 2 %. ABSTRACT. Exerting the same tractive force, corrugated rods of 500 Mpa elastic limit are cheaper {{than those of}} 400 since their respective market prices {{are not in the}} proportion 500 / 400 to their mechanical capacities but much lower (1 / 0. 6 on average). However, when rods of ever 12 mm diameter are used, the width of the cracks in the concrete is so large that the length of the cracks in the concrete is so large that the length of the truss extensions has to be reduced to ensure protection of the steel. This additional restriction increases in proportion to the diameter of the rods {{and the quality of the}} steel, and the limitation becomes less with the size of the main truss under stress. If the covering of the rods is 30 mm, for example, the maximum admissible width of the cracks in the concrete is 0. 2 mm. Then assuming that the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> of 500 steel (including the bending and installation) is 1. 06 times that of the rods of 400 MPa of the same diameter and weight, it is clear that the 500 rods are cheaper than those of 400 steel in the following three circumstances: a) When the diameter of the rods is under 20 mm; b) When, using 20 mm diam. rods for the main truss, its geometric extension is above 1 %; c) When using rods of 25 mm diam, the size of the main truss under tension is over 2 %...|$|E
30|$|An initial pasta {{producer}} price of € 1.00 <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> is assumed. After two months, we assume a semolina price increase of € 0.10 <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> and allow these effects to fully impact the pasta {{producer price}}s without introducing any other changes until the sixth month (this allows all estimated lagged increases to fully impact the semolina price). For the Pre-Antitrust intervention period, {{in the current}} period pasta price increases to € 1.078 <b>per</b> <b>kilo,</b> followed by a slight downward movement, a further but less marked raise and a another imperceptible decrease. Thus, by considering the net effect of about € 0.13 we can argue that the transmission rate of a semolina price increase on pasta price was about 130  %. After the adjustment process was complete, we introduce an equivalent reduction of € 0.10 <b>per</b> <b>kilo</b> on semolina <b>price.</b> As a result, the final pasta producer price fails to return to the initial level remaining at about € 1.10 <b>per</b> <b>kilo.</b> For comparison purpose, we set up the same simulation in the Post-Antitrust intervention period. In this case, the pasta price adjustment to semolina price increase produces a price of 1.004 with a transmission rate of 0.4  % (Fig. 2).|$|R
