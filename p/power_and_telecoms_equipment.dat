40|$|In present situation, {{the power}} {{control of a}} DC load can be {{achieved}} via an AC-DC converter consisting of a rectifier bridge and a switching element (operating by sPWM technique). The use of such a converter causes a lot of high harmonics at the AC side, which reduce the <b>power</b> factor <b>and</b> distort the grid voltage. Using passive filter in the converter input to avoid the high harmonics consequences the power factor decrease. The increase in the utilization of computers, laptops, uninterruptable <b>power</b> supplies, <b>telecom</b> <b>and</b> bio-medical <b>equipments</b> has become uncontrollable as its growth is rising exponentially. Hence, increase in functionality of such equipments leads to the higher <b>power</b> consumption <b>and</b> low <b>power</b> density which provided a large market to distributed power systems (DPS). The development of these DPS posed challenges to power engineers for an efficient power delivery with stringent regulating standards; this is the motivation and driving force of this thesis.

The development of these DPS posed challenges to power engineers for an efficient power delivery with stringent regulating standards; this is the motivation and driving force of this research work. The objective is to minimize the switching losses of front-end converters employed in DPS, with the primary aim of achieving nearly unity power factor operation of converters. Single-phase and three-phase rectifiers are increasingly used in the field of alternating current – direct current (AC-DC) power converters as front-end converters in DPS. For power factor correction (PFC) stage, conventional single-phase AC-DC PFC boost converter is the most suitable topology because of its inherent advantages. These PFC boost converters exhibit poor dynamic regulation of output voltage owing to low pass filter in the voltage feedback loop. Research effort has been made to mitigate this problem of AC-DC PFC boost converters. An extended pulse width modulation switching technique has been investigated and proposed especially for single-phase and three-phase AC-DC PFC boost converters to improve the dynamic response of output voltage during transient periods...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} situation, the {{evolution}} of growing in computers, laptops, uninterrupted <b>power</b> supplies, <b>telecom</b> <b>and</b> biomedical <b>equipment</b> has become overpowering. Hence, the utilization of such equipment results high <b>power</b> consumption <b>and</b> small <b>power</b> density which provided a large market to Distributed Power System (DPS). Power conditioning; typically rectification is essential usually for electronics equipment. Rectifier behaves as nonlinear load producing non-sinusoidal line current due to the nonlinear input characteristic. There are numbers of international standards to limit the harmonic content, caused due to the line currents of equipment coupled to electricity distribution networks. Accordingly, a reduction in line current harmonics, or Power Factor Correction – PFC is vital. This idea is the inspiration to this research effort. The objective {{is to improve the}} power factor nearly unity with minimum Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). For this thesis work small EMI (LC) passive PFC and Boost Converter active PFC are presented with suitable switching control. There are some major conventional control techniques that are implemented for the thesis work, which are; 1) Peak Current Control 2) Average Current Control 3) PI Control. Also for improved dynamic response and large stability range at high frequency the nonlinear controllers; 1) Dynamic Evolution Controller and 2) Sliding Mode Controller are applied. For each cases the input power factor is closed to unity and the line current waveform is observed as sinusoidal with THD percentage is in the tolerate limit...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{intangibles}} {{might explain}} the UK productivity puzzle. We note {{that since the}} recession: (a) firms have upskilled faster than before; (b) intangible investment in R&D and software has risen whereas tangible investment has fallen; and (c) intangible <b>and</b> <b>telecoms</b> <b>equipment</b> investment slowed {{in advance of the}} recession. We have therefore tested to see if: (a) what looks like labour hoarding is actually firms keeping workers who are employed in creating intangible assets; (b) the current slowdown in TFP growth is due to the spillover effects of the past slowdown in R&D <b>and</b> <b>telecoms</b> <b>equipment</b> investment. Our main findings are: (a) measured market sector real value added growth since the start of 2008 is understated by 1. 6 % due to the omission of intangibles; (b) 0. 75 pppa of the TFP growth slowdown can be accounted for by the slowdown in intangible <b>and</b> <b>telecoms</b> investment in the early 2000 s. Taken together intangible investment can therefore account for around 5 percentage points of the 16 % productivity puzzle...|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyses}} R&D expenditures by top R&D-investing {{companies from}} the ICT sector, {{for the period}} of 2005 - 2008. It focuses on the distribution of R&D investments by firms in specific ICT sub-sectors from the five main world regions, paying special attention to R&D investments by ICT companies from the EU. The relationship between R&D growth and company sales growth is also addressed. The analysis suggests that although EU ICT sector companies make very substantial R&D investments, as an aggregate they invest less in R&D than companies from the US or Japan. This is, however, not necessarily because individual US companies are more R&D intensive than EU ones but more {{because of the presence of}} a large number of top R&D-investing ICT sector companies from the US. EU companies’ R&D expenditures are concentrated in the <b>Telecom</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telecom</b> Services sub-sectors, whereas US, and to some extent, Japanese companies show a strong presence in IT Components, Computer Services, <b>and</b> <b>Telecom</b> <b>Equipment.</b> Worldwide, the most important sub-sector in terms of R&D investment is IT Components, which accounts for over one third of global R&D investments in the ICT sector.

It is essential that these facilities be protected {{from a wide range}} of ambient temperatures and solar radiation. Temperature extremes greatly reduce lead-acid based battery performance and shorten battery life. Therefore, it is important to maintain the cabinet temperature within the optimal values between 20 oC and 30 oC to ensure battery stability and to extend battery lifespan. To this end, cabinet enclosures with proper thermal management have been developed to house such electronic equipment in a highly weather tight manner, especially for battery cabinet. In this paper, the flow field and temperature distribution inside an outdoor cabinet are studied experimentally and numerically. The battery cabinets house 24 batteries in two configurations namely, two-layer configuration and six-layer configuration respectively. The cabinet walls are maintained at a constant temperature by a refrigeration system. The cabinet’s ability to protect the batteries from an ambient temperature as high as 50 oC is studied.
