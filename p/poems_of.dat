5|$|The symphonic <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> the Hungarian {{composer}} Franz Liszt are {{a series}} of 13 orchestral works, numbered S.95–107. The first 12 were composed between 1848 and 1858 (though some use material conceived earlier); the last, Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe (From the Cradle to the Grave), followed in 1882. These works helped establish the genre of orchestral program musiccompositions written to illustrate an extra-musical plan derived from a play, poem, painting or work of nature. They inspired the symphonic <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, Richard Strauss and others.|$|E

5|$|Dinkar {{notes that}} in the <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> Rambhadracharya, the three poetical styles of Pāñcālī (secondary figurative sense with short and sweet-sounding {{compounds}}), Vaidarbhī (with compounds and soft contexts and without many figures of speech) and Lāṭī (with precise contexts and without many figures of speech) are dominant.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The <b>Poems</b> <b>of</b> Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> the Four Quartets.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E
5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was a {{difficult}} one, and its effects would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a character in the epic Gaelic <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E
5|$|East Coker is {{described}} as a poem of late summer, earth, and faith. As in the other <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> the Four Quartets, each of the five sections holds a theme that is common to each of the poems: time, experience, purgation, prayer, and wholeness. The time theme is stated in the first section as 'In my beginning is my end' which, given proper attention, might prove to lead into the eternal moment.|$|E

5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz's {{childhood}} environment exerted a {{major influence}} on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his <b>poems,</b> <b>of</b> the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} {{convey a sense of}} the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected <b>Poems</b> <b>of</b> Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E

5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had {{notoriously}} difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku <b>poems</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E
5|$|The {{work for}} which Traherne {{is best known}} today is the Centuries of Meditations, a {{collection}} of short paragraphs in which he reflects on Christian life and ministry, philosophy, happiness, desire and childhood. This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D. and <b>Poems</b> <b>of</b> Felicity). His prose works include Roman Forgeries (1673), Christian Ethics (1675), and A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699).|$|E
