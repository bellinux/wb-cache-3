50|$|Early {{models of}} the {{aircraft}} were powered by several versions of the Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet engine, while later aircraft have adopted more recent turbofan powerplants such as the Garrett TFE731 and Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300. As well as providing the <b>propelling</b> <b>thrust</b> of the aircraft, each of the engines are connected to independent gearboxes which provide electrical power via generators and drive the onboard fuel, oil and hydraulic pumps and a generator for electrical power. The design is redundant {{so that in the}} event of a single engine failing, all aircraft systems shall continue to operate normally.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{hydrodynamic}} {{characteristics of the}} rectilinear motion of a robotic fish underwater vehicle. This 2 -joint, 3 -link multibody vehicle model is biologically inspired by a body caudal fin carangiform fish propulsion mechanism. Navier-Stokes equations are used to compute the unsteady flow fields generated due to {{the interaction between the}} vehicle and the surrounding incompressible and Newtonian fluid (water) environment. The NACA 0014 airfoil aerodynamic profile has been designed to boost the swimming efficiency by reducing drag as the vehicle undergoes an undulatory/oscillatory motion. Using the Lighthill slender body model, a traveling wave mathematical function is defined to undulate the robotic fish posterior (caudal) region while the motion tracking is carried out by dynamic meshing technique. The results obtained show that though the net lift force approaches to zero, the net thrust or negative drag coefficient maintains a finite value dependent on kinematic parameters like tail beat frequency (TBF) and amplitude span (AS) at a given propulsive wavelength and the forward velocity of the vehicle. The results reveal the effects of TBF and AS on the coefficient of drag friction and the thrust force. Drag coefficients obtained from the simulations are compared and validated with the experimental results. The hydrodynamic results are found to be similar to the kinematic study results and suggest that TBF and AS play the most effective roles in the bioinspired propulsion technique. Relation of these parameters with <b>propelling</b> <b>thrust</b> force and forward velocity is also in conjunction over a given range of TBF and AS values...|$|E

No doubt it was unromantic enough to be pushed, <b>propelled,</b> <b>thrust,</b> willing or not willing, against, or with, wind and tide, {{so that you could}} gauge your distance run--and to be run--almost to a foot; but it was very satisfactory, nevertheless, especially to those whose hearts were far in advance of their vessel, and it was more than satisfactory when {{at the end of their}} voyage of a few days they found themselves gliding swiftly, almost noiselessly, up the windings of a quiet river whose picturesque scenery, romantic vistas, and beautiful reflections might have marked it the entrance to a paradise instead of a human pandemonium.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a trajectory tracking controller for a quadrotor system by finding a coordinate change which transforms the quadrotor's vector field into {{that of a}} <b>thrust</b> <b>propelled</b> system. In a <b>thrust</b> <b>propelled</b> system, {{the goal is to}} stabilize its position around the origin, while the system is actuated by a one dimensional acceleration/thrust along a direction vector, by a time-varying gravity, and by the angular acceleration of the direction vector. For this system, a solution has been proposed in a companion article, submitted to ECC 2016, based on the implicit knowledge of a bounded controller for a double integrator system, and on the implicit knowledge of a Lyapunov function that guarantees the origin is asymptotically stable for the double integrator controlled by the bounded controller. We present two alternative bounded controllers for a double integrator system, and corresponding Lyapunov functions. Comment: Companion article submitted to ECC 201...|$|R

It is essentially a large hop forwards or backwards, <b>propelled</b> by a <b>thrust</b> from the back or front leg, respectively. Because of the large spread of the legs, Si-Li Bu is an extremely stable stance.|$|R
50|$|The first turbine powered car {{built in}} the US was the GM Firebird I which began {{evaluations}} in 1953. While photos of the Firebird I may suggest that the jet turbine's <b>thrust</b> <b>propelled</b> the car like an aircraft, the turbine in fact drove the rear wheels. The Firebird 1 was never meant as a serious commercial passenger car and was solely built for testing & evaluation as well as public relation purposes.|$|R
50|$|The air {{compressed}} by {{the compressor}} bypasses the combustor and turbine {{section of the}} engine, where it is mixed with the turbine exhaust. The turbine exhaust can be designed to be fuel-rich (i.e., the combustor does not burn all the fuel) which, when mixed with the compressed air, creates a hot fuel-air mixture which is ready to burn again. More fuel is injected into this air where it is again combusted. The exhaust is ejected through a <b>propelling</b> nozzle, generating <b>thrust.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{adaptive}} position {{tracking control}} scheme is proposed for vertical <b>thrust</b> <b>propelled</b> unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) {{in the presence}} of external disturbances. As an intermediary step, the system attitude is used to direct the thrust towards the position target. Instrumental in our control design, an extraction method allowing to obtain the desired attitude and thrust from the required force driving the system towards the desired position, is proposed. Finally, the control torque is designed for the overall system to achieve the tracking objective. The proposed controller ensures global asymptotic stability of the overall closed loop system.

40|$|Synthetic jet is a {{new type}} of {{underwater}} propulsion method with the merit of small size, compact structure, light weight, high efficiency and minimal effect on the drag profile of the vehicle. In this paper, a new concept spherical underwater robot <b>propelled</b> by <b>thrust</b> vector synthetic jet actuator is proposed. The synthetic jet actuator has an adjustable flexible nozzle actuated by 3 ropes uniformly distributed around the axis of the nozzle with the spacing of 120 °. By deflecting the angle of the nozzle, the direction of the thrust can be adjusted, so to realize the 6 DOF&# 39;s motion of the robot. The design of the robot makes it very compact in structure and gives it the ability to maneuver in confined environments. All of which make it competent for the observation tasks such as underwater infrastructure inspection or marine creature monitoring. The structure design of the robot and the thrust vector synthetic jet actuator is given in detail. The dynamic model of the robot is given which can be used to control the 6 DOF motion of the robot. The flow field of the robot with different nozzle deflection angle is given through numerical simulation. <br type="_moz" /...|$|R
5000|$|The tiny {{hairs on}} the legs provide both a {{hydrophobic}} surface {{as well as a}} larger surface area to spread their weight over the water. The middle legs used for rowing have particularly well developed fringe {{hairs on the}} tibia and tarsus to help increase movement through the ability to thrust. The hind pair of legs are used for steering [...] When the rowing stroke begins, the middle tarsi of gerrids are quickly pressed down and backwards to create a circular surface wave in which the crest can be used to <b>propel</b> a forward <b>thrust.</b> The semicircular wave created is essential to the ability of the water strider to move rapidly since it acts as a counteracting force to push against. As a result, water striders often move at 1 meter per second or faster.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{hierarchical}} design framework {{is presented to}} control {{the position of a}} class of vehicles in SE(3) that are <b>propelled</b> by a <b>thrust</b> vector along a single body axis and incorporate some mechanism to induce torques about all body axes. A position control outer loop provides reference signals for an attitude control inner loop. The main result of this paper is a set of conditions under which a position controller designed for a point-mass system and an attitude controller can be combined to form a position controller that almost globally asymptotically stabilizes the vehicle to a desired position with desired heading. As opposed to the classical backstepping framework, the proposed approach is modular, in that position control and attitude control designs are completely separate. Thus, for instance, with the proposed technique one can employ any attitude controller from the vast literature on attitude stabilization, provided it enjoys a basic almost global stability property.

5000|$|Chrysopelea is {{also known}} by its common name [...] "flying snake." [...] It climbs using ridge scales along its belly, pushing against rough bark surface of tree trunks, {{allowing}} it to move vertically up a tree. Upon reaching {{the end of a}} branch, the snake continues moving until its tail dangles {{from the end of the}} branch. It then makes a J-shape bend, leans forward to select the level of inclination it wishes to use to control its glide path, as well as selecting a desired landing area. Once it decides on a destination, it <b>propels</b> itself by <b>thrusting</b> its body up and away from the tree, sucking in its abdomen and flaring out its ribs to turn its body into a [...] "pseudo concave wing", all the while making a continual serpentine motion of lateral undulation parallel to the ground to stabilise its direction in midair in order to land safely.|$|R
50|$|Hydrofoils, or fins, {{are used}} to push against the water to create a normal force to provide <b>thrust,</b> <b>propelling</b> the animal through water. Sea turtles and {{penguins}} beat their paired hydrofoils to create lift. Some paired fins, such as pectoral fins on leopard sharks, can be angled at varying degrees to allow the animal to rise, fall, or maintain its level in the water column. The reduction of fin surface area helps to minimize drag, and therefore increase efficiency. Regardless of size of the animal, at any particular speed, maximum possible lift is proportional to (wing area) x (speed)2. Dolphins and whales have large, horizontal caudal hydrofoils, while many fish and sharks have vertical caudal hydrofoils. Porpoising (seen in cetaceans, penguins, and pinnipeds) may save energy if they are moving fast. Since drag increases with speed, the work required to swim unit distance is greater at higher speeds, but the work needed to jump unit distance is independent of speed. Seals propel themselves through the water with their caudal tail, while sea lions create thrust solely with their pectoral flippers.|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} {{and control of}} a class of <b>thrust</b> <b>propelled</b> aerial vehicles subjected to lift and drag aerodynamic forces is addressed. Assuming a rotational symmetry of the vehicle's envelope about an axis and the alignment of the thrust force with this axis, one shows that the resultant of aerodynamic forces can be decomposed as the sum of a term {{in the direction of}} the air velocity and a term {{in the direction of the}} thrust force. Conditions allowing for the derivation of a family of models of aerodynamic forces for which the first term does not depend on the vehicle's orientation are pointed out. When such a model applies, pre-compensation of the latter term with the thrust input allows one to recast the control problem into the simpler case of a spherical vehicle subjected to drag only for which nonlinear feedback controllers endowed with strong stability and convergence properties have been reported in prior studies. Beside the adaptation of these control results, the paper extends a previous work by the authors in two directions. First, the 3 D case is addressed whereas only motions in a single vertical plane was considered. Secondly, the family of models of aerodynamic forces for which the aforementioned transformation holds is enlarged...|$|R
40|$|So far, we have mainly been {{concerned}} with flows that are slow enough {{that they may be}} treated as incompressible. We now consider flows in which the velocity approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound and in which density changes along streamlines cannot be ignored. Such flows are common in aeronautics and astrophysics. For example, the motion of a rocket through the atmosphere is faster than the speed of sound in air. In other words, it is supersonic. Therefore, if we transform into the frame of the rocket, the flow of air past the rocket is also supersonic. When the flow speed exceeds the speed of sound in some reference frame, it is not possible for a pressure pulse to travel upstream in that frame and change the direction of the flow. However, if there is a solid body in the way (e. g. a rocket or aircraft), the flow direction must change. In a supersonic flow, this change happens nearly discontinuously, through the formation of shock fronts at which the flow suddenly decelerates from supersonic to subsonic. An example is shown in Fig. 16. 1. Shock fronts are an inevitable feature of supersonic flows. In another example of supersonic flow, a rocket itself is <b>propelled</b> by the <b>thrust</b> created by escaping hot gases from its exhaust. These hot gases move through the exhaust at supersonic speeds, expanding and cooling as they accelerate. In this manner the random thermal motion of the gas molecules is converted into an organised bulk motion that carries away negative momentum from the rocket and pushes it forward. The solar wind furnishes yet another example of a supersonic flow. This high speed flow of ionized gas is accelerated in the solar corona and removes a fraction ∼ 10 − 14 of the sun’s mass every year. Its own pressure accelerates it to supersonic speeds of ∼ 400 km s − 1. When the outflowing solar wind encounters a planet, it is rapidly decelerated to subsonic speed by passing through a strong discontinuity known as a bow shock, which surrounds the planet (Fig. 16. 2). The bulk kinetic energy in the solar wind, built up during acceleration, is rapidly and irreversibly transformed into heat as it passes through this shock front...|$|R
