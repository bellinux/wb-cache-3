25|$|Film capacitors, {{plastic film}} capacitors, film {{dielectric}} capacitors, or <b>polymer</b> <b>film</b> capacitors, generically called “film caps” {{as well as}} power film capacitors, are electrical capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric, sometimes combined with paper as carrier of the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|The highest surge-current rated film {{capacitors}} are film/foil capacitors with a {{metal foil}} construction. These capacitors use thin metal foils, usually aluminum, as the electrodes overlying the <b>polymer</b> <b>film.</b> The advantage of this construction is the easy and robust connection of the metal foil electrodes. In this design, the contact resistance {{in the area of}} the schoopage is the lowest.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{reactor type}} is the flow through reactor (continuous flow reactor), {{which also has}} {{internal}} electrodes, but this reactor allows monomer gas to flow through the reaction chamber as its name implies, which should give a more even coating for <b>polymer</b> <b>film</b> deposition. It has the advantage that more monomer keeps flowing into the reactor in order to deposit more polymer. It has the disadvantage of forming what is called “tail flame,” which is when polymerization extends into the vacuum line.|$|E

For example, when thin <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> are employed as dielectrics in micro or nano-devices, the dielectric loss could occur far before {{the breakdown of}} the thin <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> [7]. Therefore, quantitative study of the relaxation properties for thin <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> at nanometer scale is of great importance for their application in nanoscience and nanotechnology.|$|R

40|$|Linearly {{polarized}} light can induce an order {{parallel to the}} polarization direction of light in <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> containing different photochromic groups. In principle, this offers the possibility to generate prolate in-plane orders in <b>polymer</b> <b>films.</b> Two such photochemical processes are investigated in this paper. One {{of them is the}} irradiation of azobenzene-containing <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> with linearly polarized red light after an unpolarized UV preirradiation step. The other one is the angular selective photocycloaddition of cinnamate-containing <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> induced by linearly polarized UV light. Because in both cases the order is low after the irradiation, the liquid crystalline <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> are annealed in their mesophase to modify the photoinduced order by thermotropic self-organization. The resulting threedimensional indicatrices, as determined by waveguide spectroscopy, are found to be prolate in-plane, biaxial, or homeatropic in dependence on the polymer structures, preparation conditions, and irradiation conditions of the films...|$|R
500|$|The skintight suits worn by {{the actors}} were {{reminiscent}} of the outfits {{worn by the}} actors in the original film. Kosinski believed that the costumes {{could be made to}} be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing the lighted costumes, which used electroluminescent lamps derived from a flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>film</b> and featured hexagonal patterns. The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of Honeywell lamination and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent 3M Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to lamination. While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics. In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes. On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 LED lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled. All the costumes had to be sewn {{in such a way that}} the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures. According to Neville Page, the lead designer for the helmets, [...] "The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joe’s [...] vision. We would look over each other’s shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film." ...|$|E

In these, the capacitors have two anode foils of opposite polarity connected in series. On each of the alternate halves of the AC cycle, one anode acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse voltage from damaging the opposite anode. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized <b>polymer</b> <b>film</b> or paper dielectric.|$|E

These <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> have multiple oxidative and reductive states. The neutral <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> can be electrochemically oxidized at their diphenylbenzidine linkage or reduced at their diimide sites. The kinetics of electron transfer,ion compensation,and solvent transport during redox switching of such <b>polymer</b> <b>films</b> {{depend on the}} type of polymer,its specific redox state,the voltage scan rate,and the direction of redox switching or potential step.

Dielectric studies of these films have also been carried out at various set temperatures in the frequency from 100 [*]Hz to 1 [*]MHz for carrying out impedance spectroscopy analysis to evaluate the electrical conductivity which arises due to a single conduction mechanism and thus to have a single semicircle pattern from these <b>polymer</b> <b>films.</b> The DC electrical conductivity increases {{with an increase in}} the temperature and it could be due to high mobility of free charges (polarons and free ions) at higher temperatures.

2500|$|Adhesive lift: [...] in this method, a {{sheet of}} fixing film is used to {{preserve}} the developed indentations. [...] The fixing film is usually a relatively rigid sheet of self-adhesive, transparent <b>polymer</b> <b>film.</b> [...] It is applied by removing the backing material and carefully laying the fixing film directly onto the charging film, thus trapping and fixing the toner in place between the films. [...] Pressure is then carefully applied {{to the top of}} the fixing film by hand or with a small roller. [...] The resulting sandwich is referred to simply as a [...] "lift", or EDD lift. [...] Interpretation of the developed indentations is generally done using the lift after removal from the document because this permits the examiner to see the developed indentations on their own without interference from any visible markings on the document.|$|E
