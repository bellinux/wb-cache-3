2500|$|Absolute {{bioavailability}} of rosuvastatin {{is about}} 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food {{did not affect}} the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as <b>per</b> <b>product</b> label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. [...] Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. It is likely that closer to 0.25 (25%) of the administered dose is absorbed.|$|E
5000|$|Norman Davies {{noted that}} the {{situation}} in Galicia was likely more desperate than in Ireland, and that Galicia was likely [...] "the poorest province in Europe". Galicia was indeed {{the poorest of the}} Austrian provinces and markedly poorer than western Europe. In 1890 the <b>per</b> capita <b>product,</b> in 2010 dollars, for Galicia was $1,947. In contrast, the <b>per</b> capita <b>product</b> in Austria was $3,005 and in Bohemia was $2,513. Galicia was not as poor as eastern Hungary, whose <b>per</b> capita <b>product</b> was $1,824 and Croatia-Slavonia, whose <b>per</b> capita <b>product</b> in 2010 dollars was $1897. Galicia's <b>per</b> capita <b>product</b> was almost identical to that of Transylvania, which was $1,956 in 2010 dollars. Galicia's annual growth rate from 1870 to 1910 was 1.21 percent, slightly lower than the imperial average of 1.5%. In comparison to other countries, Galicia's 1890 <b>per</b> capita <b>product</b> of $1,947 in 2010 dollars was three times lower than that of the United Kingdom ($6,228) and lower than that of every country in northwestern Europe. However, it was higher than that of Portugal ($1,789), Bulgaria ($1,670), Greece ($1,550), Russia ($1,550), and Serbia ($1,295).|$|R

2500|$|In 1932 Kansas City, Kansas-born Charles Elmer Doolin (1903–1959), {{manager of}} the Highland Park Confectionery in San Antonio, Texas {{purchased}} a corn chip recipe, a handheld potato ricer, and 19 retail accounts from a corn chip manufacturer for $100, which he borrowed from his mother. Doolin established a new corn chip business, The Frito Company, in his mother's kitchen. Doolin and his mother and brother produced the corn chips, named Fritos, and had a production capacity of approximately 10 pounds per day and roughly 30 cents <b>per</b> <b>product.</b> Doolin distributed the Fritos in 5¢ bags. Daily sales totaled $8 to $10 and profits averaged about $2 per day. In 1933 the production of Fritos increased from 10 pounds to nearly 100 pounds due {{to the development of}} a [...] "hammer" [...] press; by the end of the year, production lines were operating in Houston and Dallas. The Frito Company headquarters also moved to Dallas to capitalize on the city's central location and better availability of raw materials. In 1937 The Frito Company opened its Research and Development lab and introduced new products, including Fritos Peanut Butter Sandwiches and Fritos Peanuts, to supplement Fritos and Fritatos Potato Chips, which had been introduced in 1935.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} and analyze the evelopmental stage of human capital in all of the European Union countries, as well as the differences in prosperity of each European Union country. It will especially focus on Bosnia and Herzegovina and its parameters, since it is the only state outside of the European Union, and will analyze the stage of its inhabitants, as well as its general social development as opposed to the European Union countries. Furthermore, it will pay attention to the realized and expected level of the gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita for all of the European Union countries and Bosnia and Herzegovina and explore the amount of countries which realized the higher gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita than it was expected according to their human development, i. e. the amount of countries which realized the lower gross domestic product than it was expected based on the education of their population. The study will offer the degree of human development expressed through the human development index, as well as the economic developmental stage with thehelp of the gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita for all of the 28 European Union countries and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the year 2012. The first conjecture states that the European Union countries with the developed human capital achieve the higher gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita than they actually should, i. e. their gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita is higher than expected. The second conjecture deals with the fact that the European Union countries whose gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita is higher have the higher gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita then it is expected. Finally, the third conjecture claims that Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its low development of human capital and low gross domestic product, has a lower gross domestic <b>product</b> <b>per</b> capita than expected...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the genetic {{interactions}} between mutant alleles in 12 genes, designated PER 1 -PER 12, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Recessive mutations {{in any of these}} genes determined three different morphological phenotypes: (i) complete absence of peroxisomes (Per-); (ii) presence of small peroxisomes in conjunction with a major fraction of peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol (Pim-); and (iii) presence of peroxisomes with aberrant crystalline matrix substructure (Pss-). Extensive complementation analysis showed many cases of noncomplementation [...] that is, diploids that contained both wild-type and mutant alleles of two different PER genes were unable to grow on methanol and showed peroxisomal defects. The observed cases of unlinked noncomplementation appeared to be gene and allele specific and were predominantly observed at lower temperatures (cold sensitive). The genetic results obtained were used to formulate a model of <b>PER</b> gene <b>product</b> interactions.
