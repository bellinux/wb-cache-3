5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second originates above {{the middle of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases. The pectoral fins are short and rounded. The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines. The dermal denticles are small and flat, with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point.|$|E
50|$|Miniaturization {{and lack}} of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> are also {{characteristic}} of the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). An old world pupfish, Aphanius apodus, also lacks <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} {{plankton}} along coral reefs. Sexual dimorphism {{occurs in the}} species of angelfish, the male is larger with blackish <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and a yellow spot on the front head, whereas the smaller female has brighter (white) <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R
50|$|The common smooth-hound has two dorsal fins, an anal fin, {{a pair of}} {{pectoral}} fins, a pair of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and a heterocercal tail. All {{of these}} fins help stabilise the shark but in males, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> are modified to form claspers.|$|R
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark.|$|E
50|$|In many respects, {{they are}} similar to the pipefishes, but can be {{distinguished}} by the presence of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins,</b> a prominent, spiny, dorsal fin, and star-shaped plates on the skin.

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} large and rounded. The {{origin of the}} first dorsal fin lies over {{the last third of}} the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases, while the origin of the much larger second dorsal fin lies over the rear of the anal fin. The claspers of adult males are moderately long and tapering, though those of some individuals may be knob-shaped and spiky. The anal fin is roughly equal in size to the pelvic fins, and smaller but longer-based than the second dorsal fin. The short caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick; the dermal denticles have three-pointed crowns and are widely spaced compared to other species in the genus. Coloured yellowish brown above and cream below, this shark has a characteristic series of ten dorsal saddles from the head to the tail; each saddle is dark brown with a darker edge and a lighter middle. Unlike in the similar lined catshark, there are no spots or additional markings between the saddles.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
40|$|The {{arms and}} legs of man are {{evolutionarily}} derived from the paired fins of primitive jawed fish. Few evolutionary changes have attracted {{as much attention as}} the origin of tetrapod limbs from the paired fins of ancestral fish. The hindlimbs of tetrapods are derived from the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> of ancestral fish. These evolutionary origins {{can be seen in the}} examination of shared gene and protein expression patterns during the development of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and tetrapod hindlimbs. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> of fish express key limb positioning, limb bud induction and limb outgrowth genes in a similar manner to that seen in hindlimb development of higher vertebrates. We are now at a point where many of the key players in the development of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and vertebrate hindlimbs have been identified and we can now readily examine and compare mechanisms between species. This is yielding fascinating insights into how the developmental programme has altered during evolution and how that relates to anatomical change. The role of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> has also drastically changed over evolutionary history, from playing a minor role during swimming to developing into robust weight-bearing limbs. In addition, the pelvic fins/hindlimbs have been lost repeatedly in diverse species over evolutionary time. Here we review the evolution of <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and hindlimbs within the context of the changes in anatomical structure and the molecular mechanisms involved. 20 page(s...|$|R
50|$|African {{lungfishes}} are elongated, eel-like fishes, with thread-like pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins.</b> They have soft scales, and the dorsal {{and tail}} fins are fused {{into a single}} structure. They can either swim like eels, or crawl along the bottom, using their pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins.</b> The largest species reach about 200 cm long.|$|R
500|$|The body {{is rather}} {{laterally}} compressed and tapers towards the tail, with two dorsal fins set far back. The first dorsal fin originates over {{the rear of}} the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> and is much larger than the second, which originates over the midpoint of the anal fin base. The bases of the pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> are about equal; the pectoral fins are large and broad while the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> are much lower. Adult males have stubby claspers with the inner margins of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> partially fused over them to form an [...] "apron". The caudal fin is short and broad, with an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very thick skin is covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. Each denticle has an arrowhead-shaped crown with three posterior points, mounted on a short stalk.|$|R

25|$|Mature red-tailed golden arowanas have {{brilliant}} metallic gold lateral scales, gill covers, bellies, and pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> membranes, {{although the}} back is dark. In juveniles, the areas destined to develop golden colour start out metallic silver. The anal fin {{and the bottom}} portion of the caudal fin are light brown to dark red.|$|E
25|$|The cleftbelly {{trevally}} is a bluish {{green on}} the upper body which fades to silver {{on the underside of}} the fish. The membranes of the large <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> are a distinctive black, while the remaining fins are a pale white colour.

50|$|The spiny {{dorsal fin}} is {{moderate}} in height and is partially {{separated by a}} notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are light grey to dark grey or black with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to flanks. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>fins</b> are large and angular and set forward of the pectoral fins.

25|$|The {{anal fin}} {{consists}} of one spine {{detached from the}} fin anteriorally, while the main fin has a single spine and 18 to 22 soft rays, with the last two detached to form a finlet like the dorsal fin. The dorsal and anal fins are quite low, and the dorsal fin is much longer than the anal. The pectoral fin is small for a carangid, {{about the length of}} the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> and is non-falcate with 20 rays. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> consists of one spine and five branched soft rays. The caudal fin is also highly diagnostic, being deeply forked and consisting of 17 caudal rays, 9 dorsally and 8 ventrally. The lateral line has a slight anterior arch and there are no scutes present on the line, but possesses about 100 scales. The scales covering the body and parts of the operculum, cheek, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fins are ctenoid in shape. The species has 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of the}} bumpnose {{trevally}} is {{a silvery}} green-blue above, becoming more silvery-white below, with a dark blotch present on the operculum. The spinous dorsal fin and the soft dorsal fin rays are black, while the anal fin is brownish, with the filaments and lobe often blackish. The caudal fin has black trailing and leading edges, and the <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> is dusky to black. Juveniles often have five to seven vertical crossbars on their sides.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} aspects of goby morphology are the fused pelvic fins that form a disc-shaped sucker.

Frequently, this communication is based on body movements, such as shaking and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fin</b> flicking. In addition, open- and cave-brooding parents assist in finding food resources for their fry. Multiple neotropical cichlid species perform leaf-turning and fin-digging behaviors.|$|E
