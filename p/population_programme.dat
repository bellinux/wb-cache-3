However, because of the absence of a coherent approach to overcome the social and cultural obstacles to the use of family planning in conjunction with poor service delivery and outreach activities; ineffective information, education and communication campaign; frequent changes in the organisational set up of the programme; inefficient management and lack of political commitment to family planning, the programme failed to achieve tangible success.

40|$|Pakistan {{launched}} one of {{the first}} population control programmes in the 1950 s, yet has lagged far behind other countries in effectively implementing or developing its understanding of population programmes. This paper explores the policy-making process which shaped the programme in Pakistan in terms of the political considerations of the various military and civilian regimes, {{the role of religion in}} politics, the influences of Western donors (particularly USAID), and the effect of international development ideology. The resulting instability of the population programmes is analyzed in terms of: a) the rivalry between the separate population and health programmes within government; b) the politically charged problem of over-centralized federal control over population; c) the unresolved and uneasy working rela-tionship between government and non-government organizations. The paper concludes that the con-flicts in these areas are directly related to the larger policy context in which they have evolved, and without addressing the latter, the <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> will remain victim to deep-rooted structural problems...|$|E
40|$|Population {{programmes}} in {{many developing}} countries have emphasised on family planning services driven largely by numbers and demographic targets. With the advent of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, it has been recognised to move beyond a narrow focus on family planning to a more comprehensive concern of reproductive health oriented towards meeting the needs of individuals and families. This advocated shift in population and development strategy, especially in health emphasises that services be offered to women, men and adolescents with a special focus on fulfilling women’s health needs, safeguarding their reproductive rights and involving men as equal partners in meeting the goal of responsible parenthood [United Nations (1995) ]. In response to ICPD’s mandate, Pakistan’s <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> has increasingly been focussed on various aspects of reproductive health and {{is in the process of}} broadening the scope of services for a transition to reproductive health without losing focus on achieving fertility reduction goal. In this regard, the government has adopted a comprehensive population and development policy incorporating an array of reproductive health services and has integrated population and health departments and their activities in dealing with RH problems. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOrganised {{screening}} programmes {{have been}} remarkably successful in reducing incidence and mortality from cervical cancer, while opportunistic screening varies in its effectiveness. Experts recommend that cervical screening or HPV testing {{be carried out}} only {{in the context of}} an organised programme. We sought to answer the following study questions: What does it mean for a cervical screening programme to be organised? Is there a place for opportunistic screening (in an organised programme) ? We reviewed 154 peer-reviewed papers on organised and opportunistic approaches to cervical screening published between 1970 and 2014 to understand how the term ‘organised’ is used, formally and in practice. We found that despite broad recognition of a prescriptive definition of organisation, in practice the meaning of organisation is much less clear. Our review revealed descriptions of organised programmes that differ significantly from prescribed norms and from each other, and a variety of ways that opportunistic and organised programmes intersect. We describe the breadth of the variation in cervical cancer screening programmes and examine the relationships and overlaps between organised and opportunistic screening. Implications emerging from the review include the need to better understand the breadth of organisation in practice, the drivers and impacts of opportunistic screening and the impact of opportunistic screening on <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> outcomes. Appreciation of the complexity of cervical screening programmes will benefit both screeners and women as programmes are changed to reflect a partially vaccinated population, new evidence and new technologies...|$|E
40|$|For Mexico, as {{for most}} {{countries}} in the world, the 20 th century will have been the century of demographic transition, characterised by population growth rates hitherto unknown. The decline in mortality, {{which began in the}} 1930 s, preceded the decline in fertility by approximately thirty years, thus explaining why the population increased at such a pace [1]. In spite of the million deaths during the Mexican Revolution (the armed phase of which lasted from 1910 to 1918), in 2001 the country had eight times more inhabitants than in 1913 : a hundred million compared with thirteen million (Figure 1). 150 million announced forty years ago The figure of one hundred million inhabitants was reached between April and October 2001, according to the authors (1). But the accuracy of the date is of little consequence given the fact that this figure was reached ten years later than forecasted by projections made in the 1960 s. Had fertility continued at the level estimated at the time, the population would have doubled in twenty years and there would be at least 150 million Mexicans today. According to the low variant, the projections still announced 132 million inhabitants for 2000. It is true it was difficult to imagine a decline in growth: at the time the population was growing by 3. 5 % every year, while official policy statements and legislation were openly pronatalist. Government policy changed drastically in 1973 with the passing of a general law on population that opened the way to family planning programmes, the firm intention being to reduce fertility. Following this law the National <b>Population</b> <b>Programme</b> for 1976 - 1982 was aimed a...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{consider}} all the historical {{reasons for the}} slow growth of colposcopy through a brief biography of Hinselmann. The history of colposcopy is beginning in March 1924. In the first experiments, colposcopic examination {{was almost impossible to}} perform because of the distance from the focus, that was no more than 80 mm. Hinselmann tried to solve this problem by pulling out the uterine cervix. The examined part is anemised by this procedure, which can prejudice the final result and a small amount of blood might leak as well. Beside that, a patient can feel pain if the portio is held by a thin forceps. The colposcopy, established in Germany, had spread throughout slowly its motherland, probably thanks to the many mistakes caused by Hinselmann himself: a) a technique proposed and almost exclusively intended for early discovery of cervical carcinoma; b) very authoritative imposition of terms, especially histological, which caused resistance by hystopathologists possibly induced by the fear of loosing their prestige who considered them too complex; c) his stubbornness in considering leukoplakia as precancerous lesion imposed him a lot of opponents; d) until the 1950 's there had not yet been any adequate didactic material at the disposal of numerous gynaecologists; e) Hinselmann’s temper, described by Wespi as a mixture of innocence and missionary eagerness, had not prepared him for dialogue and compromise. Conclusion. It might seem surprising that colposcopy, accurate in detecting all benign lesions and initial atypical atypical transformations, and perfectly capable of pointing safe biopsy in cases of suspicious lesions, did not develop as it should have a method whose function is of great importance in the prevention and treatment of CIN. Despite the role and the importance of cytology in the realization of the <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> of cervical cancer detection, the colposcopy allows the precise diagnosis among women with abnormal pap smears...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe and discuss two documents produced by the New Zealand Ministry of Health concerning the monitoring of outcomes of public health programs. The New Zealand Government is increasingly expecting planners and managers of publicly funded services to shift their focus from the delivery of ‘outputs’ towards achievement of ‘outcomes’. Intervention logic models and outcomes monitoring are promoted by central government agencies as suitable management methods for implementing the change. [1 - 3]Methods: To help managers design and implement comprehensive, effective and measurable <b>population</b> health <b>programmes</b> the Ministry of Health recently published two guidance documents. The first document provided guidance about how to plan programmes using a generic logic model approach. [4] The second set out in detail a process on how to monitor <b>population</b> health <b>programmes.</b> [5] The intent of the documents was to help managers navigate between the heights of technical rigour and the swamps of reality in the delivery of <b>population</b> health <b>programmes.</b> [6]Results: A number of issues and implications for how <b>population</b> health <b>programmes</b> are planned monitored and performance assessed have been identified by the guidance documents. Issues include the problem of small numbers, understanding the difference between outcomes monitoring and traditional forms of evaluation, and outcomes monitoring being seen as a tool for punitive performance management rather than ‘continuous programme improvement’. Implications include more time spent on the design of programmes. Planners will need to focus upon better sequencing of activities, setting more specific and time limited goals, and to be more informed about how to use research to inform the selection of interventions. Conclusions: The guidance documents promoted by the Ministry of Health have provided useful advice about how to develop and use logic models and outcomes monitoring in the planning of <b>population</b> health <b>programmes.</b> Practitioners particularly welcomed the inclusion of a glossary that included explanatory comments and examples. Two key issues have been identified with the application of outcomes monitoring that need to be managed. The first is the issue of statistically small numbers associated with relatively rare health events. The second is to promote outcomes monitoring as a tool for continuous programme improvement, rather than as a potentially punitive...|$|R

40|$|The Pasi {{share with}} most of the lower caste rural people the problem of rapidly growing population. Population policy of the Indian- Government has failed to {{initiate}} fertility decline under present conditions of Pasi existence. The people have not responded to the programme primarily because birth control contradicts the vital interest of the Pasi population. The Pasi favour large families because they are essential for economic survival. Their subsistence economy is based on man-power and every farmer knows that if he is to survive he must rely upon his family for the necessary labour force. The fact that the family is the basic unit of work has important fertility implications. Since it is the source of economic and physical security in the village, children, especially sons, are vital to the Pasi people. Therefore institutional and organizational characteristics such as extended family structure, male dominant authority-pattern, early entry into marriage and home-based role for women, encourage high fertility. The necessary conditions for the acceptance of the <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> do not exist in the Pasi community. A great majority of the people do not favour a small family. Although a Family Planning and Welfare Clinic is attached to each village, only a small minority of the Pasi women have any knowledge of modern means of contraception. The structural and organizational characteristics of the Pasi are such that the values and knowledge about family planning cannot be realized and expedited by the young couples. The locus of authority even in decision-making regarding fertility matters resides not with the young couple but with the older members of the family. The study confirms that socio-economic change is the basis for an effective solution of population problems and points out that factors promoting socio-economic development also encourage the successful implementation of family planning...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. (Social Work) The problem {{stated by}} the {{candidate}} is twofold: * family planning programmes {{throughout the world}} have generally been unsuccessful; * the question arises as to whether social workers can contribute to family planning and population programmes and what such contribution should comprise. Family planning organisers are confronted with various problems when initiating a family planning programme and trying {{to ensure that it}} will function effectively - identifying the target group in terms of numbers and demographic and social characteristics; motivating the target group towards active participation in the family planning programme; motivation for active participation in the family planning programme by the target group, and maintaining of the contraceptive regimen by those already engaged in the family planning programme. Official statistics and research findings in respect of the first two problems are available in South Africa; no adequate information exists in regard to the latter problem according to which programme organisers can plan and operate. A review of research on family planning and population programmes conducted in South Africa and other countries was undertaken. This includes a study of the findings of various KAP investigations. An empirical investigation was undertaken on an aspect in the field of study of which there is insufficient knowledge - a study that is an individual contribution towards existing knowledge. On numerous occasions in this thesis it becomes evident that social workers, by virtue of their special knowledge, values and skills, can make a unique and professional contribution to the dissemination of family planning. One of the particular skills of the social worker is that of conducting interviews. The social worker also has the ability to motivate people towards change in their behaviour. The social worker can therefore, through personal interviewing, guidance and motivation of people, contribute to the expansion of the <b>population</b> <b>programme</b> in general and the family planning programme in particular [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this lecture {{is to make a}} case for an {{integrated}} and effective population policy in Pakistan. An effective population policy is critical in its own right. It is also essential for maximising the positive outcome of all of Pakistan’s development efforts. Despite some very modest progress, the overall population growth rate is still so high that it warrants serious concern. Among the top ten contributors to world population growth during 1995 – 2000, Pakistan stood third in absolute number, and was Number One in rate of growth. The average total fertility rate per woman of 5. 2 in Pakistan, as compared to 2. 4 in Indonesia, 2. 9 in Iran, and 3. 1 in India, is indeed problematic and requires an appropriate policy response. A broader view of population growth and economic development is suggested instead of a narrow family planning focus. Thus family planning programmes (supply-side) would be effective only when the population at large has the desire or motivation for smaller families (demand-side). It is shown that the demand-side of the equation is influenced by a host of social, cultural, religious, educational, and other factors. For purposes of this paper, all these are taken together and termed the knowledge factor. It is suggested that a successful population policy must have a clear focus on increasing the knowledge factor in the country through education and advocacy. Based on the policy experiences of other developing countries and the recent demographic realities in Pakistan, an effective population policy must address the following three objectives: (a) reduction in the rate and incidence of unwanted fertility; (b) reduction in demand for large-size families; and (c) greater investment in adolescents to tackle the population momentum problem. The lecture concludes that Pakistan still has a population problem that it must deal with by a comprehensive and effective <b>population</b> <b>programme.</b> Failure to do so would magnify the current problems which are a result of previous policy neglect. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims al {{presenting}} all ecomomic {{analysis of}} Pakistan Governmentâ€™s investment in <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> {{during the period}} 1965 - 88. Economic analysis ill {{the context of this}} research implies an estimation of economic returns from public expenditure on the government Os approved population control measures. It may be asked as to what precisely economic returns mean and how they are assessed. To answer this question the present study has cast a look at the current demographic literature which reveals that quantitatively speaking. economic benefits of a population control program can be ascertained by measuring anyone of the following:- (i) Contribution of <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> in the form of lower fertility rates to the achievement of a nationâ€™s overall economic goals as given in its five year plans. (ii) Changes in the knowledge, altitude and practice of family planning and its resultant economic impact in the form of better nutrition, more savings. Higher consumption and similar type of benefits. (iii) Saving in public expenditure on social overheads like schools, hospitals. housing and transport because of reduced rate of population growth. (iv) Monetary benefits due to averted births made possible by population control measures. These monetary benefits can he viewed from a number or angles like higher per capita income. more capital formation or reduced unemployment. This research show that the last method of measuring economic returns is relatively more free of flaws from which other methods suffer. Take. for example. The first method. It requires the measurement of demographic impact of the family planning programme in the form of reduced birth rates. But decline in birth rate is dependent on many factors. family planning being only one of them. Even if birth rates do not show any significant downward trend. <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> may still be exerting powerful influence in counteracting. the effects of declining mortality rates. As against this. decline in birth rates may he due to changes in social and economic determinants of fertility or cultural factors influencing breast-feeding practices, age at marriage. gainful employment of women in economic fields and female literacy rates. As the type of data required for isolating these influences to assess the net contribution of <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> was not available in Pakistan at the time this study was initiated. this approach was not attempted. The second method of assessing economic returns cannot accurately depict the contribution of <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> because change in attitudes and use of contraceptives cannot he ascribed merely to efforts of population control network in the country. Other intermediate variables. e. g. education. audio-visual aids. exposure to western ways of life and a multiplicity of other factors can also be responsible for a change in attitudes. So this type of assessment was also not considered. The third method of assessment in terms of savings in public expenditure due to lesser demand for social overheads also lacks precision. Social overheads include schools. hospitals. means of transport and housing. An attempt to measure economic returns by this method can only partially depict the benefits from <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> because of the difficulties of identifying and estimating all relevant variables. Hence this approach was also not found suitable {{for the purpose of this}} research. The fourth method focusing on calculation of births averted because of the <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> docs not seem to suffer from any of the imperfections mentioned with reference to other methods. So this study focused on the calculation of the monetary benefits of averted births for an assessment of economic returns. This disseration is divided into four parts. each having a different theme within the overall framework of the study in a logical sequence. Benefit/cost calculations as well as other mathematical derivations and application of multiple regression analysis are based on data tabulated in appendices A,B. C,O,E,F,G and H. Abbreviations and glossary of some relevant demographic terms are also appended. PART-I This part consists of chapter I which focuses on the vitally crucial role of two interacting sets of variables i. e. economic development and population growth. Theory of demographic transition and vicious circle of poverty has also been discussed in this context. The objective of this disseration of developing an economic rationale for further investment in <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> of Pakistan has been corroborated as well. PART-II Conceptual framework of this study is discussed in this part consisting of chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5. In chapter 2. an overview of a few evaluative techniques attempting economic evaluation of <b>population</b> control <b>programmes</b> is given. In chapter 3. Some models attempting economic analysis of <b>population</b> control <b>programmes</b> in other countries have been reviewed briefly. Coale and Hoover's model. has neglected cost of <b>population</b> control <b>programme.</b> George B. Simmons. in a refined version of Coale & Hooverâ€™s model. included the cost element but did not calculate the net survivors of averted births of the previous time periods which have been included in the present model. In Enkeâ€™s model. cost was defined as the loss of productive services of the unborn child. whereas benefits were defined as difference between consumption and production of the unborn. Consumption would have strarted at 7. ero age whereas production could start at age fifteen or above. Difference between the two magnitudes was the upper limit of the money bonus which could be given to contracepting parents. Zaidanâ€™s model was based on the framework constructed by Enke with some refinements. Roth Enkeâ€™s and Zaidanâ€™s models do not include the expenditure on <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> as part of the cost. which has been included in the present model. Robinsonâ€™s model does not contain any of the flaws mentioned above but requires data of the type not available in Pakistan. Models put forward by Simon. Bower and Demeny have also been briefly discussed in this chapter. In chapter 4. a review of studies aimed at evaluation of <b>population</b> control <b>programme</b> of Pakistan has been done. The degree of over-estimation of output data generated by the population control network has been estimated by Farooqui and Soomro as 41...|$|R
