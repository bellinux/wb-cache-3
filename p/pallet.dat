5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance <b>pallet</b> to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the <b>pallet</b> to four rather than six aircraft. The reconnaissance <b>pallet</b> contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the <b>pallet.</b> When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc <b>pallet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cylinders must {{be secured}} so that they cannot move during transport. They shall not project beyond the sides or ends of the vehicle. It is {{recommended}} that cylinders are transported vertically, secured in an appropriate <b>pallet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Australian {{standard}} <b>pallets</b> {{are defined}} by Australian Standard AS:4068-1993 Flat <b>pallets</b> for materials handling. [...] They are usually manufactured in Hardwood, but 1165 × 1165 mm <b>pallets</b> can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as disposable <b>pallets</b> using 16 millimetre boards. Australian standard <b>pallets</b> are extensively used in Australian storage and warehousing as racking <b>pallets</b> {{because they can be}} removed from transport directly onto warehouse racking for storage.|$|R
50|$|Four-way <b>pallets,</b> or <b>pallets</b> {{for heavy}} loads (or {{general-purpose}} systems {{that might have}} heavy loads) are best lifted by their more rigid stringers. These <b>pallets</b> are usually heavier, bigger and more durable than two-way <b>pallets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Plastic <b>pallets</b> are {{produced}} and used widely in the U.S. and Europe, {{spurred by the}} adoption of the ISPM 15. A full comparison of wood vs plastic can be made by a life cycle analysis. Plastic <b>pallets</b> can cost 10 times as much as hardwood <b>pallets</b> and even more expensive compared to cheap expendable softwood <b>pallets.</b> RFID chips can be molded into the <b>pallets</b> to monitor locations and track inventory.|$|R
5|$|The orbiter {{carried the}} Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) <b>pallet</b> in its forward payload bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry test equipment. The <b>pallet</b> was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments. The first studied the interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with the structural materials of the orbiter and payload, while the second tested {{the performance of a}} heat pipe designed for use in the heat rejection systems of future spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is a mechanical or tracker action. Connection is achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its <b>pallet,</b> allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{cooperation}} with the US Postal Service, the mission also carried 260,000 postal covers franked with $9.35 express postage stamps, which were to be sold to collectors, with the profits divided between the USPS and NASA. Two storage boxes were attached to the DFI <b>pallet,</b> with more stored in six of the Getaway Special canisters.|$|E
5000|$|Slightly {{more complex}} {{hardwood}} block <b>pallets,</b> plastic <b>pallets</b> and metal <b>pallets</b> can be lifted from all four sides. These costlier <b>pallets</b> usually require a deposit and are {{returned to the}} sender or resold as used. Many [...] "four way" [...] <b>pallets</b> are color-coded according to the loads they can bear, and other attributes. Wood <b>pallets</b> can pose serious bio-hazard risks as they are susceptible to bacterial and chemical contamination, such as E. coli problems in food and produce transportation, and even insect infestation, and thus the need for ISPM 15.|$|R

5|$|Banagher has a {{thriving}} poetry scene {{and an annual}} poetry festival called Readings from the <b>Pallet</b> takes place in local bars. The town {{was one of the}} settings for the series Pure Mule, as featured on RTÉ television. The mini-series was an RTÉ production and shot in 2005 in Banagher, Birr and Tullamore. The series was favourably received by the critics, although some locals maintain that it portrays Midlanders in a bad light. The series won four IFTA awards in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every type of container and <b>pallet,</b> and a side door {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a <b>pallet</b> to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheapest}} <b>pallets</b> {{are made}} of softwood and are often considered expendable, to be discarded as trash along with other wrapping elements, {{at the end of}} the trip. These <b>pallets</b> are simple stringer <b>pallets,</b> and liftable from two sides.|$|R

5|$|The player {{begins in}} their {{hometown}} of <b>Pallet</b> Town. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them alone {{can be very}} dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon {{and will continue to}} battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{protagonist of}} FireRed and LeafGreen {{is a child}} {{who lives in a}} small town named <b>Pallet</b> Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher, {{explains}} to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels.

5|$|In {{the world}} of Pokémon, boys and girls {{at the age of}} ten can get their {{official}} license to become Pokémon trainers, and Ash Ketchum of <b>Pallet</b> Town is about to receive his very first Pokémon from Professor Oak. On the morning of the day that he is supposed to get his first Pokémon, it is revealed that Ash has accidentally broken his alarm clock and oversleeps. When he wakes up, he runs in his pajamas to Professor Oak's laboratory where Ash runs into his rival and the Professor's grandson, Gary Oak. Gary proceeds to taunt Ash for arriving to the ceremony late and brags about having already received his first Pokémon. When Ash enters Professor Oak's lab to receive his Pokémon, he is told that all three starter Pokémon have already been taken. Ash pleads for any Pokémon and Oak replies that he still has one left. Ash does not care and receives the Pokémon, which {{turns out to be the}} electric-type Pokémon Pikachu. Ash thinks that it is cute, but it gives him an electric shock when he picks it up to hug it. Oak gives Ash a Pokédex and six Poké Balls before he heads out on his journey to become the greatest Pokémon trainer of all time.|$|E

5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The <b>pallet</b> slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the more}} relaxed days, the Japanese {{logistics}} carrier was attached to the Japanese Exposed Facility. The cargo <b>pallet</b> was unberthed from the shuttle by the shuttle's robotic arm and handed to the station's robotic arm which then soft fixed it temporarily to the facility. After the experiments, containing an X-ray astronomy payload, a space environment monitor and a communications system, are installed the <b>pallet</b> will be returned to Earth by the shuttle.|$|E

25|$|X-rays: high-energy X-rays (produced by bremsstrahlung) allow {{irradiation}} {{of large}} packages and <b>pallet</b> loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple <b>pallet</b> loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization {{does not require}} chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an X-ray generator that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-energy electrons in {{a process known as}} bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.|$|E
40|$|Closed-loop {{production}} systems {{are used in}} many factories, e. g., machining, adhesive manufacturing, plastic forming and assembly factories. In these systems, many <b>pallets,</b> jigs or molds circulate and are used repeatedly, and the number affects the system production rate. In this paper, we analyze {{the effect of a}} number of <b>pallets</b> and system parameters on the production rate, and present the existence of the optimum number of <b>pallets</b> which yields the maximum production rate. Next, we propose an approximation method for estimating the optimum number of <b>pallets,</b> for which the estimation error is very small and the estimated number gives almost the same production rate as that yielded by the optimum number of <b>pallets...</b>|$|R
