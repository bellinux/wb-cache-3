As used in homes, they are often small, sealed, and rated {{at a fraction of}} a horsepower, but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the electric motor is usually separated from the pump body by some form of mechanical coupling. The sealed units used in home applications often have the motor rotor, pump impeller, and support bearings combined and sealed within the water circuit. This avoids one of the principal challenges faced by the larger, two-part pumps: maintaining a water-tight seal {{at the point where the}} <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> enters the pump body.|$|E
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} May 1915, {{while it}} was based at Douai with Feldflieger Abteilung 62, the Fokker factory {{outfitted}} Parschau's aircraft with the first trial version of the Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer and a Parabellum MG14 light machine gun, leaving the wing panels in the stock A.III airframe's [...] "shoulder-winged" [...] location while armed and in Parschau's use in May and June 1915. Parschau made several attempts at aerial combat during June 1915, but at this stage the gear proved very unreliable, the Parabellum gun repeatedly jamming in action. As no photos exist verifying any change in wing-panel anchorage location for Parschau's A.16/15 aircraft before its return to the Fokker factory a second time {{to serve as the}} [...] "prototype" [...] Eindecker airframe, the belief that it had been modified to have the standard mid-fuselage location used on the later production E.I airframes before its second return to the Fokker factory has not yet been proven, as it was lowered some time after the Fokker factory had received it back to be retained there, following Parschau's final use of it. The mid-fuselage wing mount modification was not fitted to the initial batch of five M.5K/MG production prototypes as originally built, with Otto Parschau's second Eindecker, the first M.5K/MG built bearing IdFlieg serial E.1/15 uniquely getting it sometime while in service. Production E.Is, and all further Fokker Eindeckers, were also fitted with the definitive version of the Stangensteuerung gear, with a large cam wheel replacing the early drive taken from the oil <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

30|$|Another {{possible}} {{option is}} the feed <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by the <b>shaft</b> {{of the main}} turbine. The pump can be joined to the turbine shaft either at the high- or low-pressure turbine side. Both solutions {{were used in the}} past, but both increased costs and the turbo set complexity. A gear had to be applied because of the difference in the speed of the turbo set and the pump. As these solutions involved a bigger investment outlay and higher operational costs, they are no longer used. Their substantial drawback was also the forced and extremely unfavorable location of the feed pump in the powerhouse which caused additional construction problems.|$|R
40|$|Several {{modifications}} {{have been}} made to the design and operation of an extended-shaft cryogenic pump to increase the efficiency of pumping. In general, the efficiency of pumping a cryogenic fluid is limited by thermal losses which is itself caused by pump inefficiency and leakage of heat through the pump structure. A typical cryogenic <b>pump</b> includes a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and two main concentric static components (an outer pressure containment tube and an intermediate static support tube) made from stainless steel. The modifications made include replacement of the stainless-steel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and the concentric static stainless-steel components with components made of a glass/epoxy composite. The leakage of heat is thus reduced because the thermal conductivity of the composite is an order of magnitude below that of stainless steel. Taking advantage of the margin afforded by the decrease in thermal conductivity, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> could be shortened to increase its effective stiffness, thereby increasing the rotordynamic critical speeds, thereby further making it possible to operate the pump at a higher speed to increase pumping efficiency. During the modification effort, an analysis revealed that substitution of the shorter glass/epoxy shaft for the longer stainless-steel shaft was not, by itself, sufficient to satisfy the rotordynamic requirements at the desired increased speed. Hence, it became necessary to increase the stiffness of the composite shaft. This stiffening was accomplished by means of a carbon-fiber-composite overwrap along most of the length of the shaft. Concomitantly with the modifications described thus far, it was necessary to provide for joining the composite-material components with metallic components required by different aspects of the pump design. An adhesive material formulated specially to bond the composite and metal components was chosen as a means to satisfy these requirements...|$|R

50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical <b>pumps</b> are used, <b>driven</b> by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to <b>drive</b> the <b>pump</b> from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> <b>driven</b> by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R

Substitution of composite material over the conventional steel material for <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has increasing the advantages of design due to its high specific stiffness and strength. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{the main component of}} drive system of an automobile. Use of conventional steel for manufacturing of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has many disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength. Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency.

Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.
