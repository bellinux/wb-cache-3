Littré's volume) and in print, his high approval of it (especially of the Inductive part) as a real contribution to the construction of the <b>Positive</b> <b>Method.</b> But we cannot discover that he was indebted to it for a single idea, or that it influenced, in the smallest particular, the course of his subsequent speculations.|$|E
60|$|How the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> of {{observation}} and verification of real facts has landed us in this, and much else {{of the same}} kind, is extremely hard to guess. Seriously to examine an encyclopædic system, that touches life, society, and knowledge at every point, is evidently beyond the compass of such an article as this. There is in every chapter {{a whole group of}} speculative suggestions, each of which would need a long chapter to itself to elaborate or to discuss. There is at least one biological speculation of astounding audacity that could be examined in nothing less than a treatise. Perhaps we have said enough to show that after performing a great and real service to thought, Comte almost sacrificed his claims to gratitude by the invention of a system that, as such, and independently of detached suggestions, is markedly retrograde. But the world has strong self-protecting qualities. It will take what is available in Comte, while forgetting that in his work which is as irrational in one way as Hegel is in another.|$|E
6000|$|And what Organon for {{the study}} of [...] "the moral and {{intellectual}} functions" [...] does M. Comte offer, in lieu of the direct mental observation which he repudiates? We are almost ashamed to say, that it is Phrenology! Not, indeed, he says, as a science formed, but as one still to be created; for he rejects almost all the special organs imagined by phrenologists, and accepts only their general division of the brain into the three regions of the propensities, the sentiments, and the intellect,[13] and the subdivision of the latter region between the organs of meditation and those of observation. Yet this mere first outline of an apportionment of the mental functions among different organs, he regards as extricating the mental study of man from the metaphysical stage, and elevating it to the positive. The condition of mental science would be sad indeed if this were its best chance of being positive; for the later course of physiological observation and speculation has not tended to confirm, but to discredit, the phrenological hypothesis. And even if that hypothesis were true, psychological observation would still be necessary; for how is it possible to ascertain the correspondence between two things, by observation of only one of them? To establish a relation between mental functions and cerebral conformations, requires not only a parallel system of observations applied to each, but (as M. Comte himself, with some inconsistency, acknowledges) an analysis of the mental faculties, [...] "des diverses facultés élémentaires," [...] (iii. 573), conducted without any reference to the physical conditions, since the proof of the theory would lie in the correspondence between the division of the brain into organs and that of the mind into faculties, each shown by separate evidence. To accomplish this analysis requires direct psychological study carried to a high pitch of perfection; it being necessary, among other things, to investigate the degree in which mental character is created by circumstances, since no one supposes that cerebral conformation does all, and circumstances nothing. The phrenological study of Mind thus supposes as its necessary preparation the whole of the Association psychology. Without, then, rejecting any aid which study of the brain and nerves can afford to psychology (and it has afforded, and will yet afford, much), we may affirm that M. Comte has done nothing for the constitution of the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> of mental science. He refused to profit by the very valuable commencements made by his predecessors, especially by Hartley, Brown, and James Mill (if indeed any of those philosophers were known to him), and left the psychological branch of the <b>positive</b> <b>method,</b> as well as psychology itself, to be put in their true position as a part of Positive Philosophy by successors who duly placed themselves at the twofold point of view of physiology and psychology, Mr Bain and Mr Herbert Spencer. This great mistake is not a mere hiatus in M. Comte's system, but the parent of serious errors in his attempt to create a Social Science. He is indeed very skilful in estimating the effect of circumstances in moulding the general character of the human race; were he not, his historical theory could be of little worth: but in appreciating the influence which circumstances exercise, through psychological laws, in producing diversities of character, collective or individual, he is sadly at fault.|$|E

60|$|The {{first and}} {{greatest}} {{aim of the}} Positive Philosophy is to advance the study of society into the third of the three stages,--to remove social phenomena from the sphere of theological and metaphysical conceptions, and to introduce among them the same scientific observation of their laws which has given us physics, chemistry, physiology. Social physics will consist of the conditions and relations of the facts of society, and will have two departments,--one statical, containing the laws of order; the other dynamical, containing the laws of progress. While men's minds were in the theological state, political events, for example, were explained by {{the will of the}} gods, and political authority based on divine right. In the metaphysical state of mind, then, to retain our instance, political authority was based on the sovereignty of the people, and social facts were explained by the figment of a falling away from a state of nature. When the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> has been finally extended to society, as it has been to chemistry and physiology, these social facts will be resolved, as their ultimate analysis, into relations with one another, and instead of seeking causes in the old sense of the word, men will only examine the conditions of social existence. When that stage has been reached not merely the greater part, but the whole, of our knowledge will be impressed with one character--the character, namely, of positivity or scientificalness; and all our conceptions in every part of knowledge will be thoroughly homogeneous. The gains of such a change are enormous. The new philosophical unity will now in its turn regenerate all the elements that went to its own formation. The mind will pursue knowledge without the wasteful jar and friction of conflicting methods and mutually hostile conceptions; education will be regenerated; and society will reorganise itself on the only possible solid base--a homogeneous philosophy.|$|E
6000|$|Let us notice, finally, the {{important}} {{fact that the}} appearance of Rousseau's Discourses was {{the first sign of}} reaction against the historic mode of inquiry into society that had been initiated by Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws was published in 1748, with a truly prodigious effect. It coloured the whole of the social literature in France {{during the rest of the}} century. A history of its influence would be a history of one of the most important sides of speculative activity. In the social writings of Rousseau himself there is hardly a chapter which does not contain tacit reference to Montesquieu's book. The Discourses were the beginning of a movement in an exactly opposite direction; that is, away from patient collection of wide multitudes of facts relating to the conditions of society, towards the promulgation of arbitrary systems of absolute social dogmas. Mably, the chief dogmatic socialist of the century, and one of the most dignified and austere characters, is an important example of the detriment done by the influence of Rousseau to that of Montesquieu, in the earlier stages of the conflict between the two schools. Mably (1709-1785), of whom the remark is to be made that he was for some years behind the scenes of government as De Tencin's secretary and therefore was versed in affairs, began his inquiries with Greece and Rome. [...] "You will find everything in ancient history," [...] he said.[195] And he remained entirely in this groove of thought until Rousseau appeared. He then gradually left Montesquieu. [...] "To find the duties of a legislator," [...] he said, [...] "I descend into the abysses of my heart, I study my sentiments." [...] He opposed the Economists, the other school that was feeling its way imperfectly enough to a <b>positive</b> <b>method.</b> [...] "As soon as I see landed property established," [...] he wrote, [...] "then I see unequal fortunes; and from these unequal fortunes must there not necessarily result different and opposed interests, all the vices of riches, all the vices of poverty, the brutalisation of intelligence, the corruption of civil manners?" [...] and so forth.[196] In his most important work, published in 1776, we see Rousseau's notions developed, with a logic from which their first author shrunk, either from fear, or more probably from want of firmness and consistency as a reasoner. [...] "It is to equality that nature has attached the preservation of our social faculties and happiness: and from this I conclude that legislation will only be taking useless trouble, unless all its attention is first of all directed to the establishment of equality in the fortune and condition of citizens."[197] That is to say not only political equality, but economic communism. [...] "What miserable folly, that persons who pass for philosophers should go on repeating after one another that without property there can be no society. Let us leave illusion. It is property that divides us into two classes, rich and poor; the first will alway prefer their fortune to that of the state, while the second will never love a government or laws that leave them in misery."[198] This was the kind of opinion for which Rousseau's diffuse and rhetorical exposition of social necessity had prepared France some twenty years before. After powerfully helping the process of general dissolution, it produced the first fruits specifically after its own kind some twenty years later in the system of Baboeuf.[199] ...|$|E
60|$|After so {{profound}} and comprehensive {{a view of}} the progress of human society in the past, of which the future can only be a prolongation, it is natural to ask, to what use does he put this survey as a basis of practical recommendations? Such recommendations he certainly makes, though, in the present Treatise, they are of a much less definite character than in his later writings. But we miss a necessary link; there is a break in the otherwise close concatenation of his speculations. We fail to see any scientific connexion between his theoretical explanation of the past progress of society, and his proposals for future improvement. The proposals are not, as we might expect, recommended as that towards which human society has been tending and working through the whole of history. It is thus that thinkers have usually proceeded, who formed theories for the future, grounded on historical analysis of the past. Tocqueville, for example, and others, finding, as they thought, through all history, a steady progress in the direction of social and political equality, argued that to smooth this transition, and make the best of what is certainly coming, is the proper employment of political foresight. We do not find M. Comte supporting his recommendations by a similar line of argument. They rest as completely, each on its separate reasons of supposed utility, as with philosophers who, like Bentham, theorize on politics without any historical basis at all. The only bridge of connexion which leads from his historical speculations to his practical conclusions, is the inference, that since the old powers of society, both in the region of thought and of action, are declining and destined to disappear, leaving only the two rising powers, positive thinkers on the one hand, leaders of industry on the other, the future necessarily belongs to these: spiritual power to the former, temporal to the latter. As a specimen of historical forecast this is very deficient; for are there not the masses as well as the leaders of industry? and is not theirs also a growing power? Be this as it may, M. Comte's conceptions of the mode in which these growing powers should be organized and used, are grounded on anything rather than on history. And we cannot but remark a singular anomaly in a thinker of M. Comte's calibre. After the ample evidence he has brought forward of the slow growth of the sciences, all of which except the mathematico-astronomical couple are still, as he justly thinks, in a very early stage, it yet appears as if, to his mind, the mere institution of a positive science of sociology were tantamount to its completion; as if all the diversities of opinion on the subject, which set mankind at variance, were solely owing to its having been studied in the theological or the metaphysical manner, and as if when the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> which has raised up real sciences on other subjects of knowledge, is similarly employed on this, divergence would at once cease, and the entire body of positive social inquirers would exhibit as much agreement in their doctrines as those who cultivate any of the sciences of inorganic life. Happy would be the prospects of mankind if this were so. A time such as M. Comte reckoned upon may come; unless something stops the progress of human improvement, it is sure to come: but after an unknown duration of hard thought and violent controversy. The period of decomposition, which has lasted, on his own computation, {{from the beginning of the}} fourteenth century to the present, is not yet terminated: the shell of the old edifice will remain standing until there is another ready to replace it; and the new synthesis is barely begun, nor is even the preparatory analysis completely finished. On other occasions M. Comte is very well aware that the Method of a science is not the science itself, and that when the difficulty of discovering the right processes has been overcome, there remains a still greater difficulty, that of applying them. This, which is true of all sciences, is truest of all in Sociology. The facts being more complicated, and depending on a greater concurrence of forces, than in any other science, the difficulty of treating them deductively is proportionally increased, while the wide difference between any one case and every other in some of the circumstances which affect the result, makes the pretence of direct induction usually no better than empiricism. It is therefore, out of all proportion, more uncertain than in any other science, whether two inquirers equally competent and equally disinterested will take the same view of the evidence, or arrive at the same conclusion. When to this intrinsic difficulty is added the infinitely greater extent to which personal or class interests and predilections interfere with impartial judgment, the hope of such accordance of opinion among sociological inquirers as would obtain, in mere deference to their authority, the universal assent which M. Comte's scheme of society requires, must be adjourned to an indefinite distance.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Stress {{could be}} defined {{simply as the}} rate of {{wear and tear on}} the body systems caused by life. Stress at work is a big problem. Working in the {{profession}} of nursing is a demanding and often stressful occupation. Thus, nurses’ health could be affected by stress dangerous consequences. Coping strategies are key elements of nurses' stress reactions. Coping strategy as a stabilizing factor may be as important as the stressful event itself. Purpose: To determine how and how much nursing staff cope with the stressful events and to find out the relationships between job coping and health outcomes in the study population. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study included one hundred nursing staff working in two hospitals (Tohid and Besat) of Sanandaj City (Kurdistan, Iran). They completed the questionnaires containing coping strategies based on the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences (A-COPE), in the year of 2006. We examined the relationships between age, gender, position, tenure state, marriage state, job experience, work shift and place (environment) to application of coping methods. Analysis was done using SPSS 18. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0. 05. Results: Out of one hundred nurses of all grades included in this study, fifty-seven were female (57 %), 60 (%) were between 30 - 39 years old and 50 (%) were single. There {{was no significant difference between}} junior and senior staff in applying <b>positive</b> <b>methods</b> (p= 0. 666) or negative responses to cope with stress (p= 0. 195). The majority of nurses 55 (%) had job experience of 5 - 10 years, 40 (%) worked in the evening and night shift and 54 (%) were in Tohid hospital. Generally in our study, the rate of application <b>positive</b> <b>methods</b> of coping was good 19 %, medium 51 % and weak 30 %. Negative responses to stress were high 49 %, medium 29 % and low 22 %. There were significant associations between: age, tenure state, work place and job experience with positive coping as follow; (p= 0. 028), (P = 0. 006), (p= 0. 001) and (p= 0. 026), accordingly. In this study, those in the age of 30 - 39 years, officially (permanent) employed, working in Tohid hospital and had job experience of 5 - 9 years more used <b>positive</b> <b>methods</b> of coping. They more applied <b>positive</b> <b>methods</b> of: listening to music, reading, talking with the partner or a colleague and walking to cope with stress. This study showed significant differences between gender (p= 0. 000) and job experience (p= 0. 035) with negative response to stress. Males and those with low job experience (less than 5 years) were more disputatious and impatient, accordingly. Conclusions: Most of our research community coped with stress positively (70 %; good and moderate). Unfortunately 49 % of our study population had high level of negative responses. This study showed significant associations between both some personal information, i. e: age, job experience, tenure state and the environment with positive application of coping methods. From this study, We concluded that the way of response to stress in nursing staff depends not only to the personality and one`s defensive styles but also the healthcare work environment. There is a necessity to teach <b>positive</b> <b>methods</b> of coping to the nursing community as well as providing a proper environment of work. <br...|$|R

6000|$|We {{are afraid}} {{it must also}} be said, though shown only by slight {{indications}} in his fundamental work, and coming out in full evidence only in his later writings--that M. Comte, at bottom, was not so solicitous about completeness of proof as becomes a positive philosopher, and that the unimpeachable objectivity, as he would have called it, of a conception--its exact correspondence to the realities of outward fact--was not, with him, an indispensable condition of adopting it, if it was subjectively useful, by affording facilities to the mind for grouping phaenomena. This appears very curiously in his chapters on the philosophy of Chemistry. He recommends, as a judicious use of [...] "the degree of liberty left to our intelligence by the end and purpose of positive science," [...] that we should accept as a convenient generalization the doctrine that all chemical composition is between two elements only; that every substance which our analysis decomposes, let us say into four elements, has for its immediate constituents two hypothetical substances, each compounded of two simpler ones. There would have been nothing to object to in this as a scientific hypothesis, assumed tentatively as a means of suggesting experiments by which its truth may be tested. With this for its destination, the conception, would have been legitimate and philosophical; the more so, as, if confirmed, it would have afforded an explanation of the fact that some substances which analysis shows to be composed of the same elementary substances in the same proportions, differ in their general properties, as for instance, sugar and gum.[10] And if, besides affording a reason for difference between things which differ, the hypothesis had afforded a reason for agreement between things which agree; if the intermediate link by which the quaternary compound was resolved into two binary ones, could have been so chosen as to bring each of them within the analogies of some known class of binary compounds (which it is easy to suppose possible, and which in some particular instances actually happens);[11] the universality of binary composition would have been a successful example of an hypothesis in anticipation of a positive theory, to give a direction to inquiry which might end in its being either proved or abandoned. But M. Comte evidently thought that even though it should never be proved--however many cases of chemical composition might always remain in which the theory was still as hypothetical as at first--so long as it was not actually disproved (which it is scarcely {{in the nature of the}} case that it should ever be) it would deserve to be retained, for its mere convenience in bringing a large body of phaenomena under a general conception. In a résumé of the general principles of the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> at the end of the work, he claims, in express terms, an unlimited license of adopting [...] "without any vain scruple" [...] hypothetical conceptions of this sort; [...] "in order to satisfy, within proper limits, our just mental inclinations, which always turn, with an instinctive predilection, towards simplicity, continuity, and generality of conceptions, while always respecting the reality of external laws in so far as accessible to us" [...] (vi. 639). [...] "The most philosophic point of view leads us to conceive the study of natural laws as destined to represent the external world so as to give as much satisfaction to the essential inclinations of our intelligence, as is consistent with the degree of exactitude commanded by the aggregate of our practical wants" [...] (vi. 642). Among these [...] "essential inclinations" [...] he includes not only our [...] "instinctive predilection for order and harmony," [...] which makes us relish any conception, even fictitious, that helps to reduce phaenomena to system; but even our feelings of taste, [...] "les convenances purement esthétiques," [...] which, he says, have a legitimate part in the employment of the [...] "genre de liberté" [...] resté facultatif pour notre intelligence." [...] After the due satisfaction of our [...] "most eminent mental inclinations," [...] there will still remain [...] "a considerable margin of indeterminateness, which should be made use of to give a direct gratification to our besoin of ideality, by embellishing our scientific thoughts, without injury to their essential reality" [...] (vi. 647). In consistency with all this, M. Comte warns thinkers against too severe a scrutiny of the exact truth of scientific laws, and stamps with [...] "severe reprobation" [...] those who break down [...] "by too minute an investigation" [...] generalizations already made, without being able to substitute others (vi. 639): as in the case of Lavoisier's general theory of chemistry, which would have made that science more satisfactory than at present to [...] "the instinctive inclinations of our intelligence" [...] if it had turned out true, but unhappily it did not. These mental dispositions in M. Comte account for his not having found or sought a logical criterion of proof; but they are scarcely consistent with his inveterate hostility to the hypothesis of the luminiferous ether, which certainly gratifies our [...] "predilection for order and harmony," [...] not to say our [...] "besoin d'idéalite", in no ordinary degree. This notion of the [...] "destination" [...] of the study of natural laws is to our minds a complete dereliction of the essential principles which form the Positive conception of science; and contained the germ of the perversion of his own philosophy which marked his later years. It might be interesting, but scarcely worth while, to attempt to penetrate to the just thought which misled M. Comte, for there is almost always a grain of truth in the errors of an original and powerful mind. There is another grave aberration in M. Comte's view of the method of positive science, which though not more unphilosophical than the last mentioned, is of greater practical importance. He rejects totally, as an invalid process, psychological observation properly so called, or in other words, internal consciousness, at least as regards our intellectual operations. He gives no place in his series of the science of Psychology, and always speaks of it with contempt. The study of mental phaenomena, or, as he expresses it, of moral and intellectual functions, has a place in his scheme, under the head of Biology, but only as a branch of physiology. Our knowledge of the human mind must, he thinks, be acquired by observing other people. How we are to observe other people's mental operations, or how interpret the signs of them without having learnt what the signs mean by knowledge of ourselves, he does not state. But it is clear to him that we can learn very little about the feelings, and nothing at all about the intellect, by self-observation. Our intelligence can observe all other things, but not itself: we cannot observe ourselves observing, or observe ourselves reasoning: and if we could, attention to this reflex operation would annihilate its object, by stopping the process observed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of renal function, with particular attention to the effects of water load. Ten healthy volunteers underwent dynamic MR imaging after an injection of gadolinium diethylene-triaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) as a contrast agent to evaluate renal function by the following four methods: the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> [longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) shortening is the dominant effect], the negative method [transverse relaxation time (T 2) shortening is the dominant effect] and two intermediate methods by switching the Gd-DTPA concentrations used in the positive and negative methods. A prolonged cortical peak time and a reduced medullary peak level were observed by the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> under a dehydrated condition, suggesting that these variables were slightly influenced by Gd-DTPA concentrated in the medulla. By the negative method, low signals due to T 2 * (T 2 * is the effective transverse relaxation time, typically shorter than T 2) shortening appeared in the medulla under normal conditions, but these signals were unclear when the subject was under an overhydrated condition. These results indicate that water metabolism, in addition to imaging parameters and Gd-DTPA dose levels, should be considered when renal function is evaluated by dynamic MR imaging. Analysis of both the pattern of MR images and the time-signal intensity curves may be useful in the evaluation of renal function. The results also indicate that the <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> is preferred when the patient is overhydrated as it allows the evaluation of the local renal kinetic function by recording changes in the regional contrast agent levels. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: IBT is {{considered}} as a creative and <b>positive</b> <b>method</b> in teaching writing. Besides, {{it is also a}} useful teaching method for developing life-long learning competence for the learners. Pedagogically speaking, IBT method affects students’ ability in learning writing. Without a good teaching method, the students’ ability, creativity, and awareness in writing may decrease. Many students of Junior High School consider writing as a difficult skill to learn. Teacher should provide creative and innovative teaching methods, so the students do not indicate that they are indolent to practice writing. The paper highlights the nature of IBT, the realistic purpose of IBT, the importance of IBT in teaching writing, and the ideas about how to implement IBT for teaching writing in Indonesian Junior High School.

40|$|Campylobacter species, {{especially}} Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are a {{major cause}} of human bacterial enteritis. Current detection in stools is done essentially by culture on selective and nonselective media with filtration. These methods were compared to 2 molecular biology methods, an in-house real-time PCR and a multiplex PCR named Seeplex Diarrhea ACE Detection, and 3 immunoenzymatic methods, Premier Campy, RidaScreen Campylobacter, and ImmunoCard Stat!Campy. Out of 242 stool specimens tested, 23 (9. 5 %) fulfilled the positivity criteria, i. e., they were positive by one or both culture methods or, in case of a negative culture, by a <b>positive</b> molecular <b>method</b> and a <b>positive</b> immunoenzymatic <b>method.</b> The striking feature of this study is the low sensitivity of culture, in the range of 60 %, in contrast to immunoenzymatic and molecular tests...|$|R
