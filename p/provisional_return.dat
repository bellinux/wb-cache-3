Whilst possible, it is unlikely the ITU would hold more than one World Cup event in the United Kingdom in any one year.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist {{politics}} following his brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University {{for participating in}} protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, {{he was arrested for}} sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a <b>Provisional</b> Government, he <b>returned</b> to Russia to play {{a leading role in the}} October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.|$|R
50|$|The Bolshevik {{revolution}} found Kolchak in Japan {{and then}} Harbin in November 1917. As {{a supporter of}} the <b>Provisional</b> Government, he <b>returned</b> to Russia, through Vladivostok, in 1918. Kolchak was an absolute supporter of the Allied cause against Imperial Germany and regarded Russia's immediate withdrawal from the conflict as dishonorable. Upon hearing of the October Revolution, Kolchak offered to enlist in the British Army to continue the struggle. The British were inclined to accept Kolchak’s offer, and there were indeed plans to send Kolchak to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Ultimately, the British Foreign Office decided that Kolchak could do more for the Allied cause by toppling Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks and bringing Russia back into the war {{on the side of the}} Allies. Reluctantly, Kolchak accepted the British suggestions and with a heavy sense of foreboding returned to Russia. Arriving in Omsk, Siberia, en route to enlisting with the Volunteer Army, he agreed to become a minister in the (White) Siberian Regional Government. Joining a 14-man cabinet, he was a prestige figure; the government hoped to play on the respect he had with the Allies, especially the head of the British military mission, General Alfred Knox.|$|R

40|$|The {{variability}} and {{the return}} on a financial asset {{on the grounds of}} historical price data is determined usually by means of the price correlations of values, realized in two adjacent periods. This approach does not reflect completely the fluctuations of the financial markets, because their values monitored in two adjacent periods are quite similar. This is a hindrance for the variability in the econometric models to be covered completely, with reference to the time data lines and looking for the autocorrelation between the separate lines. It refers to the GARCH models, encompassing fully phenomena of the financial trade such as autocorrelations and variability clusters. The application of the scope model, based on the difference between the top and the bottom price realized in a business day, using these models results in a precise reflection of the real dynamics of the variability of the daily return. The different approaches for its presentation in the GARCH models are studied – from the dynamics of its mean value to the use as an expression of the dynamics of the <b>provisional</b> variability of <b>return.</b> Thus the use of the scope could be considered a natural follow-up of the GARCH models in order to improve their explanatory and forecasting value in the process of econometric modeling of the variability. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{adoption}} of a healthy lifestyle, including physical activity, a healthy diet, moderate alcohol consumption and abstinence from smoking, {{is associated with a}} major decrease in the incidence of chronic diseases and mortality. Primary health-care (PHC) services therefore attempt, with rather limited success, to promote such lifestyles in their patients. The objective of the present study is to ascertain the perceptions of clinicians and researchers within the Basque Health System of the factors that hinder or facilitate the integration of healthy lifestyle promotion in routine PHC setting. Methods Formative research based on five consensus meetings held by an expert panel of 12 PHC professionals with clinical and research experience in health promotion, supplied with selected bibliographic material. These meetings were recorded, summarized and the <b>provisional</b> findings were <b>returned</b> to participants in order to improve their validity. Results The Health Belief Model, the Theory of Planned Action, the Social Learning Theory, "stages of change" models and integrative models were considered the most useful by the expert panel. Effective intervention strategies, such as the " 5 A's" strategy (assess, advise, agree, assist and arrange) are also available. However, none of these can be directly implemented or continuously maintained under current PHC conditions. These strategies should therefore be redesigned by adjusting the intervention objectives and contents to the operation of primary care centres and, in turn, altering the organisation of the centres where they are to be implemented. Conclusion It is recommended to address optimisation of health promotion in PHC from a research perspective in which PHC professionals, researchers and managers of these services cooperate in designing and evaluating innovative programs. Future strategies should adopt a socio-ecological approach in which the health system plays an essential role but which nevertheless complements other individual, cultural and social factors that condition health. These initiatives require an adequate theoretical and methodological framework for designing and evaluating complex interventions. </p...|$|R
