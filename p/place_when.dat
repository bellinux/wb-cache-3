5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of <b>place</b> <b>when</b> the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow.

5|$|Covalent bonding takes <b>place</b> <b>when</b> {{one of the}} {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding {{the location of the}} ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E

5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, {{protrudes}} into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in <b>place</b> <b>when</b> Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100.

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes <b>place</b> <b>when</b> the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E

Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in <b>place</b> <b>when</b> production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} in Australia {{and grew up in}} England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he {{established}} a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he {{was on the verge of}} the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a <b>place,</b> <b>when</b> he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{exported}} {{from the}} district, all furs {{had to pass}} through depots manned by a quarantine officer appointed by the Board of Health. Any furs believed to have {{come into contact with}} parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed. This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved. Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation, as no mechanism was put in <b>place</b> <b>when</b> the Act was drafted. These claims for compensation were considered, but ultimately ignored.|$|E

5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown section of the city was yet to be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took <b>place</b> <b>when</b> it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took <b>place</b> <b>when</b> two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had also begun a southeastward track.|$|E
5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take <b>place</b> <b>when</b> the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
