The adverse effects of lenient tax treatment of owner-occupied housing on economic efficiency and growth are large and well documented in the economics literature. The main {{argument in favor of}} subsidizing owner-occupied housing is that it creates <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> that offset these adverse effects. This paper tests whether homeowners create <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> to their immediate neighbourhood that capitalize into housing prices in multi-storey buildings. Using semiparametric hedonic regressions with and without instrumental variables we find no evidence of <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> from neighbourhood homeownership rate. This result is robust to relaxing the identification assumptions of our instrument using a recently developed set identification method. Our results suggest that the adverse efficiency effects of lenient tax treatment of owner-occupied housing are not offset by <b>positive</b> <b>externalities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Negative and <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> pose {{symmetrical}} {{problems to}} social welfare. The law internalizes negative externalities by providing general tort liability rules. According to such rules, those who cause harm to others should pay compensation. In theory, {{in the presence}} of <b>positive</b> <b>externalities,</b> negative liability should apply: those who produce benefits should be paid a compensatory award by the gainers. Nevertheless, the legal system does not display such general negative-liability rules. Rather, it tackles the problem of internalizing <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> by implementing a set of different and often indirect solutions. My explanation for this asymmetry in legal remedies rests on three features of a negative-liability regime, relating to intent, incentives, and evidence. These features explain the scope and design of restitution rules, liability for nonfeasance, and other mechanisms for the internalization of <b>positive</b> <b>externalities.</b> (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago.

25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a <b>positive</b> <b>externality</b> (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities.

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} {{is often}} accounted for when conducting cost–benefit analyses of vaccination programs. It {{is regarded as}} a <b>positive</b> <b>externality</b> of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios and {{an increase in the number}} of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households in which a member was vaccinated, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing disease incidence before and after a vaccination program is introduced. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction. When serotype replacement is accounted for, it lessens the predicted benefits of vaccination.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{premise of}} criminal law is that criminals who are convicted of similar crimes under similar circumstances {{ought to be}} subject to identical sentences. This article provides an efficiency-based rationale for discriminatory sentencing, i. e., establishes circumstances under which identical crimes ought {{to be subject to}} differential sentencing. We also establish the relevance of this finding to the practices of sentencing and, in particular, to the Sentencing Guidelines. Most significantly, we establish that the model can explain why celebrities, leaders, or recidivists ought to be subject to harsher sanctions than others. Discriminatory sentencing is optimal when criminals confer <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> on each other. If a criminal A who imposes (non-reciprocal) large <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> on criminal B is punished sufficiently harshly, B would expect A not to commit the crime and, consequently, he would expect not to benefit from the <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> conferred on him by A. Given that B's expected benefits are lower, the sanctions sufficient to deter B are also lower than the ones imposed on A. The result can be easily extended to the case of reciprocal externalities. Assume that a criminal A imposes <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> on B and B imposes identical <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> on A. If A is subject to a sufficiently harsh sanction and B knows this, B would expect A not to perform the crime and therefore would expect not to benefit from the <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> otherwise conferred on B. Consequently, a more lenient sanction than the sanction imposed on A would be sufficient to deter B. ...|$|R

30|$|As for <b>positive</b> {{consumption}} <b>externalities,</b> Katz and Shapiro (1985) {{observe the}} phenomenon whereby customer utility increases {{with the number}} of other customers consuming the same product. <b>Positive</b> <b>externalities</b> can be generated through a direct physical effect of the number of purchasers {{on the quality of the}} product, or the indirect effects from complementary products and post-purchase service. Ellison and Fudenberg (1999) model a customer’s utility from a product with <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> as a function of the product’s inherent value and of the number of customers using the product. When it comes to pricing strategies, Teng et al. (2010) build a two-stage dynamic game model to study the optimal prices for the monopolist producing products with <b>positive</b> <b>externalities.</b> They find that the stronger the <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> are, the more necessary for the firm to decrease the prices in the first period and raise the prices in the second period. Winter and Sundqvist 2010 demonstrates that although penetration pricing can be recommended for these kinds of products in some cases, it is not suitable all the time. Premium prices can be charged depending on the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic product values. Different from Teng et al. (2010) and Winter and Sundqvist (2010), we model the <b>positive</b> <b>externalities</b> in customer utility, instead of in total demand function. We take both positive and negative consumption externalities into account at the same time. Note that a relevant paper of Wang, Wang and Lai (2017), which deals with both pricing and production strategies, facing customers with both Veblen and network effects. However, different from their paper, excluding the firm’s production strategy, we explicitly model customers as heterogeneous in their intrinsic valuations of the product.|$|R

50|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that a pure land value tax which succeeds in avoiding taxation of improvements could actually have a negative deadweight loss (<b>positive</b> <b>externality),</b> due to productivity gains arising from efficient land use.

5000|$|If {{there is}} a {{negative}} externality, then social costs will be greater than private costs. Environmental pollution {{is an example of}} a social cost that is seldom borne completely by the polluter, thereby creating a negative externality. If {{there is a}} <b>positive</b> <b>externality,</b> then one will have higher social benefits than private benefits. For example, when a supplier of educational services indirectly benefits society as a whole but only receives payment for the direct benefit received by the recipient of the education: the benefit to society of an educated populace is a <b>positive</b> <b>externality.</b> In either case, economists refer to this as market failure because resources will be allocated inefficiently. In the case of negative externalities, private agents will engage in too much of the activity; in the case of positive externalities, they will engage in too little. (The marginal rate of transformation in production will not be equal to the marginal rate of substitution in consumption due to the effect of the externality and as a result Pareto optimality will not occur—see welfare economics for an explanation.) ...|$|E
