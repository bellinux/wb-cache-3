5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E

30|$|Parameters {{in group}} 1 whose values are either {{taken from the}} {{literature}} or set a priori include κ, α, δ, β and ϕ. Following Gollin (2008), the parameter κ is set at 0.4, which implies that own-account workers allocate 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> available <b>time</b> to entrepreneurial abilities. The capital share in the production function is fixed at the standard value of 0.33 (see, for example, Gonzalez et al. 2011, for the Colombian case). In the model, the capital share is expressed as (1 –α)γ. Given a value for γ, α is fixed so that (1 –α)γ is equal to 0.33. The annual depreciation rate δ is set at the standard value of 0.10 used in the business cycle literature. The discount factor β is fixed at 0.96 so that the steady-state rate of return of capital is 4 percent. An estimate for the degree of substitution between the consumption goods associated with the taxed and untaxed sectors is not available in the literature. Instead, the Cobb-Douglas case is considered, and so ϕ is set to zero in equation (16).|$|R

The trials took place during the pre-taper phase of training, post taper phase of training, and the post removal of body hair phase of training. The stroke rate and distance per stroke were judged using Sportline stopwatches. The swimmers' were timed every fourth arm cycle at the 175 yard and 275 yard mark of the 300 yard distance. The results of this study suggest that at submaximal effort (80 percent), there is no significant (p< 0. 05) change in stroke rate and distance per stroke due to a taper period or removal of body hair. The lack of decreased stroke rate and increased distance per stroke may be attributed to the intensity of the trials. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} paper on goat breeding in Zimbabwe's rural area of Wedza. The browsing behaviour of four free ranging goats was {{studied in the}} Wedza Communal Area of Zimbabwe over a four-day period in March 1997. Line intercepts were used to record the occurrence of browse species on range. Time spent on individual browse species was recorded. Preference indices for individual browse species were computed by relating relative frequency of consumption to relative frequency of occurrence on range. Acacia karoo had the highest relative frequency of occurrence. Of the 28 species that occurred on range, only 75 <b>percent</b> were consumed. <b>Of</b> these species, goats had a high preference for only 28 percent on which they spent 79 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> browsing <b>time.</b> Thirty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the highly preferred species had a trace occurrence on range. Strychos cucculoides, a trace species, had the highest preference index of 6. 1. The correlation coefficient between relative frequency on range and relative frequency of consumption was 0. 6. Crude protein content of the browse and the preference indices had a correlation coefficient of 0. 16. Apparently, availability of the browse species and crude protein content did not fully explain the preferences.

The results indicated that adults with ASD endorsed more symptoms of video game pathology than did TD adults. This relationship was strong, enjoying 300, 000 -to- 1 odds in Bayesian model comparison. Results also showed that adults with ASD spent more daily hours playing video games and spent a higher <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time</b> playing video games than did TD adults. Even after adjustment for these differences in daily video game hours and proportion of free time spent on games, model comparisons found evidence for a difference in game pathology scores associated with ASD status. Additionally, escapism motives for playing video games was associated with game pathology scores in both ASD and TD adults, replicating and extending a previous report. In conclusion, the risk for pathological game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD adults.

In this paper, we systematically evaluate alternative methods for calculating the heuristic values for HSP 2. 0 and {{demonstrate that the}} resulting planning times differ substantially.

We identify two different approaches for speeding up the calculation of heuristic values, namely to order the value updates and to reuse information from the calculation of previous heuristic values. We then show how these two approaches can be combined, resulting in our PINCH method. PINCH outperforms both of the other approaches individually {{as well as the}} methods used by HSP 1. 0 and HSP 2. 0 for most of the large planning problems tested. In fact, it speeds up the planning time of HSP 2. 0 by up to eighty percent in several domains and, in general, the amount of savings grows with the size of the domains, allowing HSP 2. 0 to solve larger planning problems than was possible before in {{the same amount of time}} and without changing its overall operation...|$|R
