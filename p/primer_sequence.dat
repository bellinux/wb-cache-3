25|$|It is {{critical}} to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind only to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3–5°C below the Tm of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{strategy is to}} run multiple qPCR reactions with different primer sets that target each allele separately. Well-designed primers will amplify their target SNP at a much earlier cycle than the other SNPs. This allows more than two alleles to be distinguished, although an individual qPCR reaction is required for each SNP. To achieve high enough specificity, the <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> may require placement of an artificial mismatch near its 3'-end, which is an approach generally known as Taq-MAMA.|$|E

[...] RNase H {{plays a role in}} the priming of the plus-strand, but not in the conventional method of synthesizing a new <b>primer</b> <b>sequence.</b> Rather RNase H creates a [...] "primer" [...] from the PPT that is resistant to RNase H cleavage.

5000|$|Template-switching {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (TS-PCR) is a method of reverse transcription and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) amplification that relies on a natural PCR <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> at the polyadenylation site and adds a second primer through the activity of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. [...] This permits reading full cDNA sequence and can deliver high yield from single sources, even single cells that contain 10 to 30 picograms of mRNA, with relatively low levels (3-5%) of contaminating rRNA sequence. Frequently the goal is some form of whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing. It is marketed by Clontech as Switching Mechanism At the 5' end of RNA Template (SMART).|$|E
5000|$|The cleaved cDNA {{downstream}} from the cleavage site is then discarded, {{and the remaining}} immobile cDNA fragments upstream from cleavage sites are divided in half and exposed {{to one of two}} adapter oligonucleotides (A or B) containing several components in the following order upstream from the attachment site: 1) Sticky ends with the AE cut site to allow for attachment to cleaved cDNA; 2) A recognition site for a restriction endonuclease known as the tagging enzyme (TE), which cuts about 15 nucleotides downstream of its recognition site (within the original cDNA/mRNA sequence); 3) A short <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> unique to either adapter A or B, which will later be used for further amplification via PCR.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} biomolecular {{engineering}} strategies {{have played a}} very important role in the development and practice of PCR. For instance a crucial step in insuring the accurate replication of the desired DNA fragment is the creation of the correct DNA primer. The most common method of primer synthesis is by the phosphoramidite method. This method includes the biomolecular engineering of a number of molecules to attain the desired <b>primer</b> <b>sequence.</b> The most prominent biomolecular engineering technique seen in this primer design method is the initial bioimmobilization of a nucleotide to a solid support. This step is commonly done via the formation of a covalent bond between the 3’-hydroxy group of the first nucleotide of the primer and the solid support material.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes {{degenerate}} primers are used. These {{are actually}} mixtures of similar, but not identical primers. They may be convenient {{if the same}} gene is to be amplified from different organisms, as the genes themselves are probably similar but not identical. The other use for degenerate primers is when primer design is based on protein sequence. As several different codons can code for one amino acid, {{it is often difficult}} to deduce which codon is used in a particular case. Therefore, <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> corresponding to the amino acid isoleucine might be [...] "ATH", where A stands for adenine, T for thymine, and H for adenine, thymine, or cytosine, according to the genetic code for each codon, using the IUPAC symbols for degenerate bases. Use of degenerate primers can greatly reduce the specificity of the PCR amplification. The problem can be partly solved by using touchdown PCR.|$|E
5000|$|Telomerase is a [...] "ribonucleoprotein complex" [...] {{composed}} of a protein component and an RNA <b>primer</b> <b>sequence</b> that acts to protect the terminal ends of chromosomes from being broken down by enzymes. The telomeres (and the actions of telomerase) are necessary because, during replication, DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only a 5' to 3' direction (each DNA strand having a polarity that {{is determined by the}} precise manner in which sugar molecules of the strand's [...] "backbone" [...] are linked together) and can do so only by adding nucleotides to RNA primers (that have already been placed at various points {{along the length of the}} DNA). The RNA strands are replaced with newly synthesized DNA, but DNA polymerase can only [...] "backfill" [...] deoxyribonucleotides if there is already DNA [...] "upstream" [...] from (i.e., located 5' to) the RNA primer. At the chromosome terminal, however, there is no nucleotide sequence in the 5' direction (and therefore no upstream RNA primer or DNA), so DNA polymerase cannot function and genetic sequence might be lost through chromosomal fraying. Chromosomal ends might also be processed as breaks in double-strand DNA with chromosome-to-chromosome telomere fusions resulting.|$|E

40|$|Background: Next-generation {{sequencing}} platforms have revolutionised {{our ability}} to investigate the microbiota composition of complex environments, frequently through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial component of the community.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of these three factors on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing results, using mock communities and mock community DNA. Results: The use of different <b>primer</b> <b>sequences</b> (V 4 -V 5, V 1 -V 2 and V 1 -V 2 degenerate primers) resulted in differences in the genera and species detected.
