25|$|European seiners {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} located {{more to the}} after part of the vessel with the working deck amidships. European seiners are most common in waters fished by European nations. The net is stowed in a net bin at the stern, and is set over the stern from this position. The <b>pursing</b> winch is normally positioned at the forward part of the working deck.|$|E
25|$|Trawler/purse seiners are {{designed}} so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged {{and used for}} both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the <b>pursing</b> lines and warp leads and {{in such a way}} as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.|$|E

25|$|Apraxia {{of speech}} can be {{diagnosed}} by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves {{tasks such as}} <b>pursing</b> lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves {{an examination of the}} mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. SLPs do not agree on a specific set of characteristics that make up the apraxia of speech diagnosis, so any of the characteristics from the section above could be used to form a diagnosis. Patients may be asked to perform other daily tasks such as reading, writing, and conversing with others. In situations involving brain damage, an MRI brain scan also helps identify damaged areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government {{installed}} the Special Transcaucasian Committee {{to govern the}} area. However, following the October Revolution, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was replaced on 11 November 1917 by the Transcaucasian Commissariat centered in Tbilisi. The Commissariat concluded the Armistice of Erzincan with the Ottoman Empire on 5 December 1917, ending localized armed conflict with the Ottoman Empire. The Commissariat actively sought to suppress Bolshevik influence while concurrently <b>pursing</b> a path towards Transcaucasian independence from Bolshevik Russia. This included establishing a legislative body, the Transcaucasian Sejm, to which the Commissariat surrendered its authority on 23 January 1918, following the dispersal of the Russian Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks. The secessionist and anti-Bolshevik agenda eventfully brought Transcaucasian into conflict with the central government. On 3 March, the Russians signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marking Russia's exit from World War I. In the treaty, Russia agreed to return territory gained during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), giving little care {{to the fact that}} this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces. The Trebizond Peace Conference, between the Ottoman Empire and the Sejm, began on 4 March and continued until April. The Ottomans offered to surrender all the Empire's ambitions in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the re-acquisition of the east Anatolian provinces awarded at Brest-Litovsk.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic lethality as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then <b>pursing</b> a synthetic lethality approach. Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes enolase 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the generalizability of the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E

Although he seems to like helping Rapunzel adjust to her new royal life, he eventually starts to feel he doesn't belong with her and runs away, to Rapunzel's isolated tower in the deepest parts of the forest. In Episode 11, it is revealed that, as a baby, his mother had sent him to safety on a lily-pad to escape a ravenous snake that was <b>pursing</b> them. As his mother was eaten by the snake, he had floated down a waterfall, where he heard [...] young Rapunzel singing. He climbed her tower but was still being followed by the snake which infected him with its lethal venom. It was then that the young Rapunzel used the light-based, healing magic of her blond hair to return him to life. She welcomed the infant chameleon as her best friend, that way {{they would never have}} to be alone again.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Purses</b> hardly get {{washed and}} are discarded, mostly, {{when they are}} no longer usable. This study aims to {{investigate}} whether women′s and men′s <b>purses</b> can serve as fomites. Materials and Methods: A total of 145 <b>purses</b> from 80   women and  65 men were swabbed and cultured. The bacteria were identified by gram staining and with the standard biochemical tests. Results: A total of 138 <b>purses</b> (95. 2 %) showed bacterial contamination, out of which 49. 4 % had a single growth and 50. 7 % had mixed growth. The material of the <b>purse</b> was found to affect bacterial growth. Synthetic <b>purses</b> showed higher mean colony-forming unit (CFU) counts (P < 0. 05). Micrococcus (64. 8 %) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (64. 1 %) were the most common bacteria isolated, followed by Bacillus spp. (13. 8 %). Micrococcus was found with a higher prevalence on men′s <b>purses,</b> while Bacillus spp. were more prominent on women′s <b>purses</b> (P < 0. 05). The difference between the rates of bacterial growth from the <b>purses</b> of women and of men was found to be statistically significant (57. 2 % and 44. 7 %; P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the mean CFU count was higher for men′s <b>purses</b> than for women′s <b>purses</b> (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Purses</b> from both men and women are potential vectors for transmission of diseases across the community. The use of synthetic <b>purses</b> should be discouraged, as they contribute to  increased bacterial colonization...|$|R
