5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies {{had approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire. When she did so, Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with only her foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily Chairs) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E

25|$|With the {{relieving}} force dispensed with, {{the capture}} of the fort resumed. On 3 April the 3rd Bombay European Regiment moved into position to attack the city wall {{on either side of}} the Orcha Gate. Two attacking formations of one hundred men each, the left column led by Captain Robison, 3rd Bombay European Regiment, the right by Lieutenant-Colonel Liddell, advanced with great steadiness through a very heavy fire of musketry and wall pieces towards the ladders, on reaching which they were assailed with rockets, earthen pots filled with powder and various projectiles. But a serious miscalculation had occurred – the ladders used by the 3rd Europeans were found in some instances too short, in others too weak, breaking under the men. The regiment came under heavy fire, who despite some minor success in scaling the walls with many acts of gallantry and being reinforced by another 100 men of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, was eventually forced to retire. A parallel attack on the left flank of the fort by the 86th Regiment succeeded in breaching the wall and a party from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment led by Captain Robison followed the 86th through the breach. Lt. Col. Liddell, on finding his ladders of no use, ordered Lt. Goodfellow, Bombay Engineers, to try a bag of powder at a postern but no entry could be effected. By the time, Captain Robison had made good his lodgment, and was followed by the right column. Pushing on for the Palace, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment were engaged in difficult street fighting until the Palace was reached and jointly captured by the 3rd Bombay European Regiment and 86th Regiment, though both regiments suffered casualties when the enemy ignited a <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> causing an explosion.|$|E

500|$|Divine {{has left}} an {{influence}} {{on a number of}} musicians. During the mid-1980s, the androgynous performer Sylvester decorated the <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> of his San Francisco home with Divine memorabilia. Anohni of the band Antony and the Johnsons wrote a song about Divine which was included in the group's self-titled debut album, released in 1998. The song, titled [...] "Divine," [...] was an ode to the actor, who was one of Anohni's lifelong heroes. Her admiration is expressed in the lines: [...] "He was my self-determined guru" [...] and [...] "I turn to think of you/Who walked the way with so much pain/Who holds the mirror up to fools." [...] In 2008, Irish electronic singer Róisín Murphy paid homage to Divine in the music video for her song [...] "Movie Star" [...] by reenacting the attack by Lobstora from Multiple Maniacs.|$|E

500|$|His next album, {{entitled}} M-1015 (1984), {{was more}} frenetic and pumping than his previous releases, having embraced the recently developed genre of Hi-NRG, {{but it also}} included elements of electro and rap. The major figures behind the album had been Kessie and Morey Goldstein, and Sylvester himself had not written any of the tracks. The album also contained increasingly sexually explicit lyrics, in particular in the songs [...] "How Do You Like Your Love" [...] and [...] "Sex". That year, he also entered into a relationship with an architect named Rick Cramner, and together they {{moved into a new}} apartment in the hills, where Sylvester decorated his <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> with posters and memorabilia of Divine, the drag queen, actor and singer whom he had briefly known when they were in The Cockettes. In 1985, he fulfilled a lifelong ambition by working with the singer Aretha Franklin; he and Jeanie had been invited to provide backing vocals on Franklin's album Who's Zoomin' Who?.|$|E
500|$|In 1804, Charles Heath recorded, [...] "The {{interior}} {{has nothing}} worthy {{of attention and}} the only purpose {{to which it is}} employed is an occasional guardhouse, or <b>powder</b> <b>room,</b> for the military, when stationed at Monmouth." [...] The gatehouse had by this point been abandoned as a dwelling. The lean-to extensions, including the guardhouse, were demolished around 1815. In 1819, a pedestrian passageway was driven through the building on the upstream side to help relieve the flow of traffic across the bridge. Before 1830, the gatehouse was owned by Monmouth Corporation, and subsequently the County Council, as inheritors of the medieval burgesses. In a lengthy transaction, begun that year but not concluded until 1835, ownership was formally transferred to the Duke of Beaufort as part of a property exchange. The gatehouse roof was reconstructed in 1832, with deeper eaves and four decorative corbels on each side. A second passageway was added on the downstream side of the arch in 1845. Since then, the structure has remained essentially unchanged, save for periodic maintenance and repair.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' <b>powder</b> <b>room.</b> After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E

[...] Maynard and Teach fired their flintlocks at each other, then threw them away. [...] Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword. [...] Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the Janes crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated. [...] As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men. [...] Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew. [...] The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. [...] Those left on the Adventure were captured by the Rangers crew, including one who planned to {{set fire to the}} <b>powder</b> <b>room</b> and blow up the ship. [...] Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that8 of his men and 12pirates were killed. [...] Brand reported that 10pirates and 11of Maynard's men were killed.

2500|$|... "Spotty Powder" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} as a short story in 1973. In 2005, The Times reprinted [...] "Spotty Powder" [...] as a [...] "lost" [...] chapter, saying it {{had been found in}} Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the way Leonardo da Vinci wrote his journal). This chapter describes Spotty Powder, which looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty <b>Powder</b> <b>room</b> to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs Piker interpreted as screams.
