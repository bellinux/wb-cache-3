5|$|In 1963 Rolf Hochhuth {{published}} a play significantly influenced by Kolbe's life and dedicated to him, The Deputy. In 2000, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (U.S.) designated Marytown, {{home to a}} community of Conventual Franciscan friars, as the National Shrine of St. Maximilian Kolbe. Marytown is located in Libertyville, Illinois, and also features the Kolbe Holocaust Exhibit. In 1991, Krzysztof Zanussi released a Polish film {{about the life of}} Kolbe.

5|$|Polish Flag Day (formally: Flag of the Republic of Poland Day, Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) {{was first}} {{observed}} on May 2, 2004. It {{was established in}} order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols. The date was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Polonia Day traditionally observed by the Polish diaspora outside Poland and the <b>Polish</b> <b>Senate</b> on May 2. There was also a historical reason: under the Communist regime, May 2 was a day when national flags, hoisted for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day (May 3), which was banned by the authorities.|$|E
25|$|It {{began on}} 12 December 1575 when Emperor Maximillian {{was chosen as}} monarch by the <b>Polish</b> <b>Senate,</b> while the {{majority}} of the szlachta (nobility) had voted for Bathory. It ended on 16 December 1577. Maximilian's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges. With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily, a compromise was reached, with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized, in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as the king.|$|E
50|$|During the interwar period, the Mizrachi {{party was}} {{represented}} in the kehilla councils {{as well as in}} the municipal councils and in the <b>Polish</b> Sejm and <b>Senate,</b> e.g. by the Vilnius Chief Rabbi Yitzkak Rubinstein (1888-1945), Mizrachi senator (1922-1930, 1938-1939) and deputy (1930-1935), and by Rabbi Simon Federbusch, Sejm member from 1922 till 1927.|$|R
50|$|After the Institute of National Remembrance (a Polish government-affiliated {{research}} institute which investigates both Nazi and Communist crimes committed in Poland) {{was created in}} 1998, Kurtyka was {{the first president of}} its Kraków branch. In April 2005 he was recommended by the Board of the Institute for the position of the president and was approved by the <b>Polish</b> Sejm and <b>Senate</b> in December of that year. He took his oath of office on December 29, 2005.|$|R
50|$|The first apostolic {{administrator}} was Edward O'Rourke {{who became}} Bishop of Danzig {{on the occasion}} of the elevation of the administration to an exempt diocese. He was naturalised as Danziger on the same occasion. In 1938 he resigned after quarrels with the Nazi-dominated Senate of Danzig on appointments of parish priests of <b>Polish</b> ethnicity. The <b>senate</b> also instigated the denaturalisation of O'Rourke, who subsequently became a Polish citizen. O'Rourke was succeeded by Bishop Carl Maria Splett, a native from the Free City area.|$|R
25|$|The EU {{is divided}} between unicameral (single chamber) and {{bicameral}} (dual chamber) parliaments, with 15 unicameral national parliaments and 13 bicameral parliaments. The {{prime minister and}} government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected lower house and require its support to stay in office—the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. Upper houses are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the <b>Polish</b> <b>senate,</b> indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the Federal Council of Austria, unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the National Council of Slovenia, unelected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom). Most (though not all) elections in the EU use some form of proportional representation. The {{most common type of}} proportional representation is the party-list system.|$|E

40|$|The {{national}} parliament {{is crucial}} institution in a contemporary European states, which guarantees a legitimacy {{of a power}} and regime. At the same time, {{the effectiveness of a}} parliament {{is one of the most}} important hallmark of a democratic political system. The democratic legitimacy, which comes from a national parliament is one of the sphere of the national system of implementing European policy. The author, using the system approach in European studies research, analyze the evolution of the role and functions of the <b>Polish</b> Sejm and <b>Senate</b> in the pre‑accession period, i. e. before the year 2004. The role of Polish parliament is analyzed through the two research perspectives - historical and functional. In this way it is clearly observed a growing role of the Sejm and Senate in the relations with other political institutions within a national system of implementing European policy...|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of his cousin, Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, who commanded an army {{aided by a}} small allied Swedish army led by Jacob de la Gardie, demanding cessions of Russian territory in Karelia in return, allowed Shuisky, for a time, to remain on his unstable throne. In 1610, he was deposed by his former adherents Princes Vorotynsky and Mstislavsky. He was made a monk and eventually transported together with his two brothers to Warsaw by the Polish hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. He died a prisoner in the castle of Gostynin, near Warsaw, in 1612, followed soon by his brother Dmitry. There {{they were forced to}} perform the Shuysky Tribute before the <b>Polish</b> King and <b>Senate.</b> The Romanovs, elected in 1613, did recognize Vasili posthumously as a legal tsar, and during their negotiations with the Polish authorities constantly demanded the right to rebury his body in Russia. Following the Treaty of Polyanovka in 1635, Vasili's remains were finally returned to Moscow and laid to rest in the Archangel Cathedral.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{political}} party, {{founded in}} 1896, was originally named the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union. During this time, it {{was supported by}} Metropolitan Sembratovich, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and by the Austrian government, which subsidized the newspaper Ruslan. [...] In 1911 the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union, {{under the leadership of}} Oleksander Barvinky, renamed itself as the Christian Social Party and sent representatives to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna {{as well as to the}} local Galician Diet. [...] After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Christian Social Party subsequently participated in the formation of the West Ukrainian National Republic. Following the Polish-Ukrainian War, after western Ukraine had passed under the control of the Second Polish Republic, the party continued to function until the 1930s. At that time, part of its members joined the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO) (a moderate political organization opposed to the radical Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), while others founded the Ukrainian Catholic People's Party. The latter party advocated autonomy for western Ukraine but was loyal to the Polish state. It was able to place a member in the <b>Polish</b> parliament and <b>Senate</b> but was generally not very influential within Ukrainian society.|$|R
2500|$|Švitrigaila escaped and {{continued}} to resist, but he was losing his power in the eastern provinces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1437, he proposed a compromise: {{he would continue to}} rule Kiev and Volhynia, territories that still remained loyal to him, until his death; at that time the territories would pass to the King of Poland. Due to a strong protest from Sigismund Kęstutaitis, the <b>Polish</b> <b>Senate</b> did not ratify the agreement. The following year Švitrigaila [...] retreated to Moldavia. Sigismund became the undisputed Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, his reign was short as he was assassinated in 1440.|$|E
2500|$|Švitrigaila {{was losing}} his {{influence}} in the Slavic principalities and could no longer resist Poland and Sigismund. On 4 September 1437 he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the lands that still backed him (chiefly Kiev and Volhynia), and after his death these territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, under strong protest from Sigismund, the <b>Polish</b> <b>Senate</b> declined to ratify the treaty [...] In 1438 Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia. The reign of Sigismund Kęstutaitis was brief — he was assassinated in 1440. Švitrigaila returned from exile in 1442 and ruled Lutsk until his death a decade later.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a summary of}} analyses addressing the changing patterns of voting behavior in post-communist Poland as a context for examination {{of the issue of}} the relationship between regions defined by history (eighteenth-century partitions, border shifts after WWII) and contemporary forms of voting behavior. In the 1990 s, the dominant cleavage in Polish politics was the one between the post-Solidarity and post-communist camps, and the best predictor of voting behavior was one’s religiosity. In {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century, this cleavage has been replaced by another, between the liberal, pro-european orientation and the more euro-skeptic, populist atti-tudes. The empirical evidence seems to suggest that one end of the populist–liberal continuum is relatively well defined and represents the traditional system of values, which defines Polish national identity in terms of ethnic nationalism, strong attachment to Catholic dogmas, and denunciation of communism as a virtual negation of those values. The other end of this continuum is defined more by rejection of this nationalistic-Catholic “imagined community ” than by any positive features. This article examines the relative role of identity-related factors (e. g., religiosity or region) and determinants based on one’s socioeconomic (class) position in shaping voting patterns in the 2007 elections to the <b>Polish</b> Sejm and <b>Senate.</b> The empirical data come from a postelection survey, the Polish general election Study 2007...|$|R
50|$|The {{climax of}} his {{elevation}} occurred in June 1737 when, on {{the extinction of}} the line of Kettler, the nobility ('estates') of Courland were arm-twisted into electing Biron as their reigning duke. Anna had been the wife of the penultimate duke, whose successor, his uncle Ferdinand, died childless in that year. The Kettler dynasty being now extinct, the estates were called upon to elect a new duke, and Anna proposed Biron. He was almost as unpopular in Courland as in Russia, and the estates were mortified at the prospect of this upstart holding sway over them, but the will of the empress could not be easily gainsaid. Still, it was found necessary to supply large sums of money, smuggled into Courland in the shape of bills payable in Amsterdam to bearer, in order to persuade the electors to fall in with Anna's choice. There was another complication: the duchy of Courland was then in dispute between Poland and Russia. Russian armies were employed to place Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, on the Polish throne. In return, the Elector promised that Biron would be invested with the duchy of Courland. The Emperor Charles VI, subordinating everything to his Pragmatic Sanction, readily countenanced these violent acts, and the king of Prussia was bought by certain territorial concessions. The investiture took place in 1739 at Warsaw by authority of the <b>Polish</b> king and <b>senate.</b>|$|R
