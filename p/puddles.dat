40|$|<b>Puddling</b> is {{the most}} common method of land {{preparation}} for lowland rice cultivation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the influence of various intensities of <b>puddling</b> on percolation rate, water retention by soil and the amount of water used for different <b>puddling</b> intensities in three dominant soil textures of paddy fields in Guilan province. Undisturbed soil samples were taken from 3 different soils including silty clay, clay loam and loam, with 3 replications. The soil samples were <b>puddled</b> by a laboratory apparatus with different intensities. The results showed that the low <b>puddling</b> intensity treatment caused a 29. 3, 32. 4 and 36 % reduction of percolation rate in silty clay, silty loam and loam textures, respectively. Increasing <b>puddling</b> intensity from low to medium reduced percolation rate significantly, but high intensity was not effective. Soil moisture characteristic curves of all three soils showed that water retention was increased by <b>puddling</b> treatments. Water retention in silty clay was higher than the other two soils. The high intensity treatment needed more water than low intensity for <b>puddling.</b> Increasing <b>puddling</b> intensity from medium intensity to high intensity caused 15. 4, 14. 1 and 16. 3 % increase in the amount of water required for <b>puddling</b> in silty clay, silty loam and loam textures, respectively. Generally, in all the three studied soil textures, the amount of water used for high-intensity <b>puddling</b> was more than medium-intensity <b>puddling,</b> while it had no significant effect on water percolation rate and soil water retention...|$|R

5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and <b>puddles.</b> When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>puddling</b> on percolation and rice yields in rainfed lowland paddy cultivation. We selected a study village in Khammouane province, central Laos, and set up non-puddling and <b>puddling</b> plots from high to low positions. Even when <b>puddling</b> was conducted carefully, the ponding water in the plots disappeared {{in the case of}} little rainfall. Further, percolatifons during the later periods of rice growth increased drastically. Therefore, it is difficult to overcome drought stresses only by conducting <b>puddling.</b> We also compared the water conditions in the non-puddling and <b>puddling</b> plots. In the <b>puddling</b> plots at high position and low position along a stream, the number of days without ponding water in the <b>puddling</b> plots was less than that in the non-puddling field in July, suggesting the possibility of a different transplanting date. We tried to estimate the effects of transplanting date on the rice yields and found that transplanting 15 days earlier leads to an increase of 0. 5 t/ha in the rice yields. Moreover, the profits from the increased yields exceed the <b>puddling</b> costs considerably, leading to a definite increase in income. Because the transplanting date has no effects in the fields with high ground water, <b>puddling</b> is effective in paddy fields where ponding does not occur to a significant degree. </p...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became stuck in asphalt <b>puddles</b> which seeped {{to the surface of}} the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid asphalt, which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E

5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into <b>puddles.</b> The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

However, following prolonged periods of submerged conditions during rice growth, saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with a decrease in soil dispersion, in contrast to an expected reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with increased dispersion.

5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or <b>puddles</b> {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
