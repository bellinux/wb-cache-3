40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of feeder adjustment on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Both experiments were conducted at a commercial swine research facility in southwest Minnesota. In Exp. 1, a total of 1, 170 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 129. 0 lb) were used in a 70 -d study. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 treatments with 9 replications per treatment. The treatments were feeder settings of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, based on settings at the top of the STACO stainless steel dry <b>feeders.</b> <b>Pigs</b> were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. From d 0 to 28, <b>pigs</b> fed from <b>feeders</b> with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 10) any growth performance traits. Overall (d 0 to 70), <b>pigs</b> fed from <b>feeders</b> with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 18) ADG or F/G. In Exp. 2, a total of 1, 250 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 77. 3 lb) were used in a 69 -d study to determine the effect of feeder setting and diet type on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 treatments with 8 replications per treatment. The treatments were arranged in a 3 × 2 factorial with main effects of STACO stainless steel dry feeder setting (1, 3, or 5) and diet type (corn-soybean meal- or by-product-based (15 % DDGS and 5 % bakery by-product). Overall (d 0 to 69), there were no feeder setting × diet type interactions (P > 0. 31) for growth performance. Diet type did not affect (P > 0. 75) growth performance.

In conclusion, feeding <b>pigs</b> from <b>feeders</b> with a more open feeder setting increased ADG and ADFI and tended to improve F/G at middle feeder settings compared with more closed feeder settings.

40|$|Antibiotics {{have long}} been of great benefit for people, both in the medical {{treatment}} of human disease and in animal food where they improve the growth performance and feed utilization during animal production. Antibiotics as in-feed supplements affect all stages of pork production, including the gestation, nursing, growing, and finishing stages, although the effects show stage-dependent differences. However, the use of antibiotics in animal feed has become a worldwide concern. This review describes why sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic additives in animal feed have {{become an integral part}} of animal feeding programs for more than 70 years, particularly in pork production. It also discusses the threat of the long-term use of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics in pork production. In recent years, the effectiveness of in-feed antibiotics has tended to decrease. This review analyzes this change from various perspectives. First, the equipment used at pig farms has improved dramatically and is more sanitary. Worldwide, more pig farms use pig farrowing crates, gestation crates, piglet nursery crates, flooring devices, piggery ventilation and cooler systems, automatic <b>pig</b> <b>feeders,</b> piggery heating equipment, and artificial insemination systems. In addition, scientists have replaced the use of antibiotics with organic acids, fermented mash, probiotics, prebiotics, minerals, oligosaccharides, enzymes, herbs/flavors, and protein/amino acids, and have improved management and husbandry techniques. In addition, animal welfare legislation has been aimed at improving the quality of the floors and living space, ensuring that animals have permanent access to fresh water, and setting a minimum weaning age. Finally, the prospects and the possibility of replacing antibiotics in pork production are described, in line with recent research results...|$|R
