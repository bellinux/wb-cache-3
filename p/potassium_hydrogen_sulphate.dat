The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers had similar microscopic characteristics. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of iron, sulfur, potassium, calcium and carbon and trace amounts of copper and occasionally zinc.

40|$|Abstract- Exo-polysaccharides like dextran {{produced}} by Weissella sp. {{have a wide}} range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical and other industries. This biopolymer and its derivatives like iron dextran, clinical dextran are rapidly emerging as a new and industrially important products. Dextran a polymer of glucose is produced using sucrose rich media with nitrogen source. It also requires efficient micronutrients and macronutrients for production. In the present study diverse micronutrients (chlorides) like ferric chloride, cupric chloride, magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, calcium chloride, cobalt chloride, mercuric chloride (sulphates) like ferrous sulphate, copper sulphate, magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate, calcium sulphate, <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> and macronutrients (phosphate) like dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, calcium phosphate, aluminium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and zinc phosphate were screened using statistical design like Plackett-Burman. An eight experimental design of Plackett-Burman was used and seven sources were screened. Broth analysis indicated presence of more fructose and very less glucose as it was used for exopolysccharide production. Dextran was recovered from broth by alcohol precipitation. The results indicated that there was higher dextran production in chloride micronutrients like magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, sulphate micronutrients like magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate and macronutrient like dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. These studies indicate that micronutrients and macronutrients significantly influence dextran production. These should be included in optimized production media for commercial production of dextran...|$|E

40|$|Potassium ion {{homeostasis}} {{plays an}} important role in regulating membrane potential and therefore resistance to cations, antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other yeasts. However, the precise relationship between drug resistance in S. pombe and external potassium concentrations (particularly in its natural habitats) remains unclear. S. pombe can tolerate a wide range of external potassium concentrations which in turn affect plasma membrane polarization. We thus hypothesized that high external potassium concentrations suppress the sensitivity of this yeast to various drugs. We have investigated the effect of external KCl concentrations on the sensitivity of S. pombe cells to a wide range of antibiotics, antimicrobial agents and chemotherapeutic drugs. We employed survival assays, immunoblotting and microscopy for these studies. We demonstrate that KCl, and to a lesser extent NaCl and RbCl can suppress the sensitivity of S. pombe to a wide range of antibiotics. Ammonium chloride and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> also suppressed drug sensitivity. This effect appears to depend in part on changes to membrane polarization and membrane transport proteins. Interestingly, we have found little relationship between the suppressive effect of KCl on sensitivity and the structure, polarity or solubility of the various compounds investigated. High concentrations of external potassium and other cations suppress sensitivity to a wide range of drugs in S. pombe. Potassium-rich environments may thus provide S. pombe a competitive advantage in nature. Modulating potassium ion homeostasis may sensitize pathogenic fungi to antifungal agents...|$|E
40|$|In this research, polyalkyd resins were {{prepared}} from palm oil by using polycondensation reaction. A two-step method viz., alcoholysis and esterification {{was conducted to}} synthesize polyalkyd resins. Prior to alcoholysis, crude palm oil was subjected for dehydration process to increase its unsaturation. Different types of catalysts such as, sulphuric acid, para-toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydrogen sulphate and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{were used for the}} dehydration. In alcoholysis process, the triglyceride-based dehydrated oil was reacted with glycerol to produce monoglyceride. The prepared monoglyceride was further brought into contact with acid anhydride to prepare polyalkyds. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction parameters for esterification like reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, acid anhydride to mono-glyceride ratio and agitation speed. The optimum condition was used to prepare various types of polyalkyds by using different types of acid anhydrides such as, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride. A comparison was drawn among the resins prepared by using different types and percentages of acid anhydrides. The produced bioresins were characterized for physico-chemical properties such as, viscosity, density, iodine value, acid value, drying time, non-volatile materials content, specific gravity, colour, etc. The resins prepared with optimum reaction parameters were subjected for curing process by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthanate. To enhance the resinous property, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed into the resin at different percentages of loading such as, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt. %. The loading was optimized based on the tensile strength of the film. Finally, in-situ polymerization with carbon nanotubes during esterification was performed by adding optimum percentage of loading. The films produced from different formulations were characterized by different testing such as, adhesion, chemical resistivity, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, contact-angle measurement, tensile testing, pencil hardness, gloss, etc. In addition, the curing kinetics of the resin was analysed to evaluate the kinetic parameters such as, reaction rate, activation energy and degree of conversion in terms of time and temperature. Result analyses through RSM revealed a desirability of 0. 985 for the reaction time of 88. 64 min. Moreover, 91. 5 % fractional conversion was achieved actually, which is close to the predicted value. Analysis revealed that 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydophthalic anhydride-based resin showed improved resinous property than others due to high degree of crosslinking. It was also found that higher amount of aliphatic acid anhydrides are responsible for high degree of crosslinking density, whereas higher thermal stability was ensured by the inclusion of aromatic acid anhydride. Finally, incorporation of MWCNTs into the alkyd resin enhanced the overall film properties, which was further improved through in-situ reaction. The physical bonding and mechanical entanglement were the possible reason for showing improved properties, as revealed from the analysis...|$|E

The aim of this work was to process 4 types of wines with the electrodialysis technique, of which at least 2 white and 2 red wines were preferentially unstable in terms of formation of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> crystals. These wines were processed by the electrodialysis laboratory machine EDR [...] Z/ 10 which was from the MemBrain company. During the operation, the process parameters (electrical current, voltage, flow, volume, pH and conductivity of the individual hydraulic flow) were measured. The samples of wine processed by electrodialysis were analysed by the sensory technique, for the content of tartaric acid and potassium, and for the saturation temperature of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate. The work dealt with the relation between the level of demineralization of wine, by electrodialysis, and its organoleptic properties (color, smell, taste, harmony).

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine, mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> or tetrabutylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt. It was observed that additions in mobile phase of smaller size ions such {{as in the case of}} tetraethylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> and tetrabutylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> had as a result k’ co-efficient reductions, evidently due to its smaller ion solvency compared to that of the tetrabutylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> ions. ...|$|R

50|$|When {{choosing}} primary {{standards in}} analytical chemistry, compounds with higher equivalent weights {{are generally more}} desirable because weighing errors are reduced.
