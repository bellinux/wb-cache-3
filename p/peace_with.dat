5|$|All of Sigismund's {{attempts}} to make <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague to negotiate with RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could make <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans {{with the assistance of}} Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.|$|E
5|$|Having {{defeated}} the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors to Athens. He {{was prepared to}} abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians to make <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Having {{pushed the}} Crusaders out {{of most of}} Syria, the Ayyubids {{generally}} adopted a policy of <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Through his frenetic {{activity}} {{since coming}} to the throne, Philip had successfully shored up the Macedonian situation, defeating or making <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Macedon's erstwhile enemies, whilst securing most of Macedon's borders, and revitalising and retraining his army.|$|E
5|$|After making <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> his family, Takanohana regained {{some of his}} {{consistency}} in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament. His brother had retired in March, and several {{other members of his}} stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner-up performances.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Israel opened Turkish-brokered {{indirect}} <b>peace</b> talks <b>with</b> Syria. Olmert {{stated that}} the resumption of <b>peace</b> talks <b>with</b> Syria was a national obligation that must be tried. However, Syria broke off the talks several months later {{in response to the}} Gaza War.|$|R
50|$|The peasant {{movement}} ultimately failed, with {{cities and}} nobles making separate <b>peaces</b> <b>with</b> the princely armies that restored {{the old order}} in a frequently still-harsher incarnation under the nominal overlordship of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, represented in German affairs by his younger brother Ferdinand.|$|R
25|$|The former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, {{with the}} help of some U.S. {{government}} officials and United Nation officials, attempted to mediate in <b>peace</b> talks <b>with</b> the EPLF, hosted by the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, Georgia in September 1989. Ashagre Yigletu, Deputy Prime Minister of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE), helped negotiate and signed a November 1989 <b>peace</b> deal <b>with</b> the EPLF in Nairobi, along with Jimmy Carter and Al-Amin Mohamed Seid. However, soon after the deal was signed, hostilities resumed. Yigletu also led the Ethiopian government delegations in <b>peace</b> talks <b>with</b> the TPLF leader Meles Zenawi in November 1989 and March 1990 in Rome. He also attempted again to lead the Ethiopian delegation in <b>peace</b> talks <b>with</b> the EPLF in Washington, D.C. until March 1991.|$|R
5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to make <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} made <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> China {{when it opened}} border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E

5|$|At {{a school}} dance, Sean persuades Dallas to make <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Clay while Clay dances with Chelsea. Spencer convinces Ashley to come despite her disdain for school dances, but when Madison sees them together, she alleges that Spencer is gay and kicks Spencer off the cheerleading squad. It is {{revealed}} that Ashley was once pregnant by Aiden and lost {{the baby in}} a miscarriage, and when Glen tries to force Spencer to leave, another fight breaks out between him and Aiden. Spencer and Ashley flee the dance with Aiden and end up at a lookout over LA.|$|E
5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E

5|$|Beaujeu, having {{fulfilled}} {{his mission}} in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the Joly in mid-March 1685. Many of the colonists chose {{to return to}} France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E
5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses. The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
