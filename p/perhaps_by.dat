5|$|Gebhard is chiefly {{noted for}} his {{conversion}} to the reformed doctrines, {{and for his}} marriage with the reportedly beautiful Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben, a canoness of Gerresheim. After living in concubinage with Agnes for two years, he decided, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the persuasion of her brothers, to marry her, doubtless intending {{at the same time}} to resign his see. Other counsels, however, prevailed.|$|E
5|$|Ine {{kept the}} South Saxons, {{who had been}} conquered by Cædwalla in 686, in subjugation for a period. King Nothhelm of Sussex is {{referred}} to in a charter of 692 as a kinsman of Ine (<b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> marriage). Sussex was still under West Saxon domination in 710, when Nothhelm is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia.|$|E

5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|The Roman fortress' layout {{is similar}} to other {{imperial}} outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears. This site was {{the largest in the}} area at , and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction {{in the middle of the}} fourth century CE, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> a 344 earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in 363.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III {{attempted}} {{to lead a}} rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (<b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, {{and the record}} and film outlets available to him through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the quarry for protection, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the quarry workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed {{to the demise of}} the bird by hunting it, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand {{was so great that}} Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine Puffin Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but sometimes get confused, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E

5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a {{group of}} royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, Walter Map, Ralph Diceto, John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Coutances was the {{chaplain}} to Henry the Young King, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service. He became Archdeacon of Oxford, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became Chancellor of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there. This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, {{it does not appear}} that the attempt was a sustained one.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, <b>perhaps</b> <b>by</b> a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
