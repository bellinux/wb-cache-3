40|$|AbstractMembrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase {{purified}} from dog kidney outer medulla was solubilized with octaethylene glycol n-dodecyl ether (C 12 E 8) and incubated with [3 H]ouabain in {{the presence}} of NaCl, ATP and MgCl 2 for 10 min at 0 °C. The resulting enzyme was separated, by high-performance gel chromatography executed at 0. 2 °C, mainly into its (αβ) 2 -diprotomer and αβ-protomer, which both bound stoichiometrically to [3 H]ouabain. The amounts of ouabain that bound to the tissue itself and its microsomes could be estimated in the same way, as [3 H]ouabain was found to bind only to the diprotomer and protomer they possessed. The amounts of ouabain that bound to them in the solubilized state were at least 5 -times higher than those that did so when they were non-solubilized, suggesting that the surfactant rendered the enzyme accessible to ouabain. When the solubilized tissue (138 mg ml− 1 wet tissue) was reacted with ouabain {{in the presence}} of 0. 1 M NaCl and 4. 8 mM MgCl 2 for 10 min at 0 °C, maximal ouabain binding was attained {{in the presence of}} 18. 3 μM [3 H]ouabain, 1. 2 mM ATP and 3 to 5 mg ml− 1 C 12 E 8, which was common to the outer medulla and human colon cancer cells.

40|$|Studies of intact {{smooth muscle}} have {{suggested}} that its anomalous aerobic lactate production may reflect an intracellular compartmentation of glycolytic enzyme cascades designed to support specific exergonic processes. In particular, we have postulated a membrane-associated glycolytic cascade that preferentially supports the ATP requirements of membrane functions. We tested this hypothesis by using a smooth muscle plasma membrane fraction (PMV) <b>purified</b> for calcium <b>pump</b> activity. We show that glycolytic enzymes are endogenous in PMV and can produce NADH, ATP, and lactate from fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate {{in the presence of}} glycolytic cofactors. This glycolytic cascade can fuel the calcium pump despite the presence of an ATP trap that eliminated calcium uptake fueled by exogenously added ATP. This plasma membrane glycolytic cascade is coupled to calcium pump function in a tissue with both oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Thus coupling of metabolic cascades with the specific processes they subserve may be a more general feature of cellular organization than was previously thought. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Some {{opponents of}} {{fracking}} in South Africa are {{skeptical of the}} economic benefits it may have. Some analysts {{have argued that the}} complicated process of <b>pumping,</b> <b>purifying,</b> and finding necessary materials (such as sand and water) needed for fracking activity imposes too many costs to make the venture profitable. Others are skeptical of the estimates of reserve quantities, economic benefits, and job creation. While estimates by the EIA originally had the Karoo holding 485 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, new estimates from the Petroleum Agency of South Africa now state the number to be closer to 40 trillion cubic feet. A Shell-commissioned study still contends that such a number would yield returns of 9.6% of South Africa’s GDP. Farmers in the Karoo are also concerned that development in the area could damage the viability of agricultural work, disrupting the sensitive natural landscape they work in. Lastly, fracking rights are in conflict with a radio telescope planned to be placed where Shell wishes to frack. The telescope represents a $1.87 billion investment, and can only work if placed far away from industrial activity.|$|R
40|$|Paraquat (methyl viologen) -resistant mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2) {{that grew}} and {{sporulated}} normally {{in the presence}} of paraquat were isolated. Based on the positions of the mutant loci in the genetic map, we isolated the pqr (paraquat resistance) gene whose mutation (pqr 501) caused a dominant paraquat-resistant phenotype. The pqr locus consists of two genes (pqrA and pqrB) that form a transcription unit. The pqrA gene encodes a protein with a TetR-like DNA-binding motif, and the pqrB gene encodes a putative efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily. The pqr 501 mutation was a base substitution changing arginine- 18 to glutamine (R 18 Q) near the helix-turn-helix motif in PqrA. A pqrA null mutant exhibited similar paraquat resistance, and an increase in the amount of pqrA promoter-driven transcripts of about eightfold was observed for the pqrA 501 mutant. These results suggest that PqrA is a negative regulator of its own operon. Deletion of the pqrAB operon caused cells to be very sensitive to paraquat, consistent with the prediction that PqrB may function as a paraquat-efflux <b>pump.</b> <b>Purified</b> PqrA protein specifically bound to the pqrA promoter region, whereas mutant R 18 Q protein did not, indicating that PqrA is a direct autoregulator of its own operon...|$|R

A direct doser, controlled {{by means of}} a variable leak valve, was used to dose the substrates. Raman spectra of the samples were collected using a home-built system equipped with an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra-Physics Stabilite 2017, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as an excitation source; a spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon TRIAX 550, Kyoto, Japan), and a CCD detector (Horiba Jobin Yvon Symphony) cooled to 140 K. The wavelength of the incident excitation beam was 514.5 nm. HRPES experiments were performed at the 8 A 2 beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, which was equipped with an electron analyzer (SES 100, Gamma Data Scienta, Uppsala, Sweden). The N 1 s core-level spectrum was obtained using photon energies of 460 eV. Secondary electron emission spectra (− 20 V sample bias) and valence band spectra were measured at photon energies of 80 eV. The binding energies of the core-level spectra were determined with respect to the binding energies of the clean Au 4 f core level and the valence band (Fermi energy) for the same photon energy. All spectra were recorded in the normal emission mode. The photoemission spectra were carefully analyzed using a standard nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure with Voigt functions[17].|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, {{reciprocating}} flow ion exchange has proven itself to be extremely useful for improving the performance of hexavalent chromium solutions. This technology offers many distinct improvements over conventional ion exchange. This paper will detail these improvements, and share the results of case studies performed in 3 shops that used this technology for at least 3 years. Environmental compliance through solid waste reduction, {{is just one of}} the benefits gained by purifying chrome using ion exchange technology. Other benefits include; power cost reduction, productivity improvement, and plating defect reductions. These benefits are maximized when the ion exchange method used is reciprocating flow ion exchange. What is Ion Exchange Purification? Ion exchange chrome purification occurs by pumping hard, decorative or chromic anodize solutions through a filtering unit and then through a column of. cation exchange resin. The resin (typically a polystyrene / divinylbcnzene copolymer) removes up to 90 % of the metallic impurities in a single pass through the column. As the chrome solution passes through the resin, hydrogen is exchanged off the resin and iato the solution. At the same time, cations (e+, trivalent chrome, iron, copper and/or aluminum) are exchanged onto the resin. After the resin is loaded, dilute sulfuric acid is pumped through thk resin. This acid creates an exchange which replaces the metals on the resin with hydrogen in preparation for the next batch of chrome. <b>Purified</b> chrome is <b>pumped</b> to a storage tank for recycle back to the plating baths. Figure 1 shows a typical system layout. The waste stream (containing excess acid and metals) is pumped to the plant's waste treatment system. Even the simplest of batch treatment systems can normally handle this waste stream...|$|R
40|$|Microdischarges {{offer an}} {{alternative}} and often advantageous sensing and actuation method {{that has not been}} significantly exploited in microtransducers. This thesis explores the capabilities of microdischarges to address problems such as cavity pressure control, cavity pressure detection, and purity control of fill gases, which are relevant to microsystems. Microdischarge-based transducers have been developed for these purposes. One interesting aspect of microdischarge-based transducers is the wide latitude of operating temperatures, as they are advantageous for room and high temperature operation. 	On-chip sputter-ion pumps control the pressure and gas purity in cavities. They consist of thin-film titanium electrodes patterned on glass substrates. Microdischarges sputter the cathodes, resulting in the selective chemisorption of titanium-reactive gases. Using DC discharges, these devices have reduced the pressure by 168 Torr in an air-filled, hermetically sealed, 6. 33 cm 3 package. Starting at 200 Torr, the pressure reduction rate of air is 7. 2 Torr/h; oxygen 11. 5 Torr/h, and nitrogen 3. 4 Torr/h. Relative humidity is reduced at 6 %/h. The pumps do not remove helium, purifying gas environments by selectively removing contaminating nitrogen and oxygen. A theoretical model outlining the dependency of gas removal rates on microdischarge parameters is presented. 	Microdischarge-based pressure sensors operate by correlating the measured change in spatial current distribution of pulsed DC microdischarges with pressure. One sensor version uses three-dimensional arrays of horizontal bulk metal electrodes embedded in quartz substrates with electrode diameters of 1 - 2 mm and 50 - 100 µm inter-electrode spacing. These devices have been operated over 10 - 2, 000 Torr, at temperatures as high as 1, 000 ˚C. The maximum measured sensitivity is 5, 420 ppm/Torr, while the minimum temperature coefficient of sensitivity is - 550 ppm/K. Sensors of a second version use planar electrodes, with 0. 13 mm 2 active areas. 	To explore the utility of pressure controlling devices, these transducers are combined with an optical emission sensor to create a high temperature gas phase chemical detection microsystem. The microdischarge-based pressure sensor determines the sample and backfilling gas pressure while the microscale-sputter-ion <b>pump</b> <b>purifies</b> the gas environment. The contaminating nitrogen concentration has been reduced by 56. 5 x relative to helium and the spectral detection limit has been improved by 8 x for carbon at 200 °C...|$|R
