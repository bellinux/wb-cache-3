50|$|MitigationThe {{purpose of}} {{mitigation}} {{is not only}} to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resourcesStructural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline. Structural management deals {{with the use of the}} following: groins which are man-made solution to longshore current movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastline.</b> Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.|$|E

40|$|Coastal lagoons play a {{vital role}} in {{supporting}} human well-being and the conservation of unique biological resources. They are crucial for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastline</b> from extreme events like floods, and for providing diverse livelihood opportunities to people. However, coastal lagoons face a range of threats from multiple drivers at local, regional and global scales, and those drivers are both anthropogenic and climatic in nature. In this thesis, I use a commons approach to examine changes in property rights regime in the Nurerri and Jubho lagoons of Pakistan to better understand their linkages with processes of environmental change. Both Nurerri and Jubho Lagoons are designated Ramsar sites inthe Indus delta of Pakistan, which is the world’s fifth largest delta system. The entire region, which includes a number of other important wetlands, has undergone serious degradation over the past three decades. This research considers the history of changes in the property rights regime in relation to the processes of environmental change. My main focus is to understand the extent to which environmental changes (i. e. reduced fresh water flow, recurrent floods, industrial pollution, and sea inundation) and changes in property rights (i. e. state property, communal property, partially open access, individual / private control) influence each other in times of uncertainty and how these changes affect the local communities. I also focus on the key drivers that influence these changes. I use a qualitative approach that offers a direction to my research and participatory methods for data collection. Findings indicate that there is a two-way feedback between environmental changes in the two lagoons and the system of property rights that shifted from a commons arrangement (mid 1970 s) to being privately owned and then to a contractor system (1980 s onward) before coming back to a commons arrangement in 2008. However, loss in the key physical and environmental features of the lagoons raises fundamental questions about sustaining / re-establishing commons even though policies are in place. I conclude with suggestions on sustaining lagoon commons for the future through crafting innovative governance arrangements that combine dynamic processes of change both in the physical and social spheres...|$|E

40|$|Manado City is growing, its {{population}} is increasing. This demands {{the city to}} grow outside its borders and even into the sea by using land reclamation. Introducing new challenges or making challenges bigger, which are already present. Not only growth {{is present in the}} city, going forward and becoming better and better is an on-going fight for cities. The city came up with a vision “Manado, Model City of Eco Tourism” and a mission “Make Manado a City of Happiness” for their future. Introducing a study on this subject and to anticipate on the city’s goals, the research question is stated as; What are the options to supplement Manado’s vision and mission, making the city more safe and attractive for tourists and citizens? Within this research, two other challenges regarding Manado city will be investigated as well. In <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> 2003 a major flood occurred in the city, causing great damage to the city with many casualties. Nowadays, <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> flooding is still present. Secondly, a challenge arises at <b>the</b> border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>coastline</b> <b>of</b> Manado suffers from erosion at specific locations, possibly caused by development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reclaimed land in the past. Narrowing the research, an analysis will be made upon selected subjects. Analysing the coastal protection, river floods and the city’s Vision and Mission gives a clear view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current state and what could be expected from the future. The goal is to come to a sound idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs and possibilities related to coastal protection, Kota Manado and its Vision and Mission. Working towards advices, different time paths and desires are noticed. Besides recommendations, which can be adopted at any time, found solutions are divided in short, mid and long term time spans. On short term the rivers and garbage have to be handled and nuisance of either one increases day by day. At many places the river is blocked. Removing these blockages is a good start. In addition, the embankments and beds can be ‘smoothened’, to improve the river’s flow. Besides the river attention on the short term, garbage clogs up the city. Waste Management Control is already improving. Clean ups have to be supported by the government, giving a good example to its citizens. By these measures a start is made to work towards real solutions, coming to an Improved Garbage Service. As mentioned before, improving the Waste Management Control is a continuing process. Besides the short term, this solution has a mid-term basis too. By adaption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 R-principle, garbage will be even less. This principle represents the Reduction, Reuse and Recycle <b>of</b> materials. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> waste will reduce and the city will be cleaner, although it will take a while to adopt. Measurements need to be coordinated and monitored. Making so-called Pre-Project-Planning gives benefits to make them successful. This should not only be used in this case, but also for regular Civil Engineering projects. Erosion is another problem Manado City is facing nowadays. However, its effects evolve more slowly and are thereby less noticeable. <b>The</b> <b>coastline</b> <b>of</b> Manado can be divided in three sections. Section one consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastline</b> and <b>the</b> municipality is already undertaking action to stop the erosion. The adopted measures are well designed and thought through. Even on places where there’s little area to construct a protection, the chosen measure could also be used. Section two is located near the boulevard area. Large land reclamations are constructed along the shore. The reclaimed areas are well protected by big stones and do not suffer from any erosion. These large land reclamations, however, do have side effects. One <b>of</b> them is <b>the</b> change in the current, leading to a flow towards the ’Bunaken’ coral reef area. This flow transports a lot of sediment, dust and garbage and killing a lot of fish and coral. So, for future land reclamations, an investigation into these effects must be done if the city really cares about its environment and wants to prevent it from destroying. Section three is situated in <b>the</b> North <b>of</b> Manado. <b>The</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>coastline</b> consists <b>of</b> vegetation and Mangroves. Due to certain changes in the past, among others construction of reclaimed areas, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern shoreline started to erode. <b>The</b> continuing process <b>of</b> erosion can be resolved on a mid-term base. With solutions like, for instance Mangroves, it can stop the erosion and improve <b>the</b> environmental value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastline</b> as well, leading to an eco-friendly solution. A sustainable future for <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Manado is obtained by their vision “Manado Model City for Ecotourism” and mission “To Make Manado City a city <b>of</b> Happiness”. <b>The</b> government cannot do this on its own. Involving and, most important, convincing <b>the</b> local community <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vision and mission will speed up the progression. This combines the short and long term philosophy. On short notice the local community has to be convinced and at the same time, the long term vision and mission can be fulfilled too. Manado City has a great amount of opportunities to fulfil their mission and are they are well available. Even small improvements can make a change. A good example to use the opportunities and to anticipate on the mission and vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city is to construct several parks or a beach in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> town. A park or a beach can be created to attract not only tourists but also local citizens. For tourists, including divers, it will be a welcoming relaxing spot to comfort their stay in Manado. So in this way it will give the mission and vision of Manado a tremendous boost. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{regional}} coastal planning, {{starting with a}} look at <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new coastal planning responsibilities assumed by the Catalan Government as established in article 149. 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Statute <b>of</b> Autonomy of Catalonia, and then analysing the urban master plans for the coastal system. The thesis begins (Chapter 1) with a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal framework for coastal planning and its complex division of responsibilities, which has been conditioned by two recent events: the new responsibilities incurred by the Catalan Government in <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> coastal planning and sentence 31 / 2010 passed by the Constitutional Court concerning the Statute. Then (in Chapter 2) other coastal planning models, with problems similar to our own, are studied by comparing cases in both foreign and autonomous law that provide solutions and ideas to help shape a more ambitious model for <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> our <b>coastline.</b> <b>The</b> main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis (Chapter 3) deals with the key to the current plans for the Catalan coastline: the urban master plans for the coastal system. Seven years after they were passed a jurisprudential analysis has been conducted to know how well they fit in with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> municipal autonomy, their suitability to regional and municipal planning, and the possible pecuniary liability incurred by the state upon their approval. The thesis concludes (Chapter 4) by defending the need to articulate an integrated management model for <b>the</b> Catalan <b>coastline</b> with a Catalan law governing coastal planning, which would serve to deal not only with the risks this area is subject to, but also with the need to limit <b>the</b> negative effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state coastal lawLa tesi se centra en l’estudi de l’ordenació urbanística i territorial del litoral, partint de les potencialitats de les noves competències de la Generalitat de Catalunya en ordenació del litoral atorgades per l’article 149. 3 de l’Estatut i analitzant la figura dels plans directors urbanístics del sistema costaner. El treball s’inicia (capítol I) amb l’estudi de l’evolució del marc jurídic en ordenació del litoral i el seu complex marc competencial, condicionat per dos elements recents: les noves competències traspassades a la Generalitat en matèria d’ordenació del litoral i la Sentència del Tribunal Constitucional 31 / 2010 sobre l’Estatut. A continuació (capítol II) s’estudien altres models d’ordenació litoral en el dret comparat estranger —de França, Itàlia i els EUA— i autonòmic, amb problemàtiques similars a les nostres, que ens aporten solucions i idees per ajudar a configurar un model més ambiciós de protecció de la nostra costa. En la part central de la tesi (capítol III) s’aborda l’estudi de la peça clau de l’actual ordenació del litoral català: els plans directors urbanístics del sistema costaner. Set anys després de la seva aprovació —i a través de la jurisprudència—, s’analitza el seu encaix en el principi d’autonomia municipal, la seva adequació al planejament territorial i municipal, així com l’eventual responsabilitat patrimonial que va operar en la seva aprovació. Finalment, el treball es clou (capítol IV) defensant la necessitat d’articular un model de gestió integrada del litoral català a través d’una llei catalana d’ordenació del litoral que serveixi per fer front als riscos a què es troba sotmès aquest espai, però també a la necessitat de limitar els efectes negatius de la reforma de la Llei de costes estatal que ara es plantej...|$|R
