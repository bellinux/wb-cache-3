5000|$|During British rule, {{one had to}} go {{by train}} to Giridih and then travel in a vehicle called <b>push-push</b> to Hazaribagh. It was pushed and pulled by human force over hilly tracts. It was an {{exciting}} journey across rivers and through dense forests infested with bandits and wild animals. Rabindranath Tagore travelled in a <b>push-push</b> along the route in 1885. He recorded the experience in an essay, [...] "Chotanagpur families". When the Grand Chord railway line was opened in 1906, Hazaribagh Road railway station became the link with the town. For many years, Lal Motor Company operated the rail-cum-bus service between Hazaribagh town and Hazaribagh Road railway station.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} Gibson-style wiring is {{augmented by}} Yamaha's <b>push-push</b> tone pot switches which knock out the outer coils of each Alnico V humbucker allowing for combinations of humbucking to single-coil use. The coil-taps produce a Strat-style mix with both pickups on, while the neck single-coil alone provides a thinner, more acoustic like {{version of the}} plummy humbucker mode.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} {{included three}} special-design Alnico 5 single-coil pickups with solid covers and an internal dummy coil for hum cancellation, {{as well as}} three <b>push-push</b> buttons for pickup selection. Controls include a master volume, a TBX treble/bass expander and an active MDX midrange booster with 12 dB of gain.

50|$|Rickshaws, {{known as}} pousse-pousse, were {{introduced}} by British missionaries. The {{intention was to}} eliminate the slavery-associated palanquin. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning <b>push-push,</b> is reportedly gained from {{the need to have}} a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar's hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially Antsirabe, but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads. They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated.|$|E

These early 1990s Jeff Beck Stratocasters were finished in Surf Green, Vintage White, and Midnight Purple.|$|E
50|$|If {{the output}} of an {{amplifier}} stage is simply tuned to a multiple of {{the frequency with which}} the stage is driven, the stage will give a large harmonic output. Many transmitters have used this simple approach successfully. However these more complex circuits will do a better job. In a <b>push-push</b> stage, the output will only contain even harmonics. This is because the currents which would generate the fundamental and the odd harmonics in this circuit are canceled by the second device. In a push-pull stage, the output will contain only odd harmonics because of the canceling effect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{culmination}} of the CBS [...] "cost-cutting" [...] may have occurred in 1983, when the Fender Stratocaster received a short-lived redesign lacking a second tone control and a bare-bones output jack, as well as redesigned single-coil pickups, active electronics, and three <b>push-push</b> buttons for pickup selection (Elite Series). Additionally, previous models such as the Swinger (also known as Musiclander) and Custom (also known as Maverick) were perceived by some musicians {{as little more than}} attempts to squeeze profits out of factory stock. The so-called [...] "pre-CBS cult" [...] refers to the popularity of Fenders made before the sale.|$|E
50|$|The Precision Bass Plus is an {{electric}} bass made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation and designed by George Blanda in 1989.

Other features included a solid alder or ash body, a 1-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard, adjustable Lace Sensor Precision and Jazz pickups, Schaller deluxe die-cast tuning machines, 3-ply black, parchment or 4-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard, Schaller Elite fine-tuning bridge, 3-way toggle pickup switch, master volume, series/parallel <b>push-push</b> button for the neck pickup and master TBX tone. It was discontinued in 1993.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} with synthesis, kinetic studies and conformational analysis of some model peptides. We have compared the UV-Vis absorption spectra, the trans-to-cis photoisomerization and the cis-to-trans thermal isomerization of azobenzene peptides {{with those of}} precursor 4, 4 ´-diaminoazobenzene, 4, 4 ´-dicarboxylic acid azobenzene and parent azobenzene. The thermal decay is exponential and follows the first-order kinetics in all the cases we have considered. Whatever the substituent is, the rate is always faster than that of parent cis-azobenzene. Our experimental work shows that the energy of activation is different from substituent to substituent and even from solvent to solvent. The chain elongations of both the <b>push-push</b> and pull-pull azobenzenes by amide group with alanine residues cause the rate reduction in all cases.

40|$|A Japanese drum may {{consist of}} a hollow wood barrel with {{diaphragms}} at both ends. The diaphragms are assumed as a pairs of identical stretched membranes with bending stiffness included. These diaphragms are dynamically coupled through the interior air cavity and the wood body. A numerical model for this coupled fluid-structure system is developed using the finite-element method. Axisymmetrical shell and acoustic elements are developed for the structure and fluid, respectively. MATLAB is used as the pre- and post- processors. The first two non-rigid body modes of the drum are: (1) the two diaphragms vibrate in phase, the push-pull mode, and (2) the two diaphragms vibrate out-of-phase, the <b>push-push</b> (or pull-pull) mode. Without air loading, these two modal frequencies only differ slightly, which means the effect by the wood body is small.
