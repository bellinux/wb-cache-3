40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to develop}} a PMP {{estimation}} method in a basin-scale by considering both temporal and spatial characteristics and to compare the existing PMP estimation method with the developed method in this study. Since the movement of heavy rainfall is predictable like typhoons, DAD analysis method is usually utilized to storm centered DAD method and fixed areal DAD method. However, utilizing DAD in bigger basin area or longer rainfall duration induces more errors in estimation of average areal rainfall and thus reducing {{the accuracy of the}} results. Therefore, new DAD analysis method is necessary to improve the accuracy. In this study, by utilizing the new DAD analysis method, PMP was estimated through the processes of: firstly, converting point rainfall data to distributed areal rainfall data; secondly, a Grid-based rainfall search method was developed through the utilization of Average Point-tracking; and lastly, the PMP was calculated by considering moisture maximization. PMP estimation from using the new method was compared with the existing PMP as well as the areal <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>precipitation.</b> As a result, even though the new estimate is lower than the exiting PMP, it was larger than the areal <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>precipitation</b> (200 -Year 48 -Hour Areal Rainfall Frequency). Therefore, the estimated PMP can be utilized for the flood estimation...|$|R

In this study, the amount of 24 -h PMP was estimated by Hershfield, Bethlahmy and modified Bethlahmy methods using date obtained from meteorological and Ministry of Energy over 15 or more years.  The results showed that there exist large differences between statistical and synoptic methods; however, there are rather smaller differences between Bethlahmy and synoptic methods. For modified Bethlahmy method, the results were multiplied by a coefficient of relative humidity. Then the calibrated 24 -h PMP values were estimated for all meteorological stations of Iran and a contour map of 24 -h PMP for the country was developed.

40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{formulation of}} Hershfield's statistical method for estimating <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>precipitation</b> (PMP) is proposed.

In addition, using the same data set, it is shown that Hershfield's estimate of PMP may be obtained using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with shape parameter given as a specified linear function of the average value of annual maximum precipitation series and for return period of about 60, 000 years. This formulation substitutes completely the standard empirical nomograph that is used for the application of the method. The application of the method can be improved when long series of local rainfall data are available that support an accurate estimation of the shape parameter of the GEV distribution...|$|E
