5|$|Born {{and raised}} in New York City, Blatty {{received}} his bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown University in 1950, and his master's degree in English literature from the George Washington University. Following completion of his master's degree in 1954, he joined the United States Air Force, where {{he worked in the}} <b>Psychological</b> <b>Warfare</b> Division. After service in the air force, he worked for the United States Information Agency in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Prevented by treaty from invading the Holy See's embassy, U.S. {{soldiers}} {{erected a}} perimeter around the Nunciature. <b>Psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> {{was used in}} an attempt to dislodge him, including blaring rock music, and turning a nearby field into a helicopter landing zone. After ten days of Operation Nifty Package, Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990. He was detained as a prisoner of war, and later taken to the United States.|$|E
5|$|USSOCOM conducts several covert and clandestine missions, such {{as direct}} action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, foreign {{internal}} defense, unconventional warfare, <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare,</b> civil affairs, and counter-narcotics operations. Each branch has a Special Operations Command that {{is unique and}} capable of running its own operations, but when the different special operations forces {{need to work together}} for an operation, USSOCOM becomes the joint component command of the operation, instead of a SOC of a specific branch.|$|E

50|$|Evidence {{within the}} {{documents}} {{suggest that the}} U.S. military has been paying Afghan radio and print media to run favorable stories, with two prominent examples being Radio Ghaznawiyaan and Wakht News Agency. One document refers to supplying pre-made content to a radio station, describing that content as <b>psychological</b> operations/psychological <b>warfare</b> (PSYOP) material.|$|R
5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare,</b> which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} U.S. President in 1952, {{promising}} {{to take a}} harder line against communism; the links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions {{about the extent of}} communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare.</b> This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad has {{authored}} several books. He {{wrote about}} the <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> of the Norwegian resistance movement in DURHAM: hemmelige operasjoner i Trøndelag mot tysk okkkupasjonsmakt 1943-45, released in 1981. Durham was the codeword for the operations which {{to a large extent}} consisted of distributing flyers, brochures and posters with the purpose of demoralising the Germans. This was also the topic in Psykologisk krigføring i Norge under Annen Verdenskrig 1940-45, published in 1994. In 1990 he {{wrote about the}} resistance group Lark in LARK: Milorg i Trøndelag 1940-1945.|$|E

5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare,</b> massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare,</b> intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946. He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where {{he earned his}} bachelor's degree in English in 1950. Those years at Georgetown were probably {{the best years of}} my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF <b>Psychological</b> <b>Warfare</b> Division.|$|E

50|$|Military {{psychology}} matured {{well past}} the areas aforementioned that concerned psychologists up until this time, branching off into sectors that included military leadership, the effects of environmental factors on human performance, military intelligence, <b>psychological</b> operations and <b>warfare</b> (such as Special Forces like PSYOP), selection for special duties, and the influences of personal background, attitudes, and the work group on soldier motivation and morals.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the role}} of the militants in leading the Uprising, the colonial {{authorities}} immediately accused the MDRM of instigating the movement. This view was echoed by PADESM leaders and shared by the majority of French settlers. The French authorities responded by targeting not only MDRM leaders and members, but also their supporters, drawing the wider population into the conflict. Attacks against the colonial authority in the east were immediately followed by similar actions in the south of the island before rapidly spreading throughout the country. The movement enjoyed particularly strong support in the south, where the revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for the nationalist cause. The French responded with heavy military action and <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare,</b> including incidences of crimes against humanity. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed, and the last of the fighters disbanded and fled into the forests in December 1948.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad {{joined the}} Norwegian {{resistance}} movement after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940. He {{was arrested in}} Sweden for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity {{in the country in}} 1941, and was sent to the United Kingdom where he joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of Lark, assigned with establishing radio connection with London. He led Lark in Trøndelag between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of Milorg in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande. He also founded the Durham organisation for conducting <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> {{towards the end of the}} war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the Second World War led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> by the CIA. Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War. 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Sherman's neckties {{were also}} a feature of Sherman's March to the Sea, a {{campaign}} designed to bring total war, serious destruction, to the Confederate States of America. Sherman implemented [...] "scorched earth" [...] policies; he and Union Army commander Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant believed that the Civil War would end only if the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and <b>psychological</b> capacities for <b>warfare</b> were decisively broken.|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} Wasp {{comes from the}} idea that the main character's actions and central purpose mimic that {{particular}} insect; just as something as small as a wasp can terrorise a much larger creature in control of a car to the point of causing a crash and killing the occupants, so the defeat of an enemy may be wrought via <b>psychological</b> and guerrilla <b>warfare</b> by a small, but deadly, protagonist in their midst.|$|R
25|$|Sherman's Savannah Campaign is more {{popularly known}} as the March to the Sea. He and Grant {{believed}} that the Civil War would end only if the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and <b>psychological</b> capacity for <b>warfare</b> were decisively broken. Sherman therefore applied the principles of scorched earth, ordering his troops to burn crops, kill livestock, consume supplies, and destroy civilian infrastructure along their path. This policy {{is one of the}} key tenets of a strategy of total war.|$|R
5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare</b> {{operation}} that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E
5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare.</b> Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare.</b> Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E
50|$|As {{a primary}} {{inspiration}} to du Picq, fellow Périgueux native Marshal Thomas Bugeaud {{was responsible for}} supporting him in his calculating and objective view of military operations. Bugeaud's experiences with Marshal Suchet, a highly regarded former general of Napoleon's, left an indelible impression upon the Marshal that were handed down to du Picq. Marshal Bugeaud's aide de camp, Louis Jules Trochu, provided another inspiration with his work L'Armée Française en 1867, in which Trochu emphasized <b>psychological</b> difficulties in <b>warfare.</b>|$|R

25|$|Rather than {{focusing}} specifically on causing casualties and physical destruction {{resulting in the}} attrition or annihilation of enemy forces, effects-based operations emphasizes end-state goals first, and then focuses on the means available to achieve those goals.

While effects-based operations does not rule out lethal operations, it places them as options in a series of operational choices for military commanders.|$|R
5|$|Lark {{received}} missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and {{constituted the}} leadership of Milorg in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter, and he soon {{became one of the}} most important persons in {{the leadership of}} Milorg. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943. Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943, and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in <b>psychological</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E

50|$|Adolf Hitler {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the <b>psychological</b> tactics of <b>warfare</b> the British had employed during WWI, and attributed the defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers.

Joseph Goebbels was appointed as Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed Hitler as a messianic figure for the redemption of Germany. Hitler also coupled this with the resonating projections of his orations for effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of World War II brought into clear focus two facts for the United States: warfare had {{entered a new}} era with nuclear weapons {{and the emergence of}} Communist China brought a direct challenge to United States foreign policy. To meet the Chinese threat the United States has the Seventh Fleet as a military tool to help implement political decision. This thesis examines the relevance of the Seventh Fleet as a military-political tool. Few direct sources in book form on Seventh Fleet are to be found. Sources of information were: Congressional Record, United States Department of State Bulletins, news media, United States Naval Institute Proceedings, and Chinese periodicals. The conclusions regarding this Fleet are: it augments SAC as a deterrent force; it is an ideal flexible political-military tool at the brushfire war level; and it is generally impotent to counter the political and <b>psychological</b> guerrilla <b>warfare</b> being conducted in Southeast Asia. The Seventh Fleet is largely circumscribed by the nature of this conflict, but it is still a valid force to the politician within the limits of its mission...|$|R
