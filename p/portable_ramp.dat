50|$|In 1986, using a <b>portable</b> <b>ramp,</b> {{he jumped}} from the Foresthill Bridge in California on a {{motorcycle}} then deployed his parachute, leaving the motorcycle to smash to pieces in the canyon below.|$|E
50|$|All {{platforms}} are ADA-accessible. Because {{the train}} level {{is higher than}} the platform level, a <b>portable</b> <b>ramp</b> must be used to load and unload disabled guests at all stations. For many years, the Contemporary Resort station did not have ADA access, but an elevator has since been added to the platform.|$|E
50|$|A {{wheelchair}} ramp can be permanent, semi-permanent or <b>portable.</b> Permanent <b>ramps</b> {{are designed to}} be bolted or otherwise attached in place. Semi-permanent ramps rest on top of the ground or concrete pad and are commonly used for the short term. Permanent and semi-permanent ramps are usually of aluminum, concrete or wood. <b>Portable</b> <b>ramps</b> are usually aluminum and typically fold for ease of transport. <b>Portable</b> <b>ramps</b> are primarily intended for home and building use but can also be used with vans to load an unoccupied mobility device or to load an occupied mobility device when both the device and the passenger are easy to handle.|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>portable</b> <b>ramps</b> are {{available}} for use with many vehicles and typically do not require any vehicle modification. <b>Portable</b> wheelchair <b>ramps</b> cost much less both to purchase and to maintain. Since they are not attached to the vehicle, they can be {{also be used for}} handicapped access for other applications.|$|R
50|$|A third {{launching}} site, is now {{located on}} the Coffeen Nature Preserve, a Sierra Club property east of Destin, Florida, featured a concrete inclined launch <b>ramp.</b> Steam-powered and <b>portable</b> <b>ramps</b> were also tested at this site.|$|R
50|$|In many countries, {{such as the}} UK, {{the owners}} of {{inaccessible}} buildings who have not provided permanent access measures are still required by local equality legislation to provide 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure that disabled {{people are able to}} access their services and are not excluded. These may range from keeping a <b>portable</b> <b>ramp</b> on hand to allow a wheelchair user to cross an inaccessible threshold, to providing personal service to access goods they are not otherwise able to reach.|$|E
50|$|Their {{observation}} of the three- to five-foot cliff just inland from the beach permitted the LVT units to engineer a simple yet ingenious design of a deployable, <b>portable</b> <b>ramp</b> with its frame made from timbers. This allowed them to potentially exit the LVT over the obstacle as they were immediately dropped in place. The wheeled and tracked vehicles were able funnel their way inland from the narrow beaches. They successfully confirmed the usability of WHITE #1 and #2 for the major landing assaults to follow. The recon Marines accomplished their missions without {{the loss of a}} single man and were able to bring back sketches as well as samples of the vegetation for study.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} three {{monorail}} {{lines from the}} Transportation and Ticket Center to either Magic Kingdom or Epcot, which comprise the fare-free Walt Disney World Monorail System. The three lines, and the rolling stock of twelve Mark VI monorails, are maintained by Disney and form part of the Walt Disney World transportation system. The monorails are ADA-accessible and stroller-accessible, {{though there is a}} vertical gap between the monorails and the platforms, so wheelchair users must use a <b>portable</b> <b>ramp,</b> located at each station, to board the monorail. The monorail system opened in 1971 with the Magic Kingdom [...] "Resort" [...] and [...] "Express" [...] monorail lines; the former runs in a loop between Magic Kingdom and the TTC via the Polynesian, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary Resorts, while the latter bypasses the resorts and goes directly between the TTC and Magic Kingdom via a parallel loop. The Epcot line was added in 1982. , the system {{is one of the most}} heavily used monorail systems in the world with over 150,000 daily riders.|$|E
50|$|Wheelchair {{accessible}} vehicles {{may also}} include a ramp to facilitate entry and exit. These may be built-in or portable designs. Most major automotive companies offer rebates for <b>portable</b> <b>ramps</b> and mobility access equipment for new vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second day}} of the May, 1910, race weekend started with a special event, a [...] "Hazard Race." [...] Each car went out separately, driving over <b>portable</b> <b>ramps</b> on the track, into the creek in the infield, under the track, into the parking lot, across the {{automobile}} bridge over the track, and eventually back onto the track. The total distance was a bit over a lap, and the winner was determined by the best time.|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. Army Air Forces {{continued}} {{development of}} the JB-2 as Project MX-544, with two versions— one with preset internal guidance and another with radar control. Several launch platforms were developed, including permanent and <b>portable</b> <b>ramps,</b> and mobile launching from beneath the wings of Boeing B-17G or Boeing B-29 bombers, much as the Heinkel He 111H-22 had [...] for the Luftwaffe in offensive air-launches of V-1s against the Allies. [...] Testing continued from 1944 to 1947 at Eglin to improve launch and guidance.|$|R
50|$|Crest: On {{a wreath}} {{of the colors}} (argent and gules) an embattled tower azure issuant from a mound of snow proper {{supporting}} a lion rampant or, holding in dexter forepaw an acorn of the last, slipped and leaved vert, surmounting and extending above the tower and in base {{the upper part of}} two spears saltirewise, shafts of the second, heads vert and tied {{at the center of the}} like. The shield is red for Engineers. The mailed fist is indicative of the power and aggressive-ness of the organization while the <b>portable</b> <b>ramp</b> indicates one of its functions. World War II service during which it was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation is indicated by the blue embattled tower in the color of the citation streamer and signifies repeated attacks against fortified towns. The white mound refers to the heavy snow and icy conditions encountered during the Ardennes-Alsace campaign. The gold rampant lion is from the coat of arms of Belgium while the acorn with leaves alludes to the great forests of the Ardennes and to the oak, an emblem of courage. The colors green and red commemorate the Belgian fourragere awarded the unit and the two spears allude to service with the 2d Armored Division which spearheaded the drive into Belgium and pierced the enemy defenses in the Ardennes. The arrowheads on the spears also refer to assault landings in North Africa and Sicily during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The MONOC Bariatric Transport Unit {{is larger}} {{than any of the}} other {{ambulances}} in MONOC’s fleet, and features a hydraulic suspension capable of lowering the back of the vehicle to allow a stretcher to be more easily loaded. It has also been equipped with a bariatric stretcher that is larger and able to accommodate patients weighing up to 1,600 pounds, a system of <b>portable</b> <b>ramps,</b> and an electric winch designed to load and unload the patient with safety and a reduced chance of injury to the caregivers. All of the vehicle modifications were performed by MONOC’s Fleet Services Department.|$|R
50|$|Huyton is staffed {{and open}} for {{approximately}} 18 {{hours a day}} and is equipped with a booking office, a payphone and a vending machine. There is undercover seating on each platform, as well as customer help points and live departure and arrival screens. Recent improvements include lifts to the platforms and ramped walkways from the subway, to allow step-free access to the platforms for passengers with wheelchairs or prams. <b>Portable</b> <b>ramps</b> are also available for access from the platforms to trains. The station is close to Huyton bus station and the local shopping centre. The station also has its own car park, a taxi rank and cycle racks.|$|R
50|$|As can be {{expected}} of a terminus railway station for a large town, it is staffed and open for 24 hours a day, and is equipped with payphones, vending machines, toilets and indoor seating, {{as well as a}} customer service office and a booking office. Step-free access to the station and platform is available for passengers with wheelchairs or prams, and <b>portable</b> <b>ramps</b> are also available for platform to train access. The station has its own covered concourse and, adjoining the concourse, it has a Pumpkin cafe, as well as a Point shop to Go convenience store. The station also has a 30-space car park, and adjoining bus connections, which can also accommodate Plusbus ticket holders.|$|R
50|$|Some mobile crushes are {{equipped}} {{with a set of}} wheels so they can be towed from yard to yard. A few of these portable crushes are built so the crush may also be used as a <b>portable</b> loading <b>ramp.</b> A mobile crush must incorporate a strong floor, to prevent the animal moving it by walking along the ground.|$|R
50|$|The National Park Service {{provides}} a launch <b>ramp,</b> <b>portable</b> toilet dump station, free boat pump-out station, picnic area, fish cleaning station, {{and a small}} airport called Bullfrog Basin Airport.|$|R
50|$|Opened 17 September 1866 {{the station}} was {{originally}} {{going to be a}} temporary one but was eventually made permanent by the Midland Railway. From the start {{the station was}} manned from a small wooden hut which included the waiting room and toilet. As well as the hut there were lampposts for lighting and a bench. There was a single track siding which included a loading gauge, <b>portable</b> livestock <b>ramp</b> and a small goods shed.|$|R
5000|$|McGill mainly skated vertical, {{and when}} street skating began to {{dominate}} the industry, McGill turned to {{the business side of}} skating. He started his own skateboard company, [...] "Chapter Seven" [...] (which is now defunct), and opened his own skate park. As of 2012, he owns a skate shop in Encinitas, California McGills Skateshop, as well as marketing a line of beginners' skateboards, safety equipment and <b>portable</b> skate <b>ramps,</b> rails, and Air Speed skate shoes through Wal-Mart.|$|R
50|$|After he met {{professional}} photographer Sean Stromsoe, {{he was able}} to shoot a documentary video about the community, which allowed them to start Ethiopia Skate and would lead to an Indiegogo campaign, in which Ethiopia Skate raised $14,900. The money was used for shipping and tax on donated equipment and to build one <b>portable</b> mini <b>ramp,</b> two rails and two kickers that are able to be moved around the city, as there is still no real skatepark available. This has allowed them to get more kids to skate and to expand further.|$|R
50|$|Improvements to the DVAs (Digital Voice Announcements) with {{differential}} {{pitch of}} the voice allow more natural sounding speech. These announcements were modified in July 2013, and again in January 2014. They have not been modified since then. All the stations included in the stopping pattern are also announced prior to or soon after departure from a terminus stop. ‘Smart’ air-conditioning automatically adjusts to the outside temperature {{and the number of}} passengers on board. Accessibility features include 16 wheelchair spaces, <b>portable</b> wheelchair <b>ramps</b> in the end cars, red fabric on priority seating and additional handrails compared to older trains in the fleet.|$|R
2500|$|During {{work on the}} Incline Contract for the Rimutaka Incline, {{land was}} taken just {{north-east}} of Lucena’s Creek (known today as Owhanga Stream) for a road diversion around {{what was to become}} the yard for a station identified on plans as Lucena’s. [...] By the time the station was opened in 1878, its name had been changed to Pigeon Bush. [...] It had a passenger platform and shelter shed, loading bank, <b>portable</b> sheep loading <b>ramp,</b> a loop siding and a crossing loop.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{first hand}} account of flood damage caused to {{accessible}} ramps by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is provided. The impacts of this damage to {{and destruction of}} ramps on the mobility and evacuation older adults and disabled people in affected areas is discussed, and the extent and causes of the damages are explained and quantified. An overview of various sponsors of existing ramp design guidelines is provided. Interventions are proposed, such as the establishment of additional specifications to enhance and strengthen ramp connections and mitigate future flood damage affecting the disabled and elderly. Issues for future investigation and research are discussed. Among them are the advisability of <b>portable,</b> temporary <b>ramps</b> in case of ramp failure from flood; flood preparedness/proofing of lifts for future raised housing; and the advisability of institutional partnering of various organizations such as FEMA, disability, veteran affairs and human services, insurance providers, as well as engineers, architects, and urban planners for establishing flood resistant design specifications for ramp design and construction and incentives that encourage compliance with such specifications...|$|R
