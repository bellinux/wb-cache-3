50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>photochemical</b> <b>processes</b> is the low {{efficiency of the}} conversion of electrical energy in the radiation energy of the required wavelength.

The quantum yield for the photochlorination of n-heptane is about 7000, for example. In photochlorination plants, the quantum yield is about 100. In contrast to the thermal chlorination, which can utilize the formed reaction energy, the energy required to maintain the photochemical reaction must be constantly delivered.|$|E
