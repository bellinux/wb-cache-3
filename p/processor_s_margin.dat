40|$|In {{this project}} an AMBER <b>processor</b> <b>s</b> ALU is {{synthesized}} {{to operate in}} the near/subthreshold region. The main motivation for this work is to study the possibility of implementing near/subthreshold modules in the SHMAC processor. These modules may be used for low requirement operations and are supposed to decrease the power consumption of the system. Near/subthreshold operation is a developing method to reduce power consumption in static MOS technology. It consists on using near/subthreshold voltages to reduce the dynamic power of the system. The dynamic power consumption is proportional to the square of the operational voltage so, in theory, reducing the supply voltage can significantly reduce the power usage of the system. A cell library consisting in NAND,NOR, XOR, inverter and D Flip-flop gates is created aimed to work with a near/subthreshold voltage supply. This was done using CADENCE and standard 65 nm CMOS technology. AMBER <b>processor</b> <b>s</b> ALU is synthesized using the custom library created, and simulated for 400 mV...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Continental {{margins are}} diverse and {{important}} sedimentary landforms {{that serve as}} a substrate {{for a variety of}} purposes: benthic habitats for fisheries, ship navigation and national defense operations, and engineering activities (i. e. oil and gas platforms, pipelines, cables, wind farms). Continental shelf margins also contain hard mineral resources such as aggregate sand and gravel. Because margins are increasingly important, comprehensive and integrated databases are needed for scientists to produce base maps displaying thematic information such as seafloor geology, sediment character and texture, roughness, and critical shear stress. The new usSEABED software system provides a mechanism for compiling diverse seabed datasets of U. <b>S.</b> <b>margins</b> from across the marine science community. The USGS is using usSEABED to map benthic habitats and conduct national assessments of offshore aggregates for use as potential sand sources for beach nourishment purposes.

50|$|The {{problem of}} using {{multiple}} computers {{lies in the}} difficulty of dividing up the tasks among the computers, without having to reference portions of the code being executed on other CPUs.Amdahl's law expresses the speedup of a program {{as a result of}} parallelization.It states that potential program speedup is defined by the fraction of code (P) that can be parallelized: 1/(1-P).If the code cannot be broken up to run over multiple processors, P = 0 and the speedup = 1 (no speedup). If it is possible to break up the code to be perfectly parallel then P = 1 and the speedup is infinite, in theory though practical limits occur. Thus, there is an upper bound on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units.Gustafson's law is a law closely related to Amdahl's law but doesn’t make as many assumptions and tries to model these factors in the representation of performance.

The setting of margins is closely related to the volatility of futures price changes. If volatility for the forthcoming week is expected to be high, then margins should be set larger.
