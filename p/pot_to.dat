5|$|In June 2013, Murray {{teamed up}} with former British number 1 Tim Henman for a charity doubles match against Murray's coach and eight-time grand slam {{champion}} Ivan Lendl, and world No. 6 Tomáš Berdych at the Queen's Club in London. The event named Rally Against Cancer was organised {{to raise money for}} Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the AEGON Championships, on Sunday 16 June. Subsequently, following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

25|$|Haybox cooking became popular. This {{required}} {{food in a}} <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> {{be brought}} up to heat, then the pot {{was placed in the}} centre of a box, packed with hay and left to cook slowly for hours, without using additional fuel.|$|E
25|$|Some banjos have a {{separate}} resonator plate {{on the back of}} the <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in bluegrass music, though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.|$|E
25|$|When {{they first}} {{travelled}} to London (where the regular {{game at the}} time was lowball), Ulliott was forced to change his style of play as he found the players harder to bluff; he credits the experience for improving his game. On one occasion in London, Ulliott lost a £60,000 <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> Donnacha O'Dea when the latter hit a two-outer against him, but made all the money back within 24 hours. On another occasion, Ulliott played in five cities in a day, winning in each to earn £35,000.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a pot with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added to the <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E
25|$|They make blades {{with the}} teeth of piranha, but lately they also use {{metallic}} ones. Until 1990 they practised pottery in small scale, producing a small kind of <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their key camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When {{they do not have}} matches or lighters, they use special wood (Pausandra trianae) to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of Trattinickia glaziovii nor stone axes like they did in past times.|$|E
25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, that the only thing {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was that you had a fishing rod and a <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{eventual}} {{termination of the}} supply of manna, Exodus states that {{a small amount of}} it survived within an omer-sized pot or jar, which was kept facing the Testimony (possibly, adjacent to the Ark of the Covenant); it indicates that God instructed this of Moses, who delegated it to Aaron. The Epistle to the Hebrews states that the pot was stored inside the Ark. Classical rabbinical sources believe the pot was made of gold; some say it was only there for the generation following Moses, and others that it survived at least until the time of Jeremiah. However, the First Book of Kings states that it was absent earlier than Jeremiah, during Solomon's reign in the tenth century B.C. Form critics attribute the mention of the <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> the Priestly tradition, concluding that the pot existed in the early sixth century B.C.|$|E
25|$|Soil volume: Giving a bonsai a {{relatively}} large soil volume encourages the growth of roots, then corresponding growth {{of the rest of}} the tree. With a large amount of soil, the tree trunk extends in length and increases in diameter, existing branches increase in size and new branches appear, and the foliage expands in volume. The grower can move an outdoor bonsai from a <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> a training box or to open ground to stimulate this sort of growth. Replacing the tree in a bonsai pot will slow or halt the tree's growth, and may lead to die-back if the volume of foliage is too great for the limited root system to support. Managing the tree's available soil volume allows the grower to manage the overall size of the bonsai, and to increase vigor and growth when new branches are required for a planned styling.|$|E

500|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of military clashes, between 9 January and 20 February 1978, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien made several trips to Beijing to hold discussions {{with representatives of the}} Kampuchean Government, which ultimately proved to be fruitless. On 18 January 1978, China attempted to mediate further negotiations between Kampuchea and Vietnam when Vice Premier Deng Yingchao travelled to Phnom Penh, where she was met with strong resistance by Kampuchean leaders. Meanwhile, Vietnamese government officials began conducting secret meetings with So Phim, the Khmer Rouge leader in Kampuchea's Eastern Military Zone, to plan a military uprising backed by Vietnam. During that same period, military setbacks experienced by the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in the Eastern Military Zone prompted Pol <b>Pot</b> <b>to</b> label the region as a [...] "nest of traitors".|$|E
500|$|Goshin {{first took}} shape as a forest {{planting}} around 1964. [...] Inspired by {{a forest of}} Cryptomeria japonica near a shrine in Japan, Naka first combined the four trees he had already developed into a single, [...] composition. [...] He soon added three more, to create a seven-tree forest bonsai. [...] Naka also had to modify the <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> ensure adequate drainage—the lack of which caused one of the trees, and its repeated replacements, to die. [...] At the time, Naka had seven grandchildren, each of which was represented by a tree. [...] At the urging of fellow bonsai artists, he named his composition; he called the bonsai [...] "Goshin", meaning [...] "protector of the spirit", {{in reference to the}} forest shrine that inspired it. [...] By 1973, Naka had eleven grandchildren, and he augmented Goshin concordantly.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title is}} {{intended}} to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt {{that they needed to}} establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were [...] "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience." [...] Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single [...] "Box Full of Letters", as well as [...] "Too Far Apart" [...] allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in [...] that [...] "Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's little sense of drama, and virtually no hint of risk. Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped smoking <b>pot,</b> <b>to</b> which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a <b>pot</b> <b>to</b> piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
