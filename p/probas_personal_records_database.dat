3000|$|In {{line with}} many other European countries, the Netherlands has a {{relatively}} short history of immigration. Large-scale immigration occurred in earlier centuries, but very little between 1850 and 1950. From 1950 s onwards, high demand triggered a wave of labour immigration. The perception was basically that the immigrants, called guest laborers, would return to their country of origin. Most immigrants came from southern Europe, mainly Spain and Turkey, together with immigrants from Morocco. After this influx of immigrants, many (Dutch) people from Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles came, followed by the refugees from Eastern European countries (e.g. Bosnia), Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan. More recently, immigrants from EU-countries Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and from Syria entered the Netherlands. Immigrants who stay longer than 4 months are required to register in the municipality they moved to. From 1950 onwards, the yearly registered immigrant numbers in the Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database</b> (BRP) have almost tripled: from 71 thousand in 1950 to 205 thousand in 2015. These include also Dutch citizens who returned to the Netherlands after a stay abroad. Note that in the 1950 – 2015 time span, the total population almost doubled to 17.0 million, including 3.8 million immigrants (first and second generation). Most originate from Turkey, Morocco, Indonesia, Germany and Surinam (350 to 400 thousand per country of origin). Also a substantial number (over 100 thousand) originate from Aruba and the former Netherlands Antilleans, Poland, and Belgium. Detailed information as to age/gender, regional distribution, urbanity, residence duration are available, all based on register information (see: www.cbs.nl; various Statline tables). 1 [...]...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the postal}} code {{is needed to}} study hospitalizations of {{individuals}} in the nationwide hospitalization register. Studying hospitalizations longitudinally becomes troublesome if individuals change address. We aimed {{to report on the}} feasibility and validity of a two-step medical record linkage approach to examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations and mortality in a study cohort. First, we linked a study cohort of 1564 survivors of childhood cancer with the Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database</b> (GBA) which has postal code history and mortality data available. Within GBA, we sampled a reference population matched on year of birth, gender and calendar year. Second, we extracted hospitalizations from the Hospital Discharge Register (LMR) with a date of discharge during unique follow-up (based on date of birth, gender and postal code in GBA). We calculated the agreement of death and being hospitalized in survivors according to the registers and to available cohort data. We retrieved 1477 (94 %) survivors from GBA. Median percentages of unique/potential follow-up were 87 % (survivors) and 83 % (reference persons). Characteristics of survivors and reference persons contributing to unique follow-up were comparable. Agreement of hospitalization during unique follow-up was 94 % and agreement of death was 98 %. In absence of unique identifiers in the Dutch hospitalization register, it is feasible and valid to study hospitalizations and mortality of individuals longitudinally using a two-step medical record linkage approach. Cohort studies in the Netherlands have the opportunity to study mortality and hospitalization rates over time. These outcomes provide insight into the burden of clinical events and healthcare use in studies on patients at risk of long-term morbiditie...|$|R

30|$|Drawing {{the sample}} from the Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database</b> (GBA) {{naturally}} meant that migrants {{who were not}} entered in the Database were not reached. It is likely that these would in the main be short-term migrants from Poland and Bulgaria {{who were in the}} Netherlands only temporarily for work (e.g. as seasonal workers). If migrants are in (temporary) paid employment in the Netherlands, they are entered in the employees’ register (and given a tax and social insurance number), but often do not appear in the population register (GBA), in which they are only required to register if they intend spending longer than four months in the Netherlands. The SCIP survey focuses on integration processes, with the expectation that migrants who have themselves entered in the GBA are probably intending to stay longer in the Netherlands. Migrants who do not register immediately after their arrival in the Netherlands but who do so later are recorded as new migrants at that time. It therefore regularly occurred in interviews that the migration date stated by the migrant was earlier than the formal registration date held by CBS. This applied to a lesser extent for Bulgarians than for Poles. This was a major reason for controlling for the length of time that migrants had spent in the Netherlands in our study. There is of course a selection effect here, as Poles and Bulgarians who had removed their names from the register (or who had never registered) and had remigrated might have been less successful on the Dutch labour market. If failing to get a job is a reason for removing oneself from the GBA register, a logical consequence is that length of stay has a strong effect on having a job for Poles and Bulgarians.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tumours of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) {{represent}} a relatively rare but serious health burden. This study provides insight into the incidence and survival patterns of gliomas in the Netherlands diagnosed in adult patients during the time period 1989 - 2010, with a focus on glioblastoma and low-grade gliomas. METHODS: Data on 21, 085 gliomas (excluding grade I tumours) were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, including tumours of the CNS without pathological confirmation. We calculated the age-standardised incidence rates and the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) for all glioma subtypes. Crude and relative survival rates were estimated using information on the vital status obtained from the Dutch Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database.</b> RESULTS: Incidence of gliomas in adults increased over time, from 4. 9 per 100, 000 in 1989 to 5. 9 in 2010 (EAPC 0. 7 %, p< 0. 001). Two thirds were astrocytoma, 10 % oligodendroglioma/oligoastrocytoma, 3 % ependymoma and 21 % were unspecified. Within the group of astrocytic tumours, the proportion of glioblastoma rose, while the proportion of anaplastic and unspecified astrocytoma decreased. Unspecified neoplasms also decreased, but this was significant only after 2005. Over the course of the study period, glioblastoma patients more often received multimodality treatment with chemotherapy concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy. The crude two-year survival rate of glioblastoma patients improved significantly, from 5 % in the time period 1989 - 1994 to 15 % in 2006 - 2010, with median survival increasing from 5. 5 to 9 months. The incidence of low-grade gliomas did not change over time. Survival rates for low-grade oligodendroglial and mixed tumours show a modest improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate for the total group of gliomas slightly increased, with a decrease of anaplastic and unspecified tumours and an increase of glioblastoma. Following the introduction of combined chemoradiation, two-year survival rates for glioblastoma significantly improved. Survival improved for low-grade gliomas except for low-grade astrocytic tumours. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as part of the}} “Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis” (MARS) project, a prospective observational study in the mixed ICUs of two tertiary teaching hospitals (Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and University Medical Center Utrecht) in the Netherlands [9 – 11]. Trained physicians prospectively collected the following data: demographics, comorbidities, chronic medication use, ICU admission characteristics, daily physiological measurements, severity scores, antibiotic use, and culture results. The plausibility of infection was post hoc scored based on all available evidence and classified on a 4 -point scale (none, possible, probable or definite) according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention [15] and International Sepsis Forum consensus definitions [16], as described in detail previously [9]. For the current analysis, we selected all patients included in the MARS-study between January 2011 and July 2013 with sepsis, diagnosed within 24  h after admission, defined by the presence of a definite or probable infection [9] combined with at least one of general, inflammatory, hemodynamic, organ dysfunction or tissue perfusion parameters derived from the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference [17]. Readmissions and patients transferred from another ICU were excluded, except for patients referred to one of the study centers on the day of admission. Organ failure was defined as a score of 3 or greater on the SOFA score, except for cardiovascular failure for which a score of 1 or more was used [12]. Shock was defined as use of vasopressors (noradrenaline) for hypotension in a dose of 0.1  mcg/kg/min during at least 50 % of the ICU day. Patients were assessed daily for the presence of acute kidney injury and acute lung injury using strict preset criteria [13, 14]. Left-over plasma (obtained from blood drawn for patient care) was obtained within 24  h of admission to the ICU and stored within 4  h at −  80  °C. The Medical Ethical Committees of both study centers gave approval for an opt-out consent method (IRB no. 10 - 056 C) [9, 10]. The Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database</b> was queried to determine survival up to 1  year after ICU admission.|$|R

The maximal dissimilarity protects privacy by destroying any similarity patterns among the returned candidates. Experimental results on iris biometrics demonstrate the validity of our framework and illustrate a practical implementation of an anonymous biometric system. </p...|$|R
40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do women {{treated with}} ovarian {{stimulation}} for IVF {{have an increased}} risk of melanoma? SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovarian stimulation for IVF does not increase risk of melanoma, even after a prolonged follow-up. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although exposure to ultraviolet radiation is the major risk factor for melanoma, associations between female sex steroids and melanoma risk have also been suggested. The results of available studies on fertility drugs and melanoma risk are inconclusive since most studies had several methodological limitations such as short follow-up, a small number of cases and no subfertile comparison group. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In 1996, a nationwide historic cohort study (the OMEGA-cohort) was established to examine the risk of cancer after ovarian stimulation for IVF. After a median follow-up of 17 years, cancer incidence was ascertained through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Melanoma risk in the cohort was compared with that in the general population and between the IVF group and non-IVF group using multivariable Cox regression analyses. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The cohort comprises 19 158 women who received IVF between 1983 and 1995 and a comparison group of 5950 women who underwent subfertility treatments other than IVF. Detailed IVF-treatment data were obtained from the medical records and complete information on parity and age at first birth was obtained through linkage with the Dutch Municipal <b>Personal</b> <b>Records</b> <b>Database.</b> MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 93 melanoma cases were observed. The risk of melanoma was not elevated among IVF-treated women, neither when compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio = 0. 89; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 69 - 1. 12), nor when compared with the non-IVF group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 27; 95 % CI: 0. 75 - 2. 15). A higher number of IVF cycles was associated with apparent but statistically non-significant risk increases (5 - 6 cycles HR = 1. 92; >/= 7 cycles HR = 1. 79). However, no significant trend emerged. In women with more follicle stimulating hormone/human menopausal gonadotrophin ampoules comparable non-significant risk increases were found. A longer follow-up did not increase melanoma risk. Nulliparous women did not have a significantly higher melanoma risk than parous women (HR = 1. 22; 95 % CI: 0. 81 - 1. 84). However, women who were 30 years of age or older at first birth had a significantly higher melanoma risk than women who were younger than 30 years at first birth (age: 30 - 34 years HR = 4. 57; 95 % CI: 2. 07 - 10. 08, > 34 years HR = 2. 98; 95 % CI: 1. 23 - 7. 21). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite our large cohort, the number of melanoma cases was rather small, especially in our comparison group, which hampered subgroup analyses. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results are reassuring for women who underwent IVF or are contemplating to start IVF. Since our cohort study {{is one of the largest}} published so far, with long-term follow-up, a subfertile comparison group, and detailed IVF-treatment data, our results add important information to the available evidence.

We sought to design, implement and evaluate a patient-accessible medical record specifically for patients undergoing a course of assisted reproduction (IVF or ICSI). METHODS: The <b>personal</b> med-ical <b>record</b> (PMR) <b>database</b> was developed using three formative evaluation steps, and its user-experience was evalu-ated through a cross-sectional study. Fifty-four patient-couples receiving an IVF or ICSI treatment in our hospital were granted access to the PMR. Main outcomes concern the usage of the PMR, the perceived usefulness of its func-tions and user attitudes towards privacy and financial issues. RESULTS: The PMR consists of 15 major functions that can be classified into personal information, general information and communication functions. Fifty-three patient-couples accessed the website and 51 couples filled out the evaluation questionnaire. They rated most functions as useful and preferred personalized to general functions. The results also show that some functions require further development. Patients using the PMR have little concerns regarding privacy, and 76 % {{are willing to pay}} for such a ser-vice in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in this study frequently and intensively used the Internet-accessible PMR. This suggests that the PMR offers very useful functions from an IVF/ICSI patient’s perspective.
