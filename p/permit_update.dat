40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{enabling}} technologies for a web-based urban street construction permit system. The web-based application system can automatically verify the various constraints, issue the permit if the constraints are met, notify the relevant persons of the issuance of the <b>permit,</b> <b>update</b> the pavement status for the affected street and prepare the billing report for further processing with the existing billing system. The web-based permit system is divided into two sub-systems: External System and Internal System. The external system is used by contractor/utility companies for permit application, and the internal system is used solely by authorized internal users for maintenance of the system or permit application on behalf of contractor/utility companies when there is such a necessity. These two sub-systems share the same underlying database system. In order to develop this web-based permit system, the following J 2 EE technologies have been used: Enterprise JavaBeans, JavaServer Pages, Servlet and JDBC API. Other J 2 EE technologies such as Transaction, JNDI and XML are also discussed where appropriate. The following development environments to support these technologies are also presented in this thesis: Red Hat Linux 7. 0, Java 2 Platform, Tomcat Server 3. 2. 1, Database MySQL 2. 1. 4, and JDBC Driver 2. 0. 4 for MySQL. As an example, Arlington permit system was used to demonstrate the design of an Entity- Relationship model, and an Enterprise JavaBeans application. by Changxin Qi. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The use of component modes and architecture constraints on modes and structure {{is presented as a}} basis for <b>permitting</b> the safe <b>update</b> of systems while deployed. The goal is an adaptable software architecture that can be easily modified while in the operational field without the need to return to a service depot and more challengingly that <b>permits</b> <b>update</b> while the system is deployed on a mission.

40|$|The {{computer}} communications {{world is}} very dynamic, requiring continual software updating for correction, perfection, and increased functionality.

This problem is relevant to network management software which is also dynamic. For example SNMPv 3 is not yet a standard and is not yet widely deployed. Its initial installations will need to be perfected as more experience is acquired. This paper examines a software hot-swapping solution to the problem, whereby management system software modules can be replaced dynamically without disrupting the management process.

Multidatabase transaction management has long been of interest, but general solutions have only recently been forthcoming.

40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is a major}} part of the development cycle. The traditional methodology for rolling out an update to existing programs is to shut down the system, modify the binary, and restart the program. Downtime has significant disadvantages. In response to such concerns, researchers and practitioners have investigated how to perform update on running programs whilst maintaining various desired properties. In a multi-threaded setting this is further complicated by the interleaving of different threads' actions. In this thesis we investigate how to prove that safety and liveness are preserved when updating a program. We present two possible approaches; the main intuition behind each of these is to find quiescent points where updates are safe. The first approach requires global synchronisation, and is more generally applicable, but can delay updates indefinitely. The second restricts the class of programs that can be <b>updated,</b> but <b>permits</b> <b>update</b> without global synchronisation, and guarantees application of update. We provide full proofs of all relevant properties...|$|R
40|$|As we {{approach}} nation-wide integration of computer systems, {{it is clear}} that file replication will play a key role, both to improve data availability in the face of failures, and to improve performance by locating data near where it will be used. We expect that future file systems will have an extensible, modular structure in which features such as replication can be "slipped in" as a transparent layer in a stackable layered architecture. We introduce the Ficus replicated file system for NFS and show how it is layered on top of existing file systems. The Ficus file system differs from previous file replication services in that it <b>permits</b> <b>update</b> during network partition if any copy of a file is accessible. File and directory updates are automatically propagated to accessible replicas. Conflicting updates to directories are detected and automatically repaired; conflicting updates to ordinary files are detected and reported to the owner.

40|$|Adding a {{stage of}} signal {{acquisition}} to the expected utility model shows that Bayesian updating results in a well deÂ¯ned law of demand for financial information when asset return distributions are conjugate priors to signals {{such as in the}} gamma-Poisson case. Signals have a positive marginal utility value that falls in their number if and only if investors are risk averse, asset markets large, and variance-mean ratios of asset returns high in fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium. Expected asset price increases in the number of signals so that expected excess return drops. The diminishing excess return prevents Bayesian investors from unbounded information demand even if signals are costless, unless the riskfree asset is removed. Signals mutually benefit homogeneous investors because revealing asset price <b>permits</b> <b>updating</b> so that a Pareto criterion judges competitive equilibrium as not suÂ±ciently informative. However, asset price responses make incentives for signal acquisition dependent on portfolios so that welfare and distributional consequences become intricately linked when investors are heterogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Two {{concepts}} for {{the support}} of logical data independence {{in the context of the}} structurally object-oriented data model NO 2 (New Object-Oriented data model) are presented: derived types and subschemas. In general, object types can be derived in two ways: derived types can restrict (the value set of) an existing base type, or new atrtibutes can be added to the tuple value set of an existing object type. One major design issue of the concept is to preserve object identity: an instance of a derived type has the same object identity as the corresponding instance of the base type. This enables us to <b>permit</b> <b>updates</b> to derived types even in cases where (say) the relational view mechanism could not permit them. The second concept, subschemas, supports application-specific views of schemas and the straightforward identification of those parts affected by schema modifications. 1 Introduction and Motivation NO 2 is the data model of the structurally object-oriented database system CoOMS (Co [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{statistical}} database (SDB) is {{a database}} {{that is used}} to provide simple. summary statistics about populations stored in the database and that supports statistical data analysis. When SDB users infer protected information in the SDB from responses to queries, we say that the SDB is compromised. The security problem of SDB is to allow simple summary statistics about protected information in the SDB while preventing compromise. In this paper, we consider the SDB security problem {{in the context of the}} Data Abstraction (D-A) model, and investigate the effectiveness of rounding SUM and COUNT query responses for preventing compromise due to structural, dynamic and pre-knowledge inferences in the generalization hierarchy of the D-A model. We first round only SUM query responses, <b>permit</b> <b>updates</b> in a single population, and investigate the effect of users' a priori knowledge of a single protected value. It is shown that compromise is possible, and a necessary and sufficient condition for compromise is given. We then round both SUM and COUNT query responses, and introduce techniques of choosing rounding bases for populations in tree-organized hierarchies that either eliminate or restrict structural and dynamic inferences. Finally, we propose the range response technique which eliminates structural and dynamic inferences in general generalization hierarchies...|$|R

40|$|Overall {{sampling}} of the sediments in the Adriatic Sea {{at the mouth of}} the Isonzo (SoÃ§a) River in Italy has <b>permitted</b> <b>updating</b> of the extension and level of mercury contamination. The Isonzo River transports mercury-bearing residues from the Idrija mine (Slovenia), the area of which was contaminated during the mining of cinnabar (HgS). The mercury mine started operations in the 15 th century and was shut-down finally in the 1980 âs, due to the decreased demand for mercury. An attempt was made to remove mercury from the contaminated sediments by thermal desorption with the aim of ascertaining whether low temperature and short residence time could be suitable parameters for sediment clean-up if future needs should so require. The fact is that to date no studies have been made on the health of the Italian population living in the Gulf of Trieste area. Hence there is no known correlation between the anomalous mercury content of the sediments and symptoms attributable to the ingestion of even small quantities of mercury. Desorption time of about 20 to 30 min at temperatures varying from 325 to 350 Â°C gave a residue with a mercury content below the limit imposed by Italian regulations for contaminated soils and sediments (5 ppm). The air and the mercury vapors driven off during roasting were treated before being released to the atmosphere...|$|R
