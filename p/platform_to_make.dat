25|$|By 1827, {{interest}} had revived and it {{had become}} a widespread belief that earlier material recovered had either been part of a temple to Diana or was from the villa of Julius Caesar cited by Suetonius. Annesio Fusconi built a floating platform from which to raise the wrecks. However, several of his cables broke, so he called a halt until he could find stronger cables. When he returned, he found that the locals had dismantled his <b>platform</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> wine barrels. This led him to abandon the project.|$|E

In 1934, Sukarno was shipped, {{along with his}} family (including Inggit Garnasih), to the remote town of Ende, {{on the island of}} Flores. During his time in Flores, he utilised his limited freedom of movement to establish a children's theatre. Among its members was future politician Frans Seda. Due to an outbreak of malaria in Flores, the Dutch authorities decided to move Sukarno and his family to Bencoolen (now Bengkulu) on western coast of Sumatra, in February 1938.|$|E

Yitzhak Shamir claimed later that Moyne was assassinated because of his support for a Middle Eastern Arab Federation and anti-Semitic lectures in which Arabs were held to be racially superior to Jews. The assassination rocked the British government, and outraged Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister. The two assassins, Eliahu Bet-Zouri and Eliahu Hakim were captured and used their trial as a <b>platform</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> public their political propaganda. They were executed. In 1975 their bodies were returned to Israel and given a state funeral.
