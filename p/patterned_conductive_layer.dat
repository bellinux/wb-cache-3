40|$|To {{accomplish}} an electrode patterning {{in large}} area, {{we present a}} high speed stitching technique used in an ultraviolet laser processing system and investigate the interaction between laser beams and indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films deposited on glass substrates. After optimizing the process parameters of the laser direct imaging (LDI) for the large-area electrode patterning, the ablated lines looked like regularly fish-scale marks of about a 40 m diameter and a 120 nm depth around the processing path. The parameters includes the laser power of 1 W, the scanning speed of galvanometers of 800 mm/s, and the laser pulse repetition frequency of 50 kHz. Moreover, the resistance value of the ablated ITO thin film is larger than 200 M that is electrically insulated from the other regions of electrode structure.

40|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{of flexible}} organic electronics and especially organic photovoltaics is {{highly dependent on}} cost-efficient production technologies. Roll- 2 -Roll processes show potential for a promising solution in terms of high throughput and low-cost production of thin film organic components. Solution based material deposition and integrated laser patterning processes offer new possibilities for versatile production lines. The use of flexible polymeric infstrates brings along challenges in laser patterning which have to be overcome. One main challenge when <b>patterning</b> transparent <b>conductive</b> <b>layers</b> on polymeric infstrates are material bulges {{at the edges of}} the ablated area. Bulges can lead to short circuits in the layer system leading to device failure. Therefore following layers have to have a sufficient thickness to cover and smooth the ridge. In order to minimize the bulging height, a study has been carried out on transparent <b>conductive</b> ITO <b>layers</b> on flexible PET in fstrates. Ablation results using different beam shapes, such as Gaussian beam, Top-Hat beam and Donut-shaped beam, as well as multi-pass scribing and double-pulsed ablation are compared. Furthermore, lab scale methods for cleaning the patterned layer and eliminating bulges are contrasted to the use of additional water based sacrificial layers in order to obtain an alternative procedure suitable for large scale Roll- 2 -Roll manufacturing. Besides progress in research, ongoing transfer of laser processes into a Roll- 2 -Roll demonstrator is illustrated. By using fixed optical elements in combination with a galvanometric scanner, scribing, variable patterning and edge deletion can be performed individually...|$|R
