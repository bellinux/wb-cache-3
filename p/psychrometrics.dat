Sixty-five percent of the participants reported they had problems with mildew.

The high incidence of mildew problems in this poprlation indicates a potential gap between the dehumidification needs people have in their homes and the amount of dehumidification they are getting with their air conditioning. Recognizing the contribution of misture from outside the home led to the incorporation of <b>psychrometrics</b> and weather data into tables and graphs to assess the latent heat removal necessary to produce an interior environment that {{would be less likely to}} support mildew growth.

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} {{how to use}} a simplified psychrometric chart to better understand the relationships between air temperature and relative humidity. Air is a vital component of our everyday lives. Air properties are important whether we are ventilating a livestock housing unit, drying grain, or determining relative humidity in the home. In a livestock building, temperature, moisture, odors, and toxic or noxious gases must be controlled. Since the moisture holding capacity of air increases with increasing temperature, heat may be added in grain drying to aid in removing moisture from the grain kernel. In the home, moisture can either be added to or removed from the air to change the relative humidity. In each case, air provides the link between the controls and the mechanical equipment, and air properties influence the results of the processes. <b>Psychrometrics</b> refers to the properties of moist air. A psychrometric chart graphically illustrates the relationships between air temperature and relative humidity as well as other properties. A better understanding of air properties and the psychrometric chart can aid in the selection and management of a livestock building ventilation system, a grain drying system, or a home humidifier...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} grain drying depends on an {{adequate}} control of drying parameters. The flow rate, temperature and relative humidity of drying air play major roles in grains drying. Drying simulation {{is based on}} plenty of parameters with sequent time series. It needs a powerful algorithmic tool to process such masses of mathmatic data. A software-based simulation was {{proved to be more}} efficient and economic for predicting the drying results. Based on previous surveys, lots of equations concerning air psychromatrics, thin layer drying, air flow resistance, equilibrium moisture content, deep bed drying are combined to develope a software for drying simulation. This study develops a MATLAB-based software SAPGD- 2004 to predict the air properties, <b>psychrometrics</b> data, air flow resistance, equilibrium moisture contents, the results of thin layer drying and deep-bed drying.

40|$|Introduction: Numerous {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} based on satellite imagery in order to estimate soil moisture using vegetation indices such as NDVI. Previous studies suffer from a restriction; these indices {{are not able to}} estimate where the vegetative coverage is low or where no vegetation exists. Hence, it is essential to develop a model which can overcome this restriction. Focus of this research is on estimation of soil moisture for low or scattered vegetative land covers. Trapezoidal temperature-vegetation (Ts VI) model is able to consider the status of soil moisture and vegetation condition. It can estimate plant water deficit for weak or no vegetation land cover. Materials and Methods: Moran proposed Water Deficit Index (WDI) for evaluating field evapotranspiration rates and relative field water deficit for both full-cover and partially vegetated sites. The theoretical basis of this method is based on the energy balance equation. Penman-Monteith equation of energy balance was used to calculate the coordinates of the four vertices of the temperature-vegetation trapezoid also for four different extreme combinations of temperature and vegetation. For the (Ts−Ta) Vc trapezoid, four vertices correspond to 1) well-watered full-cover vegetation, 2) water-stressed full-cover vegetation, 3) saturated bare soil, and 4) dry bare soil. WDI is equal to 0 for well-watered conditions and equals to 1 for maximum stress conditions. As suggested by Moran et al. to draw a trapezoidal shape, some field measurements are required such as wind speed at the height of 2 meters, air pressure, mean daily temperature, vapor pressure-temperature curve slope, <b>Psychrometrics</b> constant, vapor pressure at mean temperature, vapor pressure deficit, external radiation, solar radiation of short wavelength, longwave radiation, net radiation, soil heat flux and air aerodynamic resistance is included. Crop vegetation and canopy resistance should be measured or estimated. The study area is selected in the Mashhad plain in Khorasan Razavi province of I. R. Iran. Study area is about 1, 200 square kilometers and is located around the Golmakan center of agricultural research. In this study, water deficit index (WDI) was zoning by MODIS images in subset of Mashhad plain during water year of 2011 - 2012. Then, based on the close relationship between WDI and soil moisture parameter, a linear relationship between these two parameters were fitted. Soil moisture is measured by the TDR and every 7 days at 5 depths of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 cm from the surface. Remote Sensing (RS) technology used as a tool for providing some of the data that is required. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument is popular for monitoring soil moisture because of its high spectral (36 bands) resolution, moderate spatial (250 – 1000 m) resolution and various products for land surface properties. MODIS products {{used in the present study}} include: MOD 09 A 1 land surface albedo data, MOD 11 A 1 land surface temperature data, and MOD 13 A 1 vegetation data. Using ArcMap 9. 2 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2010 softwares, WDI was calculated pixel by pixel for 18 days (non-cloudy days and simultaneous with measurement of soil moisture at the station). Results and Discussion: The results showed that the northeastern region is predominantly rainfed and irrigated farmlands are under water stress. Conversely, the southwestern part of the area is mountainous with less water stress. Based on NDVI, there is also less crop cover in the southwestern part of the region during the year. The results showed that about 44...|$|E
