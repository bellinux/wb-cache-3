40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} large part of my research since the end of my PhD. Most of mywork is related to numerical (also referred to as continuous) optimization, at the exception of onecontribution done during my postdoc in Zurich introducing a new stochastic algorithm to simulatechemical or biochemical systems [23]. The optimization algorithms at the core of my work are adaptive derivative-free stochastic (orrandomized) optimization methods. The algorithms are tailored to tackle dificult numerical optimizationproblems in a so-called black-box context where the objective function to be optimized isseen as a black-box. For a given input solution, the black-box returns solely the objective functionvalue but no gradient or higher order derivatives are assumed. The optimization algorithm canuse the information returned by the black-box, i. e. the history of function values associated tothe queried search points, but no other knowledge that could be within the black-box (parametersdescribing the class of functions the function belongs to, [...] .). This black-box context is verynatural in industrial settings where the function to be optimized can be given by an executablefile for which the source code is not provided. It is also natural in situations where the functionis given by a large simulation code from which it is hard to extract any useful information for theoptimization. This context is also called derivative-free optimization (DFO) in the mathematical optimizationcommunity. Well-known DFO methods are the Nelder-Mead algorithm [79, 77], pattern searchmethods [54, 90, 6] or more recently the NEW Unconstraint Optimization Algorithm (NEWUOA) developed by Powell [82, 81]. In this context, I have been focusing on DFO methods in the literal sense. However the methodsmy research is centered on have a large stochastic component and originate from the community ofbio-inspired algorithms mainly composed of computer scientists and engineers. The methods wereintroduced {{at the end of the}} 70 's. A parallel with Darwin's theory of the evolution of species basedon blind variation and natural selection was recognized and served as source of inspiration for thosemethods. Nowadays this field of bio-inspired methods is referred to as evolutionary computation(EC) and a generic term for the methods is evolutionary algorithms. The probably most famousexamples of bio-inspired methods are genetic algorithms (GAs). However today GAs are known tobe not competitive for numerical optimization. Evolution Strategies (ES) introduced in the endof the 70 's [83] have emerged as the main sub-branch of EC devoted to continuous optimization. One important feature of ES is that they are comparison-based algorithms. The present mostadvanced ES algorithm, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) [50]is a variable metric method recognized as the state-of-the-art method for stochastic numericaloptimization. It is used in many applications in industry and academy. Because of historical reasons, the developments and work on Evolution Strategies are mainlycarried out in the EC field where practice and effectiveness is definitely as (or more) importantas having a theorem proven about an algorithm. However ES algorithms are simply adaptivestochastic iterative methods and they need to be studied from a mathematical perspective aswell as any other iterative method in optimization or other domain in order to understand themethods better and convince a broader class of people about their soundness. Questions like theirconvergence and speed of convergence central in optimization need to be addressed. My research is encompassed within this general context: I am particularly interested by themathematical aspects of adaptive stochastic methods like ES (and of course CMA-ES) or moregenerally adaptive stochastic optimization algorithms. Evolution strategies have this attractivefacet that while introduced in the bio-inspired and engineering context, they turn out to bemethods with deep theoretical foundations related to invariance, information geometry, stochasticapproximation and strongly connected to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Thosefoundations and connections are relatively new and to a small (for some topics) or large (forothers) extent partly related to some of my contributions. They will be explained within themanuscript. I particularly care that the theory I am working on relates to practical algorithms orhas an impact on (new) algorithm designs. I attempt to illustrate this within the manuscript. While optimization is the central theme of my research, I have been tackling various aspect ofoptimization. Although most of my work is devoted to single-objective optimization, I have alsobeen working on multi-objective optimization where the goal is to optimize simultaneously severalconflicting objectives and where instead of a single solution, a set of solutions, the so-called Paretoset composed of the best compromises is searched. In the field of single-objective optimization, I have been tackling diverse contexts like noisyoptimization where for a given point in a search space we do not observe one deterministic valuebut a distribution of possible function values, large-scale optimization where one is interested intackling problems of the order of 104 (medium large-scale) to 106 variables (large-scale) and to asmaller extent constrained optimization. In addition to investigating theoretical questions, I have been also working on designing newalgorithms that calls for theory complemented with numerical simulations. Last I have tackledsome applications mainly in the context of the PhD of Mohamed Jebalia with an application inchromatography and of the PhD of Zyed Bouzarkouna (PhD financed by the French Institute forpetrol) on the placement of oil wells. Furthermore, a non neglect-able part of my research those past years has been devoted tobenchmarking of algorithms. Benchmarking complements theory as it is difficult to assess theoreticallythe performance of algorithms on all typical functions one is interested. The mainmotivation has then been to improve the standards on how benchmarking is done. Those contributionswere done along with the development of the Comparing COntinuous Optimizers platform(COCO). My work is articulated around three main complementary axis, namely theory / algorithmdesign and applications. An overview of the contributions presented within this habilitationorganized along those axes is given in Figure 3. 1. Ce mémoire décrit l'essentiel de mon travail scientifique depuis la fin de ma thèse. Mes travauxsont centrés sur l'optimisation numérique dite "boîte-noire" à l'exception d'un article effectuédurant mon séjour post-doctoral à l'ETH Zurich qui introduit un nouvel algorithme d'optimisationstochastique pour simuler des systèmes en chimie ou bio-chimie [23]. Les algorithmes d'optimisation au coeur de mon travail sont des algorithmes adaptatifs sansdérivées et stochastiques. Ils sont particulièrement adaptés à l'optimisation de problèmes difficiles dans des contextes oèu la fonction n'est accessible qu'à travers une -noire" retournantl'information d'ordre zero, c'est-à-dire que la seule information disponible et utilisable parl'algorithme sont les couples (points de l'espace de recherche, valeur de fonction objectif associée). Ce contexte est très courant dans l'industrie oèu les problèmes d'optimisation rencontrés font appelà des codes de simulations numériques pour lesquels, souvent, simplement un executable du codeest disponible. L'aspect "sans-dérivées" est aussi très commun car le calcul d'un gradient (quiprésuppose la fonction sous-jacente dérivable) sur des codes de simulations numériques, par exempleen utilisant une méthode d'adjoint ou de differentiation automatique peut ^etre couteux entemps de développement. Il est par ailleurs usuel que la formulation d'un problème d'optimisationchange au fur et à mesure de sa résolution, adapter le code de calcul de gradient peut alors s'avérertrès lourd et peut motiver l'utilisation d'une méthode d'optimisation boîte-noire. Ce contexte d'optimisation boîte-noire s'appelle également optimisation sans dérivées dans lacommunauté programming" et l'acronyme anglais associé est DFO pour optimization". Les méthodes qualifiées de DFO sont généralement deterministes. Lesméthodes DFO les plus connues à l'heure actuelle sont l'algorithme du simplexe ou de Nelder-Mead [79, 77], les algorithmes de "pattern search" [54, 90, 6] et l'algorithme NEWUOA (NEWUnconstraint Optimization Algorithm) développé par Powell [82, 81]. Ce dernier algorithme est àl'heure actuelle considéré comme l'algorithme DFO déterministe état de l'art. Mon travail porte ainsi sur des méthodes DFO au sens littéral du terme. En revanche, lesméthodes auxquelles je me suis intéressées ont une large composante stochastique et ont étédéveloppées dans la communauté des algorithmes bio-inspirés qui se compose essentiellementd'ingénieurs et d'informaticiens. Les premiers algorithmes ont été introduits dans les années 70. Un parallèle entre la théorie de Darwin de l'évolution des espèces et l'optimisation a servià l'origine de source d'inspiration pour leur développement. A l'heure actuelle, ce domaine desméthodes bio-inspirées est également appelé Computation". Un terme génériquepour les algorithmes est algorithme évolutionnaire (EA). Pour beaucoup de chercheurs (dont je faispartie) dans ce domaine, l'aspect bio-inspiré n'est plus présent et le développement des algorithmesest seulement motivé par des considérations mathématiques et numériques. Parmi les algorithmes évolutionnaires, les algorithmes génétiques (GA) sont probablementencore les plus célèbres en dehors de la communauté EC. En revanche, les GAs ne sont <b>pasdes</b> algorithmes compétitifs pour l'optimisation numériquece fait est reconnu depuis plus d'unedizaine d'années.

50|$|In 2007, the Socialist Group was {{the second}} largest group in Parliament, with MEPs from all but two member states, Latvia and Cyprus. However, the 2009 European {{election}} saw {{a reduction in the}} number of PES MEPs returned from 2004. The group sought additional members in the Democratic Party of Italy, which was not affiliated to the PES in 2009. By the conclusion of the 2004-2009 parliamentary term, the Democratic Party had 8 MEPs in the Socialist Group (coming from Democrats of the Left), but also had 8 MEPs in ALDE Group (coming from The Daisy). The Democratic Party is a big tent centre-left party, strongly influenced by social democracy and the Christian left, and had MEPs who were former Christian Democrats or had other political views. So a new and more inclusive group name had to be found. The group was going to be named Alliance of Socialists and Democrats for Europe (ASDE) but this was seemed too similar to Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). The name Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats was suggested on 18 June by group president Martin Schulz and it was renamed on 23 June 2009. The English abbreviation was initially unclear, being variously reported as PASD or S&D Group or <b>PASDE.</b> Dissatisfaction by Socialist MEPs towards the new name led Martin Schulz to admit that the name was still under consideration and that the group was to be referred to as the 'Socialists and Democrats' until a final title was chosen. On 14 July 2009, the first day of the constitutive session of the 2009-2014 term, the full formal group name was Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the abbreviation was S&D.|$|E
