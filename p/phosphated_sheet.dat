5000|$|Uranyl {{minerals}} {{in general}} are very complicated, with two-thirds of the 173 species’ structures unknown. Bergenite, like other phosphuranylite minerals, consists of uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets.</b> Bergenite’s uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheet</b> is a new geometrical isomer of the group which differs in {{the orientation of the}} phosphate tetrahedra, and contains H2O along with calcium and barium cations in the interlayer. The structure was determined by direct methods. As proposed by Frost et al., Uranyl pentagonal dipyramids share edges with each other, and are then connected to uranyl hexagonal dipyramids on both sides. The hexagonal dipyramids then link with phosphate tetrahedra to form sheets that connect to adjacent pentagonal chains. The phosphate tetrahedra holding the uranyl chains together display an up-up-down-up-up-down, same-same-opposite orientation (uuduudSSO).|$|R

Its {{crystal structure}} is isotypic with the iron and cobalt analogues [Huang et al. (2012 ▶). Inorg. Chem. 51, 3316 – 3323]. In the crystal structure, the framework is built from undulating manganese <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets</b> parallel to (010) inter­connected by GeO 6 octa­hedra (at the inversion center), {{resulting in a}} three-dimensional network with eight-membered ring channels into which all the protons point. The undulating manganese <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheet</b> consists of zigzag manganese octa­hedral chains along [10 - 1], built from MnO 4 (OH) (OH 2) octa­hedra and MnO 5 (OH 2) octa­hedra by sharing their trans or skew edges, which are inter­connected by PO 3 (OH) and PO 4 tetra­hedra via corner-sharing. The crystal structure features extensive O—H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter­actions...|$|R

Compared with other few existing exfoliation methodologies, our approach provides a new route for fabricating single-layered <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets</b> in non-aqueous solutions with convenience and high efficiency. Future investigations will {{be focused on the}} use of such exfoliated ZrP nanoplatelets in composites, lubricants, and energy materials.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{selected}} autunites with phosphate as the anion {{have been studied}} using infrared spectroscopy. Each autunite mineral has its own characteristic spectrum. The spectra for different autunites with the same composition are different. It is proposed that this difference {{is due to the}} structure of water and hydrated cations in the interlayer region between the uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets.</b> This structure is different for different autunites. The position of the water hydroxyl stretching bands is related to the strength of the hydrogen bonds as determined by hydrogen bond distance. The highly ordered structure of water is also observed in the water HOH bending modes where a high wavenumber bands are observed. The phosphate and uranyl stretching vibrations overlap and are obtained by curve resolution...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of bergenite, ideally Ca 2 Ba 4 [(UO 2) 3 O 2 (PO 4) 2] 3 (H 2 O) 16, monoclinic, space group P 21 /c, a 10. 092 (1), b 17. 245 (2), c 17. 355 (2) Å, 113. 678 (2) °, V 2766. 2 (3) Å 3, Z = 2, Dcalc 4. 82 g/cm 3, was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques {{on the basis}} of F 2 to agreement indices R 1 of 5. 0 % calculated for 4118 unique observed reflections (|Fo | ≥ 4 F), and wR 2 of 11. 9 % for all data. Intensity data were collected at room temperature using MoK radiation and a CCD-based area detector. The structure of bergenite contains five symmetrically independent uranium atoms, each of which is part of a (UO 2) 2 + uranyl ion. The uranyl ions of U(1), U(2) and U(3) are coordinated by five additional ligands giving pentagonal bipyramids, and the uranyl ions of U(4) and U(5) are coordinated by six additional ligands yielding hexagonal bipyramids. The uranyl pentagonal bipyramids share edges, forming dimers, which are linked to uranyl hexagonal bipyramids on either side, resulting in chains of bipyramids. Each uranyl hexagonal bipyramid shares two equatorial edges with phosphate tetrahedra, and the resulting uranyl phosphate chains are linked into sheets by the sharing of vertices of phosphate tetrahedra with uranyl pentagonal bipyramids of adjacent chains. The uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheet</b> in bergenite is a new geometrical isomer of the phosphuranylite group; the phosphate tetrahedra between the uranyl chains vary orientations in an up-up-down up-up-down (uuduud) pattern, and the pairs of tetrahedra attached to uranyl hexagonal bipyramids change orientations in a complementary same-same-opposite (SSO) manner (symbol uuduudSSO). In bergenite, the uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets</b> are oriented parallel to (¯ 102) ...|$|R

Crystal nonlinear coefficients are : d 15 ≅ 7. 2 pm/V and d 24 ≅ 1. 3 pm/V.

40|$|Exfoliated {{monolayer}} zirconium <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheets</b> (1 μm diameter x 2. 78 nm thick) {{in water}} form colloidal suspensions exhibiting liquid crystal (LC) ordering above a critical concentration. Studies of the phase behavior and phenomenology of such suspensions {{show that the}} LC is nematic, in agreement with theory, but that the predicted lamellar smectic phase does not appear. At high concentration lamellar correlations grow in the nematic but are limited in range, either by the finite size of the sheets or by defects in the sheets. Coexistence of the nematic with an isotropic phase is observed at all concentrations, indicating a long range attraction between the sheets. At high concentration the coexisting LC forms lens-shaped nematic tactoids, analysis of which enables estimates of the nematic elasticity and surface tension. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the bispherical internal structure of the nematic director field in the tactoids. Nematic cells with initial homeotropic orientation exhibit a periodic instability in the director field, which is unstable against {{the formation of a}} bend undulation of the sheets. This phenomenon, which is also observed in lyotropic colloidal suspensions of graphene oxide sheets, may be attributed to flexopolydispersity, the slow internal rearrangement of sheets of different size to optimize their spacing and thereby maximize entropy. Azobenzene-based molecules which form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) tethered to a glass surface are highly photo-sensitive and dynamically orient liquid crystals in contact with them when illuminated with polarized actinic light. We probe the coupling of such monolayers to the nematic liquid crystal in a hybrid cell by studying the dynamics of liquid crystal reorientation in response to local orientational changes of the monolayer by a focused actinic laser with a rotating polarization. This locally reorients the nematic, winding up a set of nested rings of splay-bend nematic director reorientation until the required torque exceeds that of the surface coupling, after which the nematic director starts to slip. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics enables measurement of the coupling between the azo-SAM and the nematic liquid crystal...|$|R
40|$|Two homeotypic {{hydrated}} uranyl arsenates, (UO 2) [(UO 2) (AsO 4) ] 2 (H 2 O) 4, UAs 4; and (UO 2) [(UO 2) (AsO 4) ] 2 (H 2 O) 5, UAs 5 were synthesized by hydrothermal methods. Intensity {{data were}} collected at room temperature using MoKa X-radiation and a CCD-based area detector. Their crystal structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques {{on the basis of}} F 2 to agreement indices (UAs 4; UAs 5) wR 2 0 : 116; 0. 060, for all data, and R 1 0 : 046; 0. 033, calculated for 3176, 5306 unique observed reflections (jFoj 44 sF) respectively. UAs 4 is monoclinic, space group P 21 =c; Z 4; a 11 : 238 ð 1 Þ; b 7 : 152 ð 1 Þ; c 21 : 941 ð 2 Þ Å, b 104 : 576 (2), V 1706 : 8 ð 1 Þ Å 3, Dcalc 4 : 51 g/cm 3. UAs 5 is orthorhombic, space group Pca 21; Z 4; a 20 : 133 ð 2 Þ; b 11 : 695 ð 1 Þ; c 7 : 154 ð 1 Þ Å, V 1684 : 4 ð 1 Þ Å 3, Dcalc 4 : 65 g/cm 3. Both structures contain sheets of arsenate tetrahedra and uranyl pentagonal bipyramids, with composition [(UO 2) (AsO 4) ] 1 and the uranophane sheet anion-topology. The sheets are connected by a uranyl pentagonal bipyramid in the interlayer that shares corners with an arsenate tetrahedron on each of two adjacent sheets, resulting in open-frameworks with isolated H 2 O groups in the larger cavities of the structures. The uranyl arsenate sheet in UAs 4 is relatively planar, and is topologically identical with the uranyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>sheet</b> in (UO 2) [(UO 2) (PO 4) ] 2 (H 2 O) 4. The uranyl arsenate sheet in UAs 5 is the same geometrical isomer as in UAs 4; but is highly corrugated, exhibiting approximately right angle bends of the sheet after every second uranyl arsenate chain repeat...|$|R
40|$|Crystalline {{inorganic}} oxides {{are an important}} class of materials with many technological uses. Chapter 1 gives {{a brief history of}} this area with special focus on the formation of microporous metal oxides such as the zeolites and related AlPO family of aluminophosphates, as well as the fundamental parameters of hydrothermal synthesis used and the key methods used for characterization of these types of solid. In this work we have sought to extend the range and composition of such open framework materials, which have commercial importance in catalysis and separation technologies, to include examination of indium phosphates, mixed-metal phosphates, zirconium phosphates, vanadophosphates, vanadomolybdates, and vanadoborate cluster solids. The rationale is to find new stable oxide frameworks or clusters, for which REDOX active centers can be incorporated and leading to new catalytic applications complementary to existing phases. The experimental work in this thesis describes the formation and isolation of over 35 new crystalline solids from these above families in which the structure and arrangement of inorganic oxide components, such as metal phosphate or borate, is varied through their synthesis in the presence of organic structure directing groups. In general all compounds reported have been isolated in phase-pure form and have been fully characterized. This includes a single crystal X-ray structure determination in the majority of cases. The physio-chemical properties of certain selected compounds are also reported. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of 19 new organically modified group 13 phosphates. Initial studies show that indium phosphates vary considerably from the lighter group 13 congeners the AlPOs and GaPOs, in that indium is always octahedrally (rather than tetrahedrally) coordinated. Hydrothermal crystallization is effected usually at low pH conditions and use of fluoride mineralizer is effective, though often non-innocent as in formation of 3 [pnH 2] 3 [H 3 O][In 9 (PO 4) 8 H 2 F 16] 3 [H 2 O]. The crystal chemistry is quite rich {{with a wide range of}} In:P:F ratio possible. Several new open framework compounds, such as [hopipzH 2][In 4 (PO 4) 4 F 2 (H 2 O) 4], have been formed although they appear relatively fragile to removal of organic 'guest' counter ions. Attempts to incorporate transition metals into discrete framework sites were partially successful, with the formation of [en][CoInH(PO 4) 2 F 2 (H 2 O) 2] which is a 2 -D <b>sheet</b> <b>phosphate.</b> More promising was the formation of [FeM(PO 4) 2 (enH) ] M = Al, Ga which are novel mixed metal phosphates with pendant organic ions. These can be ion-exchanged and the framework is stable to 200 °C. Chapter 3 describes our parallel studies on group IV phosphate phases of Zr and Ti and five new phases are reported. These metals have chemical and coordination similarities to indium. Phases of variable dimensionality, including a 3 -D open framework, have been formed using the same organic template (en) but differing hydrothermal conditions. The 1 -D and 2 -D phases are difficult to crystallize and the X-ray structures obtained are rare examples of this class of phosphate solid. Chapter 4 describes our attempts to isolate group V and VI mixed metal phosphate solids and five new compounds are reported. The chemistry here, especially that of vanadium, is highly varied and is oxidation state dependent. Vanado(III) and vanadium (IV) phosphates are well established as open framework solids. We have found new phases of these, as well as new reduced cluster solids based on the new cluster anions [Mo 8 V 6 PO 42] 8 -, in which the Mo and V sites are distinct. Initial electrochemical studies on these are highly promising and show reversible REDOX activity. Chapter 5 describes our work on vanadium (IV) borates, which again typically take the form of cluster sub units. A wide range of cluster types and stoichiometries are found, which are influenced by organic groups. We have succeeded in isolating six new heterometallic vanadoborate clusters and cluster solids. The use of secondary metals such as zinc and cadmium is shown to be a successful strategy for cross-linking the [VBOx] clusters to form a new class of thermally stable microporous solids. In particular a 3 -D cubic phase with the anionic framework [Cd 3 V 12 B 18 O 60 H 6]n 6 - has been synthesized which shows reversible sorption / desorption of water, cation exchange and is stable to 250 °C. Finally the use of low aquation levels in these syntheses which may be regarded as boric acid flux' synthesis is shown to yield distinct results from hydrothermal approach. First a phase containing the 1 -D chain polymer [V 6 B 22 O 53 H 8] 8 - is found instead of salts of the discrete [V 6 B 20 H 8] 8 - ions. When copper is used instead of vanadium a novel borate phase [Cu(en) 2][B 7 O 13 H 3] is found in which the borate forms a specific porous framework around the metal-organic templating cations. In summary we have explored several relatively undeveloped areas of metal oxide solid and in each case have found that depending on synthesis conditions, the inorganic component can be co-crystallized with organic co-components which modulate the structure through supra-molecular effects. In the case of cluster work less obvious dependence is seen for the counter ion in vanadoborate chemistry, however for the vanado-molybdo-phosphate system the selective precipitation of particular clusters from a complex 'soup' of similar cluster ions appears to be possible through variation of the organic cation. This synthesis approach looks extremely promising for further development of designed metal oxide species...|$|R
