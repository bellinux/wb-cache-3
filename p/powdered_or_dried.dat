In the traditional ceramics industry, quartz containing raw materials are indispensable for manufacture and workers exposed to higher RCS concentrations in the air are potentially at risk for lung inflammation, silicosis or even lung tumors. The SILICOAT project thus aims at increasing workers' safety by developing and implementing cost-effective RCS coating technologies into ceramic processes which should saturate reactive surface silanol groups and inhibit quartz-specific toxic effects.

40|$|See {{description}} of calcium oxide {{production in the}} calcium oxide TAP Review. Hydrated lime is produced from the slow addition of water to crushed or ground quicklime (calcium oxide). This is done in a premixing chamber or vessel that mixes and agitates the lime and water at prescribed levels. The addition of water generates considerable heat of the reaction and produces steam. Although the theoretical amount of moisture needed is 24. 5 %, in practice about 50 - 65 % water is added to counteract loss from steam. After hydration, the slightly moist slaked lime is conveyed to a separator where coarse fractions are removed, and the powder dries. It is then bagged in paper sacks or shipped in bulk by truck or rail. The reaction can be characterized as: CaO + H 20 � � Ca(OH) 2 + heat high calcium quicklime high calcium hydrate Depending on the source parent rock, different grades of hydrated lime may be produced. A high calcium hydrate is 71 - 74 % calcium oxide, with 0. 5 - 2 % magnesium oxide and 24 - 25 % water. Slaked lime may also be produced as a waste product. Carbide lime is a waste lime hydrate by-product from the generation of acetylene from calcium carbide, and occurs as a wet <b>powder</b> <b>or</b> <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> of varying purity (Kirk-Othmer 1991 b).

Therefore, zinc oxide <b>powder</b> was humidified <b>or</b> <b>dried</b> and afterwards heated quickly (100 K/min) by FAST/SPS.

The lowered activation energy for densification exhibits no impact of the sintering electric current on this enhanced densification behavior.
