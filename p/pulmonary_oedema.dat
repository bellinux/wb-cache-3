5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E

5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E

Electrosurgical techniques to perform transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) followed in 1983 [2]. In 1989, Vancaille [3] introduced Rollerball coagulation. These techniques, however, carry some potentially serious risks such as excessive fluid overload (cerebral, <b>pulmonary</b> and peripheral <b>oedema),</b> uterine perforation and haemorrhage.

40|$|ObjectivesAcute limb {{ischaemia}} is {{a common}} and often lethal clinical event. Reperfusion of an ischaemic limb {{has been shown to}} induce a remote gut injury associated with transmigration of endotoxin into the portal and systemic circulation, which in turn has been implicated in the conversion of the sterile inflammatory response to a sepsis syndrome, after lower torso ischaemia-reperfusion injury. This study tests the hypothesis that an anti-endotoxin hyperimmune globulin attenuates ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) associated sepsis syndrome. DesignProspective, randomised placebo controlled trial, animal experiment. Materials and methodsExperimental porcine model, bilateral hind limb I/R injury, randomised to receive anti-endotoxin hyperimmune globulin or placebo. ResultsBilateral hind limb I/R injury significantly increased intestinal mucosal acidosis, portal endotoxaemia, plasma cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL- 6, IL- 8) concentrations, circulating phagocytic cell priming and <b>pulmonary</b> leukosequestration, <b>oedema,</b> and capillary-alveolar protein leak. Conversely, pigs treated with anti-endotoxin hyperimmune globulin (IgG) 20 mg/kg at onset of reperfusion had significantly reduced portal endotoxaemia, early circulating phagocytic cell priming, plasma cytokinaemia and attenuation of acute lung injury. ConclusionsEndotoxin translocation across a hyperpermeable gut barrier, phagocytic cell priming and cytokinaemia are key events of limb I/R injury induced systemic inflammation and acute lung injury. This study shows that an anti-endotoxin hyperimmune globulin attenuates portal endotoxaemia, which may reduce early phagocytic cell activation, cytokinaemia and ultimately acute lung injury...|$|R
