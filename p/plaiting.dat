Plane cut-out and {{expansion}} method {{is used for}} clothing structure, based on clothing pattern design through paralleled expansion method and revolved expansion method. <b>Plait</b> is {{an important element of}} clothing design with strong 3 D effects which mainly includes natural <b>plait</b> and regular <b>plait.</b> Plane cut-out {{and expansion}} method should be used flexibly in order to design different styles of clothing <b>plaits.</b> The conclusion provides reference for costume styling designer. Preface <b>Plait</b> is an eternal fashion element in costume design with three dimensions. <b>Plait</b> is widely used not only in men’s, women’s and kid’s clothing, but also in detailed design and entire styling design. The pattern design includes graphic design method and 3 D structural method. 3 D structural method is better for <b>plait</b> style which has art infection such as exaggerated <b>plait</b> and ball-flower. However, it has a complicated process, detailed line and it is hard to handle. It needs long-term experience accumulation {{and it is difficult to}} spread. So this method is not good for volume production. As for pattern design method, which is preponderant to operate easily and quickly, is widely used to design costume <b>plait.</b> In the process of designing, changing component of width of the original pattern through plane cut-out and expansion method to make up a perfect costume <b>plait</b> style. Classifications of <b>plait</b> It is classified into natural <b>plait</b> and regular <b>plait</b> according to style characteristics. Natural <b>plait</b> is flowing, and it includes wavy <b>plait</b> and gathered <b>plait</b> as shown in Fig. 1. Regular <b>plait</b> shows regularly dynamic, including drape <b>plait</b> which has a difference between left and right, and tucker <b>plait</b> which makes a distinction into apparent and hiding <b>plait</b> (Fig. 2). For each kind of <b>plait,</b> the two component of width can be equaled, differed or even one component equals zero. (Tuck <b>plait)</b> (Drape <b>plait...</b>|$|R

25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} <b>plaiting</b> the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are plaited as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The {{remainder}} of the sling is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|E

25|$|Until the 18th {{century the}} {{economic}} activity of Chesham had remained largely unchanged since {{the granting of}} its town charter in 1257. The commercial planting of beechwoods established Chesham {{as one of a}} number local centres in the Chilterns for the production of turned furniture components and other wooden items often called bodging, in local workshops. Mills along the Chess concerned with papermaking and silk weaving continued to operate until the middle of the 19th century as did 'outworkers' engaged in lace making and straw <b>plaiting</b> whose employment was impacted on by changes in fashion, by mechanisation and from cheaper imports from the continent. The mineral-laden unpolluted water of the Chess made it ideal for growing watercress and this industry flourished in Chesham in the Victorian era and beds extended along the Chess towards Latimer, which continued in operation until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor quality}} of the land though meant that {{employment}} for villagers was often of a casual nature. Straw <b>plaiting</b> was the chief occupation {{of women and children}} during most of the 19th century. The plait was sent to Luton or London. The availability of daily train services to London also provided income from pheasant rearing. Until the Second World War agriculture had been the principle industry in the area. During the 20th century, much of the land was gradually taken out of agricultural use until today when only a minimal acreage is given over to or cattle and sheep-grazing or arable farming. The relative closeness to Chesham provided opportunity for work within, for example, one of the many mills or boot factories. The arrival of the railway to Chesham during the 1880s, the relative closeness to London and other conurbations and improvement to the road networks and public transport resulted in work being sought from further afield. The village supported a number of small shops until the 1960s when supermarkets and increased car ownership sealed their fate.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 20th century, {{agriculture}} and woodworking {{had been the}} main employment for villagers although work was often of a casual nature, supplemented by road mending and season fruit picking when orchards were commonplace. Straw <b>plaiting</b> was the chief occupation {{of women and children}} during most of the 19th century. The plait was sent to Luton or London. Until the Second World War agriculture had been the principle industry in the area. In Chesham work could be found in mills and boot factories. The discovery of clay deposits in the surrounding area had been a source for small-scale pottery production since the 17th century. The demand for new houses after the First World War lead to the rapid expansion of brickmaking in the area and St Brown's brickworks was opened on the site of clayfields in Shire Lane. At its height it was producing between 3–3.5m bricks per year. In 1946 another local brickmaking company Dunton's, encouraged by the Ministry of Works rented land on an adjacent site to meet the demand for post-war reconstruction and new house building.|$|E

Redhide whips are usually made of four <b>plaits</b> due to ease {{and speed of}} {{construction}} but some people prefer 6 <b>plait.</b> A kangaroo hide whip is made, usually, with 8 or 12 <b>plaits,</b> but can be made even finer by cutting the strands narrower prior to construction.

25|$|New {{industries}} {{emerged from}} the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had {{been a source of}} firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry; making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between 17th and 19th centuries. Straw <b>plaiting</b> was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior 'Tuscan plait' traded at a Saturday market for the Luton and Dunstable hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls some of whom attended a 'plait-school' in Waterside. Lace making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechinisation in Nottingham. Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets. However one exception was the firm of George Tutill, which specialised in high-quality banners and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a going concern still specialising in flags and banners.|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} folk {{textiles}} of Anatolia, Greece, Linda Welters identifies the zonari as a long fringed belt constructed of sprang. [...] The zonari is a rounded material of indeterminate length around 2 or 3 meters long and is wrapped multiple times when worn. [...] From interviews conducted during the 1980s, Welters found that the technique was practiced by elderly women and regarded as a specialized skill which they worked on pairs of beams. [...] Their vocabulary had no special term to correspond with sprang, so they referred to it with descriptive phrases such as knitting with sticks, <b>plaiting,</b> and weaving without passing through. [...] The zonari are made from sheep's wool hand spun with a drop spindle and dyed red, blue, or black depending on local custom. [...] Zonari belts are a custom in much of Argolida and Corinthia where they are traditional dowry items worn by women from marriage onward and associated with fertility and donned on ritual occasions. [...] Welters observes that these were mostly owned and worn by older women.|$|E
