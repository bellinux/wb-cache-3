40|$|We {{define a}} new logic {{language}} with negation by introducing existential and universal quantifiers in the queries. We call Γ <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> Γ goals the <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> the goals in this language. Negation is handled by using two rules: the NAF rule for universally quantified negative queries and the NAI rule for existentially quantified negative queries. We formalize this amalgamation {{in terms of}} NAIF-resolution (SLD-resolution with Negation As Instantiation and Failure), and we prove its correctness w. r. t. the completion semantics. We also show how extended <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals, i. e. <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals whose body is an arbitrary first-order formula ([11]), can be transformed into Γ <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals and then evaluated using our system. 1 Introduction SLD-resolution extended by the NAF rule for treating negative subgoals, (SLDNF-resolution), represents {{the most widely used}} method to compute with general logic <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals [...] . ...|$|R

5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States.

At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch <b>program,</b> <b>and</b> a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures.
