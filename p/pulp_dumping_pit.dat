40|$|Abstract. Concern {{about the}} {{possible}} effects of genetically modified crops has increased the demand for segregating grains during handling and processing operations. Research {{on the amount of}} commingling of different grains in an elevator is limited. This study evaluated the level of commingling at a grain flow rate of 51 t/h (2000 bu/h) at the research elevator facility of the USDA-ARS, Grain Marketing and Production Research Center (GMPRC), Manhattan, Kansas. White corn was first loaded in the elevator followed by yellow corn. Samples were taken after the yellow corn had passed the elevator boot, weighing scale, and grain cleaner. Samples were sorted by color and components were weighed to determine commingling, defined as the percentage of unwanted grain in the total grain mass. Residual grain was also collected from each piece of equipment after each replication. Commingling for the first 380 kg (15 bu, approximately 1 % of the leg rate per hour) was approximately 4 %; it decreased to 0. 5 % within the first metric ton of load (2 % of the leg rate per hour). Residual grain in the <b>dump</b> <b>pit</b> and elevator boot amounted to 0. 24 % and 1. 41 % of the total load, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain {{handlers}} {{have responded}} to an increased use of specialty grain and the resulting need for grain segregation {{without the benefit of}} experimental data in the literature quantifying the commingling that may occur during grain handling. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of handling equipment on commingling and residual grain at an average grain flow rate of 47 t h- 1 (1852 bu h- 1) in the research elevator at the USDA-ARS Grain Marketing and Production Research Center in Manhattan, Kansas. Tests were done by first moving white corn through selected pieces of cleaned elevator equipment followed by moving yellow corn through the same equipment without any special clean out between the two operations. Commingling was calculated as the percentage of white kernels mixed in the yellow corn samples collected at selected time intervals during the second operation. Commingling was greater than 1 % during no more than the first 38 sec and always decreased to less than 0. 5 % within the first metric ton of load (76 sec) for all tested equipment. The highest cumulative commingling for tests of one truckload (ca. 7. 3 t) was 0. 24 % for the grain cleaner. Mean cumulative commingling values for the other handling equipment were 0. 22 %, 0. 01 %, and 0. 18 % for the weighing scale, grain scalper, and the combined effect of <b>dump</b> <b>pit</b> and boot, respectively. The residual grain obtained from cleaning the equipment after the test was highest at the elevator boot (120 kg), followed by the receiving pit (20 kg).

The {{results show that}} a major crude oil spillage occurred at Ejamah Ebubu, Rivers State, Nigeria approximately 30 years ago. This assessment of study {{of the status of}} the site within the immediate vicinity of the spill revealed the existence of the Ochani Stream site further downstream. With this study, the state of the hydrocarbon contamination resulting from the spill has been identified. The nature and extent of the petroleum hydrocarbon contamination across the Ochani Stream site has been defined. The study revealed a total number of nine <b>dump</b> <b>pits</b> on this site. The pits contained weathered crude oil. Seven of them were located on the elevated dry land to the southwest and slope towards the swampy bush.

The contamination within the swampy area was non-homogenous and randomly distributed. Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon contamination levels varied widely across the site, from negligible, to heavily contaminated. Depth of contamination was very shallow. At an estimated average depth of 150 mm over an area of 6. 05 Ha the total volume of contaminated soil/sediment was 9075 m 3.

Zoogenic issues of soil protective capacity formation in conditions of heavy metal content rise under technogenesis have been studied. The article discusses the features of earthworm trophic-metabolic activity in the afforested remediated site (Western Donbass, Ukraine) with different options of mixed soil bulk. Western Donbass is the large center of coal mining located in South-Western part of Ukraine. High rates of technical development in this region lead to surface subsidence, rising and outbreak of high-mineralized groundwater, and formation of <b>dump</b> <b>pits</b> of mine wastes. Remediated area is represented by the basement of mine wastes covered by 5 options of artificial mixed soil with different depth of horizons. The following tree species were planted on top of artificial soil: Acer platanoides L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., and Juniperus virginiana L. The main practical tasks were to define on the quantitative basis the buffer capacity of artificial mixed soil and earthworm excreta in relation to copper contamination and to compare its immobilization capacity in conditions of artificial forest plants in the territory of Western Donbass. It was proved that earthworm excreta had a great influence on soil immobilization capacity (particularly, on soil buffering to copper) which increased for excreta in the following range: humus-free loess loam – top humus layer of ordinary chernozem. Immobilization efficiency of copper by earthworm excreta from ordinary chernozem bulk compared with baseline (ordinary chernozem) was significantly higher. It should be noted that trophic-metabolic activity of earthworms plays very important role as a zoogenic factor which restricts movement of excess chemicals, maintains stability and increases resistance to soil contamination, in particular, with copper.
