50|$|This gene encodes {{a highly}} basic protein {{localized}} to the nucleus. The evolutionarily constrained {{open reading frame}} is found on a bicistronic transcript which has a downstream ORF encoding the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N. The upstream coding region utilizes the first three exons of the transcript, a region that {{has been identified as}} an imprinting center. Multiple transcription initiation sites have been identified and extensive alternative splicing occurs in the 5' untranslated region but the full-length nature of these transcripts has not been determined. An alternate exon has been identified that substitutes for exon 4 and leads to a truncated, monocistronic transcript. Alternative splicing or deletion caused by a translocation event in the 5' untranslated region or coding region of this gene leads to Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome due to <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> switch failure. The function of this protein is not yet known.|$|E
40|$|Praderâ€“Willi {{syndrome}} (PWS) and Angelman syndrome are neurogenetic disorders {{caused by}} the lack of a paternal or a maternal contribution from human chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13, respectively. Deletions in the transcription unit of the imprinted SNRPN gene have been found in patients who have PWS or Angelman syndrome because of a <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> switch failure in this chromosomal domain. It has been suggested that the SNRPN exon 1 region, which is deleted in the PWS patients, contains an imprint switch element from which the maternal and paternal epigenotypes of the 15 q 11 -q 13 domain originate. Using the model organism Drosophila, we show here that a fragment from this region can function as a silencer in transgenic flies. Repression was detected specifically from this element and could not be observed with control human sequences. Additional experiments allowed the delineation of the silencer to a fragment of 215 bp containing the SNRPN promoter region. These results provide an additional link between genomic imprinting and an evolutionary conserved silencing mechanism. We suggest that the identified element participates in the long range regulation of the imprinted 15 q 11 -q 13 domain or locally represses SNRPN expression from the maternal allele...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe H 19 and insulin-like {{growth factor}} 2 (Igf 2) {{genes in the}} mouse are models for genomic {{imprinting}} during development. The genes are located only 90 kb apart in the same transcriptional orientation [1], but are reciprocally imprinted: Igf 2 is paternally expressed while H 19 is maternally expressed. It {{has been suggested that}} expression of H 19 and repression of Igf 2 (or the converse) on a given chromosome are mechanistically linked and that the <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> operates at the level of transcription [2]. Although expression of Igf 2 and H 19 is thought to be monoallelic, the data have so far been obtained exclusively by looking at steady-state RNA levels using techniques that reflect the average activity of the genes in a cell population [3, 4]. Here, we have adapted a fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) method to detect nascent RNA molecules of Igf 2 and H 19 at the initial transcription sites in the nuclei of wild-type mouse embryonic liver cells. Nine different transcription patterns were observed, reflecting a high heterogeneity of transcription at the single-cell level. Our observations suggest that regulation of Igf 2 and H 19 by parental imprinting is much more complex than previously proposed and acts at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels...|$|E

5000|$|Sex-specific {{effects can}} be due to <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> a process that results in {{allele-specific}} differences in transcription, DNA methylation, and DNA replication timing. Imprinting is an important process in human development, and its deregulation can cause certain defined disease states of other imprinted human disease loci. The establishment of <b>parental</b> <b>imprints</b> occurs during gametogenesis as homologous DNA passes through sperm or egg; subsequently during embryogenesis and into adulthood, alleles of imprinted genes are maintained in two [...] "conformational"/epigenetic states: paternal or maternal. Thus, genomic imprints template their own replication, are heritable, can be identified by molecular analysis, and serve as markers of the parental origin of genomic regions.|$|R
40|$|Some {{genes in}} mammals and {{flowering}} plants {{are subject to}} <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> a process by which differential epigenetic marks are imposed on male and female gametes so that one set of alleles is silenced on chromosomes contributed by the mother while another is silenced on paternal chromosomes. Therefore, each genome contributes {{a different set of}} active alleles to the offspring, which develop abnormally if the parental genome balance is disturbed. In Arabidopsis, seeds inheriting extra maternal genomes show distinctive phenotypes such as law weight and inhibition of mitosis in the endosperm, while extra paternal genomes result in reciprocal phenotypes such as high weight and endosperm overproliferation, DNA methylation is known to be an essential component of the <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> mechanism in mammals, but there is less evidence for this in plants. For the present study, seed development was examined in crosses using a transgenic Arabidopsis line with reduced DNA methylation. Crosses between hypomethylated and wild-type diploid plants produced similar seed phenotypes to crosses between plants with normal methylation but different ploidies, This is consistent with a model in which hypomethylation of one parental genome prevents silencing of alleles that would normally be active only when inherited from the other parent - thus phenocopying the effects of extra genomes, These results suggest an important role for methylation in parent-of-origin effects, and by inference <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> in plants. The phenotype of biparentally hypomethylated seeds is less extreme than the reciprocal phenotypes of uniparentally hypomethylated seeds, The observation that development is less severely affected if gametes of both sexes (rather than just one) are 'neutralized' with respect to parent-of-origin effects supports the hypothesis that <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> is not necessary to regulate development...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{disorders}} involving imprinted genes such as Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) {{can have}} a mutation in the imprinting mechanism. Previously, we identified an imprinting center (IC) within chromosome 15 q 11 -ql 3 and proposed that IC mutations block resetting of the imprint, fixing on that chromosome the <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> (epigenotype) on which the mutation arose. We now describe four new microdeletions of the IC, the smallest (6 kb) of which currently defines the minimal region sufficient to confer an AS imprinting mutation. The AS deletions all overlap this minimal region, centromeric to the PWS microdeletions, which include the first exon of the SNRPN gene. None of five genes or transcripts in the 1. 0 Mb vicinity of the IC (ZNF 127, SNRPN, PAR- 5, IPW, and PAR- 1), each normally expressed only from the paternal allele, was expressed in cells from PWS imprinting mutation patients. In contrast, AS imprinting mutation patients show biparental expression of SNRPN and IPW but must lack expression of the putative AS gene 250 - 1000 kb distal of the IC. These data strongly support a model in which the paternal chromosome of these PWS patients carries an ancestral maternal epigenotype, and the maternal chromosome of these AS patients carries an ancestral paternal epigenotype. The IC therefore functions to reset the maternal and paternal imprints throughout a 2 -Mb imprinted domain within human chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13 during gametogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Duplication of {{chromosome}} 15 q 11 -q 13 (dup 15 q) {{accounts for}} approximately 3 % of autism cases. Chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13 contains imprinted genes necessary for normal mammalian neurodevelopment {{controlled by a}} differentially methylated imprinting center (imprinting center of the Prader-Willi locus, PWS-IC). Maternal dup 15 q occurs as both interstitial duplications and isodicentric chromosome 15. Overexpression of the maternally expressed gene UBE 3 A is predicted {{to be the primary}} cause of the autistic features associated with dup 15 q. Previous analysis of two postmortem dup 15 q frontal cortical samples showed heterogeneity between the two cases, with one showing levels of the GABA A receptor genes, UBE 3 A and SNRPN in a manner not predicted by copy number or <b>parental</b> <b>imprint.</b> Methods Postmortem human brain tissue (Brodmann area 19, extrastriate visual cortex) was obtained from 8 dup 15 q, 10 idiopathic autism and 21 typical control tissue samples. Quantitative PCR was used to confirm duplication status. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to measure 15 q 11 -q 13 transcript and protein levels, respectively. Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting-curve analysis was performed on brain genomic DNA to identify the maternal:paternal ratio of methylation at PWS-IC. Results Dup 15 q brain samples showed a higher level of PWS-IC methylation than control or autism samples, indicating that dup 15 q was maternal in origin. UBE 3 A transcript and protein levels were significantly higher than control and autism in dup 15 q, as expected, although levels were variable and lower than expected based on copy number in some samples. In contrast, this increase in copy number did not result in consistently increased GABRB 3 transcript or protein levels for dup 15 q samples. Furthermore, SNRPN was expected to be unchanged in expression in dup 15 q because it is expressed from the single unmethylated paternal allele, yet SNRPN levels were significantly reduced in dup 15 q samples compared to controls. PWS-IC methylation positively correlated with UBE 3 A and GABRB 3 levels but negatively correlated with SNRPN levels. Idiopathic autism samples exhibited significantly lower GABRB 3 and significantly more variable SNRPN levels compared to controls. Conclusions Although these results show that increased UBE 3 A /UBE 3 A is a consistent feature of dup 15 q syndrome, they also suggest that gene expression within 15 q 11 -q 13 is not based entirely on copy number but can be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms in brain. </p...|$|E
40|$|Among {{patients}} with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), {{an excess of}} DR 3 and DR 4 alleles is classically described {{when compared with the}} general population. In addition, an excess of maternal DR 3 and paternal DR 4 alleles among patients (DR 3 DR 4) is observed. In order to explain these observations, two alternative hypotheses can be tested: maternal effect and <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting.</b> Maternal effect has been tested and not rejected on a sample of 416 caucasians affected with IDDM. Under this hypothesis, the children of a DR 3 mother are expected to have an earlier exposure and, hence, an earlier age at onset. However, we did not observe such a difference in age at onset in this data set. Using the marker-association-segregation-chi 2 method, we have tested four hypotheses with different parental effects of two susceptibility alleles, alpha 0 and beta 0, at two different closely linked loci. Under the hypothesis that best fitted the data, the probability of being affected depended on the parental inheritance of the susceptibility alleles, suggesting <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> (i. e., differential role of maternal and paternal allele), without evidence for a cis-trans effect.

40|$|The causal {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} well-established relation between advancing paternal age and schizophrenia is hypothesized to involve mutational errors during spermatogenesis that occur {{with increasing frequency}} as males age.

Dysregulation of epigenetic processes may also be an important mechanism underlying the association between paternal age and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that advancing age as well as environmental exposures alter epigenetic regulation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{discovery}} of classic <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> came, {{at least in}} part, from the analysis of transgene expression in mice [1]. It was noticed that some transgenes were only expressed following paternal transmission [2 â€“ 4] and that others sometimes showed differential patterns of methylation depending on the parent of origin [5, 6]. Here, we present evidence of a novel and more subtle form of <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> {{by taking advantage of}} the highly sensitive detection of murine transgene expression afforded by flow cytometry. We have produced nine lines of transgenic mice carrying a GFP reporter linked to the human Î±-globin promoter and enhancer elements, which direct expression to erythroid cells. A high proportion of transgenic lines, four of the nine, display significantly lower levels of expression following maternal transmission. Both the percentage of expressing cells and the mean fluorescence in expressing cells are between 10 % and 30 % lower following maternal transmission. These effects are reversible upon passage through the opposite germline. This finding raises the possibility that differences in the epigenetic state of the maternal and paternal chromosomes in adult somatic cells are more widespread than was previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} a {{transgenic}} mouse line that exhibits significant deviations from a classic pattern of <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting.</b> When the transgene is {{passed through the}} female germline, it is completely silenced in some offspring while in others expression is reduced. This variable expressivity {{does not appear to}} be the result of differences in the presence of unlinked modifiers. Female transmission of the transgene is associated with hypermethylation. The transgene is generally reactivated on passage through the male germline. Extended pedigrees reveal complex patterns of inheritance of the phenotype. The most likely explanation for this result is that the imprint is not completely erased and reset when passed through the germline of either sex. FISH analysis reveals that the transgene has integrated into chromosome 3 band E 3, a region not known to carry imprinted genes, and the integration site shows no sign of allele-specific differential methylation. These findings, in conjunction with other recent work, raise the possibility that the introduction of foreign DNA into the mammalian genome, either through retrotransposition or transgenesis, may be associated with <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> that is not always erased and reset during meiosis...|$|R
40|$|The insulin-like {{growth factor}} II (IGF-II) gene is parentally {{imprinted}} in the mouse and human species. By following the inheritance of natural polymorphisms of IGF-II mRNA, we {{demonstrated that the}} tissue-specific <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> of the IGF-II gene is conserved in the rat. The expression of the paternal IGF-II allele exceeded by more than 3 orders of magnitude that of the maternal allele in livers of 3 -day-old Wistar x Fisher interstrain rat crosses. In contrast, the two alleles were both expressed in the rat central nervous system, {{which is also the}} only district of the organism where this gene is active in adult rodents. We also analyzed the allelic usage of the three IGF-II promoters, which generate alternatively spliced transcripts, and showed that <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> of all transcription starts sites is coordinately regulated since P 1, P 2, and P 3 are all repressed on the maternal allele in neonatal rat liver, and all of them are activated on both alleles in the choroid plexus of the central nervous system.

40|$|Expression of the chromosomally linked Insulin-like Growth Factor II (IGF-II) and H 19 genes is {{regulated}} by <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> during development, since the maternally inherited IGF-II and the paternally inherited H 19 alleles are inactive in fetal tissues. Here {{we show that}} expression of IGF-II and H 19 genes is activated in transgenic mice during SV 40 Tag-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and that imprinting of both genes is conserved in the liver tumors. Allelic imbalances of IGF-II and H 19 genes and other chromosome 7 markers were detected in one third (13 / 39) of the hepatocellular carcinomas analysed. A strong bias on the allele retained in the neoplasms was observed, since underrepresentation or complete loss of maternal chromosome 7 was recognised in 12 / 13 cases. High levels of IGF-II mRNA were expressed by all carcinomas with relative excess of paternal chromosome 7 alleles and suppressed H 19 expression {{was found in the}} neoplasms lacking the maternal alleles. Overall the results indicate that expression of imprinted genes is involved in progression of experimental liver tumors and suggest that the murine chromosome 7, whose loss may possibly cause the inactivation of a growth-inhibitory gene, is preferentially retained as paternal copy in the liver tumors because of <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> of IGF-II gene...|$|R
40|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> is a mammalian-specific form of {{epigenetic}} {{regulation in}} which one allele of a gene is silenced depending on its <b>parental</b> origin.

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> have been largely elucidated, the selective advantage of silencing one allele remains unclear. The mutant phenotype of the imprinted gene, Pw 1 /Peg 3, provides a key example to illustrate the hypothesis on a coadaptation between mother and offspring, in which Pw 1 /Peg 3 is required for a set of essential maternal behaviors, such as nursing, nest building, and postnatal care. We have generated a novel Pw 1 /Peg 3 mutant allele that targets the last exon for the PW 1 protein that contains > 90 % of the coding sequence resulting in a loss of Pw 1 /Peg 3 expression. In contrast to previous reports that have targeted upstream exons, we observe that maternal behavior and lactation are not disrupted upon loss of Pw 1 /Peg 3. Both paternal and homozygous Pw 1 /Peg 3 mutant females nurse and feed their pups properly and no differences are detected in either oxytocin neuron number or oxytocin plasma levels. In addition, suckling capacities are normal in mutant pups. Consistent with previous reports, we observe a reduction of postnatal growth.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> of {{differentially}} methylated regions (DMRs) {{contributes to}} appropriate expression of several developmentally important genes from paternally or maternally derived chromosomes. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) {{is the most}} common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and is asso-ciated with altered expression of certain parentally imprinted genes. As previously reported, RMS cells display loss of imprinting (LOI) of the DMR at the IGF 2 -H 19 locus, resulting in insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) transcription from both paternally and maternally inherited chromosomes, and overall IGF 2 overexpression. As the DLK 1 -GTL 2 locus is structurally similar to the IGF 2 -H 19 locus, the status of <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> of the DLK 1 -GTL 2 locus was studied in RMS. We observed that while both embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS and ARMS, respectively) show LOI of the DMR at the IGF 2 -H 19 locus, imprinting of the DMR at the DLK 1 -GTL 2 locus varies in association with the histological subtype of RMS. We found that, while ERMS tumors consistently show LOI of the DMR at the DLK 1 -GTL 2 locus, ARMS tumors have erasure of imprinting (EOI) at this locus. These changes in imprinting status of the DLK 1 -GTL 2 locus result in a higher GTL 2 /DLK 1 mRNA ratio in ARMS as compared to ERMS. This difference in imprinting elucidates a novel genetic differ-ence between these two RMS subtypes and may provide a potential diagnostic tool to distinguish between these subtypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of apomixis to crops would allow desirable genotypes to be propagated while preventing undesirable gene flow, {{but so far}} {{there has been little}} success in transferring this trait from a natural apomict to another species. One explanation is the sensitivity of endosperm to changes in relative maternal and paternal contribution owing to <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> an epigenetic system of transcriptional regulation by which some genes are expressed from only the maternally or paternally contributed allele. In sexual species, endosperm typically requires a ratio of two maternal genomes to one paternal genome for normal development, but this ratio is often altered in apomicts, suggesting that the imprinting system is altered as well. We present evidence that modification of DNA methylation is one mechanism by which the imprinting system could be altered to allow endosperm development in apomicts. Another feature of natural apomixis is the modification of the normal fertilization programme. Sexual reproduction uses both sperm from each pollen grain, but pseudogamous apomicts, which require a sexual endosperm to support the asexual embryo, often use just one. We present evidence that multiple fertilization of the central cell is possible in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that pseudogamous apomicts may also need to acquire a mechanism for preventing more than one sperm from contributing to the endosperm. We conclude that strategies to transfer apomixis to crop species should take account of endosperm development and particularly its sensitivity to <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> as well as the mechanism of fertilization...|$|R
