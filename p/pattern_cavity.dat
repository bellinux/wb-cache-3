However, as the cavity {{is defined by the}} geometry of the periodic dielectric <b>pattern,</b> <b>cavity</b> control in a monolithic structure can be problematic. Thus, either the state coherence is limited by the read-out channel, or in a high Q cavity, it is nearly decoupled from the external world, making measurement of the state extremely challenging.

The idea of the presented experiments is to examine the behaviour of RNase A molecule under high pressure before and after introduction of destabilizing mutation. For the first time crystal structures of wild-type bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and its markedly less stable variant modified at position Ile 106 were determined at different pressures. X-ray diffraction experiments at high pressure showed that the secondary structure of RNase A is well preserved even beyond 0. 67 GPa at room temperature.

30|$|Chest CT scans were {{reviewed}} by two radiologists (SHK and JYL) with 3 and 14 years’ experience {{who had no}} knowledge of the patients’ clinical information. A final decision regarding the findings was determined by consensus. The assessed patterns of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities included the following: centrilobular nodules (including a tree-in-bud <b>pattern),</b> <b>cavity</b> (site, number, size of the largest cavity and thickness), consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, calcified nodule or consolidation, bronchiectasis, irregular lines, and lung destruction. The descriptive terms used to interpret CT findings were as follows (Hansell et al. 2008): (i) centrilobular nodule: a nodule separated by several millimeters from the pleural surfaces, fissures, and interlobular septa; (ii) tree-in-bud pattern: centrilobular branching structures that resemble a budding tree; (iii) cavity: a gas-filled space, seen as a lucency or lowattenuation area, within pulmonary consolidation, a mass or nodule. Identification of bronchial wall thickening is largely subjective. Because bronchial wall thickening often is multifocal rather than diffuse and uniform, we compared the bronchial wall thickness of one lung region to another. The operational definition of lung destruction was one lobe or a lung with parenchymal distortion, bronchiectasis, and a decreased volume below half that of a normal lung. The cavities in areas of destroyed lung were not counted. In addition, the presence of mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion or thickening was recorded. Enlarged lymph nodes were defined as having a short-axis diameter > 1 cm on the CT scan. Each finding was classified at the second evaluation as completely or partially cleared, stable, increased, or newly developed.|$|E

40|$|Commonly, {{optical filters}} consist of {{pigments}} on glass or of many stapled interference layers. In both cases, {{they are not}} applied on CMOS devices within the fab line, but through further processing, which also involves additional costs. In addition to this, pigment-based filters do not allow to perform a spectral analysis, which needs multichannel-based sensors, i. e. more than four different filters. Two methods for producing optical filters in the CMOS-line with different sensitivities are presented here. The first one consists of a structured metal layer embedded in oxide, whose working principle bases on plasmonics. The second one is a Fabry-Perot resonator with <b>patterned</b> <b>cavity</b> deposited with CMOS technology {{on top of the}} device.

40|$|Complexity {{focuses on}} {{commonality}} across subject areas and forms a natural platform for multidisciplinary activities. Typical generic signatures of complexity include: (i) spontaneous occurrence of simple patterns (e. g. stripes, squares, hexagons) emerging as dominant nonlinear modes [1], and (ii) {{the formation of}} a highly complex pattern {{in the form of a}} fractal (with comparable levels of detail spanning decades of scale). Recently, a firm connection was established between these two signatures, and a generic mechanism was proposed for predicting the fractal generating capacity of any nonlinear system [2]. The mechanism for fractal formation is of a very general nature: any system whose Turing threshold curves exhibit a large number of comparable spatial-frequency instability minima are potentially capable of generating fractal patterns. Spontaneous spatial fractals were first reported for a very simple nonlinear system: the diffusive Kerr slice with a single feedback mirror [3]. These Kerr-slice fractals are distinct from both the transverse fractal eigenmodes of unstable-cavity lasers [4], and also from the fractals found in optical soliton-supporting systems [5, 6]. On the one hand, unstable-cavity fractals may be regarded as a linear superposition of diffraction patterns with different scale lengths, each of which arises from successive round-trip magnifications of an initial diffractive seed. On the other hand, fractals formed in the Kerr slice result entirely from intrinsic nonlinear dynamics (i. e. light-matter coupling leading to harmonic generation and/or four-wave mixing cascades). These processes conspire to generate new spatial frequencies that, in turn, can produce optical structure on smaller and smaller scales, down to the order of the optical wavelength. Here we report the first predictions of spontaneous fractal patterns inside driven damped ring cavities containing a thin slice of nonlinear material. Both dispersive (i. e. diffusive-relaxing Kerr [3]) and absorptive (i. e. Maxwell- Bloch saturable absorber [7]) are considered. New linear analyses have shown that the transverse instability spectra of these two cavity systems possess the requisite comparable minima that predict the capacity for the spontaneous generation of fractal patterns. Extensive numerical simulations, in both one and two transverse dimensions, have verified that both the dispersive and absorptive cavities do indeed give rise to nonlinear optical fractals in the transverse plane. Our results confirm that the mechanism for fractal formation has independence with respect to the details of the nonlinearity. An essential ingredient for the generation of fractals is the presence of a feedback mechanism [2]. Feedback drives the cascade process that is responsible for the creation of higher spatial wavenumbers, and which ultimately leads to the “structure across decades of scale” character of the fractal <b>pattern.</b> <b>Cavity</b> geometries are therefore ideal candidates as potential optical fractal generators. The simplest dispersive nonlinearity is provided by the relaxing-diffusing Kerr effect. The threshold curves possess the qualitative features necessary for the generation of spontaneous fractal patterns: successive and comparable spatial frequency minima. Rigorous simulations have shown that the Kerr cavity is indeed capable of generating fractal patterns. In a single-K configuration, where the filter attenuates all those spatial wavenumbers outside the first instability band, it is found that simple stripe patterns emerge. Once this stationary pattern has been reached, the spatial filter is removed to allow all waves to propagate. Energy is transferred to higher spatial frequencies, and the simple strip pattern acquires successive level of fine detail at a rate that depends upon the system parameters. By analysing the power spectrum P(K) it can be seen that a fractal pattern emerges relatively rapidly. Eventually, the system enters a dynamic equilibrium (within typically less than a hundred transits) where the average power spectrum remains unchanged even though the pattern continues to evolve in real space. When this statistically invariant state is attained, the pattern is referred to as a scale-dependent fractal. An appreciable portion of the dynamic state is well described by a linear relationship ln P(K) = a + bK, where a and b are constants, and this type of behaviour is one of the characteristics of a fractal pattern [2]. We have recently found that a thin-slice Maxwell-Bloch saturable absorber [7] can also generate fractal patterns. This system can be either purely absorptive or purely dispersive. Linear analysis, together with a generalized boundary condition (which allows for attenuation), yields the threshold condition for Turing instability. One finds that the threshold spectrum comprises a series of adjacent instability islands. Simulations have revealed that the Maxwell-Bloch system can also support fractals. The single-K patterns turn out to be hexagonal arrays, familiar from conventional pattern formation [1, 3]. Once this state has been reached, the spatial filter is removed and one can observe a rapid transition toward a fractal pattern. The qualitative behaviour of fractals patterns in both dispersive and absorptive systems are found to be the same, confirming the assertion of independence with respect to nonlinearity.

The volume fraction and average shape of the nanocavities have been detected by a pronounced increase in the scattering invariant Q/Q(0) and {{a detailed analysis of}} the scattering <b>patterns.</b> <b>Cavities</b> appear upon loading past an intrinsic stress sigma(int) or intrinsic elongation lambda(int). Upon unloading, nanocavities are progressively closed until the volume void fraction phi(void) reaches 0 for a constant "closure stress" of about 3. 5 MPa. As the sample is reloaded, no cavities are observed when the current elongation remains below the maximum elongation of previous cycles lambda(max) (N - 1) (N is the number of the cycles). Above this elongation, the void volume fraction phi(void) of the sample increases again. In contrast with phi(void), the cumulative void volume fraction phi(cum_void) appearing in the sample to reach a given maximum historical elongation, lambda(max), or equivalently maximum historical stress sigma(max), was found to be independent of loading history. Both results point toward a process of creation of nanovoids in confined rubber domains that have not previously cavitated rather than to the reopening of the previously created cavities. All critical cavitation parameters display a strong memory effect, mostly captured in this uniaxial test by the maximum historical stress or elongation. The closure stress probably results from the Laplace pressure. A mechanism based on the rearrangement of filler agglomerates by strong shear stress after the emergence of nanocavities is proposed to account for the formation and release of the local geometric confinement and the non-reopening of the previously opened nanovoids upon reloadin...|$|R
