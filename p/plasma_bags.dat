500|$|The {{player can}} access various {{long-range}} and melee weapons including swords, shields, bows, and guns, stakes, and holy water. Some weapons have a secondary, more powerful attack; for example a sword can be spun to decapitate a foe. Because they are vampires, allies and enemies {{are susceptible to}} damage from sunlight. Disciplines (vampiric powers) are used to supplement physical attacks. Each discipline can be upgraded, becoming a more powerful version of itself; alternatively, other in-game benefits can be gained. The game features disciplines that allow the player to enhance the character's physical abilities such as speed, strength, or durability. Disciplines can also allow the player to mesmerize an enemy or a potential feeding victim, render the character invisible to escape detection, turn the character into mist, summon serpents to attack enemies, heal, revive their allies, and teleport to a haven. Each discipline can be upgraded up to five times, affecting the abilities' durations, {{the scale of the}} damage or their effect, and the cost of using it. The characters' health and disciplines are reliant on blood, which can only be replenished by feeding on the living—including other party members—or finding blood containers such as bottles and <b>plasma</b> <b>bags.</b> Drinking an innocent to death and other negative actions reduces the player's humanity, increasing the likelihood of [...] entering a frenzy when injured or low on blood, during which they indiscriminately attack friend and foe.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{preparations}} {{are used}} to treat major blood loss {{in order to maintain}} haemostasis. During emergency management of an acute blood loss, frozen <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> must be thawed foresightfully, leading to the problem that once thawed, plasma preparations that are no longer needed must be discarded after six hours in accordance with current guidelines. The present work is the first study investigating the only available solvent/detergent-plasma preparation with prion elimination, Octaplas ® LG, during a storage period of 144 hours with regard to the stability of the concentration and activity of its pharmacologically active components, i. e. selected coagulation factors and inhibitors. The requirements stated by the European Pharmacopoeia for such plasma preparations were taken into account {{in order to determine the}} length of time during which the plasma preparation can be considered sufficiently stable. 24 <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> were thawed and stored for 144 hours at 4 °C. Four of these were left unopened and were tested microbiologically at the end of the storage period in order to detect a possible contamination during storage. Consecutive samples were taken from the remaining 20 <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> at defined time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hrs) under sterile conditions. In these samples, the concentration of fibrinogen and the activities of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX and XI, protein C, free protein S and plasmininhibitor were measured in a standardized way. The microbiological analyses of the thawed and stored plasma preparations revealed sterile contents in each unopened bag. Based on the largest relative concentration (or activity) loss of each protein (δmax), two groups of proteins could be defined: one group of relatively stable proteins (δmax 10 per cent: factors V, VII, VIII, XI). Among the relatively unstable proteins, coagulation factors VII and VIII showed their largest absolute activity losses already between the 24 and 48 hours after thawing. Not later than 96 hours after thawing and storage at 4 °C, only factor VIII fell short of the minimum activity of 50 % that is required by the European Pharmacopoeia for factors V, VIII and XI in solvent/detergent-plasma preparations. From these results, it can be inferred that the application of thawed and appropriately stored Octaplas® LG plasma may be possible beyond the currently permitted time window of six hours due to the sufficient stability of its coagulation proteins. Usage might be extended up to at least 24 and possibly even up to 72 hours. In clinical care, the rapid allocation of already thawed preparations can provide an important temporal advantage, e. g. for patients depending on an acute transfusion. In addition, a reduced number of discarded plasma products, would mean both a cost reduction as well as a more prudent use of the valuable resource of human plasma...|$|E
40|$|At {{the moment}} thawed plasma is {{discarded}} latest 6 h after thawing {{according to the}} guidelines for production of blood and blood components and use of blood products (hemotherapy) of the Bundesärztekammer according to §§ 12 and 18 of the Transfusionsgesetz (TFG) (1). The reason for the limitation of thawed plasma storage is the estimated critical decrease of clotting factors and –inhibitors after 6 h. Furthermore bacterial contamination is feared. At Charité for example, costs of 50. 720 € arise by wastage of thawed plasma (2). Besides cost saving, the implementation of an emergency plasma depot for transfusion of acute bleeding patients in the OR or ICU would be possible if the clotting factor content is preserved. This {{is supported by the}} investigation of Thiele et al. (3). In their study FFP and methylene blue light treated plasma was stable even after seven days. FVIII dropped below 70 % activity after three days. The authors support the use of the stored plasma except for treatment of specific FVIII deficiencies. Previous studys investigated only small amounts of <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> or selected blood groups (4, 5, 6, 7). Especially the modern Solvent/Detergent plasmas (S/D-Plasma) and the prion removal treated Solvent/Detergent plasma LG (e. g. Octaplas LG®) were not investigated for their clotting factor stability during storage in thawed condition. The primary objective of the studys was to measure the stability of clotting factors as a quality marker in current used plasma types (FFP, S/D-Plasma, S/D-Plasma LG) during a long time period. Furthermore the risk of bacterial contamination during storage of thawed plasma was investigated. Therefore aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were taken. In the study investigating FFPs, study plasma were taken after informed consent of plasma donators. For the studys on S/D-Plasma and S/D-Plasma LG, <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> were purchased respectively provided by the manufacturer. For the analysis of clotting factors samples were taken at predefined points (after thawing and during the six storage period at 4 °C). A sufficient level of the quality marker clotting factors according to the TFG for the FFP (FVIII > 70 % activity resp. > 0, 7 IE/ml) was found. The S/D-Plasma and S/D-Plasma LG bags showed similar results according to the European pharmacopeia (FV, FVIII and FXI > 50 % activity resp. > 0, 5 IE/ml). None of the plasmas showed bacterial contamination. The results indicate a preserved quality of thawed plasmas after six days storage at 4 °C. Additional investigations are required for use of thawed and stored plasma in patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of {{elevated}} signal-to-cut off ratios (S/CO) as {{an alternate}} to further supplemental testing (i. e., RIBA) has {{been included in}} the guidelines provided by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention for HCV diagnostic purposes since 2003. With availability of screening by NAT and non availability of RIBA, further confirmation of HCV infection has been possible at the molecular level (RNA). Aims: To study the role of S/CO ratios of anti hepatitis C virus antibody detection by enzyme immunoassays (EIA) along with ID-NAT for screening of whole blood donors. Methods: In this study we reviewed the donor screening status for anti HCV from January 2013 to May 2014. All the donations were screened for anti HCV with fourth generation ELISA (BioRad Monolisa Ag-Ab Ultra) as well as with ID NAT (Procleix Ultrio). The S/CO ratio of all the anti-HCV reactive samples were analysed for their presence of HCV RNA. Results: On screening 21, 115 donors for HCV, 83 donors (0. 39 %) were found reactive on pilot tube and repeat <b>plasma</b> <b>bag</b> testing (S/Co ratio ≥ 1) by ELISA. 41 donors were HCV RNA reactive with ID-NAT. 4 samples out of 41 were NAT yields and 37 were concordant reactive with ELISA. The S/Co ratio of anti-HCV reactive samples ranged from 0. 9 - 11. 1 [mean = 5. 1; SD ΁ 2. 9] whereas S/Co ratio of anti HCV and NAT reactive samples (concordant positives) ranged from 4. 1 - 11. 1 [mean 7. 3]. In our analysis we found that S/CO ratio of 4 showed positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of 100 %. Summary/Conclusions: Our study showed that S/CO of 4 for anti HCV on ELISA would have maximum positive predictive value of having donor with HCV RNA. S/CO ratio of 4 is very close to 3. 8 which was the CDC guideline. The presence of anti-HCV does not distinguish between current or past infections but a confirmed anti-HCV-positive result indicates the need for counseling and medical evaluation for HCV infection...|$|R

Aim: The study was done to ascertain prevalence of Gilbert′s syndrome in healthy blood donors and review the literature about feasibility of utilizing blood components from Gilbert′s syndrome donors. Materials and Methods: The study was done for 18 months and 7030 whole blood units were collected and all the units were subjected to mandatory transfusion-transmitted screening and all the <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> which were icteric on visual inspection were subjected to hematological and biochemical investigations to rule out other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. Results: Seven thousand and thirty units were collected and 445 (6. 3 %) were discarded due to various reasons. Of them, 50 units (0. 71 %) had Gilbert′s syndrome. All had unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and other hematological and liver function tests were within normal range. Statistical analysis was done to find mean, median, and standard deviation from mean and standard error of mean with lower and upper confidence limits. Conclusion: Majority of blood donors whose plasma is icteric are suffering from Gilbert′s syndrome (GS). This disease does not cause any harm to donor or patient but raises {{a lot of concern}} as many severe disorders also manifest in similar way. The available literature shows that all blood components can be used from donors suffering from GS. There should be introspection. Proper guidelines are to be framed about the use and discarding of blood components in donors with GS...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pathogen {{reduction}} system {{is expected to}} effectively reduce pathogen load of blood components while simultaneously maintaining the quality of cells and proteins. Pathogen reduction in human plasma treated {{with a combination of}} riboflavin (vitamin B 2) and UV light is based on irreversible, oxydative damage of nucleic acids. In this way it prevents further replication of viruses, bacteria and parasites eventually present in the plasma. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of photo-inactivation process on the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) present in plasma. Methods: We have tested 30 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), obtained by processing single donor whole blood. We have pooled two units of fresh plasma, identical ABO blood groups, and by dividing them got 15 pairs of fresh frozen plasma (30 units). One pair included a test unit, which will be photo-inactivated (FP) and a control unit (KP). We added 35 ml of riboflavin (500 µM) in the treated unit (FP) and illuminated it with UV lihgt (6. 24 J/ml) on the Mirasol Illuminator (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies; USA). In order to obtain equal dilution, we added 35 ml of saline into the control unit. After illumination, we took samples (1. 5 ml aliquots) from FP and KP and froze them at - 80 °C. Control and treated <b>plasma</b> <b>bags</b> were frozen simultaneously at - 30 °C. After one month, samples were thawed and concentration of F VIII in FP and KP units were compared. Results: Median value FVIII in the treated plasma was 0. 84 IE/ml (0. 59 – 0. 92 IE/ml). Median percent recovery was 68 % (59 – 78 %). Average inactivation time was 3 minutes and 9 seconds ± 22 seconds. Conclusion: The study results showed that the pathogen reduction process using Mirasol technology affects the concentration of F VIII in plasma. FVIII concentration in the treated units is consistent with the recommendations and is comparable to the concentration of FVIII after treatment with other inactivation methods...|$|E
40|$|Using an exactly {{solvable}} {{statistical model}} {{we discuss the}} equation of state of large/heavy and short-living quark gluon <b>plasma</b> (QGP) <b>bags.</b> We argue that the large width of the QGP bags explains not only the observed deficit {{in the number of}} hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed even as metastable states in a hadronic phase.

It is shown that at high temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in accordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear asymptotics), whereas for temperatures below T_H/ 2 (T_H is the Hagedorn temperature) they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the square root one).

40|$|Within an exactly {{solvable}} model I {{discuss the}} influence of the medium dependent finite width of quark gluon <b>plasma</b> (QGP) <b>bags</b> on their equation of state. It is shown that the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states in a hadronic phase. I show how the model allows one to estimate the minimal value of the width of QGP bags being heavier than 2. 5 GeV from a variety of the lattice QCD data and to get the minimal resonance width at zero temperature of about 600 MeV. The Regge trajectories of large and heavy QGP bags are established both in a vacuum and in a strongly interacting medium. It is shown that at high temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in accordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear asymptotics), whereas at low temperatures (below a half of the Hagedorn temperature T_H [1] they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the square root one). Thus, for temperatures below T_H/ 2 the spin of the QGP bags is restricted from above, whereas for temperatures above T_H/ 2 these bags demonstrate the typical Regge behavior consistent with the string models.

40|$|Background. The use of plasma frozen within 24 [*]hrs {{is likely}} to increase. Whole blood (WB) and buffy coats (BCs) can be held for a few hrs or {{overnight}} before processing. Methods. Twenty-four bags of WB for <b>plasma</b> and 12 <b>bags</b> for platelet (PLT) concentrates were collected. The fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was prepared within 6 [*]hrs. I-FP 24 and II-FP 24 samples were prepared either from leukodepleted WB that was held overnight or from WB that was held overnight before leukodepletion. The PLT concentrates (PCs) were prepared from BCs within 6 [*]hrs (PC 1) and within 18 to 24 [*]hrs (PC 2). The typical coagulation factors and some biochemical parameters were determined. Results. Compared to the FFP samples, the levels of FVII and FVIII in the I-FP 24 and II-FP 24 samples decreased significantly. The pH, Na+, LDH, and FHb levels differed significantly between II-FP 24 and FFP. Compared to PC 1, PC 2 exhibited lower pH, pO 2, and Na+ levels, a higher PLT count, and increased pCO 2, K+, Lac, and CD 62 P expression levels. Conclusion. FP 24 is best prepared from WB that was stored overnight at 4 °C and then leukodepleted and separated within 24 [*]hrs. PCs are best produced from BCs derived from WB that was held overnight at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses {{are members}} of the Filoviridae family which cause {{outbreaks}} of hemorrhagic fever. The filovirus VP 40 matrix protein is essential for virus assembly and budding, and its PPxY L-domain motif interacts with WW-domains of specific host proteins, such as Nedd 4 and ITCH, to facilitate the late stage of virus-cell separation. To identify additional WW-domain-bearing host proteins that interact with VP 40, we used an EBOV PPxY-containing peptide to screen an array of 115 mammalian WW-domain-bearing proteins. Using this unbiased approach, we identified BCL 2 Associated Athanogene 3 (BAG 3), a member of the BAG family of molecular chaperone proteins, as a specific VP 40 PPxY interactor. Here, we demonstrate that the WW-domain of BAG 3 interacts with the PPxY motif of both EBOV and MARV VP 40 and, unexpectedly, inhibits budding of both eVP 40 and mVP 40 virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as infectious VSV-EBOV recombinants. BAG 3 is a stress induced protein that regulates cellular protein homeostasis and cell survival through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Interestingly, our results show that BAG 3 alters the intracellular localization of VP 40 by sequestering VP 40 away from the <b>plasma</b> membrane. As <b>BAG</b> 3 is the first WW-domain interactor identified that negatively regulates budding of VP 40 VLPs and infectious virus, we propose that the chaperone-mediated autophagy function of BAG 3 represents a specific host defense strategy to counteract the function of VP 40 in promoting efficient egress and spread of virus particles...|$|R

We find that collisional radiative (kinetics) modeling of {{the intensities of}} the He-{beta} line and its dielectronic capture satellites is generally {{in agreement with the}} measured spectra. On the other hand, for the particular case of satellites arising from inner-shell electron collisional excitation, we find discrepancies of up to a factor of two between experiment and kinetics models. We have ruled out possible effects on the line emission due to plasma gradients, radiative transport, and suprathermal electron excitation leaving errors in the atomic physics modeling to be the most likely explanation. The determination that there are problems with the collisionally populated states is important for the interpretation of inertial confinement fusion capsule implosions where electron densities and temperature have been measured using the spectral line shape of the He-{beta} transition of Ar XVII. The analysis of the implosion data has required Stark broadening calculations coupled to a kinetics model to calculate the detailed line intensities and widths. Despite remaining discrepancies, the good agreement between the experimental dielectronic capture satellites and the HULLAC calculations suggests that HULLAC is a more appropriate code for the construction of the kinetics models of the He-{beta} complex from high density plasmas than previously used codes (e. g. MCDF). HULLAC results in higher temperatures for the implosion conditions of Ref. (5, 6) in closer agreement with the 2 -D radiation hydrodynamic modeling and other spectroscopic techniques.

The materials and methods used include 10 ml cellophane bags containing a peritoneal dialysis solution were placed in a 200 ml container full of either water or blood plasma. The experiments are performed using cellophane bags with 3. 5 kDa and 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off. 24 -hour monitoring of water transport induced by 7. 5 % icodextrin solution, and that induced by 1. 5 % and 4. 25 % dextrose solutions are compared. It is observed in the study that in a beaker containing water, mass of the cellophane bags containing 1. 5 % and 4. 5 % dextrose solutions increase up to 6. 6 % and 10. 7 % respectively within 24 hours. In blood plasma containers, the cellophane bags containing 1. 5 % and 4. 25 % dextrose solution exhibited mass loss, indicating an overall fluid flux flowing from the cellophane bag. In contrast, masses of cellophane bags containing 7. 5 % icodextrin solution increase up to 30 %. Moreover, the constant slope of the averaged mass changes after the dwell time of 8 hours also indicated a constant incoming fluid flux. We may conclude that in <b>plasma</b> beaker, cellophane <b>bags</b> containing dextrose solution exhibit mass decrease and volume reduction.
