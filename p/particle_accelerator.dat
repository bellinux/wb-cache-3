5|$|Donald William Kerst (November 1, 1911 – August 19, 1993) was an American {{physicist}} {{who worked}} on advanced <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> concepts (accelerator physics) and plasma physics. He is most notable for his development of the betatron, a novel type of <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> used to accelerate electrons.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{returns to}} Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when {{she tries to}} arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> but Davey reveals {{that he has been}} helping the {{government}} hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.|$|E
5|$|Other virtual {{particles}} {{may contribute}} to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron–positron pairs. In fact, such photon-photon scattering (see two-photon physics), as well as electron-photon scattering, is meant {{to be one of the}} modes of operations of the planned <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> the International Linear Collider.|$|E
50|$|Ion {{irradiation}} {{means in}} general using <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> to shoot energetic ions on a material.Ion implantation is {{a variety of}} ion irradiation, as is swift heavy ions irradiation from <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> induces ion tracks {{that can be used}} for nanotechnology.|$|R
50|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{in popular}} culture is about popular science books, fictional literature, feature films, TV series and other venues which include <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{as part of their}} content.

5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator.</b> In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{was also}} {{selected}} as the location for the Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME) facility, supported by UNESCO and CERN. This <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> which was inaugurated in 2017, will allow collaboration between scientists from various rival Middle Eastern countries. The facility is the only synchrotron radiation facility in the Middle East, and one of only 60 in the world.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{returned}} to Princeton and served on several high-level administrative committees. This work included advising {{on the construction}} of a <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> built jointly with the University of Pennsylvania and overseeing Project Matterhorn, which became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He chaired the committee that chose Robert F. Goheen to succeed Harold W. Dodds as President of Princeton. He also served as a consultant on nuclear power to Congress, the AEC, and private industry. He retired from Princeton in 1966.|$|E

50|$|In <b>{{particle}}</b> <b>accelerators</b> an {{ion source}} creates a particle beam {{at the beginning}} of the machine, the source. The technology to create ion sources for <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> depends strongly on the type of particle that needs to be generated: electrons, protons, H− ion or a Heavy ions.|$|R
5|$|The codex {{was tested}} in the Instituto de Física of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City using a 3 megaelectronvolt pelletron <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator.</b> Testing methods applied to the codex {{included}} ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography, optical microscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The specific aim of this non-destructive testing was to compare the materials used in the codex with those used in other pre-Columbian codices.|$|E
5|$|Today, Michigan State {{continues}} its research with facilities {{such as the}} U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as {{the site for the}} Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The $730 million facility will attract top researchers {{from around the world to}} conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

50|$|Cyclotron <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators,</b> linear <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators,</b> and Synchrotron <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> can {{accelerate}} {{positively charged}} hydrogen ions until their velocity approaches {{the speed of}} light, and each individual ion has a kinetic energy range of 100 MeV to 1000 MeV or more. Then the resulting high energy protons can capture electrons from electron emitter electrodes, and be thus electrically neutralized. This creates an electrically neutral beam of high energy hydrogen atoms, that can proceed {{in a straight line}} at near the speed of light to smash into its target and damage it.|$|R

5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator.</b> The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> {{which was designed to}} accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was {{technical}} {{director of the}} Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He was then employed at General Atomics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962, where {{he worked on the}} problem of plasma physics. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit.|$|E

5|$|Kerst {{returned}} to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He developed the spiral-sector focusing principle, which {{lies at the heart}} of many spiral ridge cyclotrons that are now in operation around the world. His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received {{a gift from the}} American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).|$|E
5|$|Peter Parker {{plans to}} propose to Mary Jane Watson, {{who has just}} made her Broadway musical debut. A {{meteorite}} lands at Central Park, and an extraterrestrial symbiote follows Peter to his apartment. Harry Osborn, seeking vengeance after his father's death, attacks Peter with weapons based on his father's Green Goblin technology. The battle ends in a stalemate, with Harry crashing out and developing amnesia, wiping out his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped prisoner Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again, and falling into an experimental <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, transforming him into the Sandman.|$|E

5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E
5|$|While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb {{force from}} the ambient {{electric}} field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to {{be attracted to}} the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator.</b> Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for {{the mass of the}} electron.|$|E
