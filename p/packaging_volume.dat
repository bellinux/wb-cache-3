30|$|In {{calculating the}} PkE {{in a real}} pcW-LED, we have to measure the power of white light outside the pcW-LED {{and the power of}} the blue light from the blue die to the <b>packaging</b> <b>volume.</b> In a pcW-LED, the blue die will be covered by {{phosphor}} mixed with the encapsulation material such as silicone [20]. The blue light in the packaging is different from that emitted by a bare blue die to the air since the light extraction of the blue die changes. Generally, the LEE could increase in such a condition, because the light escaping cone in the blue die becomes larger owing to the increase of the refractive index outside the die. However, it could be possible to reduce the LEE if the major LEE comes from effective surface texture [15]-[18]. Eventually, it is difficult to measure the power of the blue light inside the <b>packaging</b> <b>volume</b> directly. To solve the problem, we propose a way with measuring the power of the bare blue die and a calibration factor to calculate the power of the blue light inside the <b>packaging</b> <b>volume.</b> The whole process can be illustrated as following.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Internet traffic loads are increasing. Sustaining packet {{switching}} throughput of a core node will be difficult. A {{major reason for}} this is power consumption and <b>packaging</b> <b>volume.</b> As long as we use only current semiconductor technology, the switching capacity will be limited. Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) superconducting technology can overcome such difficulties because of high-speed operation and low-power consumption characteristics. A superconducting wiring also enables high-speed inter-chip communication. We report on progress on packet switch circuit implementation and cryo-cooled packaging for a RSFQ packet switch system. In addition, we discuss a possible packet switch architecture over 100 Tbps that uses RSFQ technology...|$|E

The design drivers considered were: weight, fundamental frequency, launch <b>packaging</b> <b>volume,</b> part count, and on-orbit assembly time. For the range of parameters considered, on-orbit assembly time was identified as the major design driver.

The CTB is a multievaporator hybrid loop heat pipe (MEHLHP).

Key benefits of the CTB are: multiple load heat transport, heat load sharing, eliminating thermal attitude constraints, and increasing operational reliability.

40|$|So far, the {{sustainability}} focus on packaging has been strongly on resource conservation and material recycling. However, as this thesis demonstrates based on LCA studies, for typical cases of packed consumer durables, the transportation of the packed product {{has a higher}} environmental impact than the packaging material used. Analysis of a substantial set of packed consumer durables demonstrates that transportation efficiency is determined by packaging based on volume. Hence, a designfor- volume-optimization approach is proposed. The packaging development process is studied, identifying a need to integrate packaging design and packaging engineering. Three types of packaging functionalities are identified, namely distribution-related, sales-related and experience-related. Each type of functionalities has its own relationship to <b>packaging</b> <b>volume.</b> An approach to analyze the required mix of functionalities for a specific package is proposed.
