5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is <b>positively</b> <b>charged,</b> the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E
5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a high-intensity short-pulse laser with thin solid targets produces electron jets that escape {{the target and}} <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> it, leading {{to the formation of}} the electrostatic potential that in turn governs the ion acceleration. The typical timescale of such phenomena is on the sub-picosecond level. Here we show, for the first time, temporally-resolved measurements of the first released electrons that escaped from the target, so-called fast electrons. Their total charge, energy and temporal profile are provided by means of a diagnostics based on Electro-Optical Sampling with temporal resolution below 100 fs...|$|R

Here, {{we show that}} despite of this intramolecular <b>charge</b> effect mixing <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> polycarboxybetaine and oppositely charged poly(maleic acid-co-propene) can yield polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC). Dynamic light scattering and viscometry has proved formation of highly swollen PEC nanoparticles with sizes {{in the range of}} 5 - 8 nm at n-/n+ ratio from 0. 6 to 1. 0. Significant difference in charge densities and molecular dimensions in the solution were suggested as the main reasons for deviation from 1 : 1 PEC stoichiometry...|$|R
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E
5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (<b>positively</b> <b>charged)</b> form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{process by}} which viruses destabilize endosomal {{membranes}} in an acidification-dependent manner has been mimicked with synthetic peptides {{that are able to}} disrupt liposomes, erythrocytes, or endosomes of cul-tured cells. Peptides containing the 20 amino-terminal amino acid sequence of iduenza virus hemagglutinin as well as acidic derivatives showed erythrocyte lysis activity only when peptides were elongated by an am-phipathic helix or by carboxyl-terminal dimerization. Interestingly, peptides consisting of the 23 amino-termi-nal amino acids of influenza virus hemagglutinin were also active in erythrocyte lysis.

5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E

Those works, however, relied on the use of QDs originally synthesized in organic solvents and thus capped with long-chain organic molecules which had to be post-preparatively exchanged for bifunctional short-chain ligands or thioglycolic acid (TGA) serving as molecular linkers [15] to the oxide surface. Recently, Chen et al. reported an improved QDSC by direct loading of mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdSe QDs on TiO 2 substrates from aqueous solution with a power conversion efficiency of 1.19 % [16]. Multilayers of TGA-capped CdTe QDs have been deposited on ZnO nanorods in combination with <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> polyelectrolyte to improve the light-harvesting ability [17].|$|R
40|$|Significant {{reduction}} of inherent large divergence {{of the laser}} driven MeV proton beams is achieved by strong (of the order of 10 (9) V/m) electrostatic focussing field generated in the confined region of a suitably shaped structure attached to the proton generating foil. The scheme exploits the <b>positively</b> <b>charging</b> of the target following an intense laser interaction. Reduction in the proton beam divergence, and commensurate increase in proton flux is observed while preserving the beam laminarity. The underlying mechanism has been established by the help of particle tracing simulations.

5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be <b>positively</b> <b>charged.</b> When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were <b>positively</b> <b>charged.</b> Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E

Four independent second-site revertants contain an Asp- 286 [...] Asn- 286 substitution in large T antigen. This mutant large T antigen activates replication of DNAs containing the mutant polyomavirus origin {{as well as}} replication of DNAs containing the wild-type origin; however, replication of DNAs with enhancer mutations is not activated by this large T antigen. The Asn- 286 mutation occurs in a <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> region of large T antigen near the location of several mutations which inactivate DNA replication. We suggest that this region of large T antigen is responsible for recognition of specific DNA sequences at the origin and that ionic forces are important for this interaction...|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{degrading}} enzyme (IDE) {{is believed}} to be the major enzyme that metabolizes insulin and has been implicated in the degradation of a number of other bioactive peptides, including amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), glucagon, amylin, and atrial natriuretic peptide.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} {{partially}} oxidize methane at low temperatures and pressures would have important {{environmental and economic}} applications. Although methane oxida-tion on gold nanoparticles has been observed experimentally, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate neither CH 4, CH 3, nor H adsorb on a neutral gold nanoparticle. However, by <b>positively</b> <b>charging</b> gold nanoparticles, e. g. through charge transfer to the TiO 2 substrate, CH 4 binding increases while O 2 binding remains relatively unchanged. We demonstrate that CH 4 adsorption is via bonding with the metal s levels. This holds from small gold clusters (Au 2) to large gold nanoparticles (Au 201), and for all fcc transition metal dimers. These results provide the chemical understanding necessary to tune the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles for the partial oxidation of methane under delicate conditions...|$|R
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become <b>positively</b> <b>charged.</b> Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
40|$|Hole {{trapping}} in insulating {{layers of}} HfO 2 grown on Si(I 00) using different deposition methods is analysed by generating electron-hole pairs in the oxide and observing the stable trapped charge. The charge trapping {{appears to be}} strongly sensitive to the chemistry of the particular deposition method. The dependence of the trapped charge density on the HfO 2 thickness indicates the hole trapping to be predominantly associated with a SiO 2 -like interlayer formed between Si and HfO 2 during the deposition process or subsequent annealing. The diamagnetic nature of the <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> centers {{in combination with the}} observed correlation between the positive charge and the release of atomic hydrogen at the Si/oxide interface suggest that the positive charge may be related to protonic species.

30|$|For an {{effective}} removal of dyes from textile wastewaters, {{it is essential}} to understand the mechanism of dye adsorption onto the adsorbents. The adsorption mechanism of MB can be explained by considering the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged surface of MLP and <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> MB dye. This electrostatic interaction can be explained with the help of surface functional groups of MLP adsorbent and the pH dependency of the adsorption of MB onto MLP. Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups on the surface of MLP. The ionization of these groups which depends on solution pH results in electrical charge {{on the surface of the}} MLP adsorbent. The hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups present on the surface of MLP can gain or lose a proton, resulting in a surface charge that varies with changing pH.|$|R
30|$|Halogenation {{holds the}} promise of {{effective}} drug design by facilitating the drug molecules to cross biological barriers, filling small hydrophobic pockets present in protein targets, prolonging lifetime and easy adsorption. Being a strong electron-withdrawing group, halogens help in forming H‒bond and other non-covalent interactions (Lu et al. 2009, 2012; Politzer et al. 2007; Sarwar and Ajami 2013; Wilcken et al. 2012). Comparing with other halogenations, fluorination and carbon trifluoro-methylation have significant contributions to medicinal chemistry (Alonso et al. 2005; Gillis et al. 2015; Hagmann 2008; Zhou et al. 2009). Halogens stabilize the interactions of drug molecules with their protein target by promoting stronger bonding between functional groups through charge distribution. Further, some halogens such as I and Br contain regions with <b>positively</b> <b>charge</b> on them, {{which is responsible for}} its directional and stabilizing characteristics on the drug molecules (Kolář et al. 2013).|$|R
