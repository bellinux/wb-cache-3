Viewable at [URL] device for reducing noise levels in <b>passenger</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems {{at least partially}} obstructs spacing at the interface between two steps to allow for relative movement between one step and the next. A sound transmission reducing member at least partially obstructs a sound pathway that includes the spacing to reduce the transmission of noise through the spacing. The sound transmission reducing member in one example is a barrier that partially blocks the interface, while in another; it extends completely across the interface. Additionally, sound absorbing material may be secured to {{the underside of the}} steps in order to further reduce sound transmission toward the passengers and individuals near the conveyer. Carl Q.

40|$|Crowds occur {{frequently}} in modern society. A major sporting or entertainment event can attract {{tens of thousands}} of avid fans. Usually, these large gatherings of people occur without serious problems. Occasionally, however, the combination of inadequate facilities and deficient crowd management results in injury and death. Outdoor music festivals (OMFs) are increasingly common events on the summer entertainment landscape for young people around the world. Attending these OMFs is associated with an increased risk of injury and, in extreme cases, death. A considerable proportion of these risks can be attributed to high-risk behaviour in the general admission or standing room only areas in front of the stages, or ‘mosh pits’. During the ten year period from 1992 to 2002, 66, 787 people have suffered significant injury and 232 people have died at 306 outdoor music concerts around the world. Fatality data over a longer period (1974 to 2003) indicates that at least 136 fatal incidents at concert events have not been scientifically explained. Forty one (41) of these involved persons who died in front of a concert stage. Crowd incidents show different types of group motivation. In some cases there is an interruption of a simple traffic process such as exiting a stadium or a <b>passenger</b> <b>conveyor,</b> resulting in a critical crowd pressure point. Others fall into the two general behavioural categories of either a flight response or a craze. Flight occurs where people experience either a real or perceived threat. Frequently mislabelled as panic, a closer investigation usually shows that flight was a reasonable group reaction under the perceived circumstances. A mass craze is a competitive rush to obtain some highly valued objective. Such group behaviour is created where participation in an event, or viewing of a public personage, is intensively promoted. General admission events and so called “festival seating” concerts, in particular, cause competition for favourable seats or standing positions close to entertainers...|$|E

A number of CNIM escalators are installed on the London Underground system as well as Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway. Thirty CNIM escalators in the Paris Metro system, installed in 2006-2007, were {{to be replaced by}} 2015 because they were built 10cm too wide, according to RATP Group, the operator of the stations.|$|R
