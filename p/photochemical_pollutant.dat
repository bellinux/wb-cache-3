The {{aim of this study}} was to assess and localize the cellular expression of VEGF, since the central respiratory areas show a neuroplasticity in response to ozone. Adult rats were subjected to 0. 5 ppm ozone for 3 h and then recovered for further 3 h. The expression of VEGF was evaluated by immunocytochemistry in the central respiratory areas, i. e., the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM). The data show a VEGF overexpression at the end of ozone exposure, which persisted during the 3 -h recovery. Interestingly, using confocal analysis the bulk of VEGF labeling was observed in astroglial cell bodies and branches, while neuronal labeling was hardly noticed. Moreover, VEGF colocalized with IL- 6 and TNF alpha in astrocytes closely apposed to blood vessel walls. The vasculature area was markedly increased (+ 58 %) during post-ozone recovery.

Ozone (O 3) can irritate lung airways and cause inflammation much like sunburn. Hourly and monthly variations of O 3 and their precursors – nitrogen oxides (NOx) and meteorological parameters (temperature and wind speed) were presented using time series plots. Possibility of employing multiple linear regression models as a tool for prediction of O 3 concentration was also tested.

40|$|The spatiotemporal {{variations}} of surface air pollutants (O 3, NO 2, SO 2, CO, and PM 10) with four land-use types, residence (R), commerce (C), industry (I) and greenbelt (G), {{have been investigated}} at 283 stations in South Korea during 2002 – 2013, using routinely observed data. The volatile organic compound (VOC) data at nine <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutant</b> monitoring stations available since 2007 were utilized {{in order to examine}} their effect on the ozone chemistry. The land-use types, set by the Korean government, were generally consistent with the satellite-derived land covers and with the previous result showing anti-correlation between O 3 and NO 2 in diverse urban areas. The relationship between the two pollutants in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) residence land-use areas was substantially different from that outside of the SMA, probably due to the local differences in vehicle emissions. The highest concentrations of air pollutants in the diurnal, weekly, and annual cycles were found in industry for SO 2 and PMPM 10, in commerce for NO 2 and CO, and in greenbelt for O 3. The concentrations of air pollutants, except for O 3, were generally higher in big cities during weekdays, while O 3 showed its peak in suburban areas or small cities during weekends. The weekly cycle and trends of O 3 were significantly out of phase with those of NO 2, particularly in the residential and commercial areas, suggesting that vehicle emission was a major source in those areas. The ratios of VOCs to NO 2 for each of the land-use types were in the order of I (10. 2) > C (8. 7) > G (3. 9) > R (3. 6), suggesting that most areas in South Korea were likely to be VOC-limited for ozone chemistry. The pollutants (NO 2, SO 2, CO, and PMPM 10 except for O 3 have decreased, most likely due to the effective government control.

40|$|Clean air is {{essential}} to our own health {{and that of the}} environment. Si nce the industrial revolution, the quality of the air we breathe has det eriorated considerably for some chemical species (e. g. ozone (O 3) and pa rticulate matter (PM)), which can lead to serious health problems. One t he one hand, this is caused by a change in human activities, characteriz ed by e. g. rising industrial and energy production, the burning of fossi l fuels and especially a dramatic rise in traffic. On the other hand, th e effect of a changing climate itself has the potential to increase aver age ambient concentrations and the frequency of pollution episodes. At p resent, levels of PM and the <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutant</b> O 3 continue to exce ed the thresholds set by the European Air Quality Directives, albeit var ious mitigation strategies are introduced since the late 70 s to reduce (precursor) emissions. In this respect, most of the European emission red uction strategies do not take into account a change in climate condition s. As in the future O 3 and PM are likely to remain of concern, this doct oral research aims to estimate the effect of future climate change on O 3 (and PM) concentrations, assuming that future emissions remain at the p resent-day level. This research develops a statistical downscaling method as a combination of two key techniques: 1) the objective Lamb circulation pattern classification describing the large-s cale synoptic conditions and 2) a linear multiple regression analyses, r elating surface meteorology to ozone concentrations. First, the circulat ion technique based on sea level pressure data describes for a given day the location of the high and low-pressure centres. After the classifica tion, all members of each circulation-type class are ascribed to a linea r regression equation, this for each season separately, taking into acco unt a range of meteorological surface variables for a rural mid-la titude site in the Netherlands. The combination of the Lamb circulation pattern approach prior to a multiple linear regression is a new approach in the statistical downscaling community and analyses have shown to sig nificantly improve the observed O 3 non-linear characteristics. On the ot her hand, our research shows that PM 10 is less influenced by the conside red meteorological variables. Therefore, this technique is only applied on future climate scenarios for ozone. The application of this technique on various climate change scenarios fr om a single global climate model shows an overall increase of maximum 8 hourly mean O 3 concentration with 2. 5 to 6. 5 and 6. 1 to 10. 9 µg/m³, for the 2051 - 2060 and 2091 - 2100 period respectively, against the presen t-day 10 -year average of 55. 2 µg/m³. This increase is even stronger when considering the summer season only. An increase in maximum temperature and shortwave radiation, associated with a decrease in cloud cover under the various future scenario assumptions are the main drivers of ozone increase. In order to verify whether thes e findings are physically plausible, our results are compared with the o bserved heat wave in August 2003, characterized by a poor air quality (especially in terms of O 3) and excess of mortalities in large parts of Western and Central Eur ope. Here, the observed O 3 concentration during August 2003 exceeded the European Air Quality Guidelines in Cabauw for 9 days, which lies in the upper range of our estimated number of exceedences for the 2050 s and corresponds closely to the mean number of exceedences by the e nd of this century (9. 7 days month- 1). This is confirmed by the exceptio nal warm and dry weather during August 2003, which characteristics correspon ds to the climate change scenarios {{by the end of this}} century.

40|$|The {{nature of}} two summertime {{photooxidant}} pollution episodes over Paris is investigated {{by means of}} adjoint modeling. The first episode (July 12, 1994) is characteristic of a 'local production' episode, while the second (August 12, 1997) is mostly due to advection into the urban area of high concentrations of ozone. We calculate the sensitivities to emissions of individual primary species and to reaction rate coefficients using the adjoint of a simplified multibox model representing the urban and suburban {{areas of the city}} of Paris. Sensitivity to emissions demonstrates that the first episode is essentially sensitive to volatile organic compounds (VOC) /NOx emissions, while the second is sensitive to NOx emissions. These results also point out the two important emission activity categories: traffic and solvent use, the second one being more sensitive than the first one.

Results of simulations, conducted over south-eastern France between 7 and 15 August 2003, show that the reduction of the NO 2 and O 3 photolysis rates, due to the aerosols solar extinction, decreases the mean daytime surface concentrations of ozone (0. 5 - 4 %) and secondary aerosols (7 - 10 % for sulphates and 4 - 6 % for secondary organics), especially under the internal mixing assumption...|$|R

The diurnal cycle of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutants</b> is currently missing from the data provided by the current generation of atmospheric chemistry satellites which provide only one measurement per day. Often peak surface ozone mixing ratios are reached much earlier in the day during major regional pollution episodes than during local episodes due to downward mixing of ozone that had been transported above the boundary layer overnight. The regional air quality models often do not simulate this downward mixing well enough and underestimate surface ozone in regional episodes. Having high time-resolution geostationary data will make it possible to determine the magnitude of this lower-and mid-tropospheric transport that contributes to peak eight-hour average ozone and 24 -hour average PM 2. 5 concentrations.

The yearly mean concentration of PAN was 0. 84 ppbv, with the daily mean concentration exceeding 5 ppbv in 32 of the total observation days. Calculations indicate that among the measured NMHC species, alkenes accounted for 53 % of the total NMHC contribution to the PAN production, with aromatics and alkanes accounting for about 11 and 7 % of the total, respectively. During the period of our observation only a modest correlation was found between the concentrations of PAN and O 3 for daytime hours, and observed PAN concentrations were relatively high even though the observed NMHCs/NO x ratio was low.

For this, the concentration and size distribution of submicron aerosol particles, along with the concentration of trace gases and meteorological variables, were studied over the central (Santorini) and southern Aegean Sea (Finokalia, Crete) from 15 to 28 July 2013, a period that includes Etesian events and moderate northern surface winds. Particle nucleation bursts were recorded during the Etesian flow at both stations, with those observed at Santorini reaching up to 1. 5  [*]×[*]  10 4  particles cm − 3; the fraction of nucleation-mode particles over Crete was relatively diminished, but a higher number of Aitken-mode particles were observed {{as a result of}} aging. Aerosol and <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutants</b> covaried throughout the measurement period; lower concentrations were observed during the period of Etesian flow (e. g., 43 – 70  ppbv for ozone and 1. 5 – 5. 7  µg m − 3 for sulfate) but were substantially enhanced during the period of moderate surface winds (i. e., increase of up to 32 for ozone and 140  % for sulfate). We find that NPF can double CCN number (at 0. 1  % supersaturation), but the resulting strong competition for water vapor in cloudy updrafts decreases maximum supersaturation by 14  % and augments the potential droplet number only by 12  %. Therefore, although NPF events may strongly elevate CCN numbers, the relative impacts on cloud droplet number (compared to pre-event levels) is eventually limited by water vapor availability and depends on the prevailing cloud formation dynamics and the aerosol levels associated with the background of the region...|$|R
40|$|The Attica Peninsula has {{experienced}} the {{rapid expansion of}} the Athens urban area, prior to the Athens 2004 Olympics. As a result, the distribution of pollutant sources and emission patterns has changed with a subsequent effect on the distribution of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutants</b> and aerosols. The purpose of the present work is to perform a comparative study of the land use changes in the rapidly developing Attica Peninsula including the Greater Athens Area (GAA) before and after 2004, the year that the Olympic Games took place, {{as well as of the}} effect of these changes on the respective pollutant distribution profiles. The land use data were provided by USGS Global Land Use/Land Cover version 2. 0 Database and the updating process was fulfilled with the help of a satellite image. The area was divided into cells using a spatial resolution of 5 x 5 km 2. Results showed that the urban grid has expanded considerably the past fifteen years while a great shift of population has been made to the eastern area of Attica. Also, new towns were created while others expanded and many factories moved out of the center of the city of Athens. Moreover, the forest land has decreased considerably in the Attica Peninsula either by continuous and extended fires or by the residential burst. The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) was used in order to estimate O 3 distribution during a recorded pollution episode. Results revealed that land use changes affected slightly the O 3 concentrations and the development of a new emission inventory related to the new LULC field is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{impacts on}} human health can be direct or indirect. Direct impacts include {{variations}} in physical comfort, heat and cold stress, frostbite and – specifically in response to stratospheric ozone depletion – sunburn, sunstroke, skin cancer and (possibly) cataracts. Direct impacts also include death and injury from floods, storms and other extremes of weather. <b>Photochemical</b> air <b>pollutant</b> levels and pollen levels are affected by climate and have been related to asthma, other respiratory problems, and allergies. Through its influence on biological disease agents, climate variability has {{a major impact on}} infectious disease emergence and re-emergence, by affecting pathogen maturation and vector reproduction and altering host and vector habitats. Climate change is also predicted to alter regional agricultural yields, with downturns most likely in low-latitude countries where food insecurity often pre-exist...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{ionization}} mass spectra {{have been}} recorded {{for a number of}} artists' colorants that fade rapidly when exposed to atmospheric levels of ozone and other <b>photochemical</b> air <b>pollutants.</b> These colorants include the natural colorant curcumin, several indigos and a number of alizarin derivatives. Also included are isatins, which are produced in the fading of indigo colorants by atmospheric pollutants. The protonated molecular ion MH (M = compound mol. wt.) was the most abundant peak in the methane chemical ionization spectra of most of the artists' colorants studied. Other peaks that are of important diagnostic value are discussed for each category of colorant. Examples of applications are included and illustrate the usefulness of chemical ionization mass spectrometry in assessing air pollutant-induced damage to paintings and other colorant-containing objects of artistic and historical value...|$|R
40|$|Time series {{regression}} models are especially suitable in epidemiology for evaluating short-term effects of time-varying exposures on health. The {{problem is that}} potential for confounding in time series regression is very high. Thus, {{it is important that}} trend and seasonality are properly accounted for. Our paper reviews the statistical models commonly used in time-series regression methods, specially allowing for serial correlation, make them potentially useful for selected epidemiological purposes. In particular, we discuss the use of time-series regression for counts using a wide range Generalised Linear Models as well as Generalised Additive Models. In addition, recently critical points in using statistical software for GAM were stressed, and reanalyses of time series data on air pollution and health were performed in order to update already published. Applications are offered through an example on the relationship between asthma emergency admissions and <b>photochemical</b> air <b>pollutant...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{photochemical}} {{trajectory model}} (PTM), {{coupled with the}} Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) describing the degradation of 139 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the troposphere, was developed and used {{for the first time}} to simulate the formation of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutants</b> at Wangqingsha (WQS), Guangzhou during photochemical pollution episodes between 12 and 17 November, 2007. The simulated diurnal variations and mixing ratios of ozone were in good agreement with observed data (R 2 = 0. 80, P< 0. 05), indicating that the photochemical trajectory model - an integration of boundary layer trajectories, precursor emissions and chemical processing - provides a reasonable description of ozone formation in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Calculated photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) indices for the region indicated that alkanes and oxygenated organic compounds had relatively low reactivity, while alkenes and aromatics presented high reactivity, as seen in other airsheds in Europe. Analysis of the emission inventory found that the sum of 60 of the 139 VOC species accounted for 92 % of the total POCP-weighted emission. The 60 VOC species include C 2 -C 6 alkenes, C 6 -C 8 aromatics, biogenic VOCs, and so on. The results indicated that regional scale ozone formation in the PRD region can be mainly attributed to a relatively small number of VOC species, namely isoprene, ethene, m-xylene, and toluene, etc. A further investigation of the relative contribution of the main emission source categories to ozone formation suggested that mobile sources were the largest contributor to regional O 3 formation (40 %), followed by biogenic sources (29 %), VOC product-related sources (23 %), industry (6 %), biomass burning (1 %), and power plants (1 %). The findings obtained in this study would advance our knowledge of air quality in the PRD region, and provide useful information to local government on effective control of photochemical smog in the region.

40|$|Air quality models used {{to predict}} the {{distribution}} and magnitude of <b>photochemical</b> smog <b>pollutant</b> concentrations require accurate input of meteorological and chemical components. The output from these models {{is strongly dependent on}} the accuracy of the horizontal and vertical structure of the wind field data used. In the Sydney region, surface air quality and meteorological data are available from several monitoring stations. Upper air data are available from the Bureau of Meteorology, obtained at Sydney Airport using a radiosonde system. This paper describes one selected high ozone day in the Sydney Basin and discusses the performance of meteorological models used to reproduce the atmospheric conditions important in predicting pollutant concentrations. The comparison was carried out between the observed data from Mascot and those predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology’s Limited Area Prediction System (LAPS) and The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) of CSIRO. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Photochemical {{pollution}} is formed {{due to the}} chemical reactions of atmospheric NOx, volatile organic compounds, CO, and CH 4 {{in the presence of}} sunlight. It is a complex, non-linear process influenced by several parameters which change spatially and temporally. Ozone, which is the most common photochemical, damages human health, ecosystems, and man-made materials. It also contributes to climate change. Traditional life cycle impact assessment methodologies have used aggregated impact factors for a country or even for a continent, neglecting these variations. This research assesses the geographical and temporal variability in the characterization factors for emissions of NOx and VOC over the continental US by developing monthly state-level factors. A photochemical air quality modeling system (CAMx-MM 5 -SMOKE) is used to simulate the process of formation, transformation, transport, and removal of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Characterization factors are calculated at three levels along the cause-effect chain, namely, fate level, human and ecosystem exposure level, and human effect level. The results indicate that a spatial variability of one order of magnitude and a temporal variability of two orders of magnitude exist in both the fate level and human exposure and effect level characterization factors for NOx. The highest temporal variation in the characterization factors for NOx is seen in the Northeastern US. The summer time characterization factors for NOx are higher than the winter time factors. However, for anthropogenic VOC, the summer time factors are lower than the winter time in almost half of the states. The ecosystem exposure factors for NOx and VOC do not follow a regular pattern and show a spatial variation of about three orders of magnitude. The fate, human exposure, and human effect level factors correlate well as all three are dependent on the atmospheric concentration of ozone. However, they are poorly correlated with the ecosystem exposure factors. Sensitivity analysis of the characterization factors for meteorology and emissions inputs shows variation between negative 90 % and positive 180 %. This is still lower than the spatial and temporal variations. A life cycle assessment case study is included to illustrate the use of the disaggregated characterization factors...|$|R
