40|$|Blends of {{different}} PTFE fine powder resins {{have been prepared}} and extruded in an attempt of improving the PTFE <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> process and/or the extrudates. The extrusion pressure and the mechanical properties of the extrudates were found to fall between those exhibited by the pure components. While this is an expectable behavior, it offers opportunities for controlling the degree of fibrillation needed in the final products by mixing highly fibrillated with low fibrillated PTFE resins. Boron nitride and organically modified montmorillonite clays (solid lubricants) are also tested as additives to the lubricants used in the PTFE <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{in order to identify}} enhanced processing aids. It was found that the addition of boron nitride and clays increase the extrusion pressure {{but at the same time}} improve the mechanical properties of the final extrudates in most cases. This again offers possibilities for controlling the final mechanical properties by controlling the degree of fibrillation, i. e., by adding a small amount of solid lubricants to adjust pressure, fibrillation, and thus the final mechanical properties. Finally, it is shown that fibrillation depends on temperature. Moreover, the mechanical properties of extrudates increase as the temperature goes through its two transition temperatures of 19 °C and 30 °C that render PTFE particles more deformable and prone to fibrillation. © Hanser Publishers...|$|E

40|$|Conference paper {{given at}} the 32 nd International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies (NIP). Materials and {{processes}} for additive layer manufacture have advanced considerably {{in the last few}} years and have moved the application of the technology away from prototyping to fabrication and manufacture. One area that still has little effective presence is that of 3 D printed ceramics. Ceramic materials have proved difficult to integrate with 3 D printing technologies and there is still a considerable way to go before the characteristics of most of these materials can be considered adequate. The problems experienced are high firing contractions, low density and strength, and potential incompatibility with glazes. For general tableware and giftware ceramics two main methods of 3 D printing are used; <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> through a syringe and fine nozzle, and a powder binder system that inkjets binder onto a powder bed containing a mix of ceramic powder and an organic binder. The <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> system has the advantage that conventional ceramic pastes and bodies can be used but the layer thickness is coarse and there can be problems with maintaining an even extrusion of a thin bead. The main issue with this method however is the restriction on geometric freedom that cannot compete with other 3 D printing methods. The powder/binder process gives the ability to form complex shapes, but has an inherent high porosity due to the burn out of organic binders and the restriction on particle size required for the process to function correctly. The manufacture of high performance monolithic ceramics such as alumina and zirconia is achieved by using photo cure resins with a high loading of ceramic material, this requires a thermal de-bonding process that results in a very high firing shrinkage that can effect the dimensional stability in the firing/sintering. The reasons for wanting to use ceramic materials are to utilise their unique properties but the limitations of the available processes make these properties difficult to realise by current additive manufacturing methods. This paper reviews and compares contemporary ceramic additive manufacturing processes and explains why the above issues exist and explores potential solutions. Researchers at the Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England in Bristol have a history of over eight years of research into 3 D printed ceramics and have developed and patented materials and processes in this area. They have collaborated with leading ceramic manufacturers and material suppliers in the UK to improve and refine the process. Ongoing research into this area at the University of the West of England is exploring potential solutions to these issues including; hybrid extrusion/machining for <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> ceramics, colloidal infiltration of preformed powder/binder, and 3 D printed and novel methods of pre-processing ceramic powders used in powder/binding 3 D printing to increase the density and fired performance of the ceramic material...|$|E

40|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} {{cementitious composites}} (SFRCC) manufactured by the extrusion technique exhibit {{significant improvements in}} physical, mechanical and durable properties {{as compared with the}} fiber-reinforced cementitious composites made by traditional manufacturing techniques. The constitutive properties of the fresh SFRCC <b>pastes</b> for <b>extrusion,</b> as well as their interactions with the walls of extrusion equipments, are very important for enabling a successive and successful extrusion process. However, very few researches have been done in these areas. Till now, no proper experimental method is available for calibrating the constitutive behavior of the fresh SFRCC <b>pastes</b> for <b>extrusion</b> and no reliable constitutive model has been developed for such pastes. Moreover, numerical simulation, optimization and control of various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes are still challenging. In the present study, first, various promising rheology and plasticity methods, including ram extrusion, orifice extrusion, capillary extrusion and upsetting, have been examined to investigate constitutive characteristics of the fresh SFRCC <b>pastes</b> for <b>extrusion.</b> In these experimental works, the traditional ram extrusion and orifice extrusion theories have been further developed and the capillary extrusion theory has been modified by taking the rate and the slip effects. The upsetting theory has been corrected to include the effects of boundary friction and strain rate. It has been found that the fresh SFRCC pastes show pseudo-plasticity and significant strain rate hardening behavior. Only by combing rheology and plasticity methods could it give a full description of the constitutive behavior of such pastes. Second, based on experimental and theoretical investigations, an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model has been proposed for the fresh SFRCC paste, which considers the von Mises yield criterion, the associated flow rule and nonlinear isotropic strain rate-hardening. The model is formulated by introducing a strain rate-dependent yield function. The associated material parameters in the proposed constitutive model could be identified from material tests without the help of numerical methods. These parameters have been determined for the fresh SFRCC <b>paste</b> for <b>extrusion</b> in this study. Third, the proposed elasto-viscoplasticy constitutive model has been formulated in a computational form and implemented into the explicit finite element code ANSYS/LS-DYNA for simulation purposes. Various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes, including upsetting and ram extrusion, have been simulated using the ANSYS/LS-DYNA FE package, combined with the calibrated constitutive model and the established boundary conditions. The finite element simulation results, with respect to the forming load versus imposed deformation data, agree well with the pertinent experimental results, which verify the reliability of the proposed constitutive model, boundary interaction description and numerical procedures. The predicted material flow behavior, in light of displacement fields and distributions of some internal state variables, also gives promising interpretations of various forming processes. The present study provides an appropriate method to link materials science and engineering.

40|$|A {{constitutive}} {{rheological equation}} is {{proposed for the}} <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) {{that takes into account}} the continuous change of the microstructure during flow, through fibril formation. The mechanism of fibrillation is captured through a microscopic model for a structural parameter, ξ. This model essentially represents a balance of fibrillated and unfibrillated domains in the PTFE paste through a first-order kinetic differential equation. The rate of fibril formation is assumed to be a function of the strain rate and a flow type parameter, which describes the relative strength of straining and rotation in mixed type flows. The proposed constitutive equation consists of shear-thinning and shear-thickening terms, the relative contribution of the two being a function of ξ.

40|$|Cationic starch ethers {{prepared}} by the chemical reaction of starch with a quaternary ammonium reagent are commercially important derivatives. Cationic potato starch derivatives were produced under pilot-scale conditions, employing four different principles. Wet cationisation {{was carried out by}} the slurry and paste processes, in which the cationic reagent and catalyst are added to the starch. Besides being {{prepared by}} these more commonly used processes, cationic starches were also produced by dry cationisation and by adding the cationic reagent during extrusion of starch. The cationic reagent used was 2, 3 epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. Derivatives with three graded degrees of substitution (DS) between 0. 03 and 0. 12 were prepared by each process. The physical properties of the derivatives were analysed by the following methods: polarised light microscopy, X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility and swelling behaviour, and High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (HPSEC-MALLS). The degree of substitution was determined by high resolution C- 13 -NMR spectroscopy after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The properties of the cationic starch derivatives were highly dependent on the derivatisation method. The granular structure of the starch was not visibly affected by the slurry process. Products from the semi-dry reaction showed some granular damage, which was particularly evident after suspension of the granules in water. In the <b>paste</b> and <b>extrusion</b> processes, the starch granules were completely destroyed. Swelling temperatures and enthalpies can be determined only for starch derivatives that still retain a granular structure. As a result, samples from the <b>paste</b> and <b>extrusion</b> reactions exhibited no swelling endotherm in DSC. The samples from the slurry process showed a shift in the swelling temperature range towards lower temperature and a decrease in swelling enthalpy both as compared to native potato starch and also with increasing DS. Similar behaviour was found for the samples from the semi-dry process. The swelling temperature region was comparable to that of the slurry samples for the same DS but the swelling enthalpy was distinctly lower, indicating that the granular structure of the starch was altered far more by the semi-dry than the slurry process. Swelling in excess water and solubility were affected primarily by the cationisation process, while the influence of DS was of minor importance. The extrusion products had pronounced cold-water solubility, the semi-dry products showed increasing told-water solubility with increasing DS, the paste products were highly swollen in cold water and the slurry products were insoluble in cold water. All products were soluble in hot water but the state of dissolution was different. The molar mass distributions of the samples were determined after dissolution by pressure cooking. The different derivatisation methods resulted in characteristic molar mass distributions.

We set a method designed to evaluate phase separation, usually occurring during <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion,</b> which is quantitative, reliable, and discriminating and points out the determining role of cogrinding to limit filter-pressing. We show that solid phase co-grinding leads to synergistic positive effects on cement injectability, mechanical properties, and radio-opacity. It allows maintaining a low (< 0. 4 kg) and constant load during the extrusion of paste, and the paste’s composition remains constant and close to that of the initial paste. Analogous behavior was observed when adding a third component into the solid phase, especially SrCO 3 as a contrasting agent. Moreover, the cement’s mechanical properties can be enhanced by lowering the L/S ratio because of the lower plastic limit. Finally, unloaded or Sr-loaded cements show uniform and increased optical density because of the enhanced homogeneity of dry component distribution. Interestingly, this study reveals that cogrinding improves and controls essential cement properties and involves processing parameters that could be easily scaled up.

Strength was shown to outperform several existing cellular metals by as much as an order of magnitude in some instances. Energy absorption of these materials was shown to exceed 150 J/cc at strains of 50 % for high strength alloys. Finally, the suitability of LCAs as an energetic capsule was investigated. The investigation found that the LCAs added significant static strength and as much as three to five times improvement in the dynamic strength of the system. More importantly, it was shown that the pressures achieved with the LCA capsule were significantly higher than the energetic material could achieve alone. High pressures, approaching 3 GPa, coupled with the fragmentation of the capsule during impact increased the likelihood of initiation and propagation of the energetic reaction. This multi-functional aspect of the LCA makes it a suitable capsule material. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Joe K. Cochran, Jr.; Committee Member: Dr. David L. McDowell; Committee Member: Dr. K. J.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this work is the preparation of ceramic supports and membranes for microfiltration application. The supports were prepared by using clay and calcium carbonate mixtures as starting materials. The choice of these raw materials is based on their natural abundance. These powders were mixed with certain organic additives to obtain a conveyable <b>paste</b> ready for <b>extrusion</b> in order to fabricate a porous tubular configuration with highly uniform porous structure. Microfiltration zirconia membranes were deposited on the tubular supports, using slip-casting process. It {{was found that the}} average pore size of the membrane and its thickness were about 0. 16 μm and 25 μm, respectively. Moreover, the fabricated membrane was tested with distilled water with cross-flow microfiltration process. Results showed a good retention of turbidity, conductivity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in permeate...|$|R
40|$|Robocasting is a 3 D {{printing}} technique {{that may be}} able to achieve the much-coveted goal of reliable, complex ceramic parts with low porosity and high strength. In this work a robust hydrogel formulation was optimised for use as the <b>extrusion</b> <b>paste</b> for robocasting. The paste’s rheological properties were characterised and the printing process was optimised with the aim of attaining dense monolithic ceramic parts. The pastes exhibit a characteristic shear thinning behaviour with yield stresses that can reach values above 1 kPa and depend mostly on their solid content and the particle size distribution. It is possible to formulate printable Al 2 O 3 and SiC inks with solid contents as high as 40 vol% that reached densities up to 95 th% for SiC and 97 th% for Al 2 O 3 with flexural strengths of 300 MPa and 230 MPa respectively after sintering. The sources of strength limiting defects are identified and related to the printing process...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of carbon}} dioxide on hydrotalcite-like compounds was investigated. Two different powdered hydrotalcites were used containing the cations nickel and iron. The powdered materials were screened for carbon dioxide adsorption using a thermogravimetric method and {{it was found that}} NiMgAl (Sample 1) hydrotalcite has the largest capacity for CO 2, adsorbing 1. 58 mmol g− 1 at 20 °C, and highest rate of adsorption of up to 0. 17 mmol g− 1 min− 1. This represented an increase of 53 % in adsorption capacity, compared with NiMgAlFe (Sample 2). In order to improve the rheological behaviour of hydrotalcite <b>paste</b> for <b>extrusion,</b> hydrotalcite powders were combined with boehmite alumina (70 : 30 and 50 : 50 ratios of hydrotalcite:boehmite) before extrusion into pellets suitable for use in a fixed bed adsorber. These pellets were then re-crushed and further tested by thermogravimetric methods. The effects of temperature, composition and pre-treatment of the hydrotalcites on the adsorption {{of carbon dioxide}} and nitrogen are reported. At 20 °C, the amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed was between 2. 0 and 2. 5 mmol g− 1 for all the hydrotalcite/alumina samples in this study, although this decayed rapidly with increasing temperature. The results are compared with silica gel as a common sorbent reference, and with literature values. Hydrotalcite/alumina samples have thermal stability and a high adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide over a wide range of temperatures. The composition of the hydrotalcite/alumina pellets investigated in this study has less effect upon the adsorption behaviour compared with the non-calcined hydrotalcite powder, thus allowing a wide choice of pellet compositions to be used...|$|R
40|$|NanoDynamics Inc. has {{undertaken}} {{a study to}} develop and demonstrate an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell capable of generating a minimum of 20 W per cell on hydrogen. The cell technology will also be assed for operation on renewable hydrocarbon-based fuels such as biomass gas, as well its applicability for larger-scale power production. The project was divided into five sub-tasks, {{the first of which}} was the development and refinement of the cell manufacturing processes of gel-casting and <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> for the fabrication of planar and tubular anode supports. These methods exhibited high production yields with excellent reproducibility. Using a conventional YSZ-based cell as a performance benchmark, new materials-sets and cell configurations were developed. Three prototype configurations were implemented, the best generating an average of 10 W per cell, and exhibiting excellent potential for further development and scale-up. Using a variety of techniques such as modifying the materials-set, microstructure, and cell configuration, cells with an average power output of 22. 7 W were demonstrated, 13. 5 % in excess of the 20 W project goal. Thermal cycling was performed on such cells, and it was found that over a regime of 150 cycles (approximately 300 h), the cell power increased by 1. 8 %. So-called “short-stacks” comprised of up to 6 cells were fabricated to study the feasibility of further stack scale-up. Such a 6 -cell short-stacks operated on dry hydrogen exhibited power outputs of 80 W, a 6. 4 % power increase from their constituent cells, showing that the cells had excellent potential for further scale-up. Optimized Rev A cells were built into a 3 -cell stack, and found to produce 63. 42 W operating on hydrogen, and 58. 18 W on methane. The feasibility of a biogas-fed SOFC was also investigated. Utilizing in-house developed catalysts, methane conversion and hydrogen yield was found to be 98 and 42 %, respectively. By incorporating this catalyst material into prototype Rev A cells, long-term stability tests showed that for over 200 h of operation, the cell power increased by approximately 10 %. It can be concluded that the technology developed by NanoDynamics during this project exceeded the project goal of 20 W/cell by 13. 5 %, and exhibits excellent potential for further development and scale-up...|$|E
40|$|A {{suspension}} is a fully {{saturated mixture}} of discrete solid particles and interstitial liquid. Examples of suspensions include pastes, slurries, cement, food-spreads, drilling fluids and some geophysical flows. The present work focusses on granular (as opposed to colloidal) suspensions, which we define {{as those for}} which the thermal motion of the solid particles is negligible. Despite such ubiquity in industry and nature, {{our understanding of the}} mechanical properties of suspensions lags behind that of their constituent solid and liquids. In this thesis, the discrete element method is used to simulate suspension flow in shear, capillary and constriction geometries, mapping and characterising the fundamental flow, or rheological, regimes. As a starting point (Chapter 2), we consider an established regime map for dry granular materials, appropriate for flows of sand, grains and dry debris. Taking guidance from shear flow simulations that consider the lubricating effect of an interstitial liquid, we recast the regime map for a general suspension, elucidating flows comparable to the dry material or to a viscous liquid, dependent on the shear rate, liquid viscosity and particle stiffness. We give an account of the microstructural traits associated with each regime. Motivated by recent groundbreaking theoretical, computational and experimental work, we incorporate the emerging picture of frictional shear thickening into our regime map (Chapter 3). Our shear flow simulations capture the shear thickening behaviour and demonstrate that it may, in principle, occur in any of the identified flow regimes. Our simulations of time-dependent shear flows (Chapter 4), specifically flow reversal, provide a detailed micro-mechanical explanation of a longstanding and previously unexplained experimental finding, guiding future experimentalists in decomposing the particle and liquid contributions to the viscosity of any suspension. Indeed, the findings have already been exploited in the devising of an experimental protocol that has successfully proven the dominance of particle contacts in driving shear thickening. We next consider suspension flow in a microchannel (Chapter 5), finding that the identified shear flow regimes are locally applicable to flows in complex geometries under inhomogeneous stress conditions only when the local mean shear rate exceeds temporal velocity fluctuations. A more comprehensive description is therefore required to fully characterise the flow behaviour in this geometry. Finally (Chapter 6), we simulate pressure driven suspension flow through a constriction geometry, observing highly inhomogeneous stress distributions and velocity profiles. The roles of particle and fluid properties are considered {{in the context of an}} industrial <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion</b> process...|$|E
40|$|Biomedical Tissue Engineering, Biomaterials, and Medical Devices Poster SessionBioactive {{glasses are}} {{promising}} materials for bone scaffolds {{due to their}} ability to assist in tissue regeneration. When implanted in vivo, bioactive glasses can convert to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral constituent of human bone and form a strong bond with the surrounding tissues, providing an advantage over polymer scaffold materials. Bone scaffold fabrication using additive manufacturing (solid freeform fabrication) methods provides control over design and fabrication of pores in the scaffold. 13 - 93 bioglass (manufactured by Mo-Sci Corporation), a third-generation bioactive and resorbable material designed to accelerate the body's natural ability to heal itself, was used in the research described herein to fabricate bone scaffolds using two different additive manufacturing methods - Selective Laser Sintering and Freeze Extrusion Fabrication. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a process where a laser light is controlled to selectively sinter the particles in a powder bed layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part based on a CAD model. The SLS machine used in this research was a DTM Sinterstation 2000. 13 - 93 bioglass mixed with stearic acid (as the polymer binder) by ball milling was used as the powder feedstock for the SLS machine. The fabricated green scaffolds underwent binder burnout to remove the stearic acid binder and then sintered at temperatures between 6500 C and 7000 C. After sintering, the scaffolds were mechanically tested, achieving a maximum compressive strength of 16 MPa for scaffolds with 60 % apparent porosity. Bioactivity results showed the ability of the SLS scaffolds to support the growth of osteoblastic cells. Scanning electron microsocopy analysis and MTT formazan formation measurements provided evidence that the bioglass scaffolds fabricated by the SLS process offer a surface capable of supporting robust cell growth. Freeze Extrusion Fabrication (FEF) is a process where an aqueous-based glass paste is extruded and deposited layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part in a sub-freezing temperature environment. The FEF system, developed at Missouri S&T, consists of a 3 -axis positioning system, a ram extruder for <b>paste</b> <b>extrusion,</b> and position and force sensors for measurement and control. Bioglass slurry was prepared by ball milling 13 - 93 bioglass particles along with a dispersant (surfynol) and a binder (aquazol). Further, a lubricant (PEG- 400) was added to the paste to aid in extrusion. The bioglass slurry was then heated to obtain bioglass paste. Scaffolds with varying pore sizes from 300 μm to 800 μm were successfully fabricated using the FEF process. Post processing of green scaffolds, including binder burnout and sintering, is currently being performed. Scaffolds produced by the FEF process will be evaluated and compared with the scaffolds obtained using the SLS process...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been the {{extrusion}} of powder Fe 2 O 3 /SBA- 15 catalyst {{in order to be}} successfully used in continuous catalytic fixed bed reactors as Fenton-like catalyst. The extrusion method was optimised using an amorphous silica material of similar properties than the Fe 2 O 3 /SBA- 15 catalyst. The main studied variable was the composition of the <b>extrusion</b> <b>paste</b> using bentonite and methylcellulose as inorganic and organic binders, respectively. The organic content displayed a significant influence on the mechanical strength and specific surface area of the final extrudates. In contrast, the inorganic binder content hardly affected the final properties (in the studied range). The extruded Fe 2 O 3 /SBA- 15 material showed a remarkable mechanical strength as well as the typical mesoporous structure of Fe 2 O 3 /SBA- 15 with a relevant specific surface area (264 m 2 /g). The extruded catalyst achieved a high catalytic performance in the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of phenol with a 60 % of total organic carbon reduction in both batch and continuous processes...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{fabrication}} tools, specifically {{additive manufacturing}} systems, have consistently advanced in efficiencies such as print speed, gantry size, material cost {{and ease of}} use. However most of these systems remain limited {{in their ability to}} enable automated mixing and extrusion of multiple materials with variable properties on large scales. This thesis focuses on the first steps of realizing this enabling technology by operating across two distinct trajectories. The first aims at digitally controlling precision path placement of material with high levels of tunability through analog mixing, while the second explores do-it-yourself tool customization, compactness, portability and the possibility of fabrication node-to-node communication. Inspired by the silkworm's ability to spin highly sophisticated and tunable material architectures, the aim of this thesis is to develop an enabling technology for digital fabrication requiring high levels of material tunability in product and architectural scales. Specifically, I designed, developed, built and evaluated an array of six unique customizable and compact deposition heads for tunable material properties. Amongst those tools is a freeform extrusion head for tunable geometry without the need for auxiliary support structure; a fast thread deposition head and a fiber winding head for tunable compressive and tensile strength respectively; a portable cable-suspended <b>paste</b> droplet <b>extrusion</b> head for tunable drop size of paste material; and a chitosan gel extrusion head for tunable plasticity using biomaterials. Operating across the two trajectories of tunability and portability, this thesis argues that highly tunable, compact and portable extrusion heads developed within a Fab Lab environment can support variable property printing of one or more materials outside of commercial based systems. This capability will in the future enable the digital fabrication of larger-scale prototypes, sustainable products and architectural structures inspired by nature in Fab Lab settings. by Jared Smith Laucks.

40|$|AbstractAlbendazole (ABZ), a broad-spectrum {{anthelmintic}} agent, {{is poorly}} absorbed after oral administration {{due to its}} low aqueous solubility. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve albendazole dissolution rate by formulating avicel pellets loaded with 10 % w/w drug using extrusion/spheronization technique. In addition the wet masses were characterized by mix torque rheometry (MTR) prior to pelletization process. Different additives (i. e., lactose, Tween 80 and low molecular weight chitosan) were formulated with avicel to enhance the dissolution rate of ABZ from the produced pellets. Moreover, mix torque rheometer was used to quantitatively determine the suitable moisture content in the <b>pastes</b> before the <b>extrusion</b> process. The produced pellets were characterized for their ABZ content, particle size, particle shape, dissolution profile and thermal behaviors. The maximum consistencies (the peak torques) of the wet granules were obtained using 0. 667 – 1. 333 ml/g of water or water containing surfactant. Also, the produced pellets have size range from 1036 to 1246 μm. The calculated drug RDR 30 for 10 %, 30 % and 50 % lactose concentrations were 1. 08, 1. 08 and 2. 03, respectively, while that calculated for 10 %, 30 % and 50 % w/w chitosan concentrations were 1. 71, 3. 62 and 3. 62, respectively. The results revealed also that increasing the weight ratio of lactose and chitosan was accompanied by a significant reduction of the peak torque magnitude and this was accompanied by an enhanced ABZ dissolution rate...|$|R
