40|$|Digital Terrain Models are plying an {{important}} role as information layer, mainly {{with the development of}} geographic information systems, since they describe the topographic surface of the terrain and hence it constitutes a valuable support for the study of variety of geographical and environmental events. With the advent of digital techniques and the advantages they are offering in terms of automation and precision, users are adopting image matching techniques to derive automatically Digital Terrain Models. The quality of these DTM are determined by different factors (<b>photo</b> <b>scale,</b> scanning resolution and software parameterization). This paper is a contribution to evaluate the influence of some of some factors on the final accuracy of DTM derived by correlation. In this respect, different tests were carried out on two photo scales (1 / 7500 an 1 / 20000) flown on varying topography. The photos were scanned to 20, 25, 32 and 42 microns pixel sizes and digital terrain models were derived using ViruoZo software from Supresoft. The assessment of the derived DTMs quality was based on qualitative (visual comparisons of contours) and quantitative (RMS computed from residuals on ground check points) criteria. Results showed that, in rugged terrain, DTM derived from 1 / 20000 photos are accurate to 32 cm, which may enable deriving contours with 1 m interval. The introduction of break lines prior to the correlation seems to have less influence on the accuracy of derived DTM when the generated grid is very dense, but contributes to reduce the editing burden. The high accuracy of automatically derived DTM may contribute to make less tight the map to <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> ratio. For instance mapping at 1 / 5000 from 1 / 20000 photos can preserve the height accuracy, while with conventional methods, height accuracy at 1 / 5000 map scale is preserved usually for mapping from 1 / 12000. 1...|$|E

40|$|The Satellite {{image map}} of the Northern Foothills and the Inexpressible Island area is at a scale of 1 : 50, 000. The map details an area of coastal hills on the northwestern side of Terra Nova Bay (northern Victoria Land, East Antarctica), that lies to the East of the Browning Pass and the Nansen Ice Sheet and forms a peninsular {{continuation}} of the Deep Freeze Range. Mount Abbott (1, 016 m a. s. l.) is the highest point in the Northern Foothills. The map covers an area of approximately 850 km 2, from 163 ° 33 ’ 10 ” E, 74 ° 33 ’ 47 ” S to 164 ° 15 ’ 10 ”, E 74 ° 57 ’ 59 ” S. The Italian base “Terra Nova Bay” is situated along the northern coast of the Northern Foothills (164 ° 07 ’ 23 ” E, 74 ° 41 ’ 42 ” S), on a peninsula lying in a South-North direction to the East of Tethys Bay. The map has {{been made by the}} digital integration of a SPOT 1 XS Multi-spectral image mosaic and stereo-compilation reduction of U. S. Navy aerial photographs Trimetrogon Antarctica (TMA). The satellite image mosaic used for the map has been constructed from the digital data of two multi-spectral images, recorded on December 19, 1988, by the French Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) Système Probatoire Pour l’Observation de la Terre satellite (SPOT) 1. Contour lines and spot elevations have been constructed from the photogrammetric processing of 28 black and white TMA vertical aerial photographs, acquired on January 10, 1957 (TMA 365; <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> 1 : 25, 000), November 6, 1985 (TMA 2851 and 2852; <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> 1 : 50, 000) and November 23, 1993 (TMA 3036; <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> 1 : 50, 000). The satellite image was printed in false colour, assigning red to band 3, green to band 2 and blue to band 1. The albedo of snow, firn and ice generally decreases, going from the visible wavelengths to those of near infrared. This spectral response is shown in the satellite image in false colour. It enables glacial areas where snow accumulation occurs (white in the image), to be differentiated from ablation areas that are composed of ice (blue in the image) and from rock and deposit outcrops (dark brown in the image). Cartographic editing included the drawing of: contour lines at 50 m intervals (blue in the glacial area and brown elsewhere); 30 m elevation contours; bathymetric contours (every 50 m) re-drawn from I. I. Marina (2000); over-snow routes; the location of relative elevations and photogrammetric elevations; construction and human activity (building, aircraft runway, radio mast, aerodrome, automatic weather station, historic monument) and Adélie penguin rookeries.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the ongoing climate change will have a strong influence on the Earth’s vegetation and cause the advancement of treelines towards the poles and up to higher elevations. In the Swedish mountains, changes in the positions of alpine treelines have already been reported, and major changes due to changing climate are predicted for the near future. Remote sensing techniques have considerable potential to improve the monitoring of spatially complex treeline ecotones, which are likely to show site dependent responses to changing climate. Aerial photos provide the longest temporal record of remote sensing data for studying the historical treeline changes. High spatial resolution {{and the possibility of}} interpreting photos in three-dimensions are the main strengths of aerial photos. The National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden (NILS) is a nationwide environmental monitoring program, which provides sampling infrastructure for monitoring treelines over the Swedish mountains using high spatial resolution remote sensing data. The aim of this project was to study the feasibility of visual interpretation of aerial photos for monitoring changes in treeline ecotones (transition zones between closed forest and treeless alpine vegetation). More specifically, our aim was to compare possible methods for change detection using recent and historical aerial photos, and to demonstrate a method that is applicable to the Swedish mountains using the NILS sampling infrastructure. We also wanted to evaluate how the technical properties of the aerial photos, particularly the <b>photo</b> <b>scale,</b> affect the change detection. The results were used for evaluating the potential and costs for a more comprehensive change detection study including a greater number of NILS squares. We compared interpretation methods in three 5 × 5 km NILS squares and studied in total six 5 × 5 km NILS squares for changes. Colour infrared aerial photos from two points in time (1975 – 1980 and 2002 – 2004) were used. The evaluation of the technical properties of aerial photos is important as the recent photos have been taken from a height of 4600 m (<b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> approximately 1 : 30, 000) and the historical photos from 9200 m (1 : 60, 000). The difference in <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> could introduce significant errors to the change detection. Therefore the effect of <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> was studied in two experiments in a separate study site, which had been photographed within a few days from both flying heights. We assessed three visual interpretation methods: complete cover mapping (polygon interpretation), sample plot method and transect method. To avoid recording false changes and to minimize the effect of different photo scales, we interpreted the recent and historical photos at the same time using scanned photos and digital photogrammetric workstations. The first method, polygon interpretation, was tested by comparing the current NILS interpretations for the central 1 × 1 km square within the 5 × 5 km NILS squares with the historical photos, and updating polygon borders and attributes if changes were observed. In the second method the vegetation variables were interpreted for circular sample plots (20 m radius). We used digital land cover data and GIS techniques for defining a buffer zone between the forest and the treeless alpine areas in order to focus the interpretation efforts on the treeline ecotone. The distance between the systematically sampled plots was 250 m within the treeline buffer. In the third method the variables were interpreted along subjectively selected transects across the altitudinal treeline transitions. Transects were also used for interpreting individual trees within the treeline, of which some were measured in the field. Based on the analyses we can recommend the sample plot method for interpreting tree cover changes within 5 × 5 km NILS squares. The main advantage with the method is that it can be applied to any NILS square overlapping the treeline ecotone, and that the sampling can be done objectively. A treeline buffer zone based on digital land cover data provides one possible method for pre-stratification. Delineation of polygon borders is not needed and small sized sample plots are easier to interpret concerning vegetation changes than larger polygons. This is particularly the case when changes are small. The polygon interpretation using change control mapping can also be a cost-effective method for change detection within the 1 × 1 km squares. The greatest advantage is that in addition to tree cover changes, it can provide information on the spatial patterns (landscape structure). However, the small changes in the borders are subjective and difficult to interpret. The transect method can also provide characterization of treelines, particularly in relation to elevation, but the selection of transects within NILS squares can be difficult. Furthermore, the result cannot be generalised to larger areas similar to the method based on probability sampling. We conclude that only tree cover changes can be interpreted with sufficient accuracy, because of the relatively small scale historical photos. Larger scale photos and more extensive field control would be necessary to interpret changes in small trees and shrubs. The experiments with <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> show that the greatest source of uncertainty is related to the different <b>photo</b> <b>scale</b> of the recent and historical photos. The comparison of two independent interpretations made at different scales would lead to detection of substantial false changes, particularly if interpretations would be made by different interpreters. However, we think that concurrent comparison of digital aerial photos from two points in time provides meaningful change detection for tree cover although some errors due to scale effects should be expected. The interpretation of six NILS squares by the sample plot method suggests that tree cover has increased within the treeline ecotone in three of the squares. The results demonstrate the potential of visual interpretation of aerial photos for treeline change detection. The information on tree cover changes could supplement field based monitoring of treeline elevations. Therefore, we consider that there is potential for a more comprehensive study to examine tree cover changes in a greater number of NILS squares in the Swedish mountains. Then, however, more emphasis should be given to the panchromatic black and white photos from the 1960 s, which have been taken from approximately the same flying height (4600 m) as the most recent CIR photos. We estimate that a large scale study, involving the interpretation of approximately 50 – 60 NILS squares for three points in time would require a budget of about 1 million SEK. Airborne laser scanning and larger scale aerial photos are potential data sources for monitoring future changes in treeline ecotones. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mapping {{today is}} a data {{acquisition}} for Geo Information Systems (GIS). Maps are just one form of {{the output of the}} geoinformation. Geoinformation are important as basic information for any planning purpose, nevertheless the term mapping is used for such data acquisition. Without such information no modern administration of a country is possible. In several developing countries no actual geoinformation and no regular update exists. Classical, the data acquisition is based on aerial images, but not in all countries photo flight equipment is available and foreign photo flight companies can enter some countries only with extreme bureaucratic effort, causing a delay of photo flights and raising the price. The problem of control point determination for mapping purposes today is solved by GPS-positioning, which can be improved by world wide satellite reference systems like Omnistar to absolute accuracy up to 30 cm.

For a comparison of cameras not only the nominal number of pixels is important, also the image quality has an influence. The effective resolution, respecting the image quality, can be determined by edge analysis. A sudden change of the brightness in the object space is causing a continuous change of the gray values in a profile across the edge. A differentiation of the gray value profile lead to the point spread function, including the information of effective resolution. DMC, UltraCamD and UltraCamX-images as well as analog aerial photos have been investigated. Of course the effective resolution is depending upon the illumination condition, expressed by the sun elevation, and the atmospheric condition.

Image interpretation was also done to identify morphological, structural and processes. The Sant'Arcangelo region is composed of 4 cycles both marine and continental in origin, all deposited on different environments: The Caliandro, Agri, San Lorenzo and Sauro cycles. The study area consists of Sauro and San Lorenzo Cycle. Sauro Cycle is Comprises of three heterotrophic units deposited in sintectonic discordance over the Agri cycle. San Lorenzo Cycle lying in unconformity over the precedent cycles is consisting of three units, namely conglomerates on the base part as well as on the top part of the sequence, and silty clays in the intermediate part. They form a syncline structure which ax has a NW-SE direction. The main structural features are represented by the San Lorenzo syncline and the Alianello fault. The San Lorenzo area has three principal origins: alluvial, denudation, and structural. Due to the geological-tectonic complexity, the structural landform is normally found as structural denudational landform. San Lorenzo area comprises of 41 landform units, namely 3 units of alluvial landforni, 26 units of denudational landform and 11 units of structural denudational landform...|$|E

2500|$|Although for {{a number}} of years the photo was {{considered}} evidence of the monster, sceptics dismissed it as driftwood, an elephant, an otter, or a bird. The <b>photo's</b> <b>scale</b> was controversial; it is often shown cropped (making the creature seem large and the ripples like waves), while the uncropped shot shows the other end of the loch and the monster in the centre. The ripples in the photo were found to fit the size and pattern of small ripples, unlike large waves photographed up close. Analysis of the original image fostered further doubt. In 1993, the makers of the Discovery Communications documentary Loch Ness Discovered analysed the uncropped image and found a white object visible in every version of the photo (implying that it was on the negative). It was believed to be the cause of the ripples, as if the object was being towed, although the possibility of a blemish on the negative could not be ruled out. An analysis of the full photograph indicated that the object was small, about [...] long.|$|R
