Further papers on Celtic, Greek, and medieval coins, also on archæology, mythology, and the history of art, appeared chiefly in the publications of the Munich Academy. He also drew up a <b>Promemoria</b> that is preserved among the records of the royal cabinet of coins, as to the expenses and the plan of a monumental work covering the entire field of Greek numismatics that was to take the place of the old work by Eckhel and be about one-half larger. Streber was also prominent in politics as a strong supporter of the ecclesiastico-conservative party. He founded the association for a constitutional monarchy and religious freedom, and wrote many political memorials at its request. He died in Munich.|$|E

He also fostered religious associations, {{and put an end}} to the intrigues of the Rongeaner, although important business detained him for the most part in Vienna. He attended the episcopal assembly which inaugurated the ecclesiastical revival in Austria; between 29 April and 20 June 1849, twenty-five bishops and four episcopal proxies held sixty sessions. The last in order of consecration, Rauscher took the most prominent part in the transactions. He laid before the assembly a <b>promemoria,</b> which served as the programme of the business, and drafted five of the seven memorials addressed to the Ministry of the Interior. He also drew up the decrees to serve for the bishops [...] "as the common rule of their aim and activity". The pastoral of the bishops to the clergy was also composed by him. Before the bishops separated, they chose a committee of five members for the settlement of the memorials and the arrangement of all current affairs. As the reporter of this committee, he acted at times as its sole agent.|$|E

För ett antal år sedan uppmärksammade Skatteverket ett förfarande där internationella koncernbolag utnyttjade den fria avdragsrätten i ett skatteplanerings hänse- ende. Höga vinster i svenska bolag flyttades genom höga räntor på interna lån till bolag i lågbeskattade länder. Efter ledande praxis visade det sig att möjligheten till att angripa för- farandet genom lag saknades och Skatteverkets kartläggning visade att ränteavdrag av skat- teplaneringsskäl utnyttjades i hög utsträckning, uppmärksammades behovet av lagstiftning på området. I syfte att förhindra förfarandet, som givits smeknamnet räntesnurror, infördes lagstiftning gällande ränteavdragsbegränsningar år 2009. Skatteverkets fortsatta kartläggningar tyder på att det trots införandet av lagstiftningen finns betydande möjligheter för bolag att undgå bolagsbeskattning i Sverige. Lagens ut- formning har oönskade effekter, den är oförutsebar och miljardtals kronor försvinner från den svenska skattebasen årligen. I mars 2012 lade finansdepartementet fram ett förslag till effektivare ränteavdragsbegränsningar. Syftet med denna uppsats är att analysera lagförsla- get i finansdepartementets nya <b>promemoria</b> gällande effektivare ränteavdragsbegränsningar utifrån ändamålet om att förhindra skatteplanering jämfört med dagens lagstiftning. Efter en granskning av förslaget och den kritik det bemött jämfört med dagens lagstiftning fram- {{kommer att}} förslaget bättre uppfyller statens mål om att förhindra skatteplanering. Ur ett bolagsperspektiv förefaller förslaget dock utöka oförutsebarheten och vara något väl om- fattande. Slutsatsen är att förslaget bättre uppfyller målet om att förhindra skatteplanering genom ränteavdrag men att det bör bearbetas för att inte missgynna näringslivet.   The general {{principal}} within Swedish tax law is that interest expenses are deductible on in- come derived from business. A procedure, where international corporate groups abused {{the right of}} interest deduction {{in order to accomplish}} tax avoidance, was discovered a few years ago. High profits in Swedish companies were moved to companies in tax havens through high interest rates. After established practice showed that there lacked a possibility of preventing these procedures and the Swedish Tax authority discovered the extent of which they were used the need of extended regulations for interest deductions became clear. In order to prevent these procedures, new rules regarding interest deduction were laid down in law during year 2009. The tax authority’s researches showed that even though new regulations had been laid down there still existed a substantial possibility for companies to avoid tax in Sweden. The regulations today have an undesirable effect, are unpredictable and allow billions of kroner to disappear from the Swedish tax base each year. In March 2012 the ministry of finance presented a proposal for more effective regulations on interest deduction. The objective this thesis is to analyse the proposed regulations in comparison to current legislation in the light of preventing tax avoidance. After a review of the proposal and the criticism it has re- ceived, compared to the current legislation, it appears that the proposed regulations better can accomplish the states goal of preventing tax avoidance. However when the new regula- tions are seen through a company perspective they seem to be too extensive and increase unpredictability. The conclusion is nonetheless that the proposal better fulfils the goal of preventing tax avoidance through interest deduction, however it is in need of some changes in order to not disbenefit the industrial economy. ...|$|E
