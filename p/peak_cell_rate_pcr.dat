These provide a conformance definition, using {{a form of}} the leaky bucket algorithm called the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA), which specifies how cells are checked for conformance with a cell rate, or its reciprocal emission interval, and jitter tolerance: either a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) for testing conformance to the <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>PCR)</b> or a Burst Tolerance or Maximum Burst Size (MBS) for testing conformance to the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR).|$|E
50|$|Burst {{transmission}} or burstiness, i.e. transmitting a {{burst of}} traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower rate transmission, may {{also be seen as}} a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts is commonly seen a desirable feature, e.g. in variable bitrate transmissions. Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC), as implemented in ATM networks, allows both a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) on the <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>PCR)</b> at which the bursts are transmitted.|$|E

The amount of bandwidth {{is characterized by a}} <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>PCR).</b> These applications include services such as video conferencing, telephony (voice services) or any type of on-demand service, such as interactive voice and audio.

50|$|A burst or {{clump of}} packets can {{arrive at a}} higher rate than {{determined}} by the emission interval T. This may be the line rate of the physical layer connection when the packets in the burst will arrive back-to-back. However, as in ATM, the tolerance may be applied to a lower rate, in that case the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), and the burst of packets (cells) can arrive {{at a higher rate}}, but less than the line rate of the physical layer, in that case the <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>PCR).</b> The MBS may then be the number of cells needed to transport a higher layer packet (see segmentation and reassembly), where the packets are transmitted with a maximum bandwidth determined by the SCR and cells within the packets are transmitted at the PCR; thus allowing the last cell of the packet, and the packet itself, to arrive significantly earlier than it would if the cells were sent at the SCR: transmission duration = (MBS-1)/PCR rather than (MBS-1)/SCR. This bursting at the PCR puts a significantly higher load on shared resources, e.g. switch output buffers, than does transmission at the SCR, and is thus more likely to result in buffer overflows and network congestion. However, it puts a lesser load on these resources than would transmitting at the SCR with a limit value, τSCR, that allows MBS cells to be transmitted and arrive back-to-back at the line rate.|$|E
