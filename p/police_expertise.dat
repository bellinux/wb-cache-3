50|$|Just a {{few days}} after the crime, the police arrested the perpetrators, and during the early {{investigation}} they admitted to the liquidation and described it in detail. However, these confessions were made without the presence of their lawyers. This major procedural error meant that there were no legal witnesses of executions.

On 9 July 1992, the County Court in Zagreb again rendered a not-guilty verdict. The Croatian judicial system was criticized for this.

In Part III, I argue that courts can play a limited role in improving expert forensic evidence by excluding the worst evidence in each area. I believe that to date they have not done so consistently in part because the forensic community has made it difficult to easily distinguish between better and worse testimony. I propose some steps that could be taken to make such distinctions more transparent.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} role of {{academic}} education in police professionalisation. Due to its high complexity, specialisation and status, detective work is well-suited for illustrating these developments and the practical and symbolic benefits they can bring {{to the police and}} policing as a whole. The overall approach of thesis is iterative. Literature from police studies and sociology of professions provides the conceptual and theoretical framework for the empirical data of 24 semi-structured interviews conducted with 14 police national training coordinators and local police trainers. The increasing academisation of police training and the formalisation of the police-academia relationships suggest police professionalisation has reached a tipping point. This is seen in the current investigative skills training in England and Wales, which is characterised by growing centralisation, standardisation, and emphasis on formalising the professional knowledgebase of investigations and policing – a trend which the Professionalising Investigation Programme exemplifies. While the police (including the investigative specialism) can be shown to display many of the qualities of professions, it has lacked the level of instructional abstraction characterising other professions, typically provided by higher education and, crucially, leading to externally recognised qualifications. Developing academic police education is not without its challenges, chief among them the perceived epistemological and cultural divide between the ‘two worlds’ of police and academia. A successful transformation requires careful consideration of the content and format of the arrangements, investment, support, acceptance and engagement from police, academia and government, and a simultaneous change to cultural dispositions (habitus) and internal and external structures (field). This is worth the effort as a number of practical and symbolic benefits of police academic education can be identified. It has the potential {{to improve the quality of}} service by deepening police knowledge and understanding and facilitating community-oriented approaches. More importantly, academic education bestows a rich cultural capital, strengthens and legitimises <b>police</b> <b>expertise,</b> market monopoly, and status in the eyes of the public, other professions and the government. It enables the survival of the profession, giving it the tools to prevail in conflicts over competence and the right to define and interpret policing and its social context. In summary, police professionalisation via academic education can be explained in terms of agency and structure both; as a deliberate occupational upgrading spurred by social and economic aspirations and aimed to reconceptualise and relegitimise policing; and as an inevitable reaction to wider changes and a deeper ontological shift taking place in the society...|$|E
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19 th century {{increasing}} attention was devoted to food adulteration in several European countries and in the USA. National and local rules were adopted and their enforcement raised several problems. To start with, who was most qualified to lead with expertise on food and drink: scientists or food professionals? And which kind of expertise was superior: organoleptic or standardised “scientific” analysis? In turn these questions are related to the institutional framework in which the laboratories acted. Administrative, <b>police</b> <b>expertise</b> was quite different from judicial expertise, and there were fundamental tensions between local (municipal) and central authorities. In order to explore these questions we will compare the situation of laboratories in Paris and London. Common issues will be identified, mostly based on the increasing use of scientific arguments and tools in public debate. In France, the creation of municipal laboratories in the first years of the Third Republic was a major step in allotting responsibility for the sanitary management of food markets. Through a study of unexplored archives, the birth and activity of these laboratories is revealed, in particular of the Paris laboratory, which was the first (1878) and, without any doubt, the most important and controversial. We ask whether this institution was primarily intended to serve traders (for example, wine retail merchants who were suspicious of the composition of the product they bought from wholesalers), consumers (complaining about retailers), or local authorities (the prefecture, the municipality in their campaign against adulterated products) ? We also question whether it was supposed to protect public health (and thus the consumer) or to regulate competition (and, thus, the relationship between traders) ? In England and Wales the official government laboratory was in London, operated by the Inland Revenue in Somerset House, and designated by the 1875 Sale of Food and Drugs Act. It acted as a chemical Court of Appeal and sat in judgment on the efforts of local authority analysts. Like in France, there was fierce contestation about methods and standards but there was a difference here in that the expertise of the government scientists was regularly called into question by the Society of Public Analysts and by the press. The editor of Food and Sanitation, for instance, praised the approach adopted in Paris but was bitterly critical of Somerset House. In 1894 he spoke of the “wretched, ignorant, and utterly untrustworthy system of food analysis at Somerset House”. It was a “poor, bungling department struggling to perform work for which it has not got the skill or knowledge”. In his opinion, “scientifically the Somerset House chemists are dead, and there exists no shadow of an excuse for their remaining unburied. ” In order to provide a basis for comparison, we will address three points. First, we explore the designation of experts, the nature of their methods, and the imprimatur of their pronouncements. On the one hand, traders considered themselves as the best qualified people to judge product quality; for example, wine merchants in France stressed that only they had the required know-how to conclude that a wine has been falsified or not. In contrast, the municipal administration and a part of public opinion were rather favourable to a recourse to scientists, whose methods were presented as “objective”. As such, the organoleptic analysis of traders stood against scientific chemical expertise. Second, to these conflicts between traders and scientists, we must add the question of disputes between the State and the municipalities. Because different municipal laboratories used different methods of analysis, the question arose of how to prevent meat that had, for instance, been rejected in Lyon or Liverpool being accepted in Paris or Portsmouth. The French response was to establish an official list of the methods of analysis valid for all municipal laboratories. This was first tried in the 1880 s by establishing a national committee of control. However, the results were extremely poor. In 1907, after twenty years of debate, a National Service of Fraud Repression was started. By the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, a municipal laboratory could act as an adjunct but only by special permission of the Minister. Such strong centralization reversed previous policies: municipalities lost any control over the quality of food products. This was accompanied by a standardization of the methods of analysis. Several decrees fixed in detail the methods and the instruments of analysis. In Britain the system remained devolved and it was a combination of vigorous scientific communication about methodologies and a series of court cases that provided the basis for greater standardization. Third, we will argue that laboratory organization was important. The most extreme example is the investment in commercial laboratories undertaken by the large dairy companies that emerged in the late nineteenth century and completely overshadowed the efforts of the central and local state on milk analysis. It was these ‘industrial' laboratories who led the debate on compositional standards, particularly in Britain, and their scientific expertise held such weight that it influenced government policy and helped define what were to be considered ‘natural' percentages of fat in milk. Overall, our paper indicates that comparative histories of laboratory expertise are valuable in understanding the evolution of food standards, with important additional perspectives on the development or organic chemistry and of the application of the law to issues concerning the ‘natural'...|$|E

40|$|As firms {{increase}} {{their efforts to}} engage customers, researchers have responded by incorporating customer engagement (CE) in their work (Brodie et al. 2011, Vivek, Beatty and Morgan 2012). Following the conceptualizations of engagement in existing literature, this research focused on developing a multi-faceted scale of customer engagement. The applicability of the scale is then studied across contexts. CE scale is applicable to various contexts where there occurs, or is likely to occur, a service relationship between a focal object or agent and the subject. Such relationships have been the focus during initial development of the scale. However, our exploratory work also indicated that CE might be applicable to not only the typical business-customer relationships, but also to various other types of service relationships. These include (i) compliance based relationships such as employer-employee, government-citizens and; (ii) expertise based relationships such as attorney-petitioner and teacher-student relationships.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the emergent {{role of the}} Scottish Police Authority (SPA) in delivering organisational accountability of the Police Service of Scotland, following reform in 2012. The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 amalgamated the eight local police forces into a single force, ‘Police Scotland’, and replaced the concomitant local police authorities, responsible for maintaining and governing those forces, into a national governing body: the SPA. The study draws on {{a broad range of}} qualitative data that includes official policy documents, selected minutes of public meetings held by the Justice Committee, and the SPA, inspection reports by HMICS and Audit Scotland, and interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders including a former Minister, senior police officers, members of the SPA, and MSPs. This study chronicles the inception and early development of the SPA, and critically assesses the SPA’s emergent accountability processes in relation to the perennial problems of police governance. Firstly, the doctrine of operational independence of chief constables, rooted in the traditional, and to-date “sacrosanct”, notion of constabulary independence (Reiner, 2013 : 169), makes organisational accountability of the police a complicated and contested matter (Lustgarten, 1986; Walker, 2000; Donnelly and Scott, 2002 a; Jones, 2008; Reiner, 2010). Secondly, there is a perpetual debate about whether the governance of police should be situated within local government structures, or delivered through central government. There is consensus among policing scholars that the persistent trend towards greater centralisation, coupled with the operational independence doctrine, curtailed the performance of the local police boards and their ability to hold chief constables to account (Walker, 2000; Donnelly and Scott, 2002 a; Scott, 2011; Reiner, 2013). Amidst the tussle between central and local political actors for democratic control of the police, the recent policy discourse in Scotland, that led to the reforms and the creation of the SPA, has highlighted that the governance of the <b>police</b> requires <b>expertise,</b> skills and capacities, which the previous local police authorities lacked (Tomkins, 2009; Laing and Fossey, 2011). In light of the persistent difficulties of democratic governance, and the creation of the SPA as an expert body, the study presents an original conceptual framework outlining an ‘epistocratic and deliberative’ approach to police governance. The framework seeks to reconcile democracy and expertise and offers a prescriptive solution to resolve the underlying problems of police governance. The study applies the notion of epistocracy or knowledge-based rule (Estlund, 2003, 2008) to the role of experts in institutional settings (Holst, 2012; Holst and Mollander, 2014). Conceiving the SPA as an institutional epistocracy, it is argued that such an arrangement needs to be underpinned by the right Composition, and that it needs Power, and Autonomy in order to function effectively and independently. It is further argued that principles of Deliberation, including reasoning and justification, can further strengthen epistocratic governance arrangements, as well as providing a crucial democratic dimension. The analysis of the SPA provides a strong empirical basis for the framework. The study shows that while the SPA was created as a professional body of experts, it was unable to resolve the underlying problems of police governance in its first three years. This was due to inadequacies in its composition resulting from insufficient expertise and a lack of training for new board members, differing interpretations of its role and statutory powers, and external pressures and impositions resulting in a lack of autonomy. Looking to recent developments, the study suggests that deliberative principles are now implicit in the SPA’s approach to more proactive scrutiny, which has started to serve to alleviate some shortcomings and problems it encountered in its formative years. However, the study concludes that further strengthening of the SPA’s composition, clarity around its role and powers, greater autonomy, and explicit focus on deliberative principles is needed...|$|R
