25|$|The University of Paris {{had fallen}} {{gradually}} in quality and influence since the 17th century. It {{was primarily a}} school of theology, not well adapted to the modern world, and played no {{important role in the}} scientific revolution or the Enlightenment. The school of law taught only religious law, and the medical school had little prestige, since doctors, until the mid-18th century, were considered in the same <b>professional</b> <b>category</b> as barbers. The university shrank from about sixty colleges in the early 17th century to thirty-nine in 1700. In 1763 the twenty-nine smallest colleges were grouped together in the college Louis-le-Grand, but altogether it had only 193 students. On 5 April 1792, without any loud protest, the University was closed. Following its closing, the chapel of the Sorbonne was stripped for its furnishings and the head of its founder, Cardinal Richelieu, was cut out of the famous portrait by Philippe de Champaigne. The building of the College de Cluny on Place Sorbonne was sold; the College de Sens became a boarding house, the College Lemoine was advertised as suitable for shops; the College d'Harcourt was half-demolished and the other half turned into workshops for tanners and locksmiths, and the College Saint-Barbe became a workshop for mechanical engineers. The University was not re-established until 1808, under Napoleon, with the name Université imperial.|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 awards, graphic novel The Sandman issue #19 [...] "A Midsummer's Night Dream", scripted by Neil Gaiman and {{illustrated}} by Charles Vess, won the award for Best Short Story. A common rumor afterwards was that the rules were subsequently changed to prevent another graphic novel from winning. The awards administration later clarified that comics and graphic novels were {{not intended to be}} eligible for that category, which did not require a rule change: [...] "Comics are eligible in the Special Award <b>Professional</b> <b>category.</b> We never made a change in the rules." [...] No person has won or been nominated for the Special Award <b>Professional</b> <b>category</b> for their work on a comic or graphic novel either before or since the controversy.|$|E

2500|$|The NABBP of America was {{initially}} established upon principles of amateurism. However, even early {{in its history}} some star players, such as James Creighton of Excelsior, received compensation, either secretly or indirectly. [...] In 1866, the NABBP investigated Athletic of Philadelphia for paying three players including Lip Pike, but ultimately took no action against either the club or the players. To address this growing practice, and to restore integrity to the game, at its December 1868 meeting the NABBP established a <b>professional</b> <b>category</b> for the 1869 season. Clubs desiring to pay players were now free to declare themselves professional.|$|E
