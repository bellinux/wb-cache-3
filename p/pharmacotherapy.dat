5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotoninâ€“norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of <b>pharmacotherapy</b> for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, <b>pharmacotherapy</b> of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

Objective: To update the systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of herbal medicine for adult asthma. Data Sources: Nine English and Chinese databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, AMED, CBM, CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang). Study Selections: Herbal medicines combined with routine <b>pharmacotherapies</b> {{compared with the same}} <b>pharmacotherapies</b> alone or placebo. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE Summary of Findings tables were used to evaluate methodological quality. Results: Twenty-nine (29) studies involving 3, 001 participants were included. Herbal interventions used multi-ingredients such as licorice root, crow-dipper, astragali, and angelica. Compared with routine <b>pharmacotherapies</b> alone, herbal medicines as add-on therapy improved lung function (FEV 1 : MD 7. 81 %, 95 % CI 5. 79, 9. 83, I 2 = 63 %; PEFR: MD 65. 14 L/min, 95 % CI 58. 87, 71. 41, I 2 = 21 %); asthma control (MD 2. 47 points, 95 % CI 1. 64, 3. 29, I 2 = 55 %); reduced salbutamol usage (MD - 1. 14 puffs/day, 95 % CI - 2. 20, - 0. 09, I 2 = 92 %); and reduced acute asthma exacerbations over one year (MD - 1. 20, 95 % CI - 1. 82, - 0. 58, one study). Compared with placebo plus <b>pharmacotherapies</b> herbal medicines as add-on therapy improved lung function (FEV 1 : MD 15. 83 %, 95 % CI 13. 54, 18. 12 and PEFR: MD 55. 20 L/min, 95 % CI 33. 41, 76. 99). Other outcomes were not reported in these placebo studies. Included studies were low to moderate quality. Adverse events were rare. Conclusions: Herbal medicines combined with routine <b>pharmacotherapies</b> improved asthma outcomes greater than <b>pharmacotherapies</b> alone.

40|$|Objective: Studies using {{augmentation}} of <b>pharmacotherapies</b> with nutraceuticals in {{bipolar disorder}} (BD) {{have been conducted}} and preliminary evidence in many cases appears positive. To date, however, no specialized systematic review of this area has been conducted. We present the first systematic review of clinical trials using nutrient-based nutraceuticals in combination with standard <b>pharmacotherapies</b> to treat BD. A subsequent aim of this report was to discuss posited underlying mechanisms of action. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, and grey literature were searched during mid- 2010 for human clinical trials in English using nutraceuticals such as omega- 3, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), inositol, and vitamins and minerals, in combination with <b>pharmacotherapies</b> to treat bipolar mania and bipolar depression. A review of the results including an effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was subsequently conducted. Results: In treating bipolar depression, positive evidence with large effect sizes were found for NAC (d= 1. 04) and a chelated mineral and vitamin formula (d= 1. 70). On the outcome of bipolar mania, several nutraceuticals reduced mania with strong clinical effects: a chelated mineral formula (d= 0. 83), L-tryptophan (d= 1. 47), magnesium (d= 1. 44), folic acid (d= 0. 40), and branched-chain amino acids (d= 1. 60). Mixed, but mainly positive, evidence was found for omega- 3 for bipolar depression, while no evidentiary support was found for use in mania. No significant effect on BD outcome scales was found for inositol (possibly due to small samples). Conclusions: BD treatment outcomes may potentially be improved by additional use of certain nutraceuticals with conventional <b>pharmacotherapies.</b> However, caution should be extended in interpreting the large effects of several isolated studies, as {{they have not yet}} been replicated in larger trials...|$|R
