40|$|A 5 day old baby, {{with known}} left hydronephrosis which {{discovered}} by prenatal US presented with gastrointestinal tract obstruction. Laboratory work up demonstrated abnormal renal function and metabolic acidosis combined with hyperkalemia. Radiology tests showed bilateral hydronephrosis with huge left renal pelvis crossing the midline and causing deviation of the gut laterally. This acute presentation beside inability to receive oral feeding made us prefer immediate left renal drainage with <b>pyelostomy</b> {{in order to}} restore renal function, relieve the pressure effect of the huge renal pelvis and stabilize the baby. Dismembered pyeloplasty was done at age of 3 months...|$|E
40|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the ileal conduit more than four decades ago, the options for urinary diversion after cystectomy were extremely limited. Direct cutaneous anastomoses of the collecting system (cutaneous <b>pyelostomies,</b> ureterostomies) offered patients a short-term diversion, but the benefits were outweighed by significant complications: recession or stenosis of the stoma. The first choice of diversion was the ureterosigmoidostomy with or without antireflux technique. Then it fell in popularity and was replaced with continent/non-continent uretero-ileo-cutaneous diversions. Only in the last years the continent orthotopic neobladder has been widely employed as first procedure choice. At present, patients can be offered a non-continent cutaneous diversion, a continent cutaneous diversion or an orthotopic neobladder urinary reconstructio...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{contributing}} and predisposing to peritonitis {{were studied}} retrospectively in 83 children treated with continuous ambulatory (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) from 1978 to 1988. Recurrent peritonitis {{was the most}} frequent complication and the major reason for peritoneal dialysis failure. Fifty patients had 171 episodes of peritonitis during the ten years and 33 remained peritonitis-free. The duration of dialysis was significantly shorter in the peritonitis-free group. The incidence of peritonitis was lower with CCPD than with CAPD. Leucopenia was not a predisposing factor nor was blood leucocytosis helpful in diagnosing peritonitis. Serum IgG was low in 33 % of patients with episodes of peritonitis, {{but there was no}} correlation or predictive value in this finding. The C 3 component of complement was relatively lower than the C 4 but both components were usually in the normal range. Serum albumin was low in all patients, but lower in those with peritonitis episodes. Age, sex, primary disease, diapers, <b>pyelostomies,</b> dialysis training, and living conditions were not significantly associated risk factors. Sterile dressings gave no benefit over the shower technique. Patient noncompliance, upper respiratory tract infection, skin infections, and dental treatment were potential risk factors. However, peritonitis seemed to be distributed randomly among the patients. KEY WORDS: Pediatrics; children; predisposing factors; peritonitis; contributing factors...|$|R
40|$|From 1969 to 1990, {{previously}} diverted urinary tracts were 'undiverted' in 177 {{patients whose}} {{ages ranged from}} 1 to 31 years. Fifty-six of the patients (32 %) had been diverted for 10 years or longer. There were 67 female and 110 male patients. Forty-four patients had only one kidney and in two of those patients it was a previous renal transplant. One patient was anephric {{at the time of}} reconstruction, having had two unsuccessful transplants. Most of the diversions had been considered permanent. Types of diversions that were reversed include ileal loop, colon conduit, loop ureterostomy or <b>pyelostomy,</b> end ureterostomy, cystostomy or vesicostomy, long-term nephrostomy, and ureterosigmoidostomy...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of VURD {{syndrome}} in a three day old neonate who was diagnosed with hydronephrosis on a prenatal ultrasound. Severe tortuosity and dilation of the upper urinary tracts {{in the presence of}} progression of hydronephrosis or a persistently elevated creatinine may favor a proximal urinary diversion rather than primary valve ablation or cutaneous vesicostomy. Because of a persistently elevated serum creatinine, a nonfunctioning kidney with grade 4 / 5 vesicoureteral reflux and worsening contralateral hydronephrosis despite lower tract drainage, a left cutaneous <b>pyelostomy</b> was performed, contralateral to the kidney involved with VURD. Postoperatively the serum creatinine stabilized at 1. 0 mg/dl and decreased to 0. 3 mg/dl at one month of age...|$|E

40|$|The Authors {{describe}} {{the purposes of}} ultrasonographic follow-up after both conservative surgery and endoscopic or endourological operations of the upper urinary tract. In these cases ultrasonography evaluates the results of normal surgery, the presence of early or late complications, and of iatrogenic lesions. The echo-patterns of deformations in {{the outline of the}} kidneys, of hematic, urinary or lymphatic collections (both retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal), of fistulas, of sclero-lipomatosis and of post-cicatrization hydronephrosis are described. The importance of evaluating the degree of obstruction by a dynamic ultrasonographic study with furosemide-test is emphasized. The ultrasonographic monitoring of urethral and <b>pyelostomy</b> setting of catheters is also described. The echo-patterns of retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal fluid collections and renal hematomas, in relation also the kind of fluid contained are widely discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cutaneous metastases from {{colorectal}} cancer are uncommon, accounting for 6. 5 % of all secondary skin lesions. They occur in advanced disease. The most common site is the abdomen. The penis {{is a rare}} site. Case Report: We report {{the case of a}} 79 -year-old patient who presented, two years after rectocolectomy for a rectal adenocarcinoma, obstructive renal failure secondary to a presacral recurrence, as well as symptomatic phimosis associated with papulonodules invading the penis, scrotum and pubis. After hemodialysis, percutaneous <b>pyelostomy,</b> and double-J catheter placement, the patient underwent circumcision and a pubic skin biopsy. On histology and immunohistochemistry, a cutaneous metastasis originating from the rectal adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. Conclusions: Penile invasion by {{colorectal cancer}} revealed by phimosis is a rare occurrence but needs to be recognized and promptly diagnosed by biopsy in order to propose appropriate adjuvant therapy. These rare lesions can occur without any liver or lung involvement...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the clinical significance of preinstallation of double-J stent in {{prevention and treatment}} of ureteral injury before and after laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. Methods Data of 124 patients with cervical cancer,who underwent laparoscopic radical hysterectomy in General Hospital of PLA from Jan. 2009 to Jan. 2011,were retrospectively analyzed. Double-J ureteral catheters were installed using cystoscopy before operation in 16 patients,and the catheters were removed 3 months later. Results Ureteral injury occurred in 1 of 16 patients,the catheter was removed 3 months after operation,and the ureter was then naturally repaired. Ureteral injury occurred in 6 of 108 patients,who underwent laparoscopic surgery without preinstallation of 3 stents. The injury was found during operation {{in one of the}} 6 patients,and it was repaired by installation of double-J stent with laparoscopy. The injury was produced by thermal radiation of the instrument in another 5 patients around 10 days after surgery,among them one was repaired by installation of double-J stent with cystoscopy, 2 were repaired through laparoscopy,and another 2 were treated with <b>pyelostomy.</b> Conclusion Preinstallation of double-J stent in laparoscopic radical hysterectomy may prevent ureteral injury in patients undergoing the operation...|$|E
40|$|In vitro at 37 Â°C, {{extracted}} urinary calculi were continuou s ly irrigated at 5 - 10 drops {{per minute}} for 72 hours with 10 % and 15 % renacidin solutions, as control distilled water and titriplex III (E. D. T. A.) solution. The examined calculi weighed every 6 hours. As the result, phosphate and carbonate stones were markedly disolved with renacidin solutions, whereas oxalate and urate obtained no result. 15 % solution was {{about twice as}} effective as 10 %. Four cases with renal stones were treated with the continuous irrigation of 15 % r e nacidin solution at 10 - 40 drops per minute for 82 - 218 hours, one of whom had good result. The huge staghorn calculus was dissolved and reduced to finger-tip and pea in size on radiographic appearance. One patient passed majority of small stones after removal of catheters. One of two failures {{were assigned to the}} unsatisfactory location of <b>pyelostomy</b> tube. In the other, the stone was urate and in vitro insoluble. As undesirable side effects, th r e e cases suffered from febrile attacks, pain and macroscopic hematuria. Only one patient was free from any complications. The fluctuations in serum phosphorus, N. P. N., 'electrolytes and PSP test were observed before, during and after the irrigation. We recognized the moderate elevation of N. P.

40|$|Until {{the recent}} past, {{patients}} born with congenital {{absence of the}} abdominal musculature, and associated deformity of the urinary collecting system, have often had an unhappy life and an early death. Twelve years ago, a treatment protocol was devised in our institution which included the following major steps: 1) bilateral tubeless <b>pyelostomy</b> immediately after birth; 2) serial evaluation of renal status {{during the first year}} of life; 3) laparotomy at one year of age with orchiopexy, reconstruction of the urinary collecting system and reconstruction of the abdominal wall; 4) serial electromyographic evaluation of the growth and development of the lateral abdominal musculature; 5) serial studies of renal function; 6) secondary revision of the abdominal wall and of the urinary drainage system as needed. Nine patients so treated have been followed from the third through the twelfth years of life. All are alive and growing well. Four patients had chronic urinary infection treated with long-term antibiotics; three of these have required a second surgical correction of some aspect of the urinary drainage system. Three patients have required additional surgery on the abdominal wall, but have recaptured enough function so that corsets and other devices have not been necessary. Electromyographic studies show good growth and development of some aspects of the lateral abdominal musculature which has been used in the repair. The outcome in these patients is highly encouraging for this constellation of anomalies. The cause remains controversial...|$|E
40|$|Aztreonam was {{administered}} to 30 patients, ages 0. 03 to 15. 4 years, with severe and in 21 cases complicated urinary tract infections caused {{by members of the}} family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to the study drug in vitro. A mean dose of 47. 7 mg/kg was given intramuscularly every 12 h to 26 patients. In four patients with renal insufficiency, the dose was reduced according to pharmacokinetic data. Permanent urine sterilization and clinical cure were achieved in 22 patients, 13 of whom had urological malformations. In two patients with P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis infections, the treatment failed. Another patient had an Escherichia coli reinfection 21 days after the end of therapy. Four patients with various urological abnormalities had gram-positive superinfections, and two patients had gram-negative superinfections during {{and at the end of}} therapy: all six had indwelling ureteric splints or <b>pyelostomy</b> as predisposing conditions. No adverse clinical effects were observed. Some transient and slight or moderate alterations were observed at the end of treatment: eosinophilia (nine cases), elevation of hepatic enzymes (eight cases), prolongation of prothrombin time (three cases), and neutropenia (one case). A pharmacokinetic study was performed in six patients with normal renal function and in seven patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. The elimination half-life of the drug was inversely correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. At the dosage used, aztreonam proved effective for severe urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} role of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) in the impaired urinary concentrating capacity observed in patients who underwent pyeloplasty because of congenital unilateral hydronephrosis {{as a result of}} pyeloureteral junction disease. Twelve children (mean age, 8 +/- 2 mo) were examined in the study. From day 1 to day 5 after surgery, the urine was collected separately from <b>pyelostomy</b> draining only from the postobstructed kidney and from the bladder catheter draining mostly from the contralateral kidney used as internal control. After pyeloplasty, the postobstructed kidney was characterized by a reduced urinary excretion of AQP 2 (similar to 54 %) associated with polyuria that persisted from day 1 to day 5 (433 +/- 58 versus 310 +/- 74 ml/ 24 It at day 1; 326 +/- 44 versus 227 +/- 26 ml/ 24 h at day 5). In parallel, urine osmolality from the postobstructed kidney was significantly reduced compared with the contralateral kidney (111 +/- 12 versus 206 +/- 49 at day 1; 136 +/- 24 versus 235 +/- 65 mOsm/kg at day 5). Creatinine clearance from the postobstructed kidney was not significantly different compared with the contralateral kidney throughout the 4 d after surgery. However, on day 5, creatinine clearance from the postobstructed kidney became significantly lower. Prostaglandin E 2 in the urine from postobstructed kidneys was found to be twofold higher than in the contralateral samples (26. 0 +/- 6. 7 versus 13. 5 +/- 2. 5 at day 5). It is concluded that (1) the selective downregulation of AQP 2 in postobstructed kidney may account for the higher excretion of hypotonic urine, and (2) the local increase in prostaglandin E 2 synthesis in postobstructed kidney may be involved in AQP 2 downregulation and in maintaining a GFR {{similar to that of the}} contralateral kidney...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the interventional techniques {{in the treatment of}} renal vascular injury. MethodsA total of 16 patients with renal vascular injuries were treated by superselective arterial embolization. The renal injuries resulted from renal biopsy in 7 patients, endovascular intervention in 2, percutaneous puncture and <b>pyelostomy</b> in 2, local resection of renal tumor in 1 and trauma in 4. With regards to clinical manifestations, there was hemorrhagic shock in 8 patients, severe flank pain in 14, and hematuria in 14. CT and ultrasonography confirmed that 15 patients had perirenal hematoma. The embolization was performed with microcoils in 13 and standard stainless steel coils in 3 patients, associated with polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) in 9, and gelfoam particles in 6 cases. ResultsRenal angiogram revealed arteriovenous fistula in renal parenchyma in 9 cases, pseudoaneurysm in 3 and extravasation of contrast media in 4. The arterial embolization was successful in all 16 cases in a single session. The angiography at the end of therapy showed that abnormal vessels had disappeared without other major intrarenal arterial branch occlusion. In 13 patients with hemodynamical compromise, blood loss-related symptoms were immediately relieved after blood transfusion. In 14 patients with severe flank pain, the pain was progressively relieved. Hematuria ceased in 14 patients 2 - 14 days after the embolization procedures. The renal function was impaired after the procedure in 6 cases, in which preoperative renal insufficiency was exacerbated in 3 and developed new renal dysfunction in 3, 2 of whom received hemodialysis. The ultrasonography showed that perirenal hematoma was gradually absorbed within 2 - 6 months after the procedure. All patients were followed up in 6 - 78 months (mean, 48 months). Six patients died of primary diseases (5 cases of renal failure and multiple organ failure and 1 case of malignant tumor). Ten patients survived without bleeding and further intervention. The deterioration of renal function did not occur and the serum creatinine and blood urea were in normal range. ConclusionTranscatheter selective renal arterial embolization is a safe and effective method in the treatment of renal vascular injuries...|$|E
