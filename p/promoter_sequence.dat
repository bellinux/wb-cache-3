25|$|An operon {{contains}} {{one or more}} structural genes {{which are}} generally transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes {{for more than one}} protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be polycistronic, though in practice, it usually is. Upstream of the structural genes lies a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence</b> which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an operator.|$|E

The effects of the network's topology, the extent of training, the number of random sequences in the training set and the effects of different data representations were examined and optimized.

25|$|Salmon {{have been}} genetically {{modified}} in laboratories {{so they can}} grow faster. There is opposition to the commercial use of these fish, and, as of 2006, no approval has been given. A Canadian company, , has developed a modified Atlantic salmon which grows nearly twice as fast (yielding a fully grown fish at 16–18 months rather than 30), and is more disease resistant and cold tolerant. It also requires 10 percent less food. This was achieved using a chinook salmon gene sequence affecting growth hormones, and a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence</b> from the ocean pout affecting antifreeze production. Normally, salmon produce growth hormones only {{in the presence of}} light. The modified salmon doesn't switch growth hormone production off. The company first submitted the salmon for FDA approval in 1996. In 2015, FDA has approved the AquAdvantage Salmon for commercial production. A concern with transgenic salmon is what might happen if they escape into the wild. One study, in a laboratory setting, found that modified salmon mixed with their wild cohorts were aggressive in competing, but ultimately failed.|$|E
500|$|Synthesis of RNA {{is usually}} catalyzed by an enzyme—RNA polymerase—using DNA as a template, {{a process known}} as {{transcription}}. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence</b> in the DNA (usually found [...] "upstream" [...] of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the helicase activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.|$|E
500|$|Flanking {{the open}} reading frame, genes contain a {{regulatory}} sequence {{that is required}} for their expression. First, genes require a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence.</b> The promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. The recognition typically occurs as a consensus sequence like the TATA box. [...] A gene can {{have more than one}} promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNA) that differ in how far they extend in the 5'end. Highly transcribed genes have [...] "strong" [...] promoter sequences that form strong associations with transcription factors, thereby initiating transcription at a high rate. Others genes have [...] "weak" [...] promoters that form weak associations with transcription factors and initiate transcription less frequently. Eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.|$|E

This DNA replacement procedure can potentially be used to generate any sequence alteration within the vaccinia virus genome. Deletion of growth factor <b>promoter</b> <b>sequences</b> resulted in a dramatic reduction in growth factor gene transcription and protein synthesis.

2500|$|The vector {{itself is}} {{generally}} a DNA sequence {{that consists of}} an insert (transgene) and a larger sequence {{that serves as the}} [...] "backbone" [...] of the vector. The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell. All vectors may be used for cloning and are therefore cloning vectors, but there are also vectors designed specially for cloning, while others may be designed specifically for other purposes, such as transcription and protein expression. Vectors designed specifically for the expression of the transgene in the target cell are called expression vectors, and generally have a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence</b> that drives expression of the transgene. [...] Simpler vectors called transcription vectors are only capable of being transcribed but not translated: they can be replicated in a target cell but not expressed, unlike expression vectors.

Monsanto had to seek deregulation to conduct field trials of RRA, because the RRA contains a <b>promoter</b> <b>sequence</b> derived from the plant pathogen figwort mosaic virus. The USDA granted the application for deregulation, stating that the RRA with its modifications: [...] "(1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weedy than the nontransgenic parental line or other cultivated alfalfa; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated or wild species with which it can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to raw or processed agricultural commodities; (5) will not harm threatened or endangered species or organisms that are beneficial to agriculture; and (6) should not reduce the ability to control pests and weeds in alfalfa or other crops."

Despite their importance, the basic characteristics of plant promoters are not well understood. In order to determine <b>sequence</b> diversity within <b>promoter</b> regions, evolutionary divergence of promoters between plant species, and the general structural characteristics of <b>promoter</b> <b>sequences,</b> we downloaded and analyzed 3922 plant <b>promoter</b> <b>sequences</b> {{from a wide range}} of plant species.

Very few transposable elements were detected within the plant promoters. The most common transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motif was AGAGAGAGA, followed by TTAGGGTTT and then GCCGCC. Transcribed gene regions with promoters containing the corresponding TFBSs were predicted to be most commonly involved in metabolic processes, biological regulation, and stimulus response in plants. These results reveal some basic structural characteristics of plant promoters and clarify the evolutionary forces shaping plant promoters.

We have also shown that a DNA fragment containing the 72 bp repeat, inserted directly before chicken conalbumin or adenovirus- 2 major late <b>promoter</b> <b>sequences</b> in chimeric plasmids where these promoters replace that of the SV 40 early genes, caused {{a dramatic increase in}} the expression of T-antigen in vivo.

Insertion of the 72 bp repeat into equivalent plasmids containing no known eukaryotic <b>promoter</b> <b>sequences</b> (plasmids which were not detectably expressed in vivo) gave rise to a measurable, but smaller level of expression. The stimulation of expression by the 72 bp repeat is cis-acting : it required covalent linkage to the recombinant.
