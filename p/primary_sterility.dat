40|$|Background. The polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{the most}} frequent form of endocrine pathology and occurs in 5 – 10 % women of reproductive age and makes up 80 %, and according to some data, even 90 % {{of all forms of}} hyperandrogenism. The information about pathogenesis of PCOS is contradictory. The main step of the SPCO pathogenesis is hyperproduction of LH of by the hypophysis, revealed in 40 – 80 % patients. According to one of numerous theories, an increase secretion results in the increase of LH by the hypothalamus of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GRH), secreted in the discrete mode under control sexual steroid hormones, monoamines and opioid peptides. The aim of the investigation is to study the functional status of hypophysis — gonads axis for women with SPCO. Material and methods. In the department of neuroendocrinology of the Center of Endocrinology of Health Ministry of the Republic of Uzbekistan in a period from September 2015 till July 2016 [*] 120 outpatients of fertile age with PCOS were inspected. Mean age of patients was 25. 5 ± 4. 3 years. The duration of the disease hesitated from 7 months to 9 years. 20 healthy women of corresponding age made a control group. The complex of researches, including clinical, biochemical (glycemia, glucose tolerance test), hormonal (LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrostendion (ДGEA), 17 -oxyprogesterone, аntimuller hormone (АМH), insulin) was performed in all patients, ultrasonic examination of uterus and ovaries (transabdominal and transvaginal) on the 14 th day of cycle with folliculometria in dynamics, and also magnetically-resonant tomography of hypophysis and questionnaire of patients were carried out. Results. Patients were divided into two groups: with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> (94 cases) and with secondary sterility (26 cases). In the first group of patients with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> the reliable decline of both pituitary and ovarian hormones was determined on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia. So, as compared to the group of control on the 14 th day of cycle LH, FSH, and estradiol, progesterone, while free testosterone, DGEA were enhanced as compared to control data. In the second group of patients the reliable decline of pituitary hormones was also educed on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia while an ovarian function was within the normal limits. So, as compared to the group of control on the 14 th day of cycle the LH, FSH, here free testosterone, DGEA and АМH levels were enhanced as compared to control data. The neuroimaging of hypophysis in patients with PCOS educed hyperplasia (adenomatosis) of hypophysis in 49 from 120 (40. 8 %), that can be explained by ovarian insufficiency in these patients. On the second place by incidence there was the syndrome of the empty sella (26 cases, 21. 6 %), and on the third — the microadenoma of hypophysis in 16 persons (13. 3 %). Conclusions. In the first group of patients with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> the reliable decline of both pituitary and ovarian hormones was marked on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia. In the second group of patients the significant decline of pituitary hormones was also educed on a background of hyperanrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia, while an ovarian function was within the normal limits. In both groups of patients hypogonadotropinemia occurred combined with moderate hyperprolactinemia and hyperandrogenemia. Thus, the most expressed violations of the system of pituitary — ovarian function were found out in the first group of patients with PCOS with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> at that the significant decline of the functional status of pituitary — gonads axis was marked, namely decline of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone levels on the 14 th day of menstrual cycle, that was confirmed by ultrasouns examination of uterus and ovaries by impoverishment of follicle vehicle of ovaries, anovulation signs. Thus, the most expressed violations of the system of pituitary-ovarial function were found out in the first group of patients with PCOS with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> at that the significant decline of the functional state of hypophysis-gonads was marked, namely decline of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone levels that was confirmed by ultrasound investigation of uterus and ovaries...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{fecundability}} {{is defined}} as the monthly probability for a conception that leads to a livebirth. One method of assessing effective fecundability is by examining lengths of first birth intervals. Using demographic records of marriage and birth, we examine the effects of maternal age, paternal age, mother’s education, and religion on effective fecundability in a rural region of Bangladesh. Data came from a prospective demographic and health survey conducted in Matlab thana by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Marriage and birth records from 1975 to 1982 were used to generate first birth intervals. A parametric hazards model of fecundability was used to simultaneously estimate <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> effective fecundability as well as effects of fixed and time varying covariates on effective fecundability. Marriage records were matched for 10, 255 pairs of partners, including exact times to birth and observations right censored by death, divorce, migration, or the end of record-keeping. The age range at marriage for wives was 12 and 25 years. The prevalence of <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> was 5. 1 % (± 2. 6 % SE). The estimate of effective fecundability was 0. 053 (± 0. 002). The most parsimonious model showed reduced fecundability for women under 16 years and highest fecundability from 17 to 19 years, relative to the reference age group (20 to 25) years. Fecundability was significantly higher for father’s age 25 to 29 years relative to other ages. Religion and mother’s education were not associated with fecundability. The results suggest that Bangladeshi women have a higher prevalence of sterility and lower effective fecundability compared to other samples in developing settings...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. We {{report a}} rare {{case of a}} {{heterotopic}} abdominal pregnancy with three intrauterine pregnancy, one with a viable fetus, treated successfully by laparoscopy. Methods. A 40 -year-old patient with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> who un- derwent pharmacological ovulation induction, presented abdominal pain in the right iliac region. A trans-vaginal ultrasound showed an image suggestive of ectopic gestation near the right ovary, associated with three intrauterine gestational sacs with only one viable fetus. Basing on this observation, we performed an operative laparoscopy that confirmed {{the presence of a}} right ectopic abdominal pregnancy. Since the right ampullar tubal was ruptured and bleeding, we car- ried out a salpingectomy with complete removal of ectopic abdominal pregnancy. Discussion. After laparoscopic surgery, on postoperative day 1, ultrasonographic examination showed an ongoing intrauterine pre- gnancy with the two empty gestational sacs. Postoperative course was without any complications and the patient was discharged on posto- perative day 3. Gestation went on uneventfully until at term vaginal delivery. Conclusions: Laparoscopic treatment of abdominal pregnancy with an intrauterine viable pregnancy resulted safe for both mother and fetus.

40|$|Background. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) and {{diagnostic}} laparoscopy with chromopertubation are two {{widely used}} diagnosic methods to determine tubal function in infertile women. The diagnostic value of HSG and laparoscopy {{is still a}} matter for much debate. In the retrospective analyses we wanted to evaluate the HSG and laparoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the infertile patients. Materials and methods. Three hundreds and sixty two patients treated at University Department of Obstetry and Gynecology in Ljubljana because of infertility were analysed in the year 2000 and 2001.  Laparoscopy was done in all 362 patients and HSG before the laparoscopy was done in 185 patients.

40|$|The {{demographic}} {{study of}} child supply has long {{concentrated on the}} implications of reproductive excess, rather than a lack of children. In recent years attention to population aging has begun to redress this emphasis, but even in aging research the comparative study of childlessness has a low profile. Data collected as part of anthropological and demographic research on aging in Indonesia are used to question current assumptions and to introduce issues and concepts that shed new light on current levels and experiences of childlessness. In our East Javanese study community 25 percent of the elderly have no living children, and another 15 percent have one child. Provincial and national data indicate that these findings {{are part of a}} wider pattern, corroborated by historical evidence from Indonesia, Europe, and populations elsewhere in the world. Analysis of the East Javanese data shows that childlessness is a composite category. "Demographic childlessness" occurs where a combination of proximate determinants (nuptiality, mortality, <b>primary</b> and pathological <b>sterility)</b> leads to no childbearing and child survival. "De facto childlessness" arises where {{there is a lack of}} support from any children. "Actual childlessness" aggregates demographic and "de facto" childlessness, net of adoption or remarriage where these provide alternative access to children. Analysis also takes into account the practices of patronage, charity, and kin support to assess the implications of childlessness in old age where state support is lacking.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} endometriosis in selected gynaecological conditions requiring surgery. Eligible for the study were women with <b>primary</b> or secondary <b>sterility,</b> chronic pelvic pain, fibroids or benign ovarian cysts requiring laparoscopy or laparotomy consecutively observed {{during the study period}} in 23 obstetrics and gynaecology departments in Italy between May 1991 and July 1992. Women with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis were specifically excluded. A total of 3684 subjects entered the study. Of these, 660 (mean age 31 years) were included for sterility, 409 (mean age 32) for chronic pelvic pain, 1880 (mean age 42) for fibroids and 735 (mean age 33) for benign ovarian cysts. During the surgical procedure surgeons were asked to examine the pelvis carefully to identify endometriosis. Out of the 660 women included for sterility, 195 [30 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 26 - 35] had endometriosis; the corresponding figures were 185 out of 409 (45 %, 95 % CI 39 - 52) for pelvic pain, 219 out of 1880 (12 %, 95 % CI 10 - 14) for fibroids and 257 out of 735 (35 %, 95 % CI 31 - 40) for ovarian cysts; these differences were significant (x(3) (2) heterogeneity, absence versus presence = 323. 9, P < 0. 001). Among women with endometriosis who entered the study for sterility, 51 % were at stage 1, 22 % at stage 2, 20 % at stage 3 and 7 % at stage 4. The corresponding figures for pelvic pain and fibroids were largely similar: 37 %, 24 %, 30 %, 10 % for women with pelvic pain, 36 %, 11 %, 45 % and 8 % for those with fibroids, but among cases with ovarian cysts stage 3 was over-represented (62 % of cases). The most common sites of endometriosis were, in order of frequency, the ovaries considered together, the posterior cul de sac and uterosacral ligaments. Endometriotic implants were more common on the uterosacral ligaments and the posterior cul de sac among women with sterility and pelvic pain than in those with fibroids and ovarian cysts.

To study Dicer function in testis development, we crossed mice carrying a conditional Dicer allele with an AMH-Cre transgenic line, thereby inactivating Dicer in Sertoli cells around embryonic day 14. 0 (E 14. 0). Dicer null Sertoli cells show normal embryonic development, and at postnatal day 0 (P 0), testis tubules are normal in number and histologically undistinguishable from controls. Subsequently, Dicer-mutant testes show a progressively aberrant development, so that at P 6, they contain a reduced number of disorganized testis tubules leading to <b>primary</b> <b>sterility.</b> Apoptosis and prophase I assays reveal a massive wave of apoptosis starting at P 3, causing progressive loss of Sertoli cells, but also of germ cells, resulting in drastically reduced testis size.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia {{has been}} {{described}} as a risk factor for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Increased levels of homocysteine may be due to inadequate dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 and inherited defects within the methionine-homocysteine pathway such as MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. However, the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and sterility problems have been underlined only for recurrent pregnancy loss while a relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and female sterility is still matter of discussion. AIM: This study sought to find out a possible relationship between sterility (<b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> or secondary sterility due to recurrent pregnancy loss) and homocysteine metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 20 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, 20 patients with unexplained female sterility and 20 healthy women as control group. Several whole blood samples were collected by venipuncture. Firstly homocysteinemia and other related variables were tested (i. e. folate and vitamin B 12 levels); thereafter DNA was extracted by a further whole blood sample collected in EDTA in order to screen MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. Statistical analysis was performed by chi square test; differences were considered to be significant if p 15 microM) and MTHFR C 677 T homozigosity have already been described as risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss, few studies evaluated their role in women with unexplained sterility.

Additionally, the luteinizing hormone (LH) /human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptor was isolated by affinity chromatography (wheat germ agglutinin and LH-Sepharose) and also used as an antigen. In 7 of 14 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> and endometriosis a positive reaction was observed. Similarly, 6 of 16 patients with secondary sterility and endometriosis were also positive. Patients being stimulated for in vitro fertilization and presenting either primary or secondary sterility were positive in 5 of 22 and 6 of 16 cases, respectively. In the S 80 test 41 of 60 sera presented IgG 2 antibodies, whereas in the ST 288 test 38 of 60 belonged to the IgG 1 subclass. Kappa and lambda chains were equally distributed. Some patients could recognize the unoccupied LH/hCG receptor as an antigen, while others recognized only the complex formed by the hormone plus the hormone receptor. The S 80 and ST 288 antigens were isolated by affinity chromatography. Gel permeation of the purified antigens revealed in each case the presence of an antigen complex.

40|$|Colposcopy, being {{introduced}} by H. Hinselmann in 1925, has developed chiefly {{in the field}} of early diagnosis of cervical carcinoma, and nowadays it may be said that the use is almost confined to this sole subject. Even in Germany and Australia where colposcopic examination has been accepted as an efficacious diagnostic method and is prevailing in general practice, paper dealing with non-carcinomatous diseases is minimum. Picture seen through colposcope is entirely specific and quite different from that by naked-eye examination, so it is not useless to observe and record the magnified picture of the non-carcinomatous diseases. I tried to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of colposcopy, especially in non-carcinomatous diseases, observing whether any specific finding may be found or not. Method: 550 cases of out-patients of our clinic, from Dec. 1956 to Aug. 1957, were examined through Hinselmann's colposcope of Möller Optical Works of Germany, Colpophotography in selected cases and biopsy to all cases were carried out too, and the colposcopic findings were identified by the histologic findings in every case for the purpose of interpretation of colposcopic picture. Results and Conclusion: 1) At the second healing stage of erosion, R. Meyer claims “overgrowth” and Fischer-Wasels advanced “squamous metaplasia”. I performed serial section biopsy to 9 blocks of specimen removed from the beginning Nabothian follicles and in 4 blocks, overgrowth, and in 1 block, squamous metaplasia were found. From the results obtained, I conclude that Nabothian follicle may be produced by squamous metaplasia as well as by overgrowth. 2) Among the 402 cases of cervical erosion (bleeding group 108 cases and non-bleeding group 294 cases), nearly one half of the bleeding group and 1 / 3 of the non-bleeding group were true erosion. Through the entire cases, the incidenee of misdiagnosis was 1. 6 % (5 cases), but not any specific finding was noted colposcopically. Carcinoma was detected in 10 cases (2. 4 %) of innocent-looking erosion. If the colposcopic examination is performed as a screening test prior to the beginning of erosio-treatment it may be useful to determine more appropriate therapy to every case. 3) Examining 17 functional bleeding cases colposcopically, 6 cases were acknowledged to be functional, considering the manner of bleeding, history and menstrual cycle etc. In some cases of irregular genital bleeding, the site or, although not always, even the cause of bleeding may be clarified easily by colposcopic examination. 4) Colpitis: no specific finding was found colposcopically, but, examining 61 cases, 18 cases proved to be misdiagnosis and even in 1 case, the entity proved to be carcinomatous. 5) In 22 adnexitis cases, 1 cervical tuberculosis case and 23 <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> cases, no pathognomonic finding was found. It must call our attention, however, that in chronic adnexitis and in <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> cases, remnant of inflammatory process was quite common. 6) Observing 28 cases of "Erosio gravidarum", it was noted that the remarkable increase of vaginal discharge during pregnancy was due to the marked proliferation of cervical epithelium (colposcopically; ectopy) and also that, in order to avoid histological misdiagnosis, the case history and clinical findings must be refered to. 7) The green color filter, which has been used to observe the fine structure of small vessels, is useful too in discovery of beginning transition zone. 8) Examining 191 cases of patients with the chief complaint of genital discharge, 118 cases proved to be noninflammatory and 2 cases were suffering from postabortive endometritis. Colposcope is useful to follow-up of healing process of the lower genital lesions, such as cauterization therapy, and it may be accepted widely as an useful instrument in the near future...|$|E

As a result author got the following facts. 1) Recently, most women have become much concerned about sterility. 2) It seems meaningless to infer sterility from menstrual condition. 3) Judging from {{the findings of the}} inner examination, HYPOPLASIA UTERI, the abnormal uterine position and abnormal adnexa are the important sterile factors. Secondarily, author learned these following facts through the hysterosalpingography. 1) In the findings of the hysterography, there are many HYPOPLASIA UTERI and abnormal uterine position, as seen in the findings of the inner examination, and the former is an important factor of the <b>primary</b> <b>sterility.</b> 2) In the findings of the salpingography, there can be fonnd 38 % of closing of Fallopian tubes on both sides, and most of them occur at the AMPULLA TUBAE. This tendency appears in both primary and secondary sterility. 3) The passage of the Fallopian tubes of these patients, having past anamnesises of peritonitis, tuberculosis, and laparotomy operation, is not good and each has the percentage of 88 63, and 44 of closing on both sides. Thirdly, among 461 patients who were given the hysterosalpingography 47 cases (10. 2 %) have got the completion of pregnancy. Through this investigation, author recognized that our hysterosalpingography is not only necessary as a way to seek after the cause of the female sterility, but also effectual for its treatment...|$|E
40|$|ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION “What help {{exists for}} {{potentially}} vulnerable older {{people in the}} developing world? ” tend to presuppose a normative solution: their children. Two demographic generalizations appear to warrant this sup-position. The first is an apparently ample supply of children: {{for most of the}} modern era, women’s completed childbearing in developing societies has av-eraged four or more. Second, from a demographic point of view, proximate determinants of childlessness appear secondary. Proportions not marrying in most of these societies are very small, levels of <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> typically af-fect less than 3 percent of couples, and pathological sterility is a major force in only a few regions. Recent fertility declines and improving longevity, of course, point to pending age-structural imbalances. But for today’s older co-horts, aggregate population growth during the last half-century implies an ample supply of family members in younger generations. An accurate picture, however, requires that further and less reassuring factors be considered. Many of today’s elderly experienced their childbearing years before or during the decline of infant and child mortality after World War II. Many more of their children died in infancy or childhood than would be the case for parents today. Health advances that may now limit pathologi-cal sterility were then much less available. Marital instability, prevalent for example in large areas of Southeast Asia and tropical Africa, would have cur-tailed the reproductive chances of some present-day elderly. Mortality may strike adult children on whom parents are expected to rely. Surviving chil-dren may leave the community and sever contact, either permanently or over long periods. Parental divorce and remarriage may alienate children, effec-tively cutting off older people from their support. These several causes con-tributing to childlessness may combine in various ways, progressively reduc-ing and then eliminating the supply of children. As we note below, historica...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to explore the trend in natural {{fertility}} and its components in China over half a century from the 1940 s to the 1980 s. One of the most important components of fertility, natural fertility and its secular rising trend in modern China, have never been systematically addressed, thus providing the scope for the present study. By fully using recent information on China's population and social development, this thesis documents and analyses the trend of natural fertility in China since the 1940 s. The literature review of natural fertility and its proximate and background determinants comes as the first part after the introduction. An important methodological part of the study comes next. The main data sources are introduced, problems of applying Coale and Trussell's model are discussed and an adjusted version of the model is proposed. Finally, technical problems are also addressed, including such matters as modifying data sources to meet required measurements, assessing the limitations of estimated results, suggesting ways to avoid data truncation and so on. The major part of the thesis consists in the next four chapters, which involve a thorough demographic analysis of natural fertility levels and trends for the nation as a whole, and of different aspects such as urban-rural differentials, regional variations and educational divergences. The proximate determinants: fecundability and birth intervals, breastfeeding, <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> and age at first marriage are also analyzed at length. Finally, the importance of socio-economic conditions on natural fertility change is analysed. The quantitative relationship between natural fertility and these socio-economic conditions was statistically tested and an analytical model was built, which proves to be well able to simulate the identified trends in natural fertility...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hyperhomocysteinemia {{has been}} {{described}} as a risk factor for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Increased levels of homocysteine may be due to inadequate dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 and inherited defects within the methionine-homocysteine pathway such as MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. However, the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and sterility problems have been underlined only for recurrent pregnancy loss while a relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and female sterility is still matter of discussion. Aim This study sought to find out a possible relationship between sterility (<b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> or secondary sterility due to recurrent pregnancy loss) and homocysteine metabolism. Patients and Methods We selected 20 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, 20 patients with unexplained female sterility and 20 healthy women as control group. Several whole blood samples were collected by venipuncture. Firstly homocysteinemia and other related variables were tested (i. e. folate and vitamin B 12 levels); thereafter DNA was extracted by a further whole blood sample collected in EDTA in order to screen MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. Statistical analysis was performed by chi square test; differences were considered to be significant if p Results The median fasting total plasma homocysteine concentration was 19. 2 ± 6. 14 μM for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, while was 21. 05 ± 8. 78 μM for patients with unexplained sterility, vs 7. 85 ± 3. 31 μM of control group (p Discussion MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism is frequent in the studied populations. These data raise questions on the role of the homocysteine metabolism in sterility problems. Even though increased homocysteine (i. e. > 15 μM) and MTHFR C 677 T homozigosity have already been described as risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss, few studies evaluated their role in women with unexplained sterility. Further studies on larger series are needed to better understand the role of homocysteine metabolism, including folate metabolism, in this clinical setting. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus on}} the role of social and {{cultural}} factors on the persistence of high fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa, in relation to other developing regions, conceals the enormous sociocultural heterogeneity that exists between national and sub-national populations within the region. This study examines the influence of sociocultural factors on differences in reproductive behavior among three rural areas with diverse sociocultural characteristics, in Malawi. The results show that the differences in fertility levels among the three areas are primarily a result of variations in the duration of postpartum sexual abstinence and <b>primary</b> <b>sterility,</b> both of which are culturally derived. The future of fertility decline in the areas, and in Malawi as a whole, will depend on people 2 ̆ 7 s receptivity to limit their fertility, and the availability of effective means of contraception. ^ This dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s focus on traditional methods of family planning has been important in enhancing understanding of the social context in which various reproductive decisions are made and played out. The results show that the high demand for adequate birthspacing is primarily motivated by the need to enhance child survival. While people 2 ̆ 7 s concerns and rationalization of the operation, effectiveness and side-effects of traditional methods are also applied to modern methods, the results show that most people prefer modern to traditional methods because of the former 2 ̆ 7 s superior effectiveness. The main problem with modern methods relates to their side-effects on the user 2 ̆ 7 s health. The results also show that while men have traditionally been content to be left out of the decision-making process with respect to use of traditional methods of birthspacing, they would like to play a leading role with respect to use of modern contraceptives. The relocation of the base for family planning services from the village to the hospital is likely to to increase the role of individual level characteristics and structural differences in influencing use of contraceptives. This is because the influence of the elderly women, who control reproductive behavior in the same way across the three cultural settings, is bound to be substantially reduced. However, the family planning program can exploit the enormous influence that the elderly women have on the reproductive process with regard to traditional methods, by using them to promote acceptance of modern methods. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{the aim of this}} work to examine the ability of human fertilized eggs in the {{pronucleus}} state to develop and implant under different clinical and methodical conditions. (patients age, cause of steril-ity, primary or secondary sterility, stimulation regimes, method of fertilization, duration of cryopreserva-tion, number and developmental stage of embryos transferred). Patients with <b>primary</b> <b>sterility</b> conceived significantly less (7, 5 %) than those with secondary sterility (15, 2 %). Patients, who had already been pregnant once by artificial reproduction techniques (ART as IVF or ICSI) had also a higher chance to conceive once more by another ART (15, 4 %). The age of the women up to 40 years was of no significance concerning the fertilization- and preg-nancy-rate. Looking on the reasons for sterility, the “idiopathic” was the most promising (pregnancy rate 14, 9 %) but there were only minor differences between male, female, organic and functional causes. When both genders exhibited reasons for infertility, the pregnancy rate decreased to 6, 7 %. The different agents used for stimulation in the egg- sampling cycle showed differences to some ex-tend, namely 55, 6 % after HMG- stimulation in contrast to 63, 1 % after FSH stimulation. The survival rate after thawing the PN-cells was lower after HMG stimulation (60, 2 %) than after FSH stimulation (67, 7 %). Otherwise the pregnancy rate did not show remarkable differences (9, 6 % bzw. 10, 8 %). The pre-treatment of the cryotransfer cycle was very decisive, as the cryotransfer in the unmedicated spontaneous cycle was the most successful with a pregnancy-rate of 15, 7 %. The stimulation with Clomipene-Citrate as well as low-dose Gonadotrophin application was also rather successful (14, 3 %) but the transfer in an artificial cycle, that is stimulation of endometrial development by estradiolvalerate and progesterone, lead to only a low pregnancy rate (8, 6 %). The pregnancy rate increased twice (6, 6 % to 13, 2 %) with the number of transferred embryos (1 to 3) in the same effect showed the increasing developmental stage of the embryos (PN-cells 4, 3 % 4 -cells 12, 8 %). The arithmetical consideration of both factors together lead to the fifefold increase of the pregnancy rate from one PN-cell-stage (4, 3 %) to three 4 -cell stages (23, 1 %). The freezing time, that means the duration of deep-freezing the impregnated egg cells in the pronu-cleus state before the transfer, did not influence the survival rate of the thawed cells remarkably (71, 2 % up to 3 month, 66, 7 % over 4 years) and did not influence the pregnancy rate. Fertilization by ICSI after cryokonservation lead to fewer pregnancies than IVF (8, 0 % vs. 12, 9 %), but was very similar in the primary transfer (22, 1 % vs. 26, 7 %). The over all pregnancy rate was higher in the “primary transfer” of fresh collected fertilized eggs and cultured embryos (24, 1 %) than after cryokonservation (10, 4 %), a result, that is in good accordance with time corresponding publications (1997 – 2004) ...|$|E
