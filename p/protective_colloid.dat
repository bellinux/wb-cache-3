50|$|Silver halides {{are used}} in {{photographic}} film and photographic paper, including graphic art film and paper, where silver halide crystals in gelatin are coated on to a film base, glass or paper substrate. The gelatin is {{a vital part of}} the emulsion as the <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> of appropriate physical and chemical properties. Gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components. When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow electron trap, which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form silver metal speck.|$|E
40|$|In rabbit with nephritis, {{experimentally}} created b y {{injection of}} mercuric chloride, urinary and serum mucoprotein and <b>protective</b> urinary <b>colloids</b> were investigated, and relation of these substances to urinary and serum calcium was investigated. The results are. 1) Urinary and serum mucoprotein was increased within 1 to 2 days after inje c tion of mercuric chloride, {{and the two}} values retained parallel relation {{in most of the}} cases. 2) Increase of <b>protective</b> urinary <b>colloids</b> ran parallel with that of urinary mucoprotein. In some cases, however, <b>protective</b> urinary <b>colloids</b> showed little fluctuation. 3) Injection of mercuric chloride to rabbit caused little alteration of serum calcium level, and within 2 to 3 days n pronounced increase of the urinary calcium level was noted. This was restored to normal within a week to 10 days. 4) A constant correlation between urinary ca l c ium, urinary and serum mucoprotein and <b>protective</b> urinary <b>colloids</b> was observed. It is indicated from these results that urinary mucoprotein may originate partly from serum mucoprotein and partly from the epithelium of degenerated renal tubule and that mucoprotein and mucopolysaccharides may play an important role, associated with hyp ercalcinuria, in calculus formation of urinary tract...|$|R

Upon oral admini s tration of glycerin to urinary calaulus patients a marked increase in the protective action was perceived, the most effective period being from five to six hours. 3. The increase in protective action by glycerin is attributed to its stimulating colloids {{in the process of}} excretion or it may be due to excretion of matters which increase the protective action. 4. The favorable effect of glycerin in the improvement of the urinary colloids in urinary calculus patients must be regarded as a noteworthy preventive of urinary calculus...|$|R
40|$|Emulsion polymerizations of {{vinyl acetate}} (VAc) were {{performed}} by fully or partially replacing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with renewable materials as protective colloids or by adding renewable materials, as additives or fillers, to the emulsions {{during or after}} polymerization. The {{purpose of the study}} was to increase the amount of renewable materials in the emulsion. A total of 19 emulsions were synthesized. Different recipes were used for the synthesis. The following renewable materials were studied; hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) with different molecular weights, starch and proteins. HEC and starch were used as protective colloids. Proteins were used as additives or fillers. Cross-linking agent A and Cross-linking agent B were used as cross-linking agents. A total of 26 formulations were pressed, either cold or hot. The synthesized emulsions were evaluated with respect to pH, solids content, viscosity, minimum film formation temperature (MFFT), glass transition temperature (Tg), particle size and molecular weight (Mw). The tensile shear strengths of the emulsions were evaluated according to EN 204 and WATT 91. It was possible to fully, or partially, replace PVA as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> with renewable materials. It was also possible to use renewable materials as additives or fillers in the emulsions. The emulsions obtained properties that differed from the reference. Generally, emulsions with HEC as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> showed lower viscosity and slightly higher MFFT, Tg and molecular weight than emulsions with PVA as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> Larger particle sizes than the reference were obtained for emulsions containing PVA combined with renewable materials. The emulsion with starch as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> exhibited the largest particle size. 10 formulations passed the criteria for D 2. The emulsions where PVA was fully or partially replaced with HEC or starch showed a water resistance similar to the reference (around D 2). The addition of protein did not decrease the water and heat resistance compared to the reference. Addition of protein after polymerization increased the water resistance (D 2) compared to addition during polymerization. Addition of cross-linking agents did not increase the water resistance further. Two formulations passed the criteria for D 3. The emulsion in the first formulation had PVA as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> and protein B was added during polymerization. The emulsion in the second formulation had HEC as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> To both of these emulsions, protein A was added after polymerization, as a filler, combined with Cross-linking agent B as cross-linking agent before hot pressing. The first formulation also showed a good heat resistance (passed the criteria for WATT 91). ...|$|E
40|$|Preparation of {{ethylcellulose}} microcapsules containing theophylline {{and vitamin}} K 3 {{was performed by}} simple non-solvent addition and emulsion non-solvent addition methods {{in the presence of}} polybutadiene or polyisobutylene as a <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> The effects of the <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> upon the properties of microcapsules with respect to the size distribution, drug content, ethylcellulose loss, and porosity were characterized. The results of microcapsules containing theophylline indicate that, in the presence of an appropriate amount of the <b>protective</b> <b>colloid,</b> the extent of aggregation was reduced and the surface became smoother and less porous. Mononucleated microcapsules were obtained by the emulsion non-solvent addition method in the presence of polybutylene. Owing to the occurrence of aggregation, the theophylline release from microcapsules appeared to follow the diffusion-controlled matrix model; the release rate being dependent upon the extent of aggregation and the porosity of microcapsules. Mircoencapsulation of vitamin K 3, a novel antitumor drug, was performed by emulsion non-solvent addition method in the presence of polyisobutylene as a <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> The results showed that the release rates of ethylcellulose microcapsules containing vitamin K 3 were slower than those obtained from the ethylcellulose microcapsules prepared without any <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> The extent of aggregation was reduced and individually film-coated core particles formed. However, they were accompanied by formation of small empty coacervate droplets, as detected by microscopic observation. 在本研究中，我們利用各種非溶劑添加法製備含有茶葉鹼與維他命K 3 的乙基纖維素微膠粒。並探討添加保護性膠體對微包覆的性質影響。含茶葉鹼的乙基纖維素微膠粒顯示添加適量的保護性膠體可減少微包覆聚集情形，並使得微包覆表面較為緊密與平滑。在保護性膠體的存在下，利用非溶劑添加之乳化法較利於製備單核（mononucleated）的乙基纖維素微包覆。因微包覆的聚集現象，茶葉鹼的釋放行為乃遵循釋放控制中的基質擴散模式，其釋放速率的快慢則視微包覆的聚集程度與孔隙度而定。 維他命K 3 是屬於氧化危害機制的新穎抗癌藥物，利用微包覆將維他命K 3 作為口服投藥路徑是一種新的嘗試，希望能夠減少藥物在傳遞時的破壞。結果發現利用非溶劑添加之乳化法並以polyisobutylene作為保護性膠體時，可以減少結塊現象的產生並明顯延遲了維他命K 3 的釋放速率，微膠粒的粒徑也略微減小。至於藥物含量的改變並不如預期中的明顯。值得注意的是雖然可以得到表面較為平滑細緻的微膠粒，但高濃度的保護性膠體易造成微包覆過程時殼質乙基纖維素的損失。英文摘要‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧Ⅰ 中文摘要‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧Ⅱ 表索引‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧Ⅲ 圖索引‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧Ⅳ 第一章 導論 1 - 1 引言‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 1. 1 - 2 微包覆技術簡介‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 2. 1 - 3 常見的微包覆材質‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 5. 第二章 微膠粒之設計與制放原理 2 - 1 微包覆之形成‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 8. 2 - 2 非溶劑添加造成的相分離‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 11. 2 - 3 使用乙基纖維素作為微包覆殼質材料‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 14. 2 - 4 茶葉鹼微膠粒的製備‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 16. 2 - 5 維他命K 3 微膠粒的製備‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 18. 2 - 6 保護性膠體的添加‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 21. 2 - 7 微膠粒制放動力模式‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 28. 第三章 實驗 3 - 1 實驗材料‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 35. 3 - 2 實驗儀器‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 35. 3 - 3 茶葉鹼微膠粒的製備‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 36. 3 - 4 維他命K 3 微膠粒的製備‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 38. 3 - 5 粒徑與藥物含量的測試‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 39. 3 - 6 BET的測量‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 40. 3 - 7 表面觀察‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 40. 3 - 8 溶出測量‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 40. 第四章 結果‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 41. 第五章 討論 5 - 1 保護性膠體對茶葉鹼微膠粒的影響‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 64. 5 - 2 保護性膠體對維他命K 3 微膠粒的影響‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 69. 第六章 結論‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 72. 參考文獻‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧‧ 74...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} and mechanical effects of ultrasound are interesting {{in the food}} industry. This work attempts to study new applications on grapes as the raw material {{and then in the}} stabilization process. Phenolic compounds extracted from grapes by means of disruption of the cell wall due to pressure alternance and cavitation were studied. The tests carried out showed an improvement in the extraction of polyphenolic substances, with a reduction in the duration of traditional maceration in the cellar. The US technology causes a direct cavitational damage to microbial cell membranes with leakage of its content and sonochemical structural modifications of the liquid medium. US could accelerate the release of <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> (polysaccharides, glycopolysaccharides and proteins) and stabilize wine. This study, focused on the ultrasound effects on wine lees, verifies the lytic effect on yeast cell structures and the possibility of accelerating the <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> release. Moreover, these effects were compared with the usual practices of aging wine over lees and with the enzyme treatment of lees by means of β-glucanases able to facilitate the release of intracellular components. Ultrasound treatment on wine lees resulted in an increase in total colloids, proteins, and polysaccharides in the medium with a reduction in the colloids particle diameter. These results were mainly correlated with treatment duration rather than its intensity. The vibrations provoked by waves pressure during the treatment could give off enough energy to stabilize tannin-tannin and tannin-anthocyanins polymers in wine. We also investigated effects of US on red wines, in order to understand how to speed up the aging reactions and hence reduce the time between production and sale. It was found that a few minutes ultrasonic treatment probably promotes an increase in the amount of the catechins, the depolymerization of the tannins and a change of the astringency...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{effects of}} various amino acids an d medical drugs upon urinary <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> {{has been investigated}} by three differing procedures : 1) addition of various substances in vitro, 2) administration of various substances to the patients with urolithiasis, 3) salts prezipitated experiment. 1) In this experim ent, both Ogawa's method and Yamazoe's method were utilized as a test for protective activity of urinary colloids. Triptophan, cystine and 1 -methionin increased the effect of urinary <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> both in Ogawa's method and Yamazoe's method in vitro. On the other hand, arginine hydrochloride, isoleutine, lysin and glutamic acid increased the protective colloidal effect only in Yamazoe's method in vitro. Polytamin, mastigen B 12, rutin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its co n stituent components (glycyrrhizine, glycyrrhezic acid and glucose cysteine) incresed the protective colloidal effect both in Yamazoe's method and Ogawa's method in vitro. On the other hand, methio-mastigen B 12 revealed the effect only in Ogawa's method, and chondroitin sulfate revealed the effect only in Yamazoe's method. 2) As a clinical experiment, neo-s t r ong Minophagen C, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfate {{were given to the}} patients with urolithiasis. It was found that neo-strong Minophagen C and chondroitin sulfate increased the protective colloidal effect in urine, and hyaluronidase did not show an obvious increasing effect. It is obscure, however, that such an increasing effect of chondroitin sulfate is due to the chondroitin sulfate itself or some unknown substance in the metabolic process of chondroitin sulfate. The protective effect of neo-strong Minophagen C seems to be a direct protection for urinary salts, and glycyrrhizine particularly glycyrrhezic acid, above all other constituent elements of neostrong Minophagen C, seems most effective. 3) From the results of salt p rezipitated experiment, electrodes were inserted into urine, with or without addition of polytamin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its constituent components and chondroitin sulfate, it was recognized that the amount of prezipitated salts were decreased by the addition of these substances.

40|$|Water soluble, {{chemically}} modified cellulose is of broad interest {{because of the}} long time availability, their environmental friendly degradability and their physiological harmlessness. Cellulosic derivatives are widely used as thickeners, binding agents, adhesives, swelling agents, <b>protective</b> <b>colloids,</b> emulsion and suspension stabilizers and filmforming agents, to name a few. Despite these broad fields of application {{there are still many}} open questions remaining between molecular structure and application profiles. Especially the viscoelastic properties of cellulosic derivatives in aqueous solution have to be interpreted regarding their molecular structure. The industrial important thickening properties can be captured by the so called  0 –M–c relationships. These relationships can be expanded to the non-Newtonian flow regime ( = f()) which is also possible for not molecular disperse solutions of cellulosic derivatives with associated and aggregated clusters of polymers. During the last years, new investigation methods were established which utilize rheo-optical techniques to measure the flow birefringence and dichroism. These methods allow a determination of the orientation of polymer segments and polymer aggregates in a shear flow field, the detection of the 1 st normal stress difference, as well as the detection of sol-gel transitions.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} the study of {{ultrasound}} (US) treatment effects on wine lees, in order to verify the possibility of accelerating the <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> (i. e., polysaccharides) release. Moreover, these effects were compared with the usual practices of aging wine over lees and with the enzyme treatment of lees by means of betaglucanases able to demolish the glucans and facilitate the release of intracellular components. This work was performed considering the possibility of setting up a technology applicable in a cellar. Ultrasound treatment on wine lees resulted in an increase in total colloids, proteins, and polysaccharides in the medium with a reduction in the colloids particle diameter. These results were mainly correlated with treatment duration rather than its intensity. Treatment at 90 % amplitude for 3 min provided good enough results in terms of colloids release, and therefore, it was used for the comparative study with natural lysis and enzyme treatment. The parameters evaluated showed that the ultrasound treatment resulted in an increased release of colloids from yeast (polysaccharides and glycoproteins); therefore, a significant effect on the extraction of cellular components compared to the long stay on the lees was detected, indicating the interesting advantage that this new technological application can bring to the winemaking process...|$|R

Two levels of experiment occur starting with formulation study of encapsulation agent followed by the viability study of different probiotics after spray dry and two weeks nonrefrigerated storage. The formulation of 30 % of gum Arabic, 15 % of gelatin and 45 % of coconut oil can homogenize well at least for two hours and can produce acceptable dried product (below 4 % of moisture content) at low outlet temperature (70 ? - 75 ?).

40|$|SUMMARY: Working {{details are}} given for keeping as desiccates a {{collection}} of some 1500 strains of bacteria. The efficacy of drying, the various methods of freezing, {{and the effect of}} storage were tested by viable counts, using a spinning bottle modification of the roll-tube method. The survival rate of bacteria suspended in broth or other <b>protective</b> <b>colloids,</b> and subjected to freezing at- 78 ", varied with the species from about 100 yo with the resistant Staphylococcus aureus to about 10 yo with the sensitive Neisserz'a gonorrhoeae, and from about 100 to 1. 5 yo or less, respectively, when the organisms were suspended in saline. The percentage of organisms which survive the freeze-drying process was found to vary with the species, from 100 % to less than 1. 0 yo when the organisms were suspended in broth and from 100 yo to no survivors when the organisms were suspended in saline. The storage loss of dried cultures was found to be a function of the storage temperature; however, suitably dried cultures could be kept a t room temperature for very long periods. By far the most important factor influencing loss on storage was the presence of traces of moisture, and to ensure optimal survival the cultures must be as dry as possible. It appears that eve...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} death from diphtheria intoxication {{appears to be a}} shock state due to paralysis of the entire periph-eral vascular mechanism (1). Well recognized are the mani-festations of cardiac depression or capillary paralysis, or both. Therefore, prevention and treatment of the shock state should be directed at support of the circulation, and protection of the heart and capifiaries from action of the toxin. Theoretically, desirable measures would be digitalis for the heart, and <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> and pituitary extract for the capillaries. According to G. N. Myers (1), digitalis is satisfactory in the diphtheria intoxication of cats and guinea pigs, provided the drug is given {{in the early stages of}} the intoxication, but it has no value as a life-saving measure in the late stages. Myers has recently reviewed the results with digitalis and other hemodynamic measures tried by previous investigators, so there is no need of detailing them here. Briefly, epinephrine and pituitary extract produce pressor effects in the early stages, but not in the late. Injections of saline, acacia, or dextrose solutions appear to be superior, as rapidly act-ing agents, and the efficiency of dextrose appears to be increased by the addition of alcohol. However, none of these agents, except digitalis, would be chosen for support of the circulation before symptoms of collapse are manifested...|$|R

On the other hand, the protective activity of urinary colloids of the patient with Cushing's syndrome was lower than normal, and it increased more than normal level after the adrenalectomy was performed. The concentration of mucoprotein in urine revealed the similar changes before and after the administration. (continued) 3) The concentration of urinary colloids of rabbit seemed decreased by the administration of ACTH in all of the cases except the rabbits with diarrhea and other physical disorders during the experiment. No change has been recognized on the concentration of urinary colloids in rabbits before and during the administration of cortisone preparation, but it showed higher level after the completion of administration. The results of this experiment seems to be {{due to the fact that}} the adrenal function is increased by ACTH and it is decreased by cortisone. Conclusions T h e concentration of <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> in urine is decreased by the adrenal hyperfunction in stress. The dysfunction of autonomic nervous system causes the change of urinary colloids.

40|$|A URINE {{specimen}} {{intended for}} bacteriological examination is often kept at room tempera-ture for many hours {{before it is}} cultured. During this period bacteria present in the specimen rapidly increase in number because urine, as has long been known, is an excellent culture medium. Pathogens originating in the urinary tract will increase, but so will contaminants derived from the lower urethra and external surface of the genitalia. Bacteriological investi-gation of such specimens {{is a waste of}} time and reports based on the results obtained may be highly misleading. One way of overcoming this difficulty is to prevent bacterial growth without at the same time diminishing the viability of the organisms originally present. This has been accom-plished by adding sodium chloride as a bacteriostatic agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> to maintain the suspension stability of the bacterial cells. The results obtained by this method, both in laboratory experiments and in clinical practice, are here presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Although turbulence-stabilized dispersions are of {{considerable}} industrial importance, their behaviour {{is generally not}} well understood, especially for the high dispersed phase volume fractions encountered in suspension polymerization reactors. The dispersion is formed by two dynamic processes, namely, drop breakage and coalescence. Breakage mainly occurs in regions of high shear stress near the impeller or {{as a result of}} turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations along the surface of a drop. Droplet coalescence is prevented by the combined action of turbulent agitation and the addition of <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> such as poly(viny 1 alcohol) (PVA). Depending on the combination of the degree of agitation and the concentration and type of surface active agent, the average droplet size can exhibit a U-shaped variation with respect to the impeller speed or the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA stabilizer. This U-type behaviour has been confirmed both experimentally and theoretically and has been attributed to a mani-festation of the balance between breakage and coalescence rates of the monomer drops. Both processes are related to the interfacial tension and its variation with time {{as a result of the}} varying polymer concentration and conformation at the monomer/water interface. In the present study, a series of experiments were carried out with a model system of 50 % n-butyl chloride in water in the presence of PVA with varying degrees of hydrolysis at different agitation rates.

40|$|Aims : Inhibition of {{potassium}} hydrogen tartrate (KHT) crystallization by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is {{tested in a}} model solution and in wines. Tartaric acid salt crystallization risk is assessed by computing the supersaturation, saturation temperature and excess KHT {{with respect to the}} saturation equilibrium using MEXTAR® (Mesure de l’EXces de TARtre) software. Materials and results : Firstly, the time for crystals to appear was recorded by monitoring the conductivity in a model solution and in a wine, and the inhibition ratio was computed. At 11, 5 °C, 0, 5 mg. L- 1 CMC inhibited KHT crystallization. The inhibitory effect increased exponentially with increasing CMC concentration and was several times greater than that of polysaccharides and polyphenols, the <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> in wine (Gerbaud et al., 1997). At 2 °C, 30 mg. L- 1 CMC had the same inhibitory effect than 10 mg. L- 1 at 11. 5 °C. Secondly, 20 red and white wines were refrigerated for 3 weeks at - 4 °C with CMC or metatartaric acid. Results show that the addition of 20 mg. L- 1 CMC has an inhibitory effect at least equivalent to 100 mg. L- 1 metatartaric acid. Furthermore, for 10 wines preheated for 8 days at 30 °C and then refrigerated for 2 months at 0 °C, 5 and 20 mg. L- 1 CMC maintains its inhibitory efficiency, unlike metatartaric acid which is hydrolysed Significance and impact of the study : The OIV-OENO 366 - 2009 and OIV-OENO 02 / 2008 resolutions recently authorized the use of CMC to prevent tartaric acid salt precipitation. With no impact on health, and stable under heating and in acid solution, CMC is an efficient candidate for tartaric stabilization. The optimal concentration of 20 mg. L- 1 (2 g. hL- 1) should however be adapted to local wine storage conditions and KHT crystallization risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} the following three sections: 1. Hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. In this work, we deposited HA precursor films from weak basic electrolytic solution (pH= 8 - 9) via an electrochemical approach; the deposits were changed into crystallite coatings of hydroxyapatite by sintering at specific temperatures (600 - 800 ºC). The formed coatings were mainly characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD patterns show well-defined peaks of HA when sintered under vacuum conditions. FTIR measurements indicate the existence of hydroxyl groups, which were confirmed by the characteristic intensity of the stretching and bending bands at ~ 3575 and ~ 630 cm- 1, respectively. The SEM shows an adhesive, crack free morphology for the double-layer coating surface of the samples sintered in a vacuum furnace. 2. Silver/polymer/clay nanocomposites. Silver nanoparticles were prepared in layered clay mineral (montmorillonite) /polymer (PVP: poly (vinyl pyrrolidone)) suspension by an electrochemical approach. The silver particles formed in the bulk suspension were stabilized by the PVP and partially exfoliated clay platelets, which acted as <b>protective</b> <b>colloids</b> to prevent coagulation of silver nanoparticles together. The synthesized silver nanoparticles/montmorillonite/PVP composite was characterized and identified by XRD, SEM, and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) measurements. 3. Ce-doped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. In this study, we fabricated cerium-doped PZT films (molar ratio of Zr/Ti:: 0. 5 : 0. 5) via cathodic electrodeposition on the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. In the preparation process, the PZT films were modified by adding {{a small amount of}} cerium dopants, which {{led to the formation of}} Ce-doped PZT films after sintering at high temperatures. The fabricated PZT films on the ITO coated glass substrate may be used as electro-optic devices in the industrial application...|$|R

In this process vinyl acetate is used as monomer, potassium persulfate as initiator and polyvinyl alcohol as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid.</b> A model of the system to calculate average molecular weight and dispersity is implemented. A fine and strict temperature control is {{required in order to}} guarantee the product quality and safe operation. Nonlinear geometric control based on input/output linearization is used for reactor temperature control. An extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate unmeasured states. Performance tests of the controller and state estimator are carried out by introducing modeling and estimator errors. It is also verified that the nonlinear controller can work with different initiator feed policies helping to improve the process productivity. Finally, compared to a traditional PID controller, the nonlinear geometric controller is superior in rejecting disturbances and performing set point tracking...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to microencapsulate {{beetroot}} juice (BJ) (Beta vulgaris L.) by spray-drying using as <b>protective</b> <b>colloid</b> gum Arabic. The adsorption isotherms of the microcapsules and the minimum integral entropy (∆S int) T were determined at 25, 35 and 40 ◦C. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and modeled by GordonTaylor equation. The water contents-water activity (M-aW) sets obtained from (∆S int) T, and critical water content (CWC) and critical water activity (CWA) from the Tg were similar, being {{in the range of}} water content of 5. 11 - 7. 5 kg H 2 O/ 100 kg d. s. and in the water activity range of 0. 532 - 0. 590.

40|$|The {{effect of}} blanching, post-harvest {{refrigerated}} (4 C) storage and enzyme treatment with poly-galacturonase on the microstructure of Spartan apple juice was examined by thin sectioning and negative staining transmission electron microscopy. Particles were categrized as granules (3 - 54 nm), spheres (20 - 368 nm) and aggregates (12 - 2519 nm). Enzyme treatment with polygalacturonase significantly decreased granule size (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Storage of apples significantly decreased both granule size (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and aggregate length (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and {{also resulted in}} a web-like aspect in the microscopic appearance of juice particulate. The web-like aspect of the particulate was removed either through enzyme treatment with polygalacturonase or by blanching.

40|$|A {{simple method}} of synthesising red {{pigments}} for ceramic glazes, based on gold nanoparticles {{protected by a}} refractory oxide capsule, was developed. Gold nanoparticles of an appropriate size were obtained by reaction in an aqueous medium between an Au(III) solution and an ammonium bromide solution, keeping the Br- concentration low during the process. The gold nanoparticles were encapsulated by adding the <b>protective</b> oxide in <b>colloid</b> form and subsequently coagulating it, alkalinising the medium. Diethylentriamine was then added to encourage {{the interaction between the}} gold nanoparticles and the oxide nanoparticles. This was followed by adding carboxymethylcellulose to raise medium viscosity, and to avoid segregation and subsequent agglomeration of the gold nanoparticles during drying. The dry residue was directly usable as a glaze pigment without requiring further thermal treatments. Three protective oxides, namely SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and SnO 2, were tested. In the three cases, pigments with a high colouring strength were obtained, which gave rise to reds of different shades in the resulting test glaz...|$|R

It is also used as an adjunctive product in atopic dermatitis. The safety of personal care products used on vulnerable skin is of particular importance and the risk of developing further skin irritations and/or allergies should be minimized. Methods: In a series of studies, we tested the safety of personal care products containing oatmeal (creams, cleansers, lotions) by assessing their irritant/allergenic potential on repeat insult patch testing, in safety-in-use and ocular studies using subjects with nonsensitive and sensitive skin. We also tested the skin moisturizing and repair properties of an oatmeal-containing skin care product for dry skin. Results: We found that oatmeal-containing personal care products had very low irritant potential as well as a very low allergenic sensitization potential. Low-level reactions were documented in 1. 0 % of subjects during the induction phase of repeat insult patch testing; one of 2291 subjects developed a persistent but doubtful low-level reaction involving edema during the challenge phase in repeat insult patch testing. No allergies were reported by 80 subjects after patch testing after in-use application. Sustained skin moisturizing was documented in subjects with dry skin that lasted up to 2 weeks after product discontinuation. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that colloidal oatmeal is a safe and effective ingredient in personal care products. No allergies were reported by consumers of 445, 820 products sold during a 3 -year period.

40|$|Summary. Statement of the problem. In recent years, {{products}} {{based on}} gypsum binding materials is widespread, as their application allows {{to increase the}} productivity and quality of work. However, their production is constrained by lack of efficient dry additives. Domestic additives for adjusting the properties of gypsum binders are mainly in the liquid state. The use of imported additives increases the cost of products. One {{of the ways to}} obtain the dry additive is the use of polyvinyl acetate dispersion, which is widely used in liquid form to adjust the properties of cementations materials. But by the reworking to the dry condition the dispersion is aggregated. Furthermore, the additive does not have the required functional properties. The main problem of the production of dispersible polymer powders is development of the mechanism of their dispersion and film formation, and selection of regulators. So the stabilizers in the system prevent the coagulation of the emulsion (dispersion). <b>Protective</b> <b>colloid</b> provides obtaining of the dispersion powder, then is able to disperse in the water. And, finally, drying (moisture removal) leads to the film formation. ...|$|E
