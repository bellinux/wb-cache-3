30|$|A Stark or Zeeman {{decelerator}} {{selects a}} portion of the initial molecular beam pulse, and transfers this portion to the desired final velocity keeping the phase-space density in the selected bunch constant [28]. In this respect, the decelerator acts as a filter, in principle leaving the part of the beam that is not selected to propagate freely. The quality of the bunch of molecules exiting the decelerator therefore critically depends on the parameters of the initial molecular beam pulse and the pulsed valve used. Several molecular beam sources are used in laboratories around the world {{as a starting point for}} deceleration experiments. Some of them are home-built, others are commercially available. Frequently used valves include the piezo activated valve [29], General Valve, Jordan Valve, Even-Lavie Valve [30], and more recently the Nijmegen <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Valve</b> [31].

40|$|Spacecraft surface {{charging}} {{can lead}} to arcing {{and a loss of}} electrical power generation capability of solar panel, or even loss of a satellite. The charging problem may be further aggravated by the atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which modifies the surface of materials like, Polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coating, cover glass, etc., used on satellite surface. These affect material properties, such as resistivity, secondary electron emissivity, photo emission, which govern the charging behaviour. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. This research develops a new facility at KIT, based on a novel technique for generating atomic oxygen flux involving laser induced breakdown of molecular oxygen. High velocity AO in an evacuated nozzle is formed, where laser beam breakdowns molecular oxygen into AO injected through a pressurized <b>pulse</b> <b>valve</b> into the nozzle. The energy of AO is measured using Time of flight (TOF) technique. The generated AO flux is measured using Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). The Mass Flow Controller (MFC) inserted in oxygen gas supply line measures the net amount of gas being injected through <b>pulse</b> <b>valve.</b> The spectral analysis of AO production wavelength (777. 6 nm) is detected using a spectrometer. The relative abundance of generated species is observed using a Quadrupole Mass Analyzer System (QMAS). The developed facility produces AO of velocity 8 ～ 14 kms- 1 having the flux in the order of 1018 atoms/m 2 /shot. This flux is used to expose spacecraft surface materials for extended period of 10 years at 800 km, equivalent to exposure of satellite surface materials to atomic oxygen fluence for the normal lifetime of the satellite in orbit. This thesis develops a new method and facility for the measurement of resistivity of atomic oxygen exposed polyimide by using surface charge decay method. The resistivity measurement is performed in vacuum using the charge storage decay method at room temperature, which is considered most appropriate for measuring the resistivity for space application. The mathematical formulation and experimental facility are indigenously developed to measure resistivity as per space requirement. We introduce a new method to measure surface and volume resistivity together, which can be further improved to measure the secondary electron characteristics. The results show that the surface resistivity increases and the volume resistivity remains almost the same for the AO exposure fluence of 5. 4 x 1018 atoms cm- 2 on polyimide film. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 311 号 学位授与年月日:平成 23 年 3 月 25 日 1.

Finally, the performance of FTMS is compared to a conventional double-focussing mass spectrometer with respect to the quality of their high resolution mass spectra. This comparison serves to establish the performance characteristics of the FTMS at the present time. ^ Part 3 includes a description of experimental excursions into the chemistry of the cyclopropane radical cation.

Mass spectrometric and quantum chemical studies of cerium chloride solutions can provide important insight into the composition, structure and energetic properties of molecular cerium species, and as such, deliver new information with respect to the distribution and abundance of such materials in aqueous fluids. Here we present results from electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometric experiments of cerium chloride complexes and clusters in the gas-phase, in particular, clusters of the general form [CemXn]+ (X=Cl, OH, O) and corresponding microsolvated species. We also report equilibrium geometries and associated energetic properties using M 06 /cc-pVXZ-PP (X=D,T) level theory in combination with quasi-relativistic effective core potentials for Ce.

We also conducted mass spectrometric experiments in which the concentration-dependence (1 - 20 mM; pH 5. 2 - 6. 9) of the cerium cluster distribution was probed. Results from these concentration-dependent experiments demonstrate that cerium chloride clustering increases with CeCl 3 concentration, in other words, at higher CeCl 3 concentrations (lower pH) more cerium chloride is present as polynuclear chlorocerate. With respect to solution pH, {{it is likely that the}} emergence of clusters with bridging hydroxo groups, e. g. [CemCl 3 m- 2 OH]+ arises as a consequence of the partial hydrolysis of [CemCl 3 m- 1]+ clusters, in particular, in the acidic pH range. Last but not least, the observed correlation between ion mass spectra and solution content appears to demonstrate that dinuclear clusters are intermediates on the way from the [CeCl 2]+ complex to the formation of larger “bulk-like” chlorocerate clusters. In conclusion, results from our ESI mass spectromentric and DFT study strongly point toward molecular clustering being an important factor in understanding Ce speciation in aqueous fluids. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The jet amplitude is characterized by the velocity ratio (Vj/V∞) in between 0 to 5 and the jet pulse frequency is varying between 0 to 100 Hz. A comparison between the steady and unsteady Micro Pulse Jet is also done, which indicates the mass flow requirement for pulse micro jet is reduce...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Previous {{studies have}} shown that the Carpentier-Edwards Magna (CEM) valve is an {{excellent}} bioprosthesis in terms of its systolic performance; indeed, it has been described as 'a stented valve with stentless performance'. However, valve performance is not only a matter of gradients; it is also necessary to evaluate the diastolic-phase performance. Previous in-vitro {{studies have shown}} that the CEM has an excessive total regurgitant volume. Hence, the study aim was to compare the hydrodynamics of the CEM, with the newly evolved version of this valve, the CEM Ease (CEME). METHODS: The CEM and CEME valves (both 21 mm) were tested in the aortic chamber (23 mm diameter) of the Sheffield pulse duplicator. The tests were carried out at increasing pulse rates (PR; 70 - 100 beats/min), and at each <b>pulse</b> rate the <b>valve</b> was tested at different stroke volumes (SVs; 45 - 65 ml). The forward-flow pressure drop, closing leakage volumes and effective orifice area (EOA) were recorded. RESULTS: The CEM and CEME valves showed a comparable systolic-phase performance, there being no significant differences in terms of transvalvular gradient, EOA and stroke work loss, regardless of the PR and SV. In fact, the new CEME exhibited a significantly improved diastolic performance, with the total regurgitant volume being significantly lower, due especially to a reduced leakage volume and, to a lesser extent, a reduced closing volume. CONCLUSION: The study results indicated that the new CEME valve would maintain the excellent systolic performance of the previous CEM model, but with a significantly improved diastolic performance...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIn {{aortic valve}} {{regurgitation}} and aortic dilatation, {{preservation of the}} aortic valve is possible by means of root remodeling (Yacoub procedure) or valve reimplantation (David procedure). In vivo studies suggest that reimplantation might substantially influence aortic valve-motion characteristics. Evaluation of aortic valve movement in vivo, however, is technically limited and is difficult to standardize. We evaluated the aortic valve-motion pattern echocardiographically in vitro after reimplantation and remodeling. MethodsBy using aortic roots of house pigs (aortoventricular diameter, 22 mm) a Yacoub procedure (22 -mm graft; group Y, n = 5) or a David I procedure (24 -mm graft; group D, n = 5) was performed. Roots after supracommissural replacement (22 -mm graft; group C, n = 5) served as control valves. In an electrohydraulic, computer-controlled <b>pulse</b> duplicator the <b>valves</b> were tested at flows of 2, 4, 7, and 9 L/min. Echocardiographically assessed parameters were rapid valve-opening velocity, slow valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-opening time, rapid valve-closing time, ejection time, maximum valve opening, slow valve-closing displacement, and maximum flow velocity. ResultsMean rapid valve-opening velocity and mean rapid valve-closing velocity at a cardiac output of 2 to 9 L/min were fastest in group D (rapid valve-opening velocity: 69 ± 10 cm/s [group D] vs 39 ± 4 cm/s [group Y] vs 42 ± 4 cm/s [group C], P =. 0041; rapid valve-closing velocity: 22 ± 2 cm/s [group D] vs 16 ± 2 cm/s [group Y] vs 17 ± 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0272), and slow valve-closing velocity was slowest in group D (0. 2 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group D] vs 1. 0 ± 0. 3 cm/s [group Y] vs 0. 6 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0063). With increasing cardiac output, the difference in rapid valve-opening velocity between the groups increased, the difference in slow valve-closing velocity remained unchanged, and the difference in rapid valve-closing velocity decreased. ConclusionsIn this standardized experimental setting remodeling of the aortic valve provides significantly smoother valve movements. This might contribute to preservation of a better valve performance during long-term follow-up...|$|R
