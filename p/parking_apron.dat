5|$|On 23 May, a $17 million {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} two companies, to complete {{the first phase of}} construction. This included the northâˆ’south runway, a parallel taxiway (Taxiway J), a <b>parking</b> <b>apron,</b> the Arch Hangar, a base operations building, a control tower, a power plant, a 250-person barracks (which would later become Building 6000), a water supply system, and a railroad spur to the base (now part of the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway).|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and <b>parking</b> <b>apron</b> construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Northern Ireland Airports Limited {{was formed}} to operate and develop the airport and its facilities. A major {{programme}} of airfield upgrades was undertaken resulting in improvements to runways, taxiways and the <b>parking</b> <b>apron.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the main runways, taxiways and <b>parking</b> <b>aprons</b> were mostly torn up or turned into single lane {{agricultural}} roads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>parking</b> <b>aprons</b> at {{the facility}} are approximately 87,000 ft2 and encompass approximately 170,000 ft2 of area. [...] The principal apron is located northwest of Runway 19 and {{has the capacity to}} hold 42 aircraft. The secondary apron is located in front of the terminal building and has the capacity for 10 aircraft. A small fueling apron is located between the two <b>parking</b> <b>aprons.</b> Aircraft tie-down spaces are leased by the facility's FBO from the State of Vermont.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{will have}} a 2,500-meter runway (class 4C), a 3,600 square-meter {{terminal}} building, and three aircraft <b>parking</b> <b>aprons.</b> It is designed to handle 200,000 passengers and 700 tons of cargo annually by 2020.|$|R
25|$|There are {{domestic}} and international flights form Varna to about 70 destinations in 25 countries, with Bulgarian and foreign airlines. The airport {{is close to the}} Port of Varna and the railway system. The airport has one asphalt-covered runway 09/27 with ILS CAT I system on 09 edge and a <b>parking</b> <b>apron</b> for 24 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Hobart International Airport Pty Ltd {{announced}} detailed {{plans for}} the airport with a new 20-year master plan. Currently aircraft have to taxi along the runway and proceed to the <b>parking</b> <b>apron</b> via taxiways {{in the middle of}} the runway. This has both capacity and safety implications for the airport, as the runway cannot be used whilst an aircraft is taxiing. The plans provide for a parallel taxiway to the full length of runway. When complete, aircraft landing on the runway would proceed to the end of the runway and exit via the parallel taxiway. This would allow for greater utilisation of the existing runway.|$|E
2500|$|The new 275,000 sq. ft. Terminal {{opened in}} May 1994 with 8 gates (expandable to 19 gates). The project {{included}} new roads, a new aircraft taxiway and <b>parking</b> <b>apron,</b> stormwater ponds, landscaping {{and a new}} interchange at I-95 for entry into the Airport (Exit 18-A) at mile marker 104. Total cost for the project was $68.5 million. It was completed one month ahead of schedule and under budget. [...] It was designed by KBJ Architects ...|$|E

2500|$|During 1947, {{with the}} {{airfield}} inactive, the war-damaged and repaired German jet runway {{was replaced with}} a new, 7,200' runway, and additional facilities were upgraded and brought into service. [...] New hangars were constructed along with a large concrete <b>parking</b> <b>apron,</b> and in late 1947 was redesignated as Giebelstadt Air Base [...] The new Strategic Air Command dispatched nine B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers of the 97th Bombardment Group to Giebelstadt to conduct training during temporary deployments to Europe. The last SAC personnel returned to the United States in January 1948, and afterward the facility was closed and placed on standby status due to budget reductions in the postwar era.|$|E
