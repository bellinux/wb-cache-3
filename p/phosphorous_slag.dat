40|$|AbstractThree {{kinds of}} <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powders from {{different}} localities (companies) {{were selected to}} test the dissolved phosphorus content in 3 d curing age. Influence of different localities of the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder on water requirement of normal consistency, setting time, soundness and mortar strength was studied. The {{results showed that the}} retarding effect of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder and its dissolved phosphorus content was closely related. Under the condition of the same mixing amount, the more dissolved phosphorus content, the longer setting time. When the specimens contained same <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder, the dissolution rate and dissolved quantity increased with the increase of the specific surface area. And the setting time also increased with the increase of the specific surface area. The defference in the mortar strength of the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powders from different localities may be attributed to the comprehensive effect between retarding effect and pozzolanic effect...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> is an {{industrial}} waste which potentially pollutes environments. The {{aim of the}} present work is to use <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> as a raw material to produce alkali-activated cement. The influence of mix proportion of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> and fly ash, alkali content and modulus of water glass on the properties of alkali-activated <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> and fly ash cement (AA-PS-FA-C) was studied. The results show that AA-PS-FA-C with normal setting performance and desirable mechanical properties can be prepared using water glass as the activator. Changing the fly ash content {{in the range of}} 0 - 40 wt% has only a small influence on the setting time of AA-PS-FA-C. The strengths significantly decrease when the fly ash content exceeds 30 wt%. The carbonation resistance of AA-PS-FA-C {{is similar to that of}} ordinary Portland cement (OPC), while the frost resistance is much better. The hardened paste of AA-PS-FA-C is much more compact than OPC paste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：In this paper, the {{influence}} of steel slag and its pretreatment method on properties of phosphorus slag cement has been studied. The hydration process and microstructure were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Results show that, the problem of long setting time of high content <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> cement can be effectively solved by adding steel slag and pretreated steel slag. About 6 % content of steel slag could promote the early hydration of phosphorus slag cement and reduced the initial setting time 2 hours. Grinding <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> and steel slag with different water content, the initial set time of phosphorus slag cement for 6 hours has reduced to 2. 5 hours without changing the strength. Ageing the mixed grinding power of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> and steel slag and keeping 2. 5 hours of the initial set time, the early cement strength can increase 3 MPa. ...|$|E
40|$|In most cases, {{steelmaking}} slag and hot metal dephosphorization slag {{are in a}} solid-liquid coexisting states containing dicalcium silicate as the solid phase. From the phase diagram of the CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 system, {{it is well known}} that dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) and tricalcium phosphate (C 3 P) form a solid solution at the steelmaking or hot metal dephosphorization temperature in a wide composition range. This phase diagram implies that the main products of the dephosphorization reaction can be dissolved into the main solid phase in the slag. Ito et al. have observed large partition ratio of phosphorus between liquid slag and the solid solution of C 2 S and C 3 P. According to this result, it can be said that phosphorus is more stable in the solid solution than in the liquid slag phase. The authors have proposed a new dephosphorization model that takes into account the solid phase in the slag. In order to utilize the solid solution efficiently, the rate of phosphorus enrichment from liquid slag to the solid solution and the partition ratio of <b>phosphorous</b> between liquid <b>slag</b> and the solid solution should be clarified for various slag conditions. To meet this requirement, the fundamental experiments were conducted. Combining these results with the model, some aspects to improve the dephosphorization in steelmaking process were clarified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{attempts to}} test the mechanical properties of calcium oxide-phosphorous slag powder cementing material under autoclave curing condition. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersion scanner and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry were adopted to characterize {{the performance of the}} hydration products and microstructure of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder cementing material autoclaved product. The research findings showed that under the condition of autoclave curing, doping calcium oxide would activate preferable property of hydration and hardening of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder cementing material, and the best strength of the cementing material would be achieved with optimal doping of 15 % (in mass) compound calcium oxide. With the effect of the alkaline activation of calcium oxide, there mainly remained the calcium silicate hydrate gel and Al-calcium silicate hydrate in hydration products of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder cementing material. Excess calcium oxide made alkalinity of calcium silicate hydrate gel change from low to high, thus leading to the decline of mechanical performance of autoclave products...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fly ash, calcium oxide and {{polypropylene}} fiber {{on the physical}} and mechanical properties, shrinkage and cracking behaviors of alkali-activated <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> cement (AA-PS-C) were studied. The results show that replacing 10 - 15 % <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> by fly ash and adding calcium oxide as an expansive agent reduce the shrinkage of AA-PS-C. Fly ash will increase the flexural strength, although the compressive strength will be slightly decreased, while the calcium oxide expansive agent coated with aluminum stearate will slightly shorten the setting time and reduce the strength. Adding polypropylene fiber can greatly increase the crack-resistance of AA-PS-C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of China and its eye-catching economic take-off, industrial production has brought about increasingly enormous negative impact. Industrial residues (coal ash, iron-ore slag, <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> and ganister sand) have accumulated in large quantities, thus severely contaminating the environment and greatly restricting the sustainable economic development. This paper conducts research on microstructure of the industrial wastes that are massively applied in domestic architectural material industry, such as coal ash, (S 95,S 105) slag powder, S 75 <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag,</b> micro-bead (ultra-fine coal ash) and the micro ganister sand so as to analyze its size distribution and particle appearance and introduce its functions and effect in concrete and other cement products...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} and microstructural evolution of two alkali-activated slags, with distinct alumina content, exposed to 50 &# 0176;C have been investigated. These two slags are ground-granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (containing 13 % (wt.) alumina) and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> (containing 3 % (wt.) alumina). They were hydrated {{in the presence of}} a combination of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solution at different ratios. The microstructure of the resultant slag pastes was assessed by X-ray diffraction, differential thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results obtained from these techniques reveal the presence of hexagonal hydrates: CAH 10 and C 4 AH 13 in all alkali-activated ground-granulated blast-furnace slag pastes (AAGBS). These hydrates are not observed in pastes formed by alkali-activated ground <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> (AAGPS). Upon exposure to 50 &# 0176;C, the aforementioned hydration products of AAGBS pastes convert to C 3 AH 6, leading to a rapid deterioration in the strength of the paste. In contrast, no strength loss was detected in AAGPS pastes following exposure to 50 &# 0176;C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory and outdoor exposure site studies on belite-rich cement concrete with <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder and fly ash. The parameters studied included strength, hydration heat, ultimate elongation, Young’s modulus, and adiabatic in temperature. The experimental results showed that belite-rich cement resulted in a higher rate of strength development of mortar and concrete at later ages when compared with that of moderate-heat Portland cement. And the hydration heat of belite-rich cement is lower than that of reference. This is due to the different phase composition of the two cements. Belite-rich cement contains less C 3 S but more C 2 S than moderate-heat Portland cement. In addition, belite-rich cement concrete with <b>phosphorous</b> <b>slag</b> powder and fly ash exhibited better performances than those of moderate-heat Portland cement concrete. Intorduction Belite-rich cement (BC) is a new environmentally friendly and energy efficient binder used in concrete manufacturing. BC has been found to have some superior properties as compared to ordinary Portland cement or moderate-heat Portland cement (MHC) such as better durability, higher strength at later ages, increased resistance to sulfate attack, and lower hydration heat[1 - 3]. Based on thes...|$|E
