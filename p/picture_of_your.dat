Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter provide advertisers with information about the likes and dislikes of their consumers. This technique is crucial, as it provides the businesses with a [...] "target audience". With social networks, information relevant to the user's likes is available to businesses; who then advertise accordingly. Activities such as uploading a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> [...] "new Converse sneakers to Facebook" [...] {{is an example of a}} COBRA. Electronic recommendations and appraisals are a convenient manner to have a product promoted via [...] "consumer-to-consumer interactions. An example of eWOM would be an online hotel review; the hotel company can have two possible outcomes based on their service. A good service would result in a positive review which gets the hotel free advertising via social media. However, a poor service will result in a negative consumer review which can potentially harm the company's reputation.|$|E
