(It is hard to associate this with recent political events. 1,382 people were burned by <b>petrol</b> in the <b>UK</b> from 2003-2007; an average of 5 per week.

40|$|Environmental Context: There {{is growing}} concern that lead (Pb) in the {{environment}} may cause adverse health effects in human populations. We investigated the combined use of isotopic abundance and isotopic dilution {{to show how the}} origins of soil Pb and soil characteristics affect lability. Soil pH and soil Pb content are the dominant controls on Pb lability; the lability of recent petrol-derived Pb {{is similar to that of}} other sources in urban soils but greater than geogenic Pb in rural roadside topsoils. Lability of lead (Pb) in soils is influenced by both soil properties and source(s) of contamination. We investigated factors controlling Pb lability in soils from (i) land adjacent to a major rural road, (ii) a sewage processing farm and (iii) an archive of the geochemical survey of London.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the variety of contractual arrangements in use in the <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> industry between refiners/wholesalers and their retailers, and assess their respective properties. Section 2 provides a brief account of the evolution of the main contractual options over the past two decades, emphasizing both the process of dynamic change which characterized the choice of organizational form, and the competitive element in such choice (i. e. how changes by one company appear to set in motion a process of adjustment by other companies). The profile of each contract type is outlined in Section 3; the main differences across types are then analysed in an agency framework, with emphasis on the risk-sharing and the incentive properties – explicit and implicit – of each format (Sections 4 and 5) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically tests whether Irish and <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> {{and diesel}} markets are characterised by {{asymmetric}} pricing behaviour. The econometric assessment uses threshold autoregressive models and a dataset of monthly refined oil and retail prices covering the period 1997 to mid- 2009. A methodological note is {{included on the}} importance of the specification of the number of possible regimes. In particular, the possibility of conflicting price pressures arising from short-run dynamics in retail prices and responses to disequilibrium errors needs to be explicitly modelled. For both the Irish and UK liquid fuel markets at national levels, the paper concludes that {{there is no evidence to}} support the “rockets and feathers” hypothesis that retail prices rise faster than they fall in response to changes in oil prices. It is still possible that a lack of competition at a more local level may accommodate asymmetric pricing behaviour. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMeeting EU {{targets for}} {{renewable}} transport fuels by 2020 will necessitate a large increase in bioenergy feedstocks. Although deployment of first generation biofuels {{has been the}} major response to meeting these targets {{they are subject to}} wide debate on their sustainability leading to the development of second generation technologies which use lignocellulosic feedstocks. Second generation biofuel can be subdivided into those from dedicated bioenergy crops (DESGB), e. g. miscanthus, or those from co-products (CPSGB) such as cereal straw. Potential supply of cereal straw as a feedstock for CPSGB's is uncertain in England due to the difficulty in obtaining data and the uncertainty in current estimates. An on-farm survey of 249 farms (Cereal, General Cropping and Mixed) in England was performed and linked with Farm Business Survey data to estimate current straw use and potential straw availability. No significant correlations between harvested grain and straw yields were found for wheat and oilseed rape and only a weak correlation was observed for barley. In England there is a potential cereal straw supply of 5. 27  Mt from arable farm types; 3. 82  Mt are currently used and 1. 45  Mt currently chopped and incorporated. If currently chopped and incorporated cereal straw from arable farm types was converted into bioethanol, this could represent 1. 5 % of the <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> consumption by energy equivalence. The variations in regional straw yields (t ha− 1) have a great effect on the England supply of straw and the potential amount of bioethanol that can be produced...|$|R
40|$|Alluvial {{soils are}} {{reservoirs}} of metal contaminants such as Pb that originate {{from many different}} sources and are integrated temporally and spatially through erosional and depositional processes. In this study the source, lability and solubility of Pb was examined {{in a range of}} alluvial soils from the middle and lower River Trent and its tributary the River Dove using Pb isotope apportionment and isotopic dilution. All samples were collected within 10 m of the river bank to represent the soil that is most likely to be remobilised during bank erosion. Paired samples were taken from the topsoil (0 - 15 cm) and subsoil (35 - 50 cm) to assess differences with depth. Lead concentrations in soil ranged from 43 to 1282 mg/kg. The lability of soil Pb varied between 9 - 56 % of total metal concentration whilst Pb concentrations in pore water varied between 0. 2 and 6. 5 µg/L. There was little difference in the % Pb lability between paired top and sub soils, possibly because soil characteristics such as pH, iron oxides and clay content were generally similar; a result of the recycling of eroded and deposited soils within the river system. Soil pH was found to be negatively correlated with % Pb lability. Source apportionment using 206 Pb/ 207 Pb and 208 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios showed that the isotopic ratios of Pb in the total, labile and solution pools fitted along a mixing line between Broken Hill Type (‘BHT’) Pb, used as an additive in <b>UK</b> <b>petrol,</b> and the local coal/Sourthern Pennine ore Pb. Various anomalies were found in the Pb isotopes of the bankside alluvial soils which were explained by point source pollution. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} (i) the isotopic composition of Pb in the total soil pool and the labile/solution pools and (ii) the isotopic composition of Pb in the labile and solution pools, suggesting an enrichment of recent non-Pennine sources of Pb entering the soils in the labile and solution pools...|$|R
40|$|In <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> retailing, the {{vertical}} relationship between manufacturer (refiner/wholesaler) and retailer {{is governed by}} a menu of possible contracts, characterized by different typical unit margins. In ‘agency’ terms, each contract type thus incorporates an implicit risk/incentives trade-off, with higher margins providing higher-powered incentives for retailer’s effort, but also increasing {{his share of the}} risk. At the same time, the difference in the margins also suggests a possible ‘strategic’ function of contracts: in an oligopolistic context, manufacturers might choose a particular contract type with the objective of indirectly influencing the final price set by the retailer, and possibly reduce the intensity of competition in the market game. This paper addresses the issue of contract-assignment, proposing a model where both ‘agency’ and ‘strategic’ considerations are featured in contract design. Agency considerations are explicitly incorporated in a simple duopoly, with manufacturers delegating the retail function to risk-averse retailers, and retailers competing against one another in prices. The manufacturers’ profits (payoffs) are thus obtained as the net result of two distinct influences: the agency costs of delegation, which are higher the more risk-averse (or less able) the retailer; and the strategic benefits from delegating to such a retailer, in the form of higher wholesale and retail prices. The key result of the model is that the net effect of these costs and benefits depends crucially on the intensity of local competition. Where competition is slack, the agency cost borne by the delegating manufacturer is not offset by the benefit to be gained by signalling his commitment to a less aggressive pricing strategy. The outcome is different, however, where competitive conditions are locally tight, i. e. final demand for each retailer is very sensitive to the other retailer’s price. In that case, the agency cost of employing a more risk-averse retailer is outweighed for the manufacturer by the strategic benefit from being able to commit to a higher retail price. This generates a series of testable propositions in the context of petrol retailing...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques {{are still}} popular, partly because cheques remain {{free of charge}} to {{personal}} customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods, including electronic methods. The vast majority of retailers in the United Kingdom and many in France have not accepted cheques {{as a means of}} payment for several years, and cheque guarantee cards are no longer issued. For example, Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at its <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> stations. This was soon followed by other major fuel retailers, such as Texaco, BP, and Total. Asda announced in April 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in the London area, and Boots announced in September 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in Sussex and Surrey. Currys (and other stores in the DSGi group) and WH Smith also no longer accept cheques. Cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past, or at most, a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due (for example, music teachers, driving instructors, children's sports lessons, small shops, schools). The UK Payments Council announced in December 2009 that cheques would be phased out by October 2018, but only if adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. Concerns were expressed, however, by charities and older people, who are still heavy users of cheques, and replacement plans were criticized as open to fraud. [...] It was therefore announced by the UK Payments Council in July 2011 that the cheque would not be eliminated. 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth £472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom in 2016 according to Payments UK.|$|R
40|$|Since 1989, a {{red kite}} Milvus milvus {{reintroduction}} programme has been underway in the United Kingdom, with 4 - 6 week old nestlings brought into captivity and held for 6 - 8 weeks before reintroduction. As scavengers, red kites may consume unretrieved game, and ingest shot or lead (Pb) fragments in their prey's flesh. We evaluated exposure to Pb in captive and wild red kites by taking blood samples from 125 captive young red kites prior to release, through analysing 264 pellets (regurgitated by wild birds) collected {{from under a}} roost site, and analysing Pb concentrations in livers and/or bones of 87 red kites found dead between 1995 and 2003. Lead isotope analyses of livers were also conducted {{in an effort to}} identify Pb exposure routes. Forty-six (36. 8 %) kites sampled prior to release had elevated blood Pb concentrations (201 - 3340 μg l- 1). The source of this Pb was probably small fragments of lead ammunition in the carcasses of birds or mammals either fed to the nestlings by their parents or, more likely, subsequently whilst in captivity. Once released, kites were also exposed to lead shot in their food, and a minimum of 1. 5 - 2. 3 % of regurgitated pellets contained Pb gunshot. Seven of 44 red kites found dead or that were captured sick and died within a few days had elevated (> 6 mg kg- 1 dry weight [d. w. ]) liver Pb concentrations, and six of these (14 %) had concentrations of > 15 mg kg- 1 d. w., compatible with fatal Pb poisoning. Post-mortem analyses indicated that two of these birds had died of other causes (poisoning by rodenticide and a banned agricultural pesticide); the remaining four (9 %) probably died of Pb poisoning. Bone samples from 86 red kites showed a skewed distribution of Pb concentration, and 18 samples (21 %) had Pb concentrations > 20 mg kg- 1 d. w., indicating elevated exposure to Pb at some stage in the birds' life. Lead isotopic signatures (Pb 208 / 206; Pb 206 / 207) in liver samples of the majority of kites were compatible with those found in lead shot extracted from regurgitated pellets. Lead isotope ratios found in the livers of kites with very low Pb concentrations were distinct from <b>UK</b> <b>petrol</b> Pb isotopic signatures, indicating that birds were exposed to little residual petrol Pb. We conclude that the primary source of Pb to which red kites are exposed is lead ammunition (shotgun pellets or rifle bullets), or fragments thereof, in their food sources; in some cases exposure appears sufficient to be fatal. We make recommendations to reduce Pb poisoning in both captive and wild red kites and other scavenging species...|$|R
