40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that long surviving, enhanced (AS X AUG) F 1 rat kidneys residing in a primary AS recipient are not acutely rejected if transferred into a second AS recipient. The reduced immunogenicity of the retransplanted graft was attributed to a depletion of incompatible <b>passenger</b> <b>cells.</b> It is shown here that if the primary AS recipient is made chimeric by x irradiation and injection of (AS X AUG) F 1 bone marrow cells, transfer of the long surviving, enhanced graft into a second AS recipient provokes acute graft rejection comparable to that observed when normal (AS X AUG) F 1 kidneys are transplanted into untreated AS recipients. Transplantation of passenger cell-depleted AUG kidneys into AS recipients leads to graft rejection, with a median survival time of 22 d. Treatment of these recipients with as little as 1. 5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide for 14 d induces prolonged graft survival. By contrast, {{five times as much}} cyclophosphamide treatment is required to induce prolonged survival of normal AUG kidneys (i. e., containing incompatible <b>passenger</b> <b>cells)</b> transplanted to AS recipients.

40|$|Neonatal {{skin grafts}} have the {{capacity}} to outlive adult skin grafts, especially in situations involving H- 2 antigen compatibility of donor and host. Neonatal grafts can induce a state of tolerance in their hosts; in many cases, recipients exposed to neonatal allografts fail to reject adult grafts from the same donor strain. In the H- 2 antigen compatible C 3 H ↔ CBA combination, survival of neonatal skin grafts is correlated with the emigration of passenger leukocytes from the graft vasculature. Removal of a neonatal C 3 H skin graft has no effect on the unresponsive state of the host with respect to subsequent grafts of adult tissue. Donor leukocytes arc present in various tissues of the tolerant CBA host, and treatments (such as irradiation) that eliminate the normal leukocytic population of a neonatal C 3 H skin graft also eliminate the likelihood of skin graft survival and block the establishment of tolerance. In the C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) male-to-female system, survival of neonatal skin grafts is not correlated with emigration of <b>passenger</b> <b>cells.</b> Removal of a neonatal male B 6 graft breaks the tolerance of the female host. The tolerant female is not a leukocyte chimera, and irradiation of the neonatal graft or replacement of the <b>passenger</b> <b>cells</b> with adult male cells does not eliminate the likelihood of graft survival nor does it block the establishment of tolerance. Moreover, <b>passenger</b> <b>cells</b> play no part in tolerance to Sk antigen incompatible grafts; Sk (skin-specific) antigens do not occur in lymphocytes. The anomalous survival of neonatal skin rafts, evidently promoted by different mechanisms in different donor-host combinations, remains to be clarified. And it remains also to be determined whether the idiosyncratic performance of certain neonatal <b>passenger</b> <b>cells</b> has any physiological relevance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMore than 150 Hydrogen {{refueling}} {{stations were}} {{built around the}} world in the past 10 years.

These results are compatible with the hypothesis that kidney parenchyma, although carrying major histocompatibility complex specificity is able to induce T-independent but not T-dependent alloimmunity. A corollary is that <b>passenger</b> <b>cells</b> are responsible for exciting the T-dependent allimmune response normally observed after grafing.

Barényi, explained in detail how conventional steering, steering column, steering wheel, suspension and body should, in his opinion, be changed in order to enhance safety for the car's occupants.

50|$|Great {{effort is}} taken to keep the mass of an {{electric}} vehicle {{as low as possible}} to improve its range and endurance. However, the weight and bulk of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle, reducing range and leading to longer braking distances. However, in a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits despite having a negative effect on the car's performance. They also use up interior space if packaged ineffectively. If stored under the <b>passenger</b> <b>cell,</b> not only is this not the case, they also lower the vehicles's center of gravity, increasing driving stability, thereby lowering the risk of an accident through loss of control.An accident in a 2000 lb vehicle will on average cause about 50% more injuries to its occupants than a 3000 lb vehicle. In a single car accident, and for the other car in a two car accident, the increased mass causes an increase in accelerations and hence an increase in the severity of the accident.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} which {{cells in the}} human and rat pancreas and islets express class I and II histocompatibility complex proteins, double indirect immunofluorescence and the Staphylococcus aureus rosette method were used.

These results suggest that 1) a variety of pancreas and islet nonendocrine cells can express class I and II proteins, 2) normal pancreatic islet endocrine cells not only express class I proteins but also class II proteins, and 3) in vitro islet culture results in reduced expression of class II proteins by islet B cells...|$|R

Work began in earnest on the Ponton cars in 1951 with a design focused on passenger comfort and safety. Their as an urgency to replace the dated pre war designed W136 Type 170. Head of the design team was Dr. Fritz Nallinger. Styling was headed by Karl Wilfert. Daimler-Benz incorporated into the design criteria a unitary body frame body, based on the [...] "three-box design". Part of the design team was Béla Barényi. Barényi designed the concept of the crumple zone, and the non-deformable <b>passenger</b> <b>cell</b> into the design. The crumple zones patent 854157, granted in 1952, describes the decisive feature of passive safety. Barényi questioned the opinion prevailing until then, that a safe car had to be rigid. He divided the car body into three sections: the rigid non-deforming passenger compartment and the crumple zones during collision. This design concept was proven by ADAC crash test facility in June, 2010 when a Mercedes Ponton was crash tested in their Technical Centre in Landsberg am Lech, confirming the existence of the design incorporated into the vehicle. This made for a milestone in car design with front and rear crumple zones for absorbing kinetic energy on impact.|$|E
