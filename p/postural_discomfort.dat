40|$|Agriculture {{production}} is the back bone of Indian economy and for enhancing agriculture production weeding operation is {{plays an important}} role. Most of the agriculture workers are doing weeding operation by traditional methods that why they are suffered from <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort.</b> <b>Postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> {{at the time of}} weeding affect on productivity of work and efficiency of workers. <b>Postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> is plays and important role for increase the productivity and efficiency of agriculture workers. Hence, present study was undertaken with an objective to develop scale for measuring <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> and satisfaction of agriculture workers regarding working performance and to evaluate the developed scale by agriculture workers. As the scale was found to be reliable and valid, the developed scale will serve as a scientific tool for measurement of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> of agriculture workers after weeding operation...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{creatine}} kinase (CK) variations during work and subjective assessments of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> were analysed in 30 workers assigned to three different tasks in a rolling mill. After {{four days of}} work, serum CK levels were significantly increased above control levels. No difference {{was found between the}} tasks studied. Inter-individual variability in CK response was large: a marked CK increase was only seen in 21 workers, while 5 workers showed a marked CK decrease. The <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> sensations increased with work in each group, with their location in the body being related to the characteristics of each task or workplace. No relationship was found between the <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> scores and CK changes. Results showed that determination of an individual baseline CK level was difficult to achieve in an occupational setting. It is concluded that CK variations cannot reliably be used in the field for detection of individuals exposed to excessive postural constraints. Their use as a screening tool in groups of workers assigned to similar tasks deserves further study. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{proposed}} a method for objective assessment of postural comfort (Kölsch et al., 2003). We defined comfort as the range of postures that is voluntarily assumed despite the availability of other postures. Designing user interfaces {{within the limits of}} comfort zones can avert risks associated with unknown alternative use patters of the interface. Here we report on a user study that investigated the comfort zone for free-hand gestures in the horizontal plane at about stomach height. This space is of particular interest to novel technologies such as gesture recognition and virtual reality. The results are in line with previous studies on <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort,</b> but improve on resolution and are not based on subjective, questionnaire-based data acquisition. This study also serves as an example for how to design studies for comfort evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{right-handed}} male {{university students}} performed a full factorial experiment, consisting of three forearm rotation angles (60 % prone and supine, and neutral), two elbow angles (45 °and 90 °), three humeral rotation angles (45 °, 90 ° and 135 °), and two upper arm angles (45 ° flexion and neutral). The task was a one-second pronation torque of 20 % Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) relative to MVC at the standard {{position of the}} arm, 15 times per minute for 5 minutes, at each <b>postural</b> combination. <b>Discomfort</b> rating {{after the end of}} each five minute exertion was recorded on a visual analogue scale. A repeated measures ANCOVA on discomfort score indicated that endurance time was a significant covariate. Other significant factors were upper arm flexion angle, forearm rotation angle, and the interactions of upper arm*elbow and humeral rotation*forearm*endurance time. A supplementary experiment showed that in some of the deviated postures combinations the subjects required additional muscle force to achieve the 20 % MVC from the original testing posture. Such data can be helpful for designing workplaces and developing biomechanical models, especially for assessment of designs in virtual environments. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} trunk muscle endurance training on the perception of back postural fa-tigue and performance of a laparoscopic task. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one medical students (18 men and 13 women) with no laparoscopic surgical experience {{were randomly assigned to}} either a training group or a control group. Participants in the train-ing group underwent a 6 -week, 18 -session trunk (abdominal and back muscle) endurance training program, whereas participants in the control group did not. Performance by all participants was assessed on a simu-lated laparoscopic task under varying conditions of low back postural fatigue, {{both before and after the}} train-ing program. Results: Participants in the training group showed significant improvements in trunk endurance after the 6 -week trunk endurance training program (P 0. 05), whereas those in the control group did not. The im-provements in trunk endurance were accompanied by significantly reduced perceptions of discomfort (P. 001) and fewer errors during performance of the laparoscopic task (P 0. 02), whereas no significant changes occurred for the control group (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Increasing trunk endurance can reduce <b>postural</b> fatigue and <b>discomfort</b> during simulated lap-aroscopic tasks, which may assist in the management of errors during laparoscopy...|$|R
40|$|Does greater {{strength}} {{capacity in}} the shoulder-complex afford increased protection against regionalized fatigue and discomfort induced by sustained awkward arm postures in light-weight manual assembly environments? This question was addressed by testing the relationship between differences in shoulder complex strength capacity, produced by variations in arm posture within a subject, and among subjects assuming equivalent arm postures, and severity of fatigue and discomfort sensed during a low-exertion manual performance task. Experimental findings showed that: (a) awkward arm postures produced substantial and rapid onset of <b>postural</b> fatigue and <b>discomfort</b> during a light-weight manual performance task where strength demands were low (i. e., less than 15 percent of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)), (b) variations in strength capability found among arm postures within an individual subject, or 3 mong subjects assuming the same arm posture, did not affect onset of substantial fatigue or discomfort when hands are postured near or above shoulder level, and (c) postures which simply appeared to be awkward, or which compromised strength capacity (e. g., working with the arm {{to the side of}} the body, or aligned in the coronal plane), did not necessarily increase discomfort of fatigue. Our findings suggest caution against sole reliance upon population or individual worker upper-extremity strength capabilities as predictors of fatigue and discomfort in the shoulder complex when manual exertions are small (e. g., light-weight manual assembly activities involving small parts or small hand-tools) and hands are postured at or above shoulder level...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} justify the costs of using ergonomically {{designed}} workplaces, {{it is necessary to}} relate improved posture to improved performance. This experiment used twelve subjects, four in each of three postural conditions. Subjects inspected printed circuit boards for 3 h with two five-minute breaks per hour. Both postural condition and time on task affected measures of posture, measures of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort,</b> and performance. Poor defect detection perfor-mance was associated with increased forward inclination of the trunk, increased perceived discomfort, and increased frequency of posture changes. Subjects tried to maintain their defect detection performance over time by spending longer on each board, but they were only partially successful. In addition to providing positive evidence {{to justify the}} cost of ergonomic changes in posture, the results provide a simple and consistent set of measures to be used in future work...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} are {{on top of}} occupational diseases and manicure belongs to a professional group exposed to a risk of acquiring any type of these disorders. Objective: To describe the frequency of musculoskeletal complaints and associated factors in manicures. Method: It was conducted a crosssectional and descriptive study with one hundred manicures, we used the map of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> as an evaluation tool. We calculated frequencies and percentages of age, length of service, and regions with more discomfort of the volunteers. For associations between anatomical regions, age and length of employment was used chi-square. Results: There was an association of discomfort of the left hand with age of women. It was observed that 33 % of manicures were aged between 21 and 30 years old, and 56 % were from 1 to 10 years in this occupation. Conclusion: There was not much discomfort in anatomical regions statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{introduction}} of computerized numeric control (CNC) technology in manufacturing industries has revolutionized the production process, {{but there are}} some health and safety problems associated with these machines. The present study aimed to investigate the extent of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> in CNC machine operators, and the relationship of this discomfort to the display and control panel height, with a view to validate the anthropometric recommendation for the location of the display and control panel in CNC machines. Methods: The postural discomforts associated with CNC machines were studied in 122 male operators using Corlett and Bishop’s body part discomfort mapping, subject information, and discomfort level at various time intervals from starting to end of a shift. This information was collected using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was carried out using ANOVA. Results: Neck discomfort due to the positioning of the machine displays, and shoulder and arm discomfort due to the position-ing of controls were identifi ed as common health issues in the operators of these machines. The study revealed that 45. 9 % of machine operators reported discomfort in the lower back, 41. 8 % in the neck, 22. 1 % in the upper-back, 53. 3 % in the shoulder and arm, and 21. 3 % of the operators reported discomfort in the leg. Conclusion: Discomfort increased with the progress of the day and was highest {{at the end of a}} shift; subject age had no effect o...|$|E
40|$|This study {{consists}} of a survey and experiment to identify the postural risks associated with laptop use in non-traditional work settings. The survey gauged the prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort among 186 college students, and also identified the configurations in which {{male and female students}} most frequently use laptop computers. Previous work suggests that females report a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort associated with laptop use than males, and the results of the survey confirmed this, but only for neck and shoulder discomfort. Differences in how males and females reported working were also revealed, with females more likely to use a laptop positioned on the lap and also while sitting with their legs crossed. Males, on the other hand, {{were more likely to report}} using a laptop while sitting in positions that required large trunk deviations, such as bending over a coffee table or to the side. The experiment, which was based on the survey findings, explored the reasons why females reported experiencing more frequent neck and shoulder discomfort when using a laptop than did males. It was hypothesized that this was because females use laptop computers more frequently in deviated postures. Three configurations that females reported working in more frequently than males in the survey were selected for testing, each within the context of a bed/mattress. <b>Postural</b> analysis and <b>discomfort</b> data was collected for 36 participants (18 males, 18 females) performing a 25 -minute typing task in each of the three conditions to determine whether these configurations placed the participants in highly deviated postures. Gender comparisons of postural deviation and self-reported discomfort ratings after completion of a typing task in each position were made. Both male and female participants reported very low levels of discomfort in each of the three conditions, and there was no significant gender difference. Participants displayed highly 	   deviated postures, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and wrists, in all three conditions and there were few gender differences. Any gender differences that were discovered were not consistently in favor of one gender. Males had a slight tendency to work in more deviated postures than females, however both genders were in undesirable postures for much of the experiment. It is most likely that any increased prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort in females compared to males is due to their choice of working configuration, rather than inherent differences in posture. However, there are a number of other factors that may account for any gender differences in musculoskeletal discomfort, including the finding that females report spending more hours per week using a computer. Further study to identify the contribution of each factor, both in males and females, would be valuable in order to understand the impact that working configuration has on musculoskeletal discomfort and injur...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify instantaneous and cumulative spinal loads in orthodontic practice. The study consisted of two parts. The first part of the study included the mailing out of the standardized nordic questionnaire to all orthodontists residing in the province of Alberta, Canada to find out the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) within the occupation. There was a 56 percent response rate: 32 respondents out of 57 distributed questionnaires. Of the 32 respondents, 19 (59 %) reported low back trouble, 18 (56 %) neck trouble and 15 (47 %) shoulder trouble. The second part of the study included a sample of graduate orthodontic students (n = 9) from the University of Alberta. The subjects were videotaped performing their regular duties and the recorded postures were printed for biomechanical analysis of instantaneous compression and shear loads on the low back and neck. Cumulative loads were calculated from the instantaneous loads. A <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> questionnaire was also administered to the subjects to be completed at four different times during the work day. The results showed the average instantaneous lumbosacral compression loads for males and females to be 1, 383 N and 936 N respectively. The average daily cumulative lumbosacral compression loads for males and females were 16. 2 MNs and 9. 9 MNs respectively. The conclusion arises from the results that instantaneous loads are not indicative of cumulative loads, particularly for the occupation of orthodontistry. Furthermore, prolonged static sitting exerts large cumulative loads on the spine, which is compelling evidence to show and confirm that orthodontic practice is of high risk for MSDs.

40|$|By {{request of}} COBA Plastics Ltd of Fleckney, Leicestershire an {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} test the effect of 8 different types of floor matting on objective and subjective measures related to thermal comfort and fatigue in comparison to standing directly on concrete slabs. As a compromise between precision, duration and cost {{it was decided to}} perform a study in the laboratory ensuring identical conditions in all tests. Participants in the study performed diverse light tasks while standing for 90 minutes either directly on the concrete slabs or with a mat on the concrete. Objective data (temperatures of the foot, leg and body) were obtained as well as participants’ perceptions of their (dis) comfort and fatigue. None of the temperature measurements showed significant differences between the conditions which was attributed to the limited test duration of 90 minutes and the large day to day variability of these measurements on the same participants. However a number of the subjective (dis) comfort sensations did show statistically significant improvements related to mat use. Firstly the thermal comfort vote for the whole body showed less discomfort when standing on the mats. Votes moved from slightly uncomfortable towards neutral in that case. This improved whole body thermal comfort was accompanied by a reduced <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> in a number of body parts. The discomfort vote for the lower legs, the upper legs and the lower back all improved (i. e. discomfort reduced) statistically significantly, when using a mat. The lower back and lower legs showed the largest improvement. No clear differentiation in the effects could be made for the individual mat types tested. From the test results it can be concluded that the use of the mats has a beneficial effect on the experienced thermal and postural comfort of the workers. Given the relative short duration of the present 90 minutes test compared to a full working day, a larger benefit can be expected for full working day exposures...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{periods in}} sitting or {{standing}} may negatively influence worker health. Integration of sit-stand workstations {{has attempted to}} mitigate these deleterious effects, and has generated positive results in terms of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort,</b> injury risk and worker fatigue. Identification of how identical tasks are affected by sitting and standing is necessary {{to take advantage of}} loading differences between these configurations. The purpose of this research was to determine if differences in workplace configurations between seated and standing postures created changes in posture or muscular activity levels during manual materials handling tasks. Twenty male and twenty female participants performed four manual materials handling tasks: a 40 N static push, a 40 N static pull, a weighted bottle transfer set at 15 % of the participant’s maximal arm elevation force, and a light assembly task in sitting and standing. Upper extremity electromyography was collected at 8 sites, and changes in local joint moments and body discomfort were calculated. Interactions between task and sit/stand configuration resulted in increases of up to 500 % in some joint moments, 94 % in EMG activity and 880 % in some local body discomfort regions when tasks were completed in sitting. A main effect of sitting appeared primarily in joint moments and muscle activity, and generally resulted in increased loading in sitting. Important exceptions existed, which included resultant wrist joint loading 8. 2 times larger in standing, and foot/shank discomfort increasing by up to 609 %. Task differentially affected all EMG outputs, as well as most local joint moments and body discomfort regions. Future recommendations regarding upper extremity exposures during manual materials handling tasks should consider placing workers in standing postures instead of seated ones to minimize musculoskeletal loading to the upper extremity. In addition, the effects of task and sit/stand configuration should be considered in order to leverage differences between these positions, with tasks in standing generally resulting in decreased musculoskeletal disorder risks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The motion {{complexity}} of modern vehicles may cause several symptoms as nausea, headache, <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> and unsteadiness that are classified within the broad definition of motion sickness (Golding, 2005). Whereas {{the scientific community}} renews efforts to develop some behavioural and pharmaceutical techniques to sup- press motion sickness, this problem is not resolved yet. Interestingly, several authors proposed that unpleasant odors could contribute to motion sickness (Glaser, 1959; Turner and Griffin, 1999; Fessler and Arguello, 2004). However, the relation between olfactory system and motion sickness has not been previously investigated. For this purpose, subjects were recruited among healthy and non-smoker women fulfilling Golding’s (1998) Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ). Subjects were divided in two groups: (1) subjects who {{are very sensitive to}} motion sickness (N= 10), (2) subjects who are not sensitive to motion sickness (N= 10). We compared with usual psychophysics methods the olfactory sensitivity (i. e. threshold testing with the odor of n-butanol), and the self-ratings of intensity, familiarity and hedonic valence of a panel of seventeen odorants. Our results showed: (i) a poor olfactory sensitivity in subjects sensitive to motion sickness (Intergroup T-test, T= 2. 63), (ii) that motion sickness sensitive subjects judged the odor of leather as more unpleasant than the other group (Inter- group T-test, T=- 3. 53), (iii) motion sickness sensitive subjects judged the odor of petrol as more unpleasant (Intergroup T-test, T=- 3. 46) and more familiar than the other group (Intergroup T- test, T= 2. 43). The present results pointed out some differences on olfactory perception relative to motion sickness susceptibility. Herz (2005) high- lighted that the emotional context in which an odor is encountered could influence odor hedonic perception and odor-related behaviour. Thus, we could proposed that subjects who are very sensitive to motion sickness judge odours of leather and petrol as unpleasant because it remind them the bad experience of motion sickness in vehicles, in particular in cars. In this way, we could explain the poor olfactory sensitivity of these subjects as a defence reaction to con- tend to motion sickness. Although several points of our results need to be deeper explore, this study provided support for new techniques to help motion sickness sensitive subjects, based on olfactory perception...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar as repercussões do trabalho de mulheres e homens analistas de sistemas na saúde. MÉTODOS: Trata-se de estudo exploratório de delineamento transversal, abrangendo 553 analistas de duas empresas de processamento de dados da região metropolitana de São Paulo. Foram {{realizadas}} análises ergonômicas do trabalho, entrevistas semi-estruturadas e preenchimento de questionários para auto-aplicação. A análise dos dados baseou-se em tabelas de contingência com qui-quadrado a 5 % de significância e razões de prevalência e seus intervalos de confiança segundo gênero. RESULTADOS: As mulheres constituíram 40, 7 % do grupo estudado, sendo mais jovens que os homens. A presença de filhos foi maior entre os homens, embora o tempo diário dedicado às tarefas domésticas tenha sido maior entre as mulheres. Observou-se predomínio dos homens nas funções de chefia. Fatores de incômodo, com freqüência semelhante entre homens e mulheres, foram: sobrecarga de trabalho devido a prazos curtos; alto grau de responsabilidade; exigência mental do trabalho; e complexidade da tarefa. Fatores de incômodo predominantes em mulheres foram: postura desconfortável; maior exposição ao computador; e presença de equipamento obsoleto. As mulheres relataram maior freqüência de sintomas visuais, musculares e relacionados a estresse; maior insatisfação com o trabalho; maior fadiga física e mental. CONCLUSÕES: O estudo sugere que as repercussões na saúde das analistas de sistemas estão associadas às exigências do trabalho e ao papel da mulher na sociedade. Os resultados destacam a importância de estudos sobre saúde, trabalho e gênero, em analisar a interseção entre a esfera produtiva e a doméstica. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} health impact of working conditions among {{male and female}} systems analysts. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 533 systems analysts of two data analysis companies located {{in the metropolitan area}} of São Paulo were studied. Data was collected using work ergonomic assessments, individual and group semi-structured interviews and a self-applied questionnaire. Data analysis was based on contingency tables, Chi-square values at 5 % level, prevalence rates and ratios, and their 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of the participants, 40. 7 % were women who on average were younger that the studied men (59. 6 % of women and 39 % of men were in the age range 25 to 34). Though fatherhood was more frequently seen among men (57. 6 % x 34. 2 % for women), women spent more time with household tasks, including children care. There were more men in leading management positions. Work-related discomfort factors were seen in both sexes at similar frequencies. Men most commonly complained of work overload due to tight deadlines, high degree of responsibility, mental strain, and work complexity. Women more frequently complained of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort,</b> higher exposure to video display terminal, and obsolete equipment. Women reported more visual, musculoskeletal and stress related symptoms, and higher work dissatisfaction and mental fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the health impact on female systems analysts is associated with the work demands and the women's social role. There is a need of further studies associating health, work and gender and an assessment of the intersection between the domestic and productive roles...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the organisational nature of the construction industry, and due to the dynamic nature of construction activities, construction workers are exposed to Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) risk factors as an intrinsic part of their daily activities. Plasterers are one of the trades that experience high prevalence rates of the disorders when compared with other trades within the industry. Consequently, the quality of their work is affected. Additionally, due to associated absenteeism and early retirement, and costs associated with treatment, compensation, and insurance costs, the plasterer, their employer, and the economy experience a significant financial burden. Upon developing a research risk assessment protocol, it was used as a guide to develop an assessment methodology to evaluate if plasterers working in Ireland were at an increased risk of developing WRMSDs because of their tasks and working conditions. Psychophysical, physiological, and biomechanical assessment methods were selected based on their suitability to evaluate WRMSD risk. Visual Analogue Discomfort Scales (VADS) was used to evaluate psychophysical stress; Heart Rate Analysis (HRA) was used to evaluate physiological stress, and Electromyography (EMG) was used to evaluate biomechanical stress [...] The VADS survey consisted of 100 mm linear scales, a body map and questionnaires. It was used as an assessment method on active construction sites to measure subjective qualitative judgments of <b>postural</b> <b>discomfort</b> to determine if plasterers experienced discomfort {{over the course of a}} working day and working week. Further analysis of the VADS data was carried out to evaluate if the type of work being carried out, and the type of conditions plasterers worked in, influenced levels of discomfort intensity. Additionally, it was used to provide a snapshot representation of the type of work being carried out, and the type of conditions plasterers work in over a five-day work period. The dependent unit of psychophysical response is intensity of discomfort represented as a measure of millimetres ranging from 0 - 100 mm. Eighteen plasterers participated in the VADS study. HRA and EMG were used to evaluate plasterersÂ¿ responses when carrying out a plastering activity in four simulated working environments. Each environment was set up to represent combinations of independent variables - standing surfaces (e. g. ground, stilts, trestle, and hop-up), plastering surfaces (e. g. wall and ceiling), plastering tasks (e. g. Mix Plaster, Load Mortarboard, Load Hawk, Load Trowel and Plaster), and mortarboard stand heights (e. g. 775 mm and 1270 mm). HRA was used to evaluate and compare each plastererÂ¿s physiological response when they carried out a wet-plastering task in each of the four assessment workstations. The dependant variables of physiological response were mean heart rate (bpm), Heart Rate Zone (HRZ) activity, Relative Heart Rate (RHR) and Recommended Rest Period (RRP). EMG analysis was used to evaluate muscle activity levels to evaluate the plasterersÂ¿ biomechanical response of for each for each sub-task for each variable condition. The muscles assessed were the right and left sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck, right and left trapezius muscles in the shoulder, and the right and left erector spinae muscles in the back. The dependent variable of biomechanical response was mean/maximum muscle activity level represented as a percentage of peak muscle activity. Statistical analysis was carried out to describe details about aspects of the sample population and compare independent variables with dependent variables. The results indicate that in most cases independent variables significantly influences change in the dependent variables and plastering activities and working conditions increase plasterersÂ¿ risk of developing WRMSDs. For example, in the VADS study (psychophysical analysis) it was found that plasterers experienced an increase in perceived discomfort intensity levels over five consecutive workdays. A decline in intensity levels was observed after a period of rest i. e. lunch break or overnight break. In the HRA study (physiological analysis), plasterers experienced the highest physiological stress when carrying out a wet-plastering activity on a wall while standing on the ground and a hop-up, and using a low mortarboard stand. When working on ceiling, plasterers experienced their lowest physiological stress when standing on stilts and using a high mortarboard stand. In the EMG study (biomechanical analysis), activity levels were highest when plasterers worked on a ceiling when compared with working on a wall. The neck muscles had the highest activity level when standing on a trestle, whereas the shoulder and back muscles had the highest activity levels when standing on the ground. The neck, shoulder, and back muscles had the highest activity levels when tasks were carried out when using the low mortarboard stand. The findings from the data analysis were used to provide recommendations for control interventions to minimise the adverse effects that the plastering task and working conditions has on the musculoskeletal system and decrease the probability of plasterers developing WRMSDs...|$|E
