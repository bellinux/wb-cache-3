5|$|Besides {{providing}} the <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defence, camouflage and thermoregulation.

5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} over the functions of Triceratops head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat, or display in courtship, with the latter thought now {{to be the most}} likely <b>primary</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are {{a group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the forebrain. The <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia.|$|E

5|$|The main {{change in}} {{structure}} from the 2nd-century army was {{the establishment of}} large escort armies (comitatus praesentales), typically containing 20,000–30,000 top-grade palatini troops. These were normally based near the imperial capitals: (Constantinople in the East, Milan in the West), thus far from the empire's borders. These armies' <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> was to deter usurpers, and they usually campaigned under the personal command of their emperors. The legions were split into smaller units comparable in size to the auxiliary regiments of the Principate. Infantry adopted the more protective equipment of the Principate cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} line (OL) consists of several players whose <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> is to block {{members of the}} defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of the {{offensive line}} is the center (C), {{who is responsible for}} snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.|$|E
5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's <b>primary</b> <b>function,</b> the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E

The station is served by {{regional}} trains that operate northwards via towns such as Tønsberg, Holmestrand and Drammen to Oslo Central Station and onwards via Oslo Airport to Hamar and Lillehammer, calling at several other smaller stations. Southwards, the trains serve Sandefjord, Larvik, Porsgrunn and Skien. Travel time to Oslo is 1 hour and 48 minutes, and to Oslo Airport it is 2 hours 23 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|A <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of the FMPU was the {{training}} of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Scottish people, {{like most of}} Catholic Europe, were {{increasingly}} concerned with prayers for the dead, necessary to speed passage from Purgatory to Heaven. The upper nobility began to turn from patronage for monasteries to the establishing collegiate churches to pray for them, such as Lord Dummond's foundation at Innerpeffray in 1508 and Lord Fleming's re-establishment at Biggar in 1546. Those lower down in society paid for shrines, priests and masses, leading to a proliferation of altars, clergy and services within existing churches. In the burghs the <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of craft guilds was {{to pay for the}} funerals and masses of their members. By the early sixteenth century St. Mary's in Dundee had perhaps 48 altars and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.|$|E
5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} form of {{political}} organisation in the Early Middle Ages, with competing minor kingdoms and fluid relationships of over and under kingdoms. The <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> of these kings was as war leaders, {{but there were also}} ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation.The unification of the Scots and Picts from the tenth century that produced the Kingdom of Alba, retained some of these ritual aspects in the coronation at Scone. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with Royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of Western European courts and later elements of their ritual and grandeur.|$|E
5|$|The Steam {{client was}} first made {{available}} for public beta testing in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, {{for which it was}} mandatory to install and use. At the time, Steam's <b>primary</b> <b>function</b> was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period. The system and website choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the latest version of Counter-Strike. In 2004, the World Opponent Network was shut down and replaced by Steam. The online features of games which required World Opponent Network ceased to work unless they were converted to Steam.|$|E
