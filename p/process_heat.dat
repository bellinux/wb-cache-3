This work compiles latest literatures in terms of thesis, journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on industrial <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> systems in the industrial sector. Different types of equipment used (i. e., recuperator, regenerators, heat wheels, heat pipes, economizers, etc.) and energy savings are reviewed in various industrial <b>processes</b> <b>heating.</b> Based on the review results, {{it is found that}} significant amounts of energy could be saved by using heat recovery system in the industrial <b>process</b> <b>heating.</b> By using recuperator up to 25 % energy can be saved in the furnace. In the case of boiler, by using economizers 10 % to 20 % energy can be saved. Economic analysis shows that the payback period of recuperator and economizer are normally less than 2 years. It is also found that the payback period is lower when operating hour is comparatively high...|$|R

To begin with, data for (i) classification of paper mills on the basis of size and feedstock used (ii) extent of cogeneration in paper mills (iii) annual paper production (feed stock wise) (iv) specific thermal energy requirement for <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> etc. have been collected. Annual <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> requirement for paper production (based on feed stock used) in paper mills in India has been estimated.

25|$|Heat is {{transferred}} either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy {{is transferred}} by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The {{distribution of energy}} from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection <b>process.</b> <b>Heat</b> is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid is circulated through the carrier pipes to the heat transfer vault. Inside the vault, heat is transferred throughout the medium through convection.|$|E

40|$|Nationwide <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> in the {{manufacturing}} sector accounts for 7, 815 trillion BTU of energy use annually; this is roughly one-third of the sector 2 Ì† 7 s total energy consumption [Energetics Incorporated, 2014]. The U. S. Department of Energy estimates that seventy percent of <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> is fueled by the onsite {{burning of fossil fuels}} [Energetics Incorporated, 2014]. These fuel-fired <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> applications are prime opportunities for heat recovery projects capable of saving energy and, consequently, reducing operating costs. This thesis evaluates different methods for heat recovery in the Milwaukee manufacturing facility of STRATTEC Security Corporation. As a basis for this work, the overall energy usage of the facility is evaluated and the largest <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling loads are identified. Systems that will be evaluated include the zinc melt furnace, the low pressure steam system and the chilled water system. The energy recovered can be used to improve the efficiency of the source piece of equipment, to meet other <b>process</b> <b>heating</b> needs in the facility, or to generate electricity. These systems also can benefit from receiving energy recovered from a power generating process. Models of the energy and exergy balances in these systems are developed to predict the potential reduction in operating costs when heat recovery is implemented in the STRATTEC facility. In addition, the models and energy use information are used to identify inefficiencies in the systems that should be addressed before heat recovery is applied. Finally, a thermo-economic analysis is used to compare the various heat recovery options and select the most cost effective plan for implementing heat recovery. This analysis found that, for the existing equipment, heat recovery could not be implemented economically. However, opportunities for cost savings exist in the selection of new equipment to replace aging systems. Specifically, it was found that heat recovery could be implemented economically by replacing the existing chiller with an absorption chiller system that used waste heat from a power generation system...|$|R

25|$|Before {{widespread}} {{power distribution}} from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings {{had their own}} power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam {{could be used for}} building and industrial <b>process</b> <b>heat,</b> which today is known as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. Cogeneration is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called microgeneration.|$|E

In 2010, about 20 percent of the world's sugar was produced from beets.|$|E
25|$|A nuclear reactor, {{formerly}} known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle {{can be used for}} industrial <b>process</b> <b>heat</b> or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research.

25|$|Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah {{hypothesized}} that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure <b>process</b> <b>heat.</b> Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium {{was thought to be}} accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30Â°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50Â°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.|$|E
