40|$|The {{effects on}} heart rate, blood {{pressure}} and pulmonary function of single oral doses of <b>prizidilol</b> hydrochloride (400 mg SK&F 92657) and propranolol (40 mg) were compared with placebo in nine healthy volunteers, in a double blind crossover study. <b>Prizidilol</b> {{had no effect on}} heart rate while propranolol caused a significant reduction compared with placebo. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered to the same extent by both <b>prizidilol</b> and propranolol. Propranolol significantly reduced the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the maximal expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (MEF 50). <b>Prizidilol</b> had no effect on flow-volume loop parameters. Effective pulmonary blood flow was not altered by propranolol, but it was significantly increased by <b>prizidilol.</b> Oral <b>prizidilol</b> exerts its hypotensive effect by vasodilatation without reflex tachycardia. It does not cause airways obstruction in healthy subjects...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} doses (50, 100 and 200 mg) of <b>prizidilol</b> hydrochloride (SK&F 92657), a novel antihypertensive {{agent with}} vasodilating and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties, {{were given to}} three (n = 5) groups of essential hypertensive patients in order to evaluate hypotensive dose-response relationship of the drug and its beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties. Irrespective of the dose given, acute administration of <b>prizidilol</b> did not effectively decrease blood pressure; however after one-week of treatment <b>prizidilol</b> was effective in reducing blood pressure at both the 100 and the 200 mg b. i. d. schedules. At these doses the drug decreased resting heart rate and plasma renin activity for the first 4 - 6 h after both acute and steady-state dosing. Similarly postdynamic exercise tachycardia {{was reduced to a}} significant extent by the drug; after acute administration this effect lasted 2 h with the lowest dose and 4 h with the highest one. After chronic administration this effect lasted up to 10 h for both the 100 and 200 mg doses. These data indicate that: chronic <b>prizidilol</b> treatment can achieve a satisfactory control of blood pressure in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension; when <b>prizidilol</b> is administered chronically in hypertensive patients, an equally effective control of blood pressure can be obtained with either a 200 mg b. i. d. or a 100 mg b. i. d. schedule; <b>prizidilol</b> possesses beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties in man which can contribute to its pharmacodynamic activity...|$|E
40|$|Effective renal plasma {{flow and}} glomerular {{filtration}} rate were measured in 22 mild-to-moderate, uncomplicated, essential hypertensive patients during placebo and after 3 months of randomly assigned treatment either with <b>prizidilol</b> (n = 10) or propranolol (n = 12). Measurements were performed at rest and during cycloergometer exercise. For a comparable effect on blood pressure effective renal plasma flow was significantly increased at rest by <b>prizidilol</b> (+ 9 %) and decreased by propranolol (- 13. 6 %); these patterns were maintained during exercise. Glomerular filtration rate was immodified after the treatment with both drugs. It is concluded that <b>prizidilol</b> {{is an effective}} hypotensive agent with no deleterious effects on renal haemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|Two {{separate}} assays for <b>prizidilol</b> {{have been}} developed. One relies on separation by high performance liquid chromatography, {{and the other}} on separation by thin layer chromatography. Both of these methods have several advantages over the existing assay developed by JC Pearce for Smith Kline and French Ltd. (SK & F). Firstly, both methods utilize pepsin to digest plasma protein since it is known that precipitation with trichloroacetic acid of the protein leads to losses by binding at different rates of <b>prizidilol</b> and of the internal standard. The SK & F assay might therefore be less sensitive and precise than necessary. Secondly, use of the complexing reagent, quinolin- 3 -al, leads to greater sensitivity of detection than the reagent, anisaldehyde, previously employed. The minimum level of quantitation of the developed assays are approximately 30 μg/ 1 by HPLC and 15 μg/ 1 by TLC, as against 50 μg/ 1 by the earlier HPLC method originating from SK & F laboratories. Finally, the TLC method is much quicker to perform than the previous assay...|$|E
