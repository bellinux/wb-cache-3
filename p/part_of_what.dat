5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E

5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become North America {{was near the}} equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of}} the world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E

In today's currency, damages would be between $ and $.|$|E
50|$|In 1776, the District of West Augusta {{was divided}} into three counties: Ohio County, Monongalia County, and Yohogania County.

Monongalia County encompassed much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now north-central West Virginia, and <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> are now Washington, Greene and Fayette Counties in Pennsylvania. Yohogania County consisted <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now southwestern Pennsylvania, including all <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the present counties of Washington, Fayette, Allegheny, and Beaver, and the counties of Hancock County, West Virginia and the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Brooke County, West Virginia.|$|R

The park is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect {{the two sets of}} park blocks arose in the 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made a proposal for what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, {{there are}} records of Didsbury {{existing}} as a small hamlet {{as early as the}} 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate that covered a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in the subsequent retreat.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} Portuguese {{settlement}} efforts was launched {{for the purpose}} of territorial conquest. It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of Luanda, mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought from African intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean. In addition, Benguela developed a commerce in ivory, wax, and honey, which they bought from Ovimbundu caravans which fetched these goods from among the Ganguela peoples in the eastern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Angola.|$|E

5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire western <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years ago. This event helped {{to build the}} Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.|$|E
5|$|The 25th Battalion was {{the eighth}} such unit raised for the 2NZEF and was formed on 15 May 1940 at Trentham Military Camp with {{personnel}} drawn largely from Wellington, Hawke's Bay and the Taranaki region. With an establishment of around 780 men, it was organised into four rifle companies, a headquarters company consisting of specialised personnel such as signals and a battalion headquarters. It {{was one of}} three infantry battalions that were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was initially known as the Third Echelon of the 2NZEF and which would later be designated the 6th Infantry Brigade, one of three infantry brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.|$|E
