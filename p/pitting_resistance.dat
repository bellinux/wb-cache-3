This work reports the results of pitting potential measurements in solutions simulating alkaline and carbonated concrete on black steel, stainless steel DIN 1. 4301, duplex steel DIN 1. 4462 and nickel-free stainless steel DIN 1. 4456. Duplex and nickel-free stainless steels are fully resistant even in 5 M NaCl solutions with pH 13 or higher, the lower grade DIN 1. 4301 shows a wide scatter between fully resistant and pitting potentials as low as + 0. 2 V SCE. In carbonated solutions with pH 9 the nickel-free DIN 1. 4456 shows pitting corrosion at chloride concentrations ≥ 3 M. This ranking of the <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance</b> can be rationalized based on XPS surface analysis results: both the increase of the Cr(III) oxy-hydroxide and Mo(VI) contents in the passive film and a marked nickel enrichment beneath the film improve the <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance.</b> The duplex DIN 1. 4464 shows the highest <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance,</b> which {{can be attributed to the}} very high Cr(III) oxy-hydroxide, to a medium Mo(VI) content in the film and to a nickel enrichment beneath the film.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are a very}} attractive alternative to austenitic grades due to their higher strength and good corrosion performance. The austenitic grades can often be welded autogenously, while the duplex grades normally require addition of filler metal. This is to counteract segregation of important alloying elements and to give sufficient austenite formation to prevent precipitation of chromium nitrides that could {{have a negative effect}} on impact toughness and <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance.</b> The corrosion performance of the recently-developed lean duplex stainless steel LDX 2101 is higher than that of 304 and can reach the level of 316. This thesis summarises <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance</b> tests performed on laser and gas tungsten arc (GTA) welded LDX 2101. It is shown here that this material can be autogenously welded, but additions of filler metal, nitrogen in the shielding gas and use of hybrid methods increases the austenite formation and the <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance</b> by further suppressing formation of chromium nitride precipitates in the weld metal. If the weld metal austenite formation is sufficient, the chromium nitride precipitates in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) could cause local pitting, however, this was not seen in this work. Instead, pitting occurred 1 – 3 mm from the fusion line, in the parent metal rather than in the high temperature HAZ (HTHAZ). This is suggested here to be controlled by the heat tint, and the effect of residual weld oxides on the <b>pitting</b> <b>resistance</b> is studied. The composition and the thickness of weld oxide formed on LDX 2101 and 2304 were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The heat tint on these lean duplex grades proved to contain significantly more manganese than what has been reported for standard austenitic {{stainless steels}} in the 300 series. A new approach on heat tint formation is consequently presented. Evaporation of material from the weld metal and subsequent deposition on the weld oxide are suggested to contribute to weld oxide formation. This is supported by element loss in LDX 2101 weld metal, and nitrogen additions to the GTA shielding gas further increase the evaporation.  QC 2010112...|$|E

Understanding Mo mechanism on corrosion resistance in alkaline media is hence of major importance, particularly for new lean grades with low Nickel and Molybdenum contents which presents a good balance between the properties required in these applications and the final cost of the material. In this work we will show the effect of Mo addition on pitting corrosion properties of austenitic, ferritic and duplex SS. A comparison between Mo content steels (alloys: 1. 4404, 1. 4113 and 1. 4462) and very low molybdenum contents steels (alloys: 1. 4301, 1. 4016 and 1. 4362) is done considering their <b>pitting</b> corrosion <b>resistance</b> (<b>pitting</b> potential Epit) in different corrosion conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the influence of Mo addition on pitting behaviors for the different stainless steel rebar families in several aggressive media mainly in synthetic, chlorinated and carbonated solution reproducing the real concrete pore environments (pH 10 solution with carbonates and chlorides ions) ...|$|R
