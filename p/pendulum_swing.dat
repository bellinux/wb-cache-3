The {{force of the}} clock's mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing,</b> advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} clock movement, {{the verge}} escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100°. Huygens showed {{this was a}} source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock's drive force. [...] To make its period isochronous, Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal 'chops' next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc. [...] This solution didn't prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum's swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were isochronous [...] motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> in clocks to 4°–6°.|$|E
2500|$|On April 27, 1997, a {{group of}} amateur daredevils, led by {{bartender}} and stuntman Steve Trotter and composed of a mix {{of male and female}} participants, performed an unannounced guerrilla [...] "pendulum swing" [...] bungee jump off the bridge, wherein they planned to swing back and forth on a home-made bungee cord made of steel cable attached to the cast-off point. Arriving by stretch limousine, the group unexpectedly pulled over at the apex of the bridge, quickly rigged up their cable, tethered themselves to it with harnesses, and jumped over the edge. This stunt failed when the plastic sheathing on the steel cable, unable to handle the increase in forces exerted on it by the initial <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing,</b> sheared off and allowed the connecting clamps to slide freely off the cable, plunging the jumpers [...] into the water, leading to broken bones and neck injuries. The entire accident was caught on multiple video cameras that had been set up to record the feat.|$|E

50|$|At {{the equator}} the {{rotation}} of the Earth is not observable in relation to the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> because the plane of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> is moving along with {{the rotation of}} the Earth and no net change in relationship occurs. It is shown by the diagrams that the surface velocity vectors of the Earth underneath the swing of the pendulum are either balanced in the same direction or included within the same plane as the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the {{equatorial}} pendulum with a swing in the latitudinal direction (along the equator) the surface velocity vectors {{on either side}} of the swing are not balanced in the same direction but are acting within the same x-y plane as the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> (see Figure 2B).

On one side of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> the surface velocity vectors are angled upwards but on the opposite side the vectors are angled downwards.

50|$|The anchor was {{the second}} widely used {{escapement}} in Europe, replacing the 400-year-old verge escapement in pendulum clocks. The pendulums in verge escapement clocks had very wide swings of 80° to 100°. In 1673, 17 years after he invented the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens published his mathematical analysis of pendulums, Horologium Oscillatorium. In it he showed that the wide <b>pendulum</b> <b>swings</b> of verge clocks caused them to be inaccurate, because the period of oscillation of the pendulum was not isochronous but varied to a small degree due to circular error with changes in the amplitude of the <b>pendulums</b> <b>swing,</b> which occurred with unavoidable changes in drive force. The realization that only small <b>pendulum</b> <b>swings</b> were nearly isochronous motivated clockmakers to look for an escapement that could deliver small swings.|$|R
50|$|In {{the anchor}} escapement, an {{increase}} of drive force causes the <b>pendulum</b> to <b>swing</b> back and forth more quickly, but does not increase the pendulum's amplitude, the length of its swing, much. The increased force of the escape wheel tooth on the pallet during the recoil part of the cycle tends to decrease the <b>pendulum's</b> <b>swing,</b> while {{the force of the}} tooth during the forward impulse part of the cycle tends to increase the <b>pendulum's</b> <b>swing.</b> These tend to cancel each other out, leaving the swing unchanged. But both these effects decrease the time of swing. In other words, increased force knocks the pendulum back and forth in a fixed arc faster.|$|R

50|$|The support {{structure}} {{is dependent on}} the velocity of the surface of the Earth where it is located. The point of connection of the pendulum moves with the surface velocity vectors of the Earth at that latitude. At the equator the support-point moves with the equatorial rotation of the Earth and moves the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> along with this rotation. At the poles the support-point is located on the axis of the Earth so the support-point rotates but does not have a horizontal velocity component as it does at the equator (and a progressively less horizontal velocity component with increasing latitude). The plane of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing,</b> however, is independent of the surface velocity vectors underneath the swing since there is only one point of connection. The point of connection is configured such that the plane of <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> is free to swing in any direction in relation to the structure of the connection point. The <b>pendulum</b> <b>swing</b> at the poles remains aligned toward a star if not forced to rotate with the support. As a result, it is observable that the Earth turns underneath the plane of swing of the pendulum.|$|E
