5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> of models for other artists ever since.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Farnese Ceiling was {{considered}} the unrivaled masterpiece of fresco painting for its age. They were not only seen as a <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> of heroic figure design, {{but also as a}} model of technical procedure; Annibale’s hundreds of preparatory drawings for the ceiling became a fundamental step in composing any ambitious history painting.|$|E

500|$|The first <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> for {{embroidery}} {{published in}} England was Moryssche & Damaschin renewed & encreased very popular for Goldsmiths & Embroiderers by Thomas Geminus (1545). [...] Moryssche or Moresque refers to Moorish or arabesque designs of spirals, scrolls, and zigzags, {{an important part}} of the reportoire of Renaissance ornament in many media. [...] Scrolling patterns of flowers and leaves filled with geometric filling stitches are characteristic of blackwork from the 1540s through 1590s, and similar patterns worked in coloured silks appear from the 1560s, outlined in backstitch and filled with detached buttonhole stitch.|$|E
500|$|When {{the series}} was {{launching}} in 1985, since Wendy Richard was the most recognisable actor from the original cast, she and her character Pauline were used heavily to promote EastEnders in the media. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to narrate a special [...] "dial-a-soap" [...] service for EastEnders. Run by British Telecom, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update, up to 88 seconds long. It was the first television show to provide such a service. Between 1985 and 2006, Pauline was featured in much EastEnders-related merchandise and promotional material, including calendars, cast-cards, annuals, novels, a knitting <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> and a greeting card.|$|E
500|$|From 1965 to 1967, Isola {{worked on}} the theme of sun and sea, {{creating}} at least nine designs used by Marimekko including Albatrossi (Albatross), Meduusa (Jellyfish), and Osteri (Oyster). Her patterns were by now being widely reproduced. To facilitate this process and to keep the patterns accurate, Isola maintained a set of [...] "pattern books". These were handwritten exercise books containing precise details of her pattern repeats. Each one, such as her 1968 Lovelovelove, was drawn to scale on a <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> page, coloured, and annotated with the names of the colours to be used. The books also recorded the size of the actual repeat and details of print orders. The books continued to be used as production guides in the decades after her death.|$|E

2500|$|Many changes {{occurred}} during the Nixon administration {{under the direction of}} First Lady Pat Nixon. Clement Conger, the new White House curator appointed during the Nixon administration, had completed substantial Chippendale and Neoclassical interiors at the United States Department of State. In the Green Room, {{as well as in the}} Blue and Red rooms, Conger addressed correcting the generic traditional plaster moldings put in place during the Truman reconstruction, installing historically accurate crown moldings and ceiling medallions. Conger commissioned Edward Vason Jones and David Byers to design new drapes of striped cream, green, and coral silk satin. [...] Conger and Jones cited illustrations shown in an early 19th-century <b>pattern</b> <b>book</b> belonging to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now called Historic New England). Coral and gilt ornamental cornices were constructed and installed above the windows. They were topped by hand-carved, gilded American eagles with outspread wings, a favorite decorative motif of the Federal period. The cornices are similar to those in the library of the Miles Brewton House in Charleston, South Carolina, and the South Drawing Room of the Sir John Soane House in London in the United Kingdom. Scalamandré produced a copy of the Kennedy-era moss green silk to be rehung on the walls.|$|E
