In November 2002, the British High Commission and Connect UK jointly <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first 'British Week' in that country, 'a celebration of British arts, culture, design, education and science and technology'. Festival participants included Janet Street-Porter and Benjamin Zephaniah.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne. Scholars {{have argued that}} Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav's deposition {{after the death of}} Asen. If he had been alive, Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E

5|$|With 142 Queen's Scouts as Guard of Honour, {{and live}} {{broadcast}} by the BBC (commentator Richard Dimbleby), Baden-Powell House was opened on 12 July 1961 by Queen Elizabeth II. Afterwards, she toured {{the house with}} the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, her uncle Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. A black marble panel with gold lettering was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony in the hall to commemorate the event.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible.

5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won {{each of the last}} three Tests by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it {{presented}} casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E

5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E

He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

Williams {{confirmed that the}} woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had been}} <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
