30|$|In the {{previous}} era of mutual dependency and abundance of resources, conflict between farmers and pastoralists occurred only during critical periods in the <b>production</b> <b>calendar</b> (sowing and harvesting). The relationship between different resource users was, {{for the most}} part, one of complementarity and peaceful co-existence. Scarcity of resources on which both farmers and herders depend has eroded this equilibrium and increased the likelihood for conflict of interest and competition. The effects of this scarcity have been distributed asymmetrically between farmers and pastoralists. Based on their status in the broader political context of Nigeria, some argue that pastoralists in the contemporary period have been denied access to resources and increasingly marginalised through landlessness and political powerlessness. Pastoralists therefore bear a larger burden of the scarcity than their rival group, the farmers, {{as a result of}} a gradual shift of power in favour of agriculturalists (Shettima and Tar 2008).|$|E

This new problem consists of determining which customers will be served by a common carrier, as well as the delivery routes for those served by the private fleet, in order to minimize the overall transportation and inventory costs. We first model this problem and then propose a simple decomposition procedure that can be used to provide a starting solution. Next, we introduce a new tabu search heuristic and we describe two new neighbor reduction strategies. Finally, we present the results of our extensive computational tests. According to these tests, our reduction strategies are efficient not only at reducing computing time but also at improving the overall solution quality.

40|$|Because of {{the obvious}} {{disadvantages}} inherent in the ‘general import tariff ’ scheme it has been liberalized in early 2001. A first decree reduced {{the level of the}} ‘general import tariff ’ for all product groups to 1 %. A second decree which at the time this study was written but has not been signed yet, foresees the complete abolishment of the ‘general import tariff’. These measures are significant steps towards further liberalization of Syria’s trade regime. As long as this reduction in trade protection is not compensated for by increasing the product-specific import tariff, the economic effects should be measurable in the future. The difference between domestic and world market prices should narrow. Furthermore, domestic prices for imported commodities should decrease, which in turn will be particularly beneficial for those consumers who rely on imported food commodities to a great extent. Non-tariff import constraints. Non tariff import constraints for agricultural commodities amount in Syria. In an attempt to protect producers of fruits and vegetables – which is likely to be one sub-sector of agriculture which enjoys relatively high comparative advantages – a total import ban for fruits and vegetables has been in force during the 90 s.

40|$|Warm-season {{grasses and}} legumes have the {{potential}} to provide forage throughout the Mediterranean summer when there are high temperatures and low rainfall and when cool-season grasses become less productive. Twenty-nine non-native, warm-season pasture species (twenty-three grasses and six legumes) were assessed for their adaptability to the coastal plain of southern Italy in terms of their productivity and nutritional quality. The investigated species were compared with two reference species widely used in a Mediterranean environment: a grass (Festuca arundinacea) and a legume (Medicago sativa). The species differed in their phenological and biological characteristics, i. e. start of vegetative resumption, first flowering and cold resistance, from each other and from the control species. From the second year after establishment, warm-season perennial grasses had high dry-matter (DM) yields and, in many cases, a more than adequate nutritional quality. As for legumes, the control, M. sativa gave the best results in all the investigated characters. Among the grasses, seven species (Chloris gayana, Eragrostis curvula, Panicum coloratum, Paspalum dilatatum, Pennisetum clandestinum, Sorghum almum, Sorghum spp. hybrid) had DM yields greater than the control species and had their maximum growth during the hottest period of the year, when F. arundinacea, the control grass species, was dormant. Eragrostis curvula had the highest annual DM yield (21 · 1 t ha− 1) and P. clandestinum provided the best combination of agronomic and yield characteristics which were similar to those of M. sativa.

40|$|SUMMARY The general {{objective}} of this work is to analyze {{the viability of the}} culture of organic fair trade cotton in comparison with that of conventional cotton. The study was conducted with a sample of 45 farms with 15 farms per system, and following a systemic approach at three levels: the land of cotton cropping systems based on cotton and across the operation. At the cotton, whatever the socio-economic producer, cotton compared to conventional cotton has lower average yields, work time higher and smaller plots (0. 85 ha production organic fair against 2. 35 and 1. 76 ha respectively in conventional <b>production</b> <b>calendar</b> and thresholds. organic fair trade cotton generates less revenue because of smaller plots. Nevertheless, the cotton is organic fair identified two broad categories of farms: farms with high levels of resources have an important livestock farms and poor with little means of production, for which the organic fair trade cotton {{is one of the few}} alternatives for income money. It should be noted that the level of these poor farms, it is often women and dependent operations manager who practice organic cultivation of cotton. Only farms with high level of resources that have a herd can derive significant profits from the cultivation of organic fair trade cotton. The alternative organic fair this effect allows access to land and access to the culture of cotton formerly marginalized groups, including women, unlike conventional cotton where only the manager manages the cultivation of cotton. There is thus improving the status of women. However, the lack of sustained management of soil fertility and nutrient compromises obtaining better yields - which is a key success factor to be and remain competitive. Level of cropping systems, comparative analysis of the performance of cropping systems confirms that productivity and valuation levels of the working day cultures and cultivation systems based on organic fair trade cotton are lower than obtained by conventional production. At the farm level, conventional production systems produce between 29 % (SPCca) and 43 % (SPCs) more grain from the organic production system. Reflecting the fragility of food security in the region in case of massive conversion to organic production. Regarding environmental sustainability, it appears that the most important contribution of organic cotton is safe for human health and the environment of the inputs used...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to trace the performance of selected irrigation associations after the transfer of operation and maintenance (O&M) activities from the state to the farmers. Four irrigation associations were selected according to the regional and cropping pattern diversity. The area of the selected associations made up slightly more than 5 percent of the total transferred area. The data for the different types of revenues and expenses of the associations were obtained from the annual reports of the associations to the State Hydraulic Works. Results suggest that irrigation associations are able to fulfill irrigation tasks to a large extent using enhanced equipment. Fee collection rates are at improved levels, despite delays in payments, mainly due to the mismatch of the financial and <b>production</b> <b>calendars.</b> Dominant cropping patterns for cotton lead to higher and increasing O&M expenditures compared to cereals. Although the transfers increased the adjustment ability of farmers to exogenous factors, the findings suggest that it is still too early to decide on the sustainability of the transfer program...|$|R
