40|$|The {{trends in}} British twin and higher {{multiple}} birth rates {{inside and outside}} marriage from 1938 to 1989 were reviewed for evidence of the probable impact {{of the use of}} ovulatory stimulants.

5000|$|Although Seneca {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a Stoic philosopher, he draws on Neopythagoreanism for his views on sexual austerity. Neopythagoreans characterized sexuality outside marriage as disordered and undesirable; celibacy was not an ideal, but chastity <b>within</b> <b>marriage</b> was. To Seneca, sexual desire for pleasure (libido) is a [...] "destructive force (exitium) insidiously fixed in the innards"; unregulated, it becomes cupiditas, lust. The only justification for sex is reproduction <b>within</b> <b>marriage.</b> Although other Stoics see potential in beauty to be an ethical stimulus, a way to attract and develop affection and friendship within sexual relations, Seneca distrusts the love of physical beauty as destroying reason {{to the point of}} insanity. A man should have no sexual partner other than his wife, and the wise man (sapiens, Greek sophos) will make love to his wife by exercising good judgment (iudicium), not emotion (affectus). This is a far stricter view than that of other Stoics who advocate sex as a means of promoting mutual affection <b>within</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
