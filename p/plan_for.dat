50|$|The {{starting}} point is {{the balance of the}} individual economies' and the state's <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> building monetary assets. If the balance of the <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> building money assets (<b>plans</b> <b>for</b> sales surplus) has a surplus over the <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> money assets reduction (<b>plans</b> <b>for</b> buy surplus) this generates a negative momentum. As a consequence, economic actors overall -as expected- make less expenses in the following periods when they reduce money assets unplanned and make more expenses in the opposite case when their money assets increase by planning.This momentum is reinforced by the multiplier which results from the average willingness of the economic actors to accept unplanned changes of their money assets.|$|R

5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> Hordaland.|$|E
