25|$|Up until 1997, {{uniforms and}} hats had distinctions {{according}} to their rank. For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform.

Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have a insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the <b>police</b> <b>hat.</b> Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.|$|E

5000|$|Borremans, a brewer's son, aged 26, who {{originated}} {{from the area}} around the Old Grain Market Square in the centre of Brussels, had gathered a group of more or less 200 ‘Hunters of Brussels’ volunteers around him between the riots {{that took place in the}} month of August 1830 and the fights of 24 September. The Hunters found shelter in the barracks of the fire brigade situated in the district of the Old Grain Market Square. After his group had participated in the fights of the 22 and 23 September and in the fight for the public park of Brussels, where the army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands had set up camp, they were recognised as [...] "regular" [...] troops on 27 September by the provisional government established by the rebels. The ‘Hunters of Brussels’ were the first infantry unit to be incorporated into the new army. On the same day this unit was expanded to include 200 volunteers from the region of Ath. Borremans rose quickly through the ranks to head this corps; advancing in rank to become a major on 28 September and by 5 October had become a lieutenant colonel. Meanwhile, the corps had officially acquired the title [...] "Hunters of Brussels"; numbering some 450 men grouped in six companies and a staff. The Hunters wore an authorised uniform that consisted of a blue tunic, a lumbar ribbon, and a black <b>police</b> <b>hat</b> with a tricolor rosette. On 1 November, the provisional government issued a decree establishing the 1st Regiment of Hunters on foot, of which Borremans' Hunters of Brussels constituted the core. The decree was confirmed by the National Congress of Belgium, the temporary legislative institution tasked with the development of a new constitution which was ratified by the first assembly on 10 November. It is only on 25 February 1831 that Borremans, then colonel, effectively got command over this huddle, grouped in two battalions that had grown to some 950 agitators. Brussels became for these poor wretched soldiers the main seat, where they had to secure the city and maintain order.|$|E

The mascot and a trained helper undertake event walkarounds, stopping for photographs and giving away handouts such as stickers and cardboard <b>police</b> <b>hats.</b> At larger events such as the Telethon Kids Carnival, the mascot takes part in safety-themed song and dance performances on stage with actors from the Constable Care Performance Company. The Constable Care mascot was recognised at a ceremony in June 2014 at the Western Australian Police Academy for 25 years of service to the WA community, receiving the regimental number 12020 and the status of Senior Constable.
