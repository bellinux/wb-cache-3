5000|$|The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{considered}} {{the construction of}} a channel to the east of the Mississippi River but instead accepted an alternative proposed by James Buchanan Eads. [...] Eads proposed the construction of <b>parallel</b> <b>jetties</b> that would concentrate the flow of the river thereby scouring the bottom and maintaining deeper depths. Construction began in 1875 and was completed by 1879. [...] As a result of the newly established jetties, river depth was maintained at 30 feet, thereby reducing the problem of shoaling.|$|E
50|$|Nicholl's ambitions led him {{to build}} Lower Kennedy Limeworks and abandon the early {{quarries}} and St Cuthbert's Limeworks about 1858. After a brief, expensive period working Lower Kennedy he obtained Admiralty permission to build new kilns and two <b>parallel</b> <b>jetties</b> near the castle and to connect them to Nessend Quarry by a wholly new tramway down {{the east of the}} island, abandoning Lower Kennedy, the 1846 jetty and all trackwork, though he may have recycled some materials. This took place around 1861. Map 2 gives hints of his evolving aspirations at the time.|$|E

50|$|According to the Rehoboth Bay Sediment Management Plan, Rehoboth Bay {{is part of}} Delaware’s Inland Bays which {{encompass}} Rehoboth Bay, Little Assawoman Bay, and Indian River Bay. Both Rehoboth Bay and Little Assawoman Bay are barbuiltestuaries, while Indian River Bay is a drowned river valley. Rehoboth Bay is thenorthernmost of Delaware’s inland bays (Figure 2-1). Depths in the bay {{are generally}} shallow,less than 6 to 7 feet below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). Surface area of the bay isapproximately 13 square miles. Rehoboth Bay receives fresh water discharges from a number ofsmall creeks along the bay, including White Oak Creek, Love Creek, Herring Creek, and GuineaCreek. Rehoboth Bay is linked to Indian River Bay to the south, providing tidal exchange with the Atlantic Ocean through Indian River Inlet, which is stabilized by two <b>parallel</b> stone <b>jetties.</b> To the north, the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal provides limited exchange with Delaware Bay.|$|R

50|$|Jetties {{have been}} {{constructed}} {{on each side of}} the outlet river of some of the rivers flowing into the Baltic, with the objective of prolonging the scour of the river and protecting the channel from being shoaled by the littoral drift along the shore. The most interesting application of <b>parallel</b> <b>jetties</b> is in lowering the bar in front of one of the mouths of a deltaic river flowing into a tide — a virtual prolongation of its less sea, by extending the scour of the river out to the bar by banks. Jetties prolonging the Sulina branch of the Danube into the Black Sea, and the south pass of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, formed of rubble stone and concrete blocks, and respectively, have enabled the discharge of these rivers to scour away the bars obstructing the access to them; and they have also carried the sediment-bearing waters sufficiently far out to come under the influence of littoral currents, which, by conveying away some of the sediment, postpone the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out (see river engineering).|$|E
50|$|The {{approach}} channel to some ports situated on sandy coasts is guided and protected across the beach by <b>parallel</b> <b>jetties,</b> made solid up {{to a little}} above low water of neap tides, on which open timber-work is erected, provided with a planked platform at the top raised above the highest tides. The channel between the jetties was originally maintained by tidal scour from low-lying areas close to the coast, and subsequently by the current from sluicing basins; but it is now often considerably deepened by sand-pump dredging. It is protected to some extent by the solid portion of the jetties from the inroad of sand from the adjacent beach, and from the levelling action of the waves; while the upper open portion serves to indicate the channel and to guide the vessels, if necessary (see harbor). The bottom part of the older jetties, in such long-established jetty ports as Calais, Dunkirk and Ostend, was composed of clay or rubble stone, covered on the top by fascine-work or pitching, but the deepening of the jetty channel by dredging and the need that arose for its enlargement led to {{the reconstruction of the}} jetties at these ports. The nes jetties at Dunkirk were founded in the sandy beach, by the aid of compressed air, at a depth of 22.75 ft. below low water of spring tides; and their solid masonry portion, on a concrete foundation was raised 50 ft. above low water of neap tides.|$|E
40|$|A {{coastal zone}} is the {{interface}} between the land and water that influenced by both of them. Coastal dynamic is influenced by many factors from land and sea, such as sedimentation and current. In order to support marine facility, Marine Geological Institute of Indonesia (MGI) {{plan to build a}} port. The prospective area is behind MGI office at Cirebon. This study use multi temporal remote sensing data in order to observe trend of coastline change around MGI. Based on the interpretation of the data, there are sedimentation around the MGI water and abrasion due to the presence of Kejawananâ€™s jetty and Kalijaga River. The result also shows that the current in this region is moving from southeast to northwest. The presence of the Kejawananâ€™s jetty stymies the movement of sediment. The sediment which is normally moving {{to the north of the}} jetty is then trapped on the south side of the structure, so that the sediment precipitates in this region and makes it as the active region of sedimentation and accretion. The presence mangrove conduces to support sedimentation speed and accretion at this region, because of his function as the catchment area. Abrasion occurs in the eastern part of MGI office at the Kalijaga river mouth within the bay. The Kalijaga River mouth is predicted to be the primary source of sedimentation in this area. The coastline change caused by sedimentation will be continuing as long as it is supplied by the sediment. The direction of the sedimentation is <b>parallel</b> to the <b>jetty</b> and it forms ellipsoid, with the sedimentation/accretion region is behind MGI office. The abrasion area is found in Kalijaga River mouth and a small area beside Kalijaga River. In order to build a port, we have to consider this sedimentation process. One of the alternatives to build the port is to make a quay pile model which gives way the current to pass through the other side of the port. Another alternative is to build the port as a pond model but it needs accuracy in building the mouth of jetty to minimize the sedimentation process...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{diversion}} of the Kaituna River from Maketū Estuary, out to sea at Te Tumu in 1956, the local community has continually voiced concerns over the estuary’s increased sedimentation rates and decreasing ecological health. These concerns led to the partial re-opening of Fords Cut in 1996. However, this has only resulted in a slight improvement in water quality, and no measurable reduction in sedimentation. The Bay of Plenty Regional Council is currently investigating {{a number of different}} re-diversion options to partially or fully restore the flow of the Kaituna River into Maketū Estuary, with the aim of restoring the estuary’s health. However, a consequence of re-diversion is the possible reduction in discharge through the inlet at Te Tumu. Significantly reducing the discharge would likely cause a large amount of sedimentation in, and around the cut, which could ultimately lead to the closure of the channel. In order to predict the geomorphic response to the proposed options of lowering the Ford’s Cut Culverts to RL - 1. 6 m (Option J), or reopening Papahikahawai Channel (Option N) a coupled 2 -dimensional, wave, hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was developed. Despite being unable to calibrate the hydrodynamic model due to the highly variable nature of the ADCP data collected, the coupled model was entirely calibrated through the sediment transport model. Comparisons between five transects extracted from a survey conducted in 2008 and from the model results of a simulation run over the same time period, showed predicted bed levels to match on average within 0. 35 m. Bed levels inside the river were predicted almost exactly, however, the error increased over the ebb delta, although, the same overall shape was still recreated. Through simulations of average and low river flows, and average and twice the average wave height conditions the morphological response of the Te Tumu Cut to various potential re-diversion options were found. Simulations of Option J showed that the majority of increased water entering the estuary through Ford’s Cut occurred during the incoming tide. This therefore increased the flood tidal volume and sediment transport capacity entering the cut, and caused the ebb channel to become shorter by approximately 20 metres. Similarly, reopening Papahikahawai Channel with one-way flapgated culverts caused an increase in the flood tidal volume entering the Cut. However, unlike Option J there was no corresponding increase in sedimentation around the river mouth. This was attributed to dredging required to install the flapgates, resulting in a loss of sediment from the system and the inlet not yet reaching a new equilibrium. When Papahikahawai Channel is reopened without flapgated culverts both the peak flood tidal discharge and peak ebb discharge increased. The increased ebb flows resulted in a small increase in size of the ebb channel through the delta, with the increase in size varying between the different river flow and wave condition simulations. The effect of adding <b>parallel</b> twin <b>jetty</b> structures to the Te Tumu Cut was also assessed at a preliminary level. Model simulations showed jetties spaced either 45 or 35 metres apart would aid in increasing the navigability through the river mouth. The 35 metre spaced jetties produced a more uniform and deeper channel compared to the 45 metre spaced option. However, further investigation is required to determine the ideal jetty configuration and long term effects on the surrounding coastlines...|$|R
50|$|Where a {{river is}} narrow near its mouth, has a {{generally}} feeble discharge {{and a small}} tidal range, the sea is liable on an exposed coast to block up its outlet during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another exit at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at some distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up, so that the river {{from time to time}} shifts the position of its mouth. This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the outlet of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side of this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge in a definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked up by littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the shifting outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has also been successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of the Adur near Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of Biscay below Bayonne. When a new channel was cut across the Hoek van Holland to provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel for the river Maas, forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low, broad, <b>parallel</b> <b>jetties,</b> composed of fascine mattresses weighted with stone, were carried across the foreshore into the sea {{on either side of the}} new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from littoral drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it out to deep water. The channel, also, beyond the outlet of the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has been regulated by jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty out for nearly 0.5 mi with a curve concave towards the channel the outlet has not only been protected to some extent from the easterly drift, but the bar in front has been lowered by the scour produced by the discharge of the river following the concave bend of the southwest jetty. As the outer portion of this jetty was exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of Biscay before the outer harbour was constructed, it has been given the form and strength of a breakwater situated in shallow water.|$|E

Due to the severe wave action, a number of rubble-mound con-struction techniques including stone, concrete cubes, tetrahedrons, and finally dolos armor units have been used.
