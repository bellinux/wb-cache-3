5|$|Each year, the Trait du Nord is {{honored at}} an {{agricultural}} show and horse show in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord {{took the first}} place prize for weight <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> the show. Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place {{every two or three}} years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> {{the core of the}} deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E

25|$|The fewer {{the number}} of combat-experienced {{divisions}} the British had left {{at the end of}} the war, the smaller Britain’s influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the USA and the USSR. Montgomery was thus caught in a dilemma – the British Army needed to be seen to be <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> least half the weight in the liberation of Europe, but without incurring the heavy casualties that such a role would inevitably produce. The 21st Army Group scarcely possessed sufficient forces to achieve such a military prominence, and the remaining divisions had to be expended sparingly.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{anatomy of}} a muscle is the most {{important}} indicator of its role in the body. One particularly important aspect of gross anatomy of muscles is pennation or lack thereof. In most muscles, all the fibers are oriented in the same direction, running in a line from the origin to the insertion. In pennate muscles, the individual fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the line of action, attaching to the origin and insertion tendons at each end. Because the contracting fibers are <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> an angle to the overall action of the muscle, the change in length is smaller, but this same orientation allows for more fibers (thus more force) in a muscle of a given size. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force, such as the rectus femoris.|$|E
25|$|Having {{seen the}} armed blacks, {{some of the}} more than 1,000 whites at the {{courthouse}} went home for their own guns. Others headed for the National Guard armory at Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm up. The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition. Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry had already learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he took appropriate measures to prevent this. He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory. When a group of whites arrived and began <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300–400 men. Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter. After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory.|$|E

25|$|Otitis {{media is}} a group of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes of discharge from the ear. It may be a complication of acute otitis media. Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss. The hearing loss in OME, due to its chronic nature, may affect a child's ability to learn.|$|E
25|$|England's {{chances of}} lasting the day were {{effectively}} dashed after Kevin Pietersen flicked {{the ball to}} Damien Martyn at short midwicket off Brett Lee in the first over of the day, immediately after Australia's taking the new ball and without adding to his overnight score. Geraint Jones struck a few boundaries but edged onto his stumps off Glenn McGrath. Fellow NSW paceman Stuart Clark took the final wickets of Giles (caught at first slip), Hoggard (caught at first slip) and Harmison (caught <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> fine leg), with England lasting only 20 overs for the day. England's fourth innings total of 370 was the highest ever achieved in a fourth innings of a Test match at the Gabba but was still nowhere near the total set by Australia. Australia won the match by 277 runs, with Ricky Ponting named man of the match for his 196 and 60 not out. The total attendance was recorded as 164,747 for the match.|$|E

Grant. [...] Galland bailed out and tugged at {{what he thought was}} his parachute ripcord, but was actually <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> his parachute release harness. With a [...] "sickening" [...] feeling, he composed himself and pulled the ripcord which opened.

500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is so nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E
500|$|Fourteen riders {{representing}} twelve teams {{broke away}} after [...] They stayed {{clear as a}} group through the four climbs on course before they started to splinter. Danilo Di Luca's LPR team drove the peloton most of the day, because the finish figured to favor Di Luca more than race leader Denis Menchov or the man in third, Levi Leipheimer. However, one team <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> {{the front of the}} peloton proved to be no match for a 14-man breakaway working cohesively, {{and by the time the}} peloton reached the descent of the fourth climb, the last before the summit finish, it was clear the breakaway would not be caught. The breakaway was still twelve strong as it began the last climb of the day. Andriy Hryvko was the first to attack for the stage win, but he was caught well before the summit, and wound up finishing in the pink jersey group a minute behind the stage winner. The decisive attack came from Simon Gerrans, who no one could match, giving the Cervélo rider the stage win. Leipheimer and Ivan Basso were both dropped from the pink jersey group just before the summit of the climb and the end of the stage, losing three potentially valuable seconds to the other highly placed riders in the GC. Michael Rogers was a further three seconds back of Leipheimer and Basso, causing him to drop from sixth to seventh in the GC.|$|E

500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, BMC {{was one of only}} two teams to have more than three riders present in the leading group on the road after a crash on the Le Manie climb [...] from the finish effectively split the field in two. With both teams lacking field sprinters, and with sprinters Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, and Heinrich Haussler surviving the split, BMC captain Ballan and 's Vincenzo Nibali struck a deal that they would each send men {{to the front of the}} lead group to help keep it away from the sprinters left behind in the second group, and dislodge the sprinters in the first group if possible. The tactic worked; with domestiques from both these teams, plus , <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> the head of the leading group, they kept their lead through to the end of the race. Ballan, and Nibali, later figured into a crucial eight-rider selection that took place on the Poggio just a few kilometers from the end of the [...] day of racing. Those eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one had a teammate to perform a proper leadout. After Nibali, Gilbert, and 's Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Ballan was gapped off momentarily and could manage only fourth behind race winner Matthew Goss. Van Avermaet had also been with the first group after the split on Le Manie, and occupied first position on the road for the kilometers between the Cipressa and the descent from the Poggio, before he was caught by the select group of eight that finished together at the head of the race.|$|E

2500|$|The {{spinning}} process {{occurs when a}} fibre is {{pulled away from the}} body of a spider, whether by the spider's legs, by the spider's falling under its own weight, or by any other method including being pulled by humans. The term [...] "spinning" [...] is misleading because no rotation of any component occurs, but rather comes from analogy to the textile spinning wheels. Silk production is a pultrusion, similar to extrusion, with the subtlety that the force is induced by <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> the finished fibre rather than being squeezed out of a reservoir. The unspun silk fibre is pulled through silk glands of which there may be both numerous duplicates and different types of gland on any one spider species.|$|E

2500|$|The tumultuous {{relationship}} between Wilder and Chandler only enhanced {{the product of}} their collaboration.

If you are going to collaborate, you need an opponent to bounce things off of." [...] His tugging with Chandler did have a softer side, it seems: over 60 years after the film's initial release, it was discovered that Chandler had agreed to appear in a fleeting cameo at 16 minutes 12 seconds into the film, glancing up from a book as Neff walks past in the hallway. This is notable because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.|$|E
