We discuss how the approach can be built into dic-tionary interfaces to help tip-of-the-tongue searches. We also describe our contribution to the CogALex 2014 shared task. We argue that the reverse response-stimulus word associations cho-sen for the shared task are only mildly related to the motivation idea of the lexical access support system. The methods employed in our contribution are briefly introduced. We present results of experiments with various parameter settings and show what improvement can be expected if more than one answer is allowed. The paper concludes with {{a proposal for a}} new collective effort to assemble real tip-of-the-tongue situation records for future, more-realistic evaluations. ...|$|R
40|$|This <b>paper</b> <b>advances</b> a novel <b>mechanism</b> {{to explain}} the {{dissipation}} of the Alfvén waves that carry much of the energy in heliospheric and astrophysical turbulence, with specific applications to solar wind heating. The essential {{point is that the}} nonlinear beating of relatively low-frequency Alfvén waves, which are abundant in the heliosphere, drives a compressible magnetosonic response whose damping can dissipate significant energy. This mechanism involves both kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. The damping of the magnetosonic waves is a kinetic process. The nonlinear beating of Alfvén waves, which produces the magnetosonic waves, is best described by MHD theory. This mechanism complements and may compete with the well-known alternative mechanism in which the cascade of turbulent energy to small-scale, high-frequency Alfvén waves dissipates by ion-cyclotron damping. The MHD analysis in this paper reveals that the fast magnetosonic mode dominates the dissipation when the plasma beta is near unity, and that the timescale of dissipation in the heliosphere can vary from hours to a year depending upon the direction of the driven wave and the plasma parameters where it is driven. The damping of the driven magnetosonic waves may also contribute to the observed high-energy particle distributions. © 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

We implement these simulation designs in two modeling packages that illustrate the differences between discrete-time simulation (DTS) and discrete-event simulation (DES) methodologies. Many combat models use DTS as their simulation time <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We demonstrate that the presence and size of the time step as a modeling component can have a substantial impact on the basic characteristics of agent and simulation performance. We show that the use of a DTS method can degrade the modeling accuracy of changes in agent sensor range and detection outcomes, and also can compromise the ability of agents to travel to specific target destinations in a spatial simulation environment. We conclude that DES methodology successfully addresses these problems and is preferred as a time <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism</b> in these situations. ...|$|R

40|$|A new cell {{engineering}} technique (L. B. technique) {{was established in}} our Lab. At first, the physical and chemical methods were used to facilitate the reestablishment of intercellular contacts and plasmodesma channels between different parents, thus forcing cytoplasm and chromatin to pass the cell wall with different qualities and quantities from one cell to others, through the enlarged intercellular plasmodesma channels or the vulnerable regions and the holes on the cell wall formed differently in growth and thickness {{in the process of}} cell wall formation to introduce external genetic substances or gene groups into plant cells. There are different ways, frequencies and strengths for the migration between the cells in different growth and development regions or the same growth and development region. In this <b>paper</b> we <b>advance</b> the <b>mechanism</b> of cytoplasm and chromatin migration through the cell wall: There are a large number of plasmodesma channels or vulnerable regions and holes different in growth and thickness during the formation of the cell walls between meristematic cells. Low osmotic pressure and low pH value K+ solution treatments force the augmentation of plasmic streaming, and the streaming of karyolymph, the relaxation of the cell wall, the formation of more holes on the cell wall and the enlargement of plasmodesma channels in meristematic cells. All these make a proper structural and physiological condition for migrating through cell walls. Osmotic pressure and centrifugal forces are the practical forces forcing cytoplasm and chromatin to migrate extensively and transfer external genetic substances or gene groups to plant cells...|$|R

Normally the film is held steady in the gate whenever it is exposed to light. Special shutter adjustments allow the film to be exposed while the camera mechanism is actually moving the film to the next frame. In the film Saving Private Ryan, cinematographer Janusz Kamiński used such a shutter adjustment to give his film the look of World War II newsreel photography. Previously, this effect could only be achieved by purposefully mis-adjusting the timing belt of the film <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the camera.
