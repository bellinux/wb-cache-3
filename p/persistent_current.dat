50|$|This kind of <b>persistent</b> <b>current</b> {{was first}} {{predicted}} to be experimentally observable in micrometer-scale rings in 1983 by Markus Büttiker, Yoseph Imry, and Rolf Landauer. Because the effect requires the phase coherence of electrons around the entire ring, the current {{can not be}} observed when the ring is interrupted by an ammeter and thus the current must by measured indirectly through its magnetization.In fact, all metals exhibit some magnetization in magnetic fields due a combination of de Haas-van Alphen effect, core diamagnetism, Landau diamagnetism, Pauli paramagnetism, which all appear regardless of {{the shape of the}} metal.The additional magnetization from <b>persistent</b> <b>current</b> becomes strong with a connected ring shape, and for example would disappear if the ring were cut.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>persistent</b> <b>current</b> is a {{mesoscopic}} {{low temperature}} effect: {{the magnitude of}} the current becomes appreciable when the size of the metallic system is reduced to the scale of the electron quantum phase coherence length and the thermal length. Persistent currents decrease with increasing temperature and will vanish exponentially above a temperature known as the Thouless temperature. This temperature scales as the inverse of the circuit diameter squared. Consequently, {{it has been suggested that}} persistent currents could flow up to room temperature and above in nanometric metal structures such as metal (Au, Ag,...) nanoparticles. This hypothesis has been offered for explaining the singular magnetic properties of nanoparticles made of gold and other metals. Unlike with superconductors, these persistent currents do not appear at zero magnetic field, as the current fluctuates symmetrically between positive and negative values; the magnetic field breaks that symmetry and allows a nonzero average current.Although the <b>persistent</b> <b>current</b> in an individual ring is largely unpredictable due to uncontrolled factors like the disorder configuration, it has a slight bias so that an average <b>persistent</b> <b>current</b> appears even for an ensemble of conductors with different disorder configurations.|$|E
