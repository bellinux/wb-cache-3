This technology has revitalised the field of wildlife forensics and is now routinely used across India to provide a species identification service in cases of wildlife crime.|$|E
500|$|David Alexander Johnston (December 18, 1949 – May 18, 1980) was an American USGS {{volcanologist}} who {{was killed}} by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. A <b>principal</b> <b>scientist</b> on the USGS monitoring team, Johnston {{was killed in the}} eruption while manning an observation post 6 miles (...) away on the morning of May 18, 1980. He was the first to report the eruption, transmitting [...] "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" [...] before he was swept away by a lateral blast. Despite a thorough search, Johnston's body was never found, but state highway workers discovered remnants of his USGS trailer in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, Spedding and Wilhelm {{founded the}} Institute of Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission. Wilhelm became its {{associate}} director in 1945, serving {{in that capacity}} until 1966. He remained the <b>principal</b> <b>scientist</b> and professor of chemistry and metallurgy until he retired in 1970 at the mandatory retirement age of 70. The Ames Laboratory was initially established {{on the grounds of}} Iowa State College. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall respectively in 1986. His work at the Ames Laboratory ranged over a wide range of subjects, from the design of high-speed computers to environmental waste management and materials science. He individually or jointly held over 40 patents relating to chemistry and metallurgy, and 60 relating to atomic energy. He was part of the United States delegation to the 1955 International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with his}} musical gifts, Rachmaninoff possessed {{physical}} gifts {{that may have}} placed him in good stead as a pianist. These gifts included exceptional height and extremely large hands with a gigantic finger stretch (he could play the chord C E G C G with his left hand). This and Rachmaninoff's slender frame, long limbs, narrow head, prominent ears, and thin nose suggest {{that he may have}} had Marfan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue. This syndrome would have accounted for several minor ailments he suffered all his life, including back pain, arthritis, eye strain, and bruising of the fingertips, although others have pointed out that this was more likely because he was playing the piano all day long. This Marfan speculation was proposed by Dr. D. A. B. Young (formerly <b>principal</b> <b>scientist</b> of the Wellcome Foundation) in a 1986 British Medical Journal article. Twenty years later, an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, by Ramachandran and Aronson differed greatly from Young's speculation: ...|$|E
