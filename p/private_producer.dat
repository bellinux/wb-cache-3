These countries tend to have autocratic regimes. I explore a reason why bad policies may benefit autocrats. I present a model economy where the autocrat manages his production (e. g., military exploits, plantation cultivation, mining) in addition to setting policies for the <b>private</b> <b>producers.</b> The autocrat has an incentive to repress the income level of private producers: it reduces the wage rate that he must offer to his workers and thereby increases the surplus from his production. Thus the autocrat chooses a tax rate that {{is higher than the}} revenue-maximizing rate: it lies on the backward-bending part of the Laffer curve. He may also choose to lower the productivity of <b>private</b> <b>producers</b> through confiscation, neglect of public goods, and other non-tax policies. I argue that the story is helpful in understanding bad policies present in militaristic regimes of the Ottoman and Mughal empires, Trujillo's regime in the plantation- based economy of the Dominican Republic, and Mobutu's regime in mineral- rich Zaire.

Food, commodities, and other items were sold at a fixed price to prevent rivals to the ruler and government, as specified {{in the first part}} of the constitution, which also allowed citizens to purchase basic necessities at a reasonable and affordable price. Another part sought to protect producers by eliminating a vertical monopoly. Work was divided equally amongst all members, providing for a low competition rate. The third part of the constitution claims that private producers receive aid only from family members, although some might also have slaves to help in the business.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model {{to investigate the}} incentive of <b>private</b> <b>producer</b> and policy-maker to reduce seasonality in a given market, where consumers derive different utilities from the consumption of the good in different seasons. The (seasonal) product differentiation is modeled {{along the lines of}} the contributions of Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979) and Shaked and Sutton (1982). We take into consideration that investments are possible to reduce the degree of seasonality. We show that, for a wide set of parameter configuration, the policy maker finds it optimal to make more effort to reduce seasonality as compared to private producers. The theoretical conclusion is consistent with empirical and anecdotical evidence, especially in the field of tourism markets. ...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} present a {{theoretical}} model {{to investigate the}} private and social incentives to reduce seasonality in a given market.

The seasonal product differentiation is modelled {{along the lines of}} Gabszewicz and Thisse (Price Competition, Quality and Income Disparities, 1979) and Shaked and Sutton (Relaxing Price Competition through Product Differentiation, 1982). The authors assume that it is possible for a firm to invest {{in order to reduce the}} degree of the demand seasonality. They show that, for a wide set of parameter configuration, the optimal effort to reduce seasonality is higher from a social welfare perspective, as compared to the <b>private</b> <b>producer</b> perspective. The tourism market can represent an application of the present model. However, unlike most available literature in this field, their model provides a microeconomic basis for the evaluation of investments aimed at reducing seasonality, rather than taking a macroeconomic approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{innovation}} process links technology generation with product commercialization, {{a connection}} involving {{a myriad of}} activities such as applied research, industrial design, and design for manufacture. The incremental aspects of innovation are defined and, with use of Canadian examples, situations are identified in which policy interventions may be justified because of unmet goals of national (or regional) industrial performance and because of knowledge-market imperfections encountered by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Use is made {{of the concept of}} transaction costs to explain the problems some SMEs encounter in being innovative. Survey evidence confirms the theoretical arguments: some successful SMEs establish input linkages with specialists but many more are impeded from establishing relevant contacts with consultants in the public and <b>private</b> <b>producer</b> services and with other manufacturers. The geographic and policy problem, therefore, becomes one of designing networks to assist the development of superior information connections by SMEs. The principles for policy design are discussed {{in the light of the}} theory used to identify market imperfections. ...|$|E
