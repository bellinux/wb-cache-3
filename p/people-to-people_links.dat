40|$|From {{the report}} 2 ̆ 7 s foreword: Australia’s aid program focuses on {{assisting}} {{countries in the}} Asia-Pacific region. A considerable proportion of our aid goes towards assisting our Pacific Island neighbours. In the 2007 - 2008 financial year 872. 5 million will be disbursed to the Pacific, with the majority directed to assist citizens of the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Each of the Pacific Island states has different development needs—some more complex than others—and the Australian aid program seeks to address {{a wide range of}} them. The Australian Government does so in partnership with, principally, national governments; but also other donors, non-government organisations and local communities. In the course of the inquiry, the Committee heard {{from a wide range of}} government and non-government stakeholders with an interest in development in the Pacific—Australians and Pacific Islanders alike. A key theme to emerge throughout the inquiry was the need for strong <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> between Australians and Pacific Islanders—not only for development reasons but also to promote a deeper understanding and better appreciation of our respective cultures. There are claims by some that the <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> between our nations (be they government-to-government, business, civil society or educational) have reduced in recent years. However, the Committee learnt that many opportunities for engagement exist and that these are increasing. For example, Australia is expanding its scholarship assistance through the Australian Scholarships Program and will double the total number of education awards offered to the region to over 19, 000. It was with their benefits in mind that the Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider establishing a Pacific Island Youth Ambassador Scheme (similar to and possibly linked with the Australian Youth Ambassador Scheme or AusAID Development Scholarships), whereby young skilled Pacific Islanders can apply for placements in an Australian host organisation workplace for the purpose of work experience and cultural exchange. It is the Committee’s view that an exchange such as this will build further personal contacts and—in time—boost cooperative networks in Australia and the Pacific...|$|E

This demonstrates how the theory is useful for its explanation of small state foreign policy behaviour, but also providing an insightful revelation of the theories flaws.

Introduction: The Lowy Institute hosted the inaugural Australia-Papua New Guinea Emerging Leaders Dialogue on 26 November 2013. The Dialogue was convened {{with the support of}} the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and was an initiative that arose from the 2012 Papua New Guinea-Australia Ministerial Forum. Twenty-two emerging leaders from Papua New Guinea and Australia, from across the business, government, media and non-government sector, participated in the Dialogue. The Dialogue focused on four main themes: Growing the economy and attracting investment in the Asian Century; Politics and accountability – new expectations; National infrastructure challenges – new approaches; Reform and innovations in the delivery of health and education services. Key findings: 	Perceptions of Papua New Guinea among the Australian public and business community are narrowly based. They focus on media reports on mining, crime and corruption. These perceptions could be improved by businesses better publicising their successes in Papua New Guinea, the use of creative media and increasing <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> between the two countries through networking and structured collaboration. 	Social media is rapidly changing the media landscape in Papua New Guinea. Although traditional media continues to be important, the proliferation of mobile phones has given Papua New Guineans, including those living in rural or remote areas, the ability to influence what the media reports and to get their message into the public sphere. 	Australia and Papua New Guinea, although at difference stages of development, face many of the same challenges in infrastructure and the delivery of services to remote areas. Papua New Guinea could benefit from Australia’s experience in consultative infrastructure planning between governments and business and using emerging, cheap technologies to meet the health and education needs of remote communities...|$|E

That is why I commissioned the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper. I took a clear decision that our nation should actively plan for and shape our national future. Only by doing so can we realise our vision of being a land of increased opportunity, prosperity and fairness. Whatever else this century brings, it will bring Asia’s rise. The transformation of the Asian region into the economic powerhouse {{of the world is}} not only unstoppable, it is gathering pace. In this century, the region in which we live will become home to most of the world’s middle class. Our region will be the world’s largest producer of goods and services and the largest consumer of them. History teaches us that as economic weight shifts, so does strategic weight. Thriving in the Asian century therefore requires our nation to have a clear plan to seize the economic opportunities that will flow and manage the strategic challenges that will arise. There are also great social and cultural benefits to be had from broadening and deepening our <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> across the region.

ForewordAsia’s rise is changing the world. This is a defining feature of the 21 st century—the Asian century. These developments have profound implications for people everywhere. Asia’s extraordinary ascent has already changed the Australian economy, society and strategic environment. The scale and pace of the change still to come mean Australia is entering a truly transformative period in our history. Within only a few years, Asia will not only be the world’s largest producer of goods and services, it will also be the world’s largest consumer of them. It is already the most populous region in the world. In the future, it will also be home to the majority of the world’s middle class. The Asian century is an Australian opportunity. As the global centre of gravity shifts to our region, the tyranny of distance is being replaced by the prospects of proximity. Australia is located {{in the right place at}} the right time—in the Asian region in the Asian century. For several decades, Australian businesses, exporters and the community have grown their footprint across the region. Today, for Australia, the minerals and energy boom is the most visible, but not the only, aspect of Asia’s rise. As the century unfolds, the growth in our region will impact on almost all of our economy and society. An increasingly wealthy and mobile middle class is emerging in the region, creating new opportunities. They are demanding a diverse range of goods and services, from health and aged care to education to household goods, and tourism, banking and financial services, as well as high-quality food products.

Overview The Australian Government is committed to providing opportunities to assist indigenous peoples —both in Australia and overseas—to overcome social and economic disadvantages. Indigenous peoples make up only 5 per cent of the global population; however they make up 15 per cent of the world’s poor and {{about one-third of the}} world’s 900 million extremely poor rural people. Australia’s first peoples are one of the oldest continuous living cultures on Earth. The contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to modern Australian society is an enormous part of what makes our country and who we are. The Australian Government is committed to better engagement with its Indigenous peoples to ensure policies and programmes improve their lives and opportunities across the country. Globally, Australia continues to be a strong advocate for the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples around the world in international matters which affect them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is committed to ensuring that indigenous peoples benefit from its work. Through a network of 95 overseas posts in 77 countries, and in partnership with government and non-government organisations, business and community groups in Australia and overseas, DFAT leads the Australian Government’s efforts to: 	advance Australia’s security interests internationally 	open up new markets and create conditions for increased trade and investment to strengthen Australia’s economy and to create jobs 	lift living standards and reduce poverty in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond 	shape the regional and international environment and strengthen global cooperation in ways that advance Australia’s interests 	project a positive and contemporary image of Australia as a destination for business, investment, tourism and study 	provide high-quality passport and consular services to Australian citizens. DFAT {{has developed}} a five-year Indigenous Peoples Strategy to align its work on issues affecting indigenous peoples across the foreign policy, aid, trade and corporate objectives for the department. The Indigenous Peoples Strategy provides a framework for DFAT to work with its partners to advance and promote the wellbeing of indigenous peoples around the world, in line with Australia’s national interest. DFAT will use the strategy to manage for positive results and continual improvement in its work on issues affecting indigenous peoples. DFAT will assess and disseminate lessons from its work to contribute towards evidence and debate about issues affecting indigenous peoples, both in Australia and overseas. The strategy will be guided by four pillars to achieve this vision: 	DFAT will work with its partners to influence international policy to advance the interests of indigenous peoples in the international community. 	DFAT will strive to deliver international programs that improve outcomes for indigenous peoples. 	DFAT will encourage Indigenous Australians to apply for DFAT-funded opportunities to engage in and develop <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> with the international community.

40|$|John Fitzgerald {{argues that}} {{democracy}} matters in Australia’s dealings with China PUBLIC DISCUSSION since the airing of allegations by First Secretary Chen Yonglin and former security officer Hao Fengjun {{that a large}} Chinese spy network operates in Australia {{has focused on the}} facts of the case, the reactions of federal government departments, the response of Chinese ambassador Fu Ying, and the lessons that might be drawn for Australia. Missing from the discussion so far is some understanding of the historical background to this affair one that offers clues to its resolution. That background is the struggle for democracy in China. This has been regarded as a Chinese domestic affair since the crackdown in 1989, but looms once again as a crucial issue in China’s relations with Australia. In September 1999, the courageous Chinese democratic activist Wei Jingsheng stood in line outside Parliament House in Canberra {{to catch a glimpse of}} Chinese President Jiang Zemin as he made his way to a formal lunch with Prime Minister John Howard. For the occasion Wei had composed a brief hand-written message that he hoped to pass on to Jiang. Translated, the message read: Honourable Mr Jiang Zemin, This is not our first encounter, and as you can already hear what I have to say through public channels there is no need for me to go into any detail here. I simply want to alert you to something. China is bound to change. In thinking about the changes that lie ahead, do you want to deal with reasonable people, or do you prefer dealing with unreasonable people? This is the biggest question that you face, and the biggest question confronting your party. It is easy to contact me through my New York Office [details follow] Wei Jingsheng [1] The question Wei framed for Jiang touched directly on the dilemma the Falun Gong movement presented to the Chinese government in 1999. Not long before Wei penned his message, the government launched a massive onslaught on the Falun Gong T’ai-Ch’i movement in China. The assault flowed from the unauthorised assembly of an estimated 10, 000 Falun Gong members who converged on Beijing from around the country in April, catching city authorities unawares when they gathered outside the central government’s residential compound near Tiananmen Square. [2] Tellingly, Jiang’s first reaction was to excoriate the county, city and provincial officials who had allowed Falun Gong practitioners to travel from their jurisdictions to Bejijng without monitoring their departures. Local officials were sacked for failing to keep a close eye on their patch. At the same time, Jiang classified the Falun Gong movement as an evil cult bent on bringing down the government and Communist Party and banned its practice in China. At the time Wei drafted his letter, China was growing so rapidly under the impact of market reforms that the Communist Party state was confronting the limits of its capacity for managing, manipulating and controlling a rapidly diversifying national community. The Falun Gong movement was a sign of rapid social change and a measure of the party-government’s failure to monitor and control it. A decade earlier, the authorities had turned down an opportunity to manage change by dealing with democratic reformers who spoke the language of reason, as Wei called it, when they appealed for a free press and the rights of organisation and assembly in the democracy movement of 1989. Indeed, Wei himself had led such calls in 1978 - 79, during the Democracy Wall movement, which was suppressed by Deng Xiaoping. [3] Having dismissed the voice of reason in 1979 and even more brutally in 1989, the government confronted, in 1999, a host of Falun Gong practitioners whose beliefs revolved around notions of miracle cures, alien invaders, the supernatural powers of the supreme leader and other claims that lay outside the range of any reasonable warrant. In asking whether the president preferred to deal with reasonable or unreasonable people in planning for the future, Wei was simply reminding Jiang that by crushing reasonable aspirations for democratic reform his Communist Party had unleashed irrational forces that would compel China to respond and change in ways that could well force the country to spin out of control. What are the facts and the lessons of the case? In 1999 Wei’s warning was directed to the Chinese government. Today it could well be directed toward the Australian government and Australian citizens who live in fear of harassment from Beijing. Leaving aside the rationality or otherwise of the Falun Gong religious movement, the liberty to believe and practise religion is a fundamental right in Western liberal democracies. Freedom of religion is not negotiable. If it can be established that China’s secret security system has spun out of control in Australia in response to Falun Gong and other alleged threats to the Communist Party state, then Chinese attempts to suppress dissent at home becomes a matter of concern not just to the Australian Federal Police, or to Foreign Affairs, but to all citizens of this country. The size and impact of the Chinese informant network in Australia reaches far beyond the small cohort of cloak and dagger intelligence operatives who are based in embassies, consulates, information bureaus, travel agencies and other legitimate businesses. Like the old East German Stasi informant system, China’s informant network is built on the benign principles of neighbourhood watch under the less benign supervision of paid operatives. These operatives gather and file information from a large number of formally recruited informers and informal volunteers in Australia, who report on their fellow students and working colleagues, before passing it on to higher authorities in the intelligence system back in China. It is estimated that one in 50 East Germans was an unpaid Stasi informant. With 40, 000 to 50, 000 visitors from China in Australia at any one time, one thousand informers in Australia is well within the range of plausibility. And given the flexible scalability of the operation, Chen Yonglin’s estimate of 1000 informants in Australia as likely underestimates as overstates the extent of the informant network at any point in time. The system has been functioning since diplomatic relations were first established in 1972, a time when Australian intelligence agencies were equally active in recruiting spies and informants to keep an eye on Australians in China. The scale was modest. This changed exponentially after the Beijing massacre of 1989. The Chinese informant network in Australia expanded to the point of recruiting a significant proportion of Chinese visitors to the country. These recruits informed embassy and consular officials about people the security services placed under surveillance, and occasionally carrying message back from officials to harass Chinese-Australian citizens. The system soon came to embrace the principle of plausible deniability. Throughout the 1990 s, Chinese-Australian democracy activists were warned that their families in China would suffer if they attended public rallies in this country. Non-Chinese academics were pointedly advised that their universities’ educational programs in China would suffer if they spoke at the same rallies. In some cases warnings were issued directly by consular officials. So a professor at Monash University, Bruce Jacobs, was warned that his access to China could be restricted if he spoke out. But in many cases warnings were conveyed through intermediaries whose roles could plausibly be denied by officials carrying diplomatic passports even though the intermediaries claimed unequivocally to speak on their behalf. These messages conveyed the impression that Chinese officials in this country would not hesitate to threaten Chinese-Australians if they stepped out of line. At no point however could Chinese officials be charged with exercising undue influence in conveying this message to Australian citizens and residents. The rate of informal surveillance picked up apace after the Falun Gong crackdown in 1999. Colleagues at universities in Australia advise that many of their academic visitors from China were summoned to meetings with local security forces on the eve of their departures from China and told who to contact and who to avoid among Chinese-Australians they might run across in the street. Under the circumstances this was sensible advice given that the visitors would fall under surveillance themselves if they happened to meet up with a suspect person who was already under surveillance. The same visitors were invited to report back on their return to China about any suspicious activities they observed among Chinese-Australians. In other cases, Chinese-Australian shopkeepers and people going about their business were warned that their families and friends in China would suffer if they stocked Falun Gong publications or associated with Falun Gong members. In my neighbourhood, one shop closed down shortly after removing suspect Falun Gong texts and discs from its shelves. Not long before the store closed, I asked the proprietor why the materials had been removed. ‘You know,’ he replied in an indirect form of speech that hinted at intimidation, ‘sometimes they can threaten people’s families. ’ Some might say that we need not be too concerned about this kind of harassment as it affects our friends in China, where surveillance is the currency of daily life. People in Shanghai and Beijing probably find this kind of surveillance less onerous to bear than the systematic repression and mass terror that characterised the Maoist era. [4] What should concern us, however, is indicative evidence of relentless attempts by the Chinese regime to monitor and report on the behaviour of Australian citizens by invisible means. There is no formal mechanism for dealing with this kind of harassment of Australian citizens. Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian government can and does lodge formal protests with the Chinese government concerning the exercise of ‘improper influence’ when such claims are fully substantiated. But formal diplomatic protests are extremely rare because substantiating a claim of surveillance or harassment involves two conditions that cannot normally be met. First, foreign officials on diplomatic passports can be called to account for ‘improper influence’ only when they are caught red-handed. As the informant system operates through intermediaries without diplomatic status no official is likely to be caught in the act although as Chen Yonglin has shown some may come forward of their own account. Second, Australians who are intimidated in this way are unlikely to test Chinese government threats to harm their families in China. Putting claims of this kind in writing to support an official complaint of ‘improper influence’ would be to sign a warrant for the arrest and persecution of their friends and families in China. In defence of officials in China’s Foreign Ministry, it should be recalled that the Communist Party stands above the law in China and behaves towards Chinese officials at home and abroad as menial servants of the party state. [5] Chinese Foreign Affairs officers are hauled over the coals on their return to China if they have not fulfilled their quota of dossiers on Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents, or have failed to make an appropriate number of strident complaints about their host government’s relations with Taiwan. The party has little patience for the subtleties of international diplomacy and less inkling of the effects of its actions on public opinion abroad, because it has no domestic experience of being held accountable for anything. This is where the danger lies for China’s relations with Australia. A recent Lowy Institute survey of the standing of other countries in Australian public opinion placed China sixth overall, well ahead of the US. It would be instructive to see where China rates in the public mind today. [6] By its behaviour the Chinese government runs a real risk of setting loose irrational forces in Australia that don’t need much encouragement, history would suggest, to consider China a hostile power. It has long been clear that the people of Australia do not care a great deal about maintaining healthy government-to-government relations when the lives and livelihoods of its citizens are at stake, as the case of Schapelle Corby in Bali clearly illustrates. The same principle could be extended to China with little prompting and, if not properly managed, with damaging consequences. Leaving aside questions of bureaucratic competence in the handling of Chen Yonglin and Hao Fengjun, four broad lessons can be drawn from recent events. First, China’s Foreign Affairs representatives in Australia need to send a clear message home that Australians do not like foreign governments harassing Australians. Failure to heed this message in China could have long-term consequences for the sensible management of relations between our two countries at a time when economic, political and <b>people-to-people</b> <b>links</b> have every reason to grow from strength to strength. Second, there is little that the Australian Federal Police, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can do directly to put an end to the harassment of Australian citizens on the scale revealed by Chen Yonglin. The government is constrained not by a commitment to placing economic interests above basic human rights but simply because Chinese informants in Australia cannot be effectively cautioned within prevailing diplomatic codes. Nevertheless, the Australian government can reinforce the message that Australians do not like foreign governments harassing their fellow citizens by publicly stating and privately restating this proposition at every available opportunity. Third, given the formidable constraints on government action it is up to the people of Australia to engage in a bit of plain speaking. Bob Brown of the Greens showed during Jiang’s visit in 1999 that we do not all need to be dumbfounded by the ambiguities that confront a government in office when it comes to managing relations with China. More recently, Brown has distinguished himself as the only member of parliament capable of talking about Chinese government harassment of Australians without a forked tongue over the week since Chen Yonglin went public in Sydney. Finally, the case brings home to Australians a lesson that people in China learned many years ago. There will be no end to harassment until the Communist Party is prepared to share power with other contenders in an open society that operates under the rule of law and holds the party accountable to the law. For Australian citizens no less than the citizens of China it is critically important that Communist leaders start to deal with ‘rational people’, as Wei put it in his letter to Jiang. The Chinese government must start negotiating with those who advocate freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion and, above all, government accountability. Australians who may have imagined that the call for democracy in China was a domestic Chinese affair are coming to appreciate that it is a matter of concern to us all including those who would wish China well as it seeks to establish its rightful place in the world. Notes 1. Wei Jingsheng asked me to pass his letter to President Jiang, a task I tried to do through an intermediary. A copy is in my possession. 2.

Australian China specialist David Goodman captured these events in his book Beijing Street Voices (Marion Boyars, 1981). Wei Jingsheng’s role in the wider democracy movement is the subject of Paul Monk’s new book, Thunder from the Silent Zone: Rethinking China (Scribe 2005). 4. For a recent account of terror in the Maoist era see Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: The Untold Story (London: Cape, 2005). 5. See for example Minxin Pei, ‘China’s Governance Crisis’, China Review 23 (2002) and Suisheng Zhao, ‘Political Liberalism without Democratisation’, Journal of Contemporary China 12 : 35 (2003). 6. Australians Speak 2005 : Public Opinion and Foreign Policy (Lowy Institute, 2005). John Fitzgerald is professor in Asia-Pacific Studies at the Australian National University. His most recent volume, After the Rush (with Sophie Couchman and Paul Macregor), focuses on Chinese-Australian history since the gold rush era.
