"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

60|$|After this I saluted such of the councillors {{present as}} I knew, {{which was not}} many, {{for most of my}} old friends were dead, and sat down upon the stool that was <b>placed</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not very far from the dwarf Zikali, who stared at me in a stony fashion, as though he had never seen me before.|$|R
2500|$|In 1934, Shach was {{appointed}} rosh yeshiva of the Novardok yeshiva. This came {{about as a}} result of the recommendation of Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (known as the Chazon Ish) to one of the yeshiva's founders, Rabbi Bentzion Brook. During this time in Shach's life, the rest of his family stayed in Kletsk, while he stayed in the Novardok yeshiva for extended periods of time. After approximately two years, Shach left the yeshiva, because, in his own words, [...] "this is not the <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> for many reasons". In 1935, Shach became rosh yeshiva at the Hasidic Karlin yeshiva in Luninets. He also functioned as the mashgiach ruchani of the yeshiva, giving customary mussar sermons to the yeshiva students. Shach remained at the yeshiva until the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Another similar, {{though less}} spectacular, episode {{happened}} with 2005 Divac's {{attempt to take}} over the Večernje novosti, a Serbian high-circulation daily. He made an agreement with small shareholders {{to take over the}} company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital. However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted {{what should have been a}} mere technical move. [...] While the attempted takeover was a [...] "backdoor" [...] one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already happened. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily. Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor, he withdrew from the contest, citing [...] "friendly advice" [...] by unnamed persons. Embittered, he decided to stop his attempts to invest in Serbia: [...] "All of this is ugly and I'm very upset... I realized that there's no <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in Serbia and my friends can meet me in Madrid from now on... In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them".|$|E
2500|$|On December 29, 2013 DiFranco {{issued an}} apology, announcing {{that she was}} {{cancelling}} the retreat, stating that [...] "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege {{or the fact that}} i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... i think many positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design. [...] {{i do not wish to}} reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation. at this point I wish only to cancel." [...] The singer's statements were called [...] "remarkably unapologetic" [...] on Jezebel, and [...] "a variety of excuses and justifications" [...] by Ebony,. Additionally, a piece at The Guardian said the announcement made [...] "much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse." ...|$|E
