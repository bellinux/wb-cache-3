5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous.

40|$|Paleoclimatic and {{modeling}} studies {{dealing with the}} climatic conditions during a past and future warmer Earth have shown an inverse climatic relationship (wet/dry) between the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa. This study used monthly mean temperatures and monthly total precipitation during the 30 -year period from 1951 to 1980 {{to determine if there}} are, indeed, climatic relationships between the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa. ^ The annual amounts of precipitation are used to divide each region into subregions of which there are ten in North Africa and three in the Great Plains. Precipitation data are also used to calculate the correlation coefficients between subregions in the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa. Correlation coefficients between temperature and precipitation among stations are also calculated. ^ There are indications of negative relationships between northern and southern subregions in both the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa, but direct as well as indirect climatic relationships exist between the Great <b>Plains</b> subregions <b>and</b> North African subregions. In general, climatic relationships between the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North African subregions are weak and insignificant. This conclusion is in contrast with the conclusions obtained from paleoclimatic {{and modeling}} studies. ^ Indirect climatic relationships between the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa were experienced during the Great Plains drought of 1952 - 1956 and during the Sahel drought of 1968 - 1973. The persistance of certain patterns of the general circulation may be the main cause of these droughts. Changes in the circulation patterns over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (due to the effect of SSTs) were associated with changes in the circulation patterns over the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa. These changes may produce climatic teleconnections between the Great <b>Plains</b> <b>and</b> North Africa. ...|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River <b>Plain</b> <b>and</b> re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River <b>Plain</b> <b>and</b> Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

The <b>plains</b> <b>and</b> terra unit, occurring in the central and eastern parts of the quadrangle, was originally mapped to the east in the Kuiper quadrangle (De Hon and others, 1981). The term was there applied where differences in image quality prevent clear distinctions between <b>plains</b> <b>and</b> terra materials. The name was adopted in the Beethoven quadrangle for the same reason. The unit intergrades to the west and south with intercrater <b>plains</b> material <b>and</b> is interpreted to be of the same origin and composition.|$|R
