40|$|This thesis explores John Donne's {{vision of}} the Apocalypse as {{revealed}} by his religious poetry and prose. Donne believed himself to be alive in the last age of the world; however, he rejected historicist interpretations of the Apocalypse. Instead, he located the conflict with sin and death within the individual soul. Donne was concerned to create {{an image of the}} sinful soul restored to unity with the divine through its own exertions and by God's grace, free from social and political constraints. The Apocalypse presented Donne with a paradigm of unity which he appropriated in order to represent the interconnexion of God and humankind, as well as to situate himself within a present unfolding of ultimate conformity. Knowledge {{of the role of the}} Apocalypse in Donne's self-presentation, <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of the extent to which Donne understood himself to be an active participant in the fulfilment of the Providential design...|$|E
40|$|Haptic {{perception}} {{is an active}} process that <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of objects that are encountered as an organism scans its environment. In contrast to the sensation of touch produced by contact with an object, the perception of object location arises from the interpretation of tactile signals {{in the context of}} the changing configuration of the body. A discrete sensory representation and a low number of degrees of freedom in the motor plant make the ethologically prominent rat vibrissa system an ideal model for the study of the neuronal computations that underlie this perception. We found that rats with only a single vibrissa can combine touch and movement to distinguish the location of objects that vary in angle along the sweep of vibrissa motion. The patterns of this motion and of the corresponding behavioral responses show that rats can scan potential locations and decide which location contains a stimulus within 150 ms. This interval is consistent with just one to two whisk cycles and provides constraints on the underlying perceptual computation. Our data argue against strategies that do not require the integration of sensory and motor modalities. The ability to judge angular position with a single vibrissa thus connects previously described, motion-sensitiv...|$|E

Their main products are copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver. To make it easier to standardize the procurement process and introduce new lead-buyers, Boliden has decided to create a procurement manual. The primary purpose of the Manual is to provide an overview of Bolidens procurement operations, procurement processes and procurement information systems. As such, this Manual <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of mandatory requirements, policy considerations, guidelines, procedures and best practices. The manual will contain job descriptions for all roles involved in procurement, instructions on how to handle communications, purchasing ethics and policies and detailed descriptions of the procurement process and its sub processes. In this project this manual is created through interviews and workshops with relevant personnel. The manual is adopted for presentation at the company intranet. In the process of creating this manual five main processes are identified: Governance and administration, strategic sourcing, contracting, operative procurement and supplier management. These processes are mapped in flowcharts and presented in the report. The final conclusions of this report is that in order to be able to control and measure the procurement process in order to improve it, it has to be properly mapped. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Disability impacts one’s {{life and}} many South African {{people with disabilities}} remain {{socially}} excluded as they are denied access to employment. This research {{study was conducted to}} understand the experiences of a group of people with disabilities who were engaged in an employment assisted programme (EAP) as a means of accessing the open labour market. The Literature Review provided a rich theoretical base by giving an overview of the concepts underpinning disability related issues within the social context of employment in the open labour market. A qualitative research approach was followed using individual descriptive case studies as the research design. Five unemployed young people with disabilities, who engaged an EAP, participated in the research study. Semi-structured interviews contributed to the rich information regarding their experiences relating to engaging in the EAP. Informed consent was obtained to ensure voluntary participation by the participants. Data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Four themes relating to each of the corresponding objectives emerged from the findings. The themes were: Theme One: Vehicle of progression This theme highlights the expectations held by the participants as they entered and engaged the EAP. Theme Two: Belonging in the world of work This theme captures the process of engagement in the EAP. It encapsulates the collective experiences which reflect coping factors, benefits and challenges encountered in the EAP. Theme Three: Active participation begins with me This theme reveals action taken by participants’ to promote personal progress relating to expectations and challenges presented in the EAP.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} interpretative {{possibility}} of literary emotion in Anglophone African-Caribbean women's writing. It develops the now well-established study of mental and cultural decolonisation {{to focus on}} the role and value of emotions in this process. I argue that when power structures have become internalised {{to the extent that the}} emotions are affected, literature's privileged role in affecting its readers offers a way to impart knowledge that is both cognitive and emotional and that can lead towards social and human transformation. The social structures in the Caribbean that evoke or prohibit emotion and its expression have a specific history in the region that need to be understood in context. Thus a study of emotion in these literary works needs to move from the universal discourse of emotion to a specific Caribbean emotion epistemology. A focus on the role of emotion in Caribbean women's writing <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of how shame, anger, and love shape subjectivities and can deepen an understanding of the political and social mechanisms that result in hierarchies, disunity, conflict, and even physical violence. Through close readings of selected novels (Merle Hodge' s Crick Crack, Monkey and For the Life ofLaetitia, Dionne Brand's In Another Place, Not Here, Merle Collins's Angel, and Erna Brodber's Jane and Louisa Will Soon Come Home, Myal, and The Rainmaker's Mistake) I explore how emotion works to broaden an awareness of social problems. Furthermore, I argue that the authors' literary techniques shape a specific reader response to each novel that makes an intellectual understanding of healing and transformation simultaneously affect the reader on an emotional level. In this way, I suggest that each novel's structure mirrors the form of intervention that is described in the novel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Southern Tasmanian shelf {{waters are}} {{host to the}} {{seasonal}} interplay of Australia’s two poleward boundary currents; the East Australian Current (EAC) and the Leeuwin Current (LC). While the behaviour and properties of the LC remain underexplored, strong research focus has allowed insight into how an intensifying EAC has created greater subtropical influence, leading {{to changes in the}} physical and biological oceanography of the region. In this cool temperate setting seven species of dinoflagellates, all in the genus Ceratium, which are more typically associated with warm waters of eastern Australia, were observed. This coincided with the seasonal increase in the EAC’s southward penetration beginning in October. Despite the seasonal peak in EAC activity, temperature-salinity plots, nutrient, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton concentrations all indicate the presence of subantarctic waters on the shelf and in coastal waters in summer. Our results are consistent with the description of the EAC as an erratic, eddy-driven current; this itself allowing the periodic influx of subantarctic waters across the shelf. In winter, temperature- salinity plots and nutrient concentrations indicate that the LC was present in southern shelf waters. In addition to its high nitrate signature, the LC displayed low silicate properties in southern Tasmania. Chlorophyll a concentrations revealed a distinct spring bloom event and an extended, productive summer, typical of temperate and subantarctic systems, respectively. This suggests the region is a transitional state between classic seasonal primary production cycles for temperate and subantarctic waters. This paper links changes in southern Tasmanian microphytoplankton communities to shelf ventilation by the EAC, the LC and subantarctic waters, and provides new insight into the oceanography of the region. Consequently, this study <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of potential phytoplankton perturbations that may be applied to other coastal cool temperate marine environment...|$|E
40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a multifaceted, complex {{problem that is}} {{associated}} with many other chronic health conditions. School nurses are well positioned to assess, intervene, and evaluate efforts to positively impact this population, however school nurse practice for obesity varies greatly. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine concepts related to the role of school nurse providing care to school age children with obesity using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Study 1 examined the self-reported physical and psychosocial quality of life of school age children with obesity and included descriptive comments from the school nurses providing their case management. The study found that the students with obesity had lower self-reported quality of life when compared to a healthy weight sample and comments from the school nurses reported the complex physical and psychosocial dynamics for students with obesity in the school setting. These findings supported that school-based interventions need to consider both physical psychological issues experienced by students to lead to successful outcomes. Study 2 investigated the experiences of school nurses providing care to students with overweight or obesity including perceived barriers and ways that school nurses successfully implement interventions with these students. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} limited time, heavy workload, limited resources, and supervisor pressure may prevent obesity interventions thus leading school nurses to use a "seize the moment" approach where they use any contact time with students to provide interventions and suggest that activities requiring small amounts of time may be best suited for successful implementation by school nurses. Nurses in this study described experiences associated with moral distress, a concept that has not been previously studied in school nurses. Study 3 examined the level of moral distress that exists in school nurses and its relationship to common moral dilemmas and school nurse characteristics. School nurses were found to experience moral distress and it was strongly related to many of the moral dilemmas experienced by school nurses. This study <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of this issue for school nurses and includes policy implications for school nursing practice...|$|E

40|$|Children {{participating}} in classroom field trips learn first hand in an authentic context. However, activities during these trips are often limited to observation and data collection. Children synthesize their knowledge later, in classroom discussions {{and in the}} collaborative construction of a representational artifact. But the classroom {{is removed from the}} authentic context in which the knowledge was gained. My research investigated how mobile technology can bridge this gap by supporting and encouraging young children (grades K- 4) to collaboratively construct knowledge artifacts, while simultaneously exploring open, educational environments. Three key elements are addressed; creating a concrete connection between digital information and the real world, supporting awareness of collaborative opportunities in an open environment, and promoting face-to-face collaboration. This dissertation details the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of the Tangible Flags technology; a tangible interface that is developmentally appropriate for children (grades K- 4) to embed and access digital information through their physical environment and multi-user tools that support collaboration in open environments. Tangible Flags are simple for children to attach to the environment and promote an awareness of artifact creation and exploration activities because they are visually apparent. An interface that <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of changes to digital artifacts and enables concurrent and remote access to these artifacts further enhances collaboration. Two studies were conducted to evaluate the concepts of Tangible Flags. A case study was conducted in an authentic outdoor learning environment, a National Park. A second study compares children's use of the Tangible Flags technology to a roughly equivalent paper system. Quantitative and qualitative analysis indicates that children using Tangible Flags participated in more asynchronous collaborative activity and were more engaged than those who did not. It also showed that awareness of peer activity combined with remote and concurrent access to digital artifacts resulted in increased face-to-face collaborative activity and examines the impact of artifact awareness and access on children's focus on the environment. These contributions will be useful to educators, designers of educational environments and researchers in the field of children's educational technology...|$|E
40|$|How {{should we}} think about the role of visual spatial {{awareness}} in perception and perceptual knowledge? A common view, which finds a characteristic expression in Kant but has an intellectual heritage reaching back farther than that, is that an account of spatial awareness is fundamental to a theory of experience because spatiality is the defining characteristic of "outer sense", of our perceptual awareness of how things are in the parts of the world that surround us. A natural counterpart to this idea is to treat self-consciousness as residing in a kind of sense that is fundamentally "inner", such as introspection or whatever else gives one privileged access to his own mental states as well as the proprioceptive and kinesthetic awareness of bodily position. This division is compatible, of course, with the idea that inner sense <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of a distinctive kind of "body space", but it treats that as importantly different from the awareness of the worldly space around one. In contrast to such a picture, this dissertation proposes an account of visual spatial awareness according to which it is no less a source of self-consciousness than of the awareness of the objects around us, and an account of self-awareness in which visual experience is essentially implicated. I begin by arguing that we should think of visual spatial awareness not as necessary for the individuation of visual sensations but rather as an essential element in the awareness of an experientially objective world. In the subsequent chapters, I argue that in being visually aware of the egocentric positions of the worldly objects around us we are often aware also of our own spatial locations with respect to them, and that the visual experience of the world around one and one`s own situation in it is often an essential component in the knowledge that a human agent will have of his own intentional actions...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundaryless}} {{career has}} become a remarkably popular, albeit contentious, concept, with various academics and practitioners offering cautionary notes concerning the {{lack of understanding of}} boundary less career implications. This thesis argues that the boundaryless career concept is theoretically and empirically under-developed with regard to the impact of such careers, particularly those in what literature appears to consider 'non-professional' occupations. Beginning with a review of existing boundaryless career literature, this thesis moves on to introduce the notion of dairy farming as a boundaryless career and provides an insight into the impact such a career can have. Observations and interviews are then combined to produce an ethnographic case study of the experiences of the Culverden community with the findings being presented in three sections - individual, family and community. The discussion of each of these sections partially supports prevailing literature by confirming the existence of a number of positive aspects of boundaryless careers. At the same time however, these discussions identify a number of negative aspects associated with this type of career. The limitations of existing research are thus highlighted through confirming that career literature neglects the potential impacts of the positive aspects it regularly refers to, and almost entirely overlooks potential impacts of the negative aspects of boundaryless careers. This thesis therefore has not only theoretical significance through contributing to existing literature by providing insight into both the positive and negative impacts of boundaryless careers from not only an individual perspective, but also a family and community perspective, but also practical significance in that it <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of the potential implications of the boundaryless nature of dairy farming which may aid in the development of strategies to address problems and simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities created by the boundaryless nature of dairy farming. In this way, this thesis has the potential to {{play a crucial role in}} the maintenance of a cohesive, sustainable rural community...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how Ushirika wa Neema Deaconess Centre {{contributes}} to the empowerment {{of women in the}} ELCT-Northern Diocese and fosters gender awareness in the church and community. It also explores challenges which the deaconesses face in the Chagga patriarchal society. The collection of data was based mostly on semi-structured interviews. People were interviewed orally using some questions to guide the interviews. An interview schedule was prepared with a list or set of questions or issues which were to be explored during the interviews. The theoretical framework consists of Third Wave Feminist views of empowerment. The focus was on women’s empowerment which enables women to be critical and conscious about external realities and <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> about their internal thought construction and belief systems that affect their well being in terms of gender justice and social justice, as well as the determination to use their physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual resources to protect their lives and sustain values that guarantee gender equality at the personal, social, economic and institutional level. The study revealed that Ushirika wa Neema Deaconess Centre provides women with opportunities, such as the means for independent income, for education, for professional training and for learning skills. These opportunities change women’s self-esteem, and raise their self-confidence and respect in the church and community. The study also showed that women’s agency at home increased to some extent because of engaging in income-generating activities. This helps women to give advice to family members on different issues and influence household decisions. In addition, the education offered to deaconesses at Ushirika wa Neema has contributed to enable them to qualify to be leaders in different institutions in the ELCT-Northern diocese. Deaconess in leadership positions practice participatory and inclusive leadership which includes collaboration and teamwork. This contributes to change the mindset of the Chagga patriarchal society that women can be better leaders like men. On the other hand, it was found that there is tension between Chagga cultural values and the celibate life style of the deaconesses at Ushirika wa Neema which directly counters Chagga traditional social values of marriage and child bearing. Conclusively, this study noted that the learning of different skills at Ushirika wa Neema makes women more independent and self-reliant. From the findings of the study it has been recommended that strategies and mechanisms for gender equality must be strengthened...|$|E
40|$|High level {{environmental}} {{screening study}} for offshore wind farm developments – marine habitats and species This report <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> {{of the environmental}} issues related to marine habitats and species for developers and regulators of offshore wind farms. The information is also relevant to other offshore renewable energy developments. The marine habitats and species considered are those associated with the seabed, seabirds, and sea mammals. The report concludes that the following key ecological issues {{should be considered in}} the environmental assessment of offshore wind farms developments: • likely changes in benthic communities within the affected area and resultant indirect impacts on fish, populations and their predators such as seabirds and sea mammals; • potential changes to the hydrography and wave climate over a wide area, and potential changes to coastal processes and the ecology of the region; • likely effects on spawning or nursery areas of commercially important fish and shellfish species; • likely effects on mating and social behaviour in sea mammals, including migration routes; • likely effects on feeding water birds, seal pupping sites and damage of sensitive or important intertidal sites where cables come onshore; • potential displacement of fish, seabird and sea mammals from preferred habitats; • potential effects on species and habitats of marine natural heritage importance; • potential cumulative effects on seabirds, due to displacement of flight paths, and any mortality from bird strike, especially in sensitive rare or scarce species; • possible effects of electromagnetic fields on feeding behaviour and migration, especially in sharks and rays, and • potential marine conservation and biodiversity benefits of offshore wind farm developments as artificial reefs and 'no-take' zones. The report provides an especially detailed assessment of likely sensitivity of seabed species and habitats in the proposed development areas. Although sensitive to some of the factors created by wind farm developments, they mainly have a high recovery potential. The way in which survey data can be linked to Marine Life Information Network (MarLIN) sensitivity assessments to produce maps of sensitivity to factors is demonstrated. Assessing change to marine habitats and species as a result of wind farm developments has to take account of the natural variability of marine habitats, which might be high especially in shallow sediment biotopes. There are several reasons for such changes but physical disturbance of habitats and short-term climatic variability are likely to be especially important. Wind farm structures themselves will attract marine species including those that are attached to the towers and scour protection, fish that associate with offshore structures, and sea birds (especially sea duck) that may find food and shelter there. Nature conservation designations especially relevant to areas where wind farm might be developed are described and the larger areas are mapped. There are few designated sites that extend offshore to where wind farms are likely to be developed. However, cable routes and landfalls may especially impinge on designated sites. The criteria that have been developed to assess the likely marine natural heritage importance of a location or of the habitats and species that occur there can be applied to survey information to assess {{whether or not there is}} anything of particular marine natural heritage importance in a development area. A decision tree is presented that can be used to apply ‘duty of care’ principles to any proposed development. The potential ‘gains’ for the local environment are explored. Wind farms will enhance the biodiversity of areas, could act as refugia for fish, and could be developed in a way that encourages enhancement of fish stocks including shellfish...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is a study}} of 12 young people constructing identities in the transition between sixth form college and university. Identity is conceptualised as fluid and self-reflective. Giddens’ (1991) work on the reflexive project focuses on both narrative and reflexivity {{in the construction of}} identity, and this research uses the tool of narrative to capture the subjective experiences of the young people. Narrative methodology is shown to produce rich and detailed data and it both constructs as well as captures stories. The research process itself becomes part of the young people’s identity work. The young people are embedded in a social and historical context of late modernity and I endeavour to interrogate how structural forces shape and constrain identities. Some analysis of agency and choice in relation to identity is forwarded. The research findings foreground the student identities of the young people and explore what being a student means for the young people. Being in transition and issues of liminality are associated with this student status. The nature of transition is interrogated drawing on literature from anthropology and psychoanalytic theory among others. Transition is experienced by the young people as a space of betwixt and between-ness which has four particular effects on identity. Firstly, transition encapsulates a quality of temporality which concerns both the present and the future. It pushes the young people to conceive of making the transition to university as an opportunity to make a ‘fresh start’, and the new identity is future-oriented; transition shapes future as well as present selves. Secondly, transition disrupts the normal flow of life and often involves choice-making. Making choices, particularly those which will have future implications, brings identity into sharp relief through reflexive processes. Thirdly, transition to university involves moving into a broader landscape bringing encounters with a wider range of people. This forces issues of similarity, difference and otherness into the frame. Identities are reflexively constructed through understanding of similarity and difference, and transition provides the space where the young people are faced with both possibilities and limitations. On the one hand the broad social mix of university students <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of heterogeneity that the young people had not experienced before, with all the potential for new identities this opens up. But on the other hand, butting up against otherness and difference in this way solidifies and limits identities. Fourthly, transition precipitates mechanisms for connectedness. Connectedness- that is, the all-pervading and on-going relating with others; peers, friends and family- dominates the narratives of the young people and is significant in both social capital and support, and also identity. Cross-gender friendships are prevalent and are shown to have significant effects on identity. The role of emotion in social interaction is also analysed drawing on concepts of emotional capital and emotional literacy. Links are made between emotion and narrative and the place of emotions in the research process is also discussed. Giddens’ work on identity emphasises the role of reflexivity and yet the concept is not well analysed. Professional discourse is drawn on to open up the concept. The different ways the young people engage in reflexivity are demonstrated and reflexivity is found to be both contextdependent and also related to self-learning. The need for reflexivity is also applied to the research process. Narratives are co-productions and research authenticity calls for transparency and reflexivity of the researcher...|$|E

40|$|Participatory {{research}} methodologies {{and the use}} of interactive communication technologies (ICTs) such as email are increasingly seen by many researchers, including feminists, as offering ways to enhance women's inclusion, participation and empowerment. However, from critical and poststructuralist perspectives, some researchers suggest the need for greater caution about claims that participatory methodologies and certain communication technologies automatically enhance inclusion and empowerment. These researchers argue that issues of power, agenda and voice in the research context require greater attention (LeCompte, 1995). The major argument made in this thesis is that feminist researchers need to adopt a more critical and rigorous yet pragmatic approach to evaluating women's empowerment, inclusion and participation, and that this approach needs to include an analysis of diversity and difference, macro and micro contexts, power-knowledge relations, and the contradictory effects of participation. The outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} this approach can create new knowledge and understanding that will enable the development of more effective strategies for women's empowerment and inclusion. To explore and support this argument, findings are presented from a detailed evaluation and critique of a major feminist action research project that involved women in rural, regional and remote Queensland, Australia and elsewhere, a university research team and several government and industry partners. The project made extensive use of ICTs, including email and the Internet, and aimed to be empowering and inclusive. Given the many contradictory discourses of empowerment that currently circulate, empowerment is seen as a problematic concept. The multiple meanings and discourses of empowerment are therefore identified and considered in the analysis. With the increasing importance of communication technologies in rural community development, this study also evaluates the effectiveness of ICTs as a medium for empowering rural women. The 'politics of difference' (Young, 1990) that underpins attempts to include a diversity of rural women in feminist research projects presents many challenges to feminist praxis. Chapters 1 and 2 propose that, in evaluating such projects, researchers need to take diversity and difference into account to avoid reproducing stereotyped images of rural women, and to identify those who are included and excluded. This is because of the complex nature of the identity 'rural woman', the multiple barriers to women's participation, and the diverse needs, agendas and ideologies of participants and stakeholders. The concept of seriality (Young, 1994) is used in this study to avoid reproducing 'rural women' and feminist researchers as women with a singular identity. Chapters 1 and 2 argue that a comprehensive and critical analysis of these complex issues requires an eclectic, transdisciplinary approach, and that this can be fruitfully achieved by using a combination of two feminist frameworks of theory and epistemology: praxis feminism and feminist poststructuralism. While there are commonalities between these frameworks, the feminist poststructuralist framework takes a much more cautious and critical approach to claims for empowerment than praxis feminism. The praxis feminist framework draws on feminist theories that view power as social, cooperative and enabling. Women's diverse needs, values, issues and experiences are taken into account, and the analysis aims to gives voice to women. The purpose of this is to better understand the processes that meet women's diverse needs and could be empowering and inclusive for women (or otherwise). In contrast, the feminist poststructuralist framework uses Foucault's (1980) analytic of power as positive and strategic, exercised in all our interactions, and intimately connected to knowledge. The power-knowledge relations, and the multiple and shifting discourses and subject positions that were taken up in various research contexts are identified and analysed. The purpose of this is to highlight the contradictions and dangers inherent in feminist practices of empowerment that often go unnoticed. To achieve its practical and critical aims, this study uses two different, but complementary, {{research methodologies}}: participatory feminist evaluation and feminist deconstructive ethnography, and multiple research methods, which are outlined in Chapter 3. This eclectic approach is argued to provide maximum flexibility and creativity in the research process, and to enable the complexity and richness of the data to be represented and understood from a diversity of perspectives. Triangulation of the multiple methods and sources of data is employed to increase the validity and rigour of the analysis. Assessing how well feminist projects that use ICTs have met the aim of including a diversity of women requires an analysis of a wide range of complex social, economic,cultural, technological, contextual and methodological issues related to women's participation. Analysing these issues also requires giving voice to a diversity of participants' and stakeholders' assessments and meanings of 'diversity' and 'inclusion'. The results of this analysis, set out in Chapter 4, suggest that differences in perceptions of diversity and inclusion are strongly related to participants' and stakeholders' political and ideological beliefs and values, and their degree of commitment to social justice issues. The evaluation found that a limited diversity of women participated in the project, and identified many barriers to their participation. Feminists argue that women-only activities are often more empowering than mixed gender activities. The evaluation findings detailed in Chapter 5 suggest that the project's women-centred activities, particularly the workshops and online groups, were very successful in meeting the multiple needs of most participants. However, contradictory or undesirable effects of the project's activities were also identified. This analysis demonstrates the need to consider the various groups of participants and their diverse needs in assessing how well feminist methods and activities have met women's needs or are empowering. Chapter 6 identifies various forms and features of empowerment and disempowerment and categorises them as social, technological, political and psychological. A model is developed that illustrates the interrelationships between these four forms of empowerment. Technological empowerment is identified as a new under-theorised form of empowerment that is seen as increasingly important as ICTs become more central to women's networking and participation. However, the findings suggest that the extent to which participants want to be empowered needs to be respected. While many participants were found to have experienced the four forms of empowerment, their participation was also shown to have had various disempowering effects. The project's online group welink (women's electronic link), which linked rural and urban women, including government policy-makers, was assessed as the most empowering project activity. The discourse analysis and deconstructions, undertaken in Chapter 6, identify competing and contradictory discourses of new communication technologies and feminist participatory action research. The various discourses taken up by the researchers and participants were shown to have both empowering and disempowering effects. The analysis demonstrates the intersection between empowerment and disempowerment and the shifting subject positions that were taken up, depending on the research context. It was argued that the discourses of feminist action research operated as a 'regime of truth' (Foucault, 1980) that regulated and constrained the discourses and practices of this form of research. An analysis of a highly contentious welink discussion challenges feminist assumptions that giving voice to women will lead to empowerment, and suggests that silence can, in some circumstances, be empowering. This analysis highlights the intersection of voice and silence, the limitations of the gendered discourse of care and connection, and how this discourse, and other factors, regulated the use of more critical discourses. Critical reflections on the study are made in Chapter 7. They include the suggestion that an 'impossible burden' was placed on the project's feminist researchers who used an egalitarian feminist discourse that produced expectations of 'equal relations' between participants and researchers. However, these relations had to be established in the context of a university-based project that involved senior academic, government and industry staff. Drawing on the new knowledge and understandings developed, this study proposes several principles and strategies for feminist participatory action research projects that seek the inclusion and empowerment of rural women and use ICTs. They include the suggestion that feminists need an awareness of the limits to the politics of difference discourse when power-knowledge relations are ignored. A further principle is that there is value in adopting a Foucauldian analytic of power, since this enables a better understanding of the complex, multifaceted and dynamic nature of power-knowledge relations in the research context. This approach also <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> of how processes that attempt to empower will inevitably produce disempowerment at certain moments.

In this paper, we describe how two separate modules for these tasks, as we employ them in our virtual human Max, can give rise to secondary emotions such as frustration and relief. The BDI-based cognitive module is responsible for appraisal as well as reappraisal of elicited emotions that our conversational agent Max becomes aware of. The emotion dynamics simulation system is driven by the valence information of every emotion and assures a general consistency of the simulated emotions over time by dynamically <b>providing</b> <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> likelihood for every emotion. ...|$|R
