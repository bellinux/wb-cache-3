40|$|Abstract — In {{an effort}} to improve the {{property}} of escort mechanism of vertical internal broaching machine, a new-style escort mechanism is designed. Work process and defect about structure of escort mechanism in existence is firstly analyzed in depth, design concept and implementation methods of the new escort mechanism are then studied. Three-dimensional structure and work process are presented, and performance comparison between the new-style structure and the old one is conducted. Application study is launched at last. The innovative escort mechanism and slide board are movably connected and lumped together. In consequence, the escort mechanism will stop and then be hung at the column, while the <b>tool</b> <b>slide</b> continues to move down until broaching stop. The new-style escort mechanism has superiority such as low cost, high robust and good safety, and so on, which make it adaptive and useful for structural optimization of broaching machine.

40|$|Modeling protein {{flexibility}} in structure-based drug design and virtual screening remains a strong challenge {{due to the}} number of degrees of freedom involved and the co-optimization of protein and ligand shape and chemistry. However, there is a growing trend towards incorporating some protein side-chain flexibility modeling in docking, which enables better ligand positioning and scoring, which in turn can enhance the success of virtual screening. Here, we present several methods used for side-chain flexibility modeling in docking and recent insights gained from analyzing conformational transitions between ligand-free and bound crystal structures. BACKGROUND Improving Docking and Screening through Side-chain Flexibility Modeling Several studies have shown that better sampling of motions during docking, including sampling ligand orientations more finely and modeling induced fit between the protein and ligand, improves the ability of protein-ligand complementarity scoring functions to detect the most accurate docking (1 - 4). For instance, when using the docking and screening <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE</b> (Screening for Ligands with Induced-fit Docking, Efficiently) t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract High {{temperature}} wear of AlCrN coated <b>tool</b> steels <b>sliding</b> {{against the}} ultra-high strength boron steels used for hot press forming has been studied. The sliding wear tests {{have been carried}} out using a pin-on-disc of configuration under applied normal load of 50 N for 20 min with heating the ultra-high strength boron steels up to 800 o C. Characterizations of tribolayers formed on the contacting surfaces between the tribopairs of the AlCrN coated tool steels and the ultra-high strength boron steels have been studied. It was found on the tribolayers of the AlCrN coated tool steels that microcracking and oxides containing Fe and Cr to increase friction coefficient were formed at the early stage of sliding wear, followed by the generation of the smeared oxide layers containing Fe transferred from the tribopair to decrease friction coefficient. This may mainly contribute to very low specific wear rate of the AlCrN coated <b>tool</b> steels <b>sliding</b> against the ultra-high strength boron steels, resulting from oxide-oxide contact between the tribopair...|$|R

The training of neural network has been carried by mapping the positioning error using a laser interferometer. Key network parameters of the trained neural network has been extracted and used in a ‘C’ program for real time computation and compensation of the positioning error based on the position of the axis, by updating tool offset using global variable. The positioning error of the slide has been reduced to sub micrometer range after implementation of the module in the motion controller the high precision turning machine...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to learn from nature about the {{magnitudes}} of side-chain motions that occur when proteins bind small organic molecules and to test a computational model of sampling these motions {{for its ability to}} improve the prediction of protein-ligand complexes. Following analysis of protein side-chain motions upon ligand binding in 63 complexes, we tested the ability of the docking <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE</b> to model these motions appropriately without restricting them to rotameric transitions or deciding which side chains should be modeled as flexible. The model encoded and tested is that side-chain conformational changes involving more atoms or larger angles {{are likely to be more}} costly and less prevalent than small motions due to energy barriers between rotamers and the potential of large motions to cause new steric clashes. Accordingly, SLIDE adjusts the protein and ligand side groups as little as necessary to achieve steric complementarity. We tested the hypothesis that small motions are sufficient to achieve good dockings for 63 ligands into the apo structures of 20 different proteins and compared SLIDE side-chain rotations to those experimentally observed between apo and ligand-bound structures. None of these proteins undergo major main-chain conformational change upon ligand binding...|$|R
40|$|Summary. We present our database-{{screening}} <b>tool</b> <b>SLIDE,</b> {{which is}} capable of screening large data sets of organic compounds for potential ligands to a given binding site of a target protein. Its main feature is the modeling of induced complementarity by making adjustments in the protein side chains and ligand upon binding. Mean-field theory is used to balance the conformational changes in both molecules in order to generate a shape-complementary interface. Solvation is considered by prediction of water molecules likely to be conserved from the crystal structure of the ligand-free protein, and allowing them to mediate ligand interactions, if possible, or including a desolvation penalty when they are displaced by ligand atoms that do not replace the lost hydrogen bonds. A data set of over 175 000 organic molecules was screened for potential ligands to the progesterone receptor, dihydrofolate reductase, and a DNA-repair enzyme. In all cases the screening time {{was less than a}} day on a Pentium II processor, and known ligands as well as highly complementary new potential ligands were found.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} which post-processing imaging protocol would be better to analyze the additional mental foramen (AMF) in preoperative planning with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) exams, and to test reproducibility of measurements, using open source software (OsiriX). The software was used to detect the cases of AMF from among 58 exams for dental implant planning in edentulous mandible areas-three cases were found. The case images were submitted to qualitative analysis using 2 D orthogonal MPR, 3 D-MPR and 3 D volume rendering protocols by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. Quantitative analysis used the 3 D-MPR protocol; the closed <b>polygon</b> <b>tool</b> measured the mental foramen (MF) and the AMF areas; the length tool measured the distance between foramina. The measurements were performed independently by the examiners, at two different times. Intra- and interexaminer agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The panoramic view did not show the MF and the AMF clearly. The AMF could be detected in the parasagittal view. 2 D Orthogonal MPR was effective to observe the AMF in some cases. The 3 D-MPR and 3 D view protocols were the most effective to locate and analyze the AMF. In conclusion, a 3 D view improves visualization when anatomical points are not clearly visible. 3 D-MPR was considered a more effective post-processing imaging protocol to observe foramina relationships. The high reproducibility of measurements for anatomical MF variations was established using specific tools featured in open source software for CBCT. OsiriX is realistic and recommended for preoperative planning...|$|R
