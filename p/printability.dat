2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip <b>printability</b> are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E

50|$|Diketenes {{with two}} alkyl chains {{are used in}} the {{manufacture}} of paper for sizing of paper in order to improve their <b>printability</b> (by hydrophobization). Besides the rosin resins with about 60% share of world consumption, long chain diketenes called alkylketene dimers (AKD) are with 16% share the most important synthetic paper sizes, they are usually used in concentrations of 0.15%, meaning 1.5 kg solid AKD/t paper.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{functionality}} and <b>printability</b> {{can interfere}} with each other, mandating careful optimization. For example, a higher molecular weight in polymers enhances conductivity, but diminishes solubility. For printing, viscosity, surface tension and solid content must be tightly controlled. Cross-layer interactions such as wetting, adhesion, and solubility as well as post-deposition drying procedures affect the outcome. Additives often used in conventional printing inks are unavailable, because they often defeat electronic functionality.|$|E
50|$|Most paper types {{must have}} some water-resistance to {{maintain}} a specific writing quality and <b>printability.</b> Until 1980, the typical manner of adding this resistance was by using a rosin in combination with alum.

50|$|Plasma {{technology}} {{was used to}} modify a polyethylene membrane for enhanced adhesion, wettability and <b>printability.</b> These are usually performed by modifying the membrane on only its outermost several molecular levels. This allows the surface to behave differently without modifying {{the properties of the}} remainder. The surface was modified with acrylonitrile via a plasma coating technique. The resulting acrylonitrile-coated membrane was named PiAn-PE. The surface characterization demonstrated that PiAN-PE's enhanced adhesion resulted from the increased polar component of surface energy.|$|E
50|$|Sizing is {{used during}} paper {{manufacture}} {{to reduce the}} paper's tendency when dry to absorb liquid, {{with the goal of}} allowing inks and paints to remain {{on the surface of the}} paper and to dry there, rather than be absorbed into the paper. This provides a more consistent, economical, and precise printing, painting, and writing surface. This is achieved by curbing the paper fibers' tendency to absorb liquids by capillary action. In addition, sizing affects abrasiveness, creasibility, finish, <b>printability,</b> smoothness, and surface bond strength and decreases surface porosity and fuzzing.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{thermoplastics}} {{that are}} often utilized in traditional 3D printing, the chain entanglements and ionic interactions within the hydrogel-like [...] bioink rather than temperature dominate shape fidelity. The natural derivation of many bioinks often results in a high water content and sensitivity to harsh processing conditions. [...] Therefore, bioink filaments are often deposited at or below human body temperature and under mild conditions to preserve bioink <b>printability.</b> Additional considerations {{must be taken into}} account when printing bioinks blended with a cell suspension due to the need to preserve cell viability.|$|E

The Discbox Slider is 100% recyclable. Many covermount CDs released in British magazine Mixmag used to be packaged in Discbox slider, after replacing a standard jewel box, although the discbox slider itself was replaced by a simple cardboard sleeve.|$|E
50|$|Surface sizing {{solutions}} {{consists of}} mainly modified starches and sometimes other hydrocolloids, such as gelatine, or surface sizing agents such as acrylic co-polymers. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, {{resulting in a}} smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent. Sizing improves the surface strength, <b>printability,</b> and water resistance of the paper or material {{to which it is}} applied. In the sizing solution, optical brightening agents (OBA) may also be added to improve the opacity and whiteness of the paper or material surface.|$|E
50|$|Bioink {{compositions}} and chemistries {{are often}} inspired and derived from existing hydrogel biomaterials. However, these hydrogel biomaterials were often developed {{to be easily}} pipetted and cast into well plates and other molds. Altering the composition of these hydrogels to permit filament formation is necessary for their translation as bioprintable materials. However, the unique properties of bioinks offer new challenges in characterizing material <b>printability.</b> Unlike traditional 3D printing materials such as thermoplastics that are essentially ‘fixed’ once they are printed, bioinks are a dynamic system due to their high water contains and often non-crystalline structure. The shape fidelity of the bioink after filament deposition must also be characterized. Finally, the printing pressure and nozzle diameter {{must be taken into}} account to minimize the shear stresses placed on the bioink and on any cells within the bioink during the printing process. Too high shear forces may damage or lyse cells, adversely affecting cell viability.|$|E
50|$|In general inkjet {{solar cells}} {{are made by}} using an inkjet printer {{to put down the}} {{semiconductor}} material and electrodes onto a solar cell substrate. Both organic and inorganic solar cells can be made using the inkjet method. Inkjet printed inorganic solar cells are mainly CIGS solar cells. The organic solar cells are polymer solar cells. The inkjet printing of hybrid perovskite solar cells is also possible. The most important component of the ink is the functional material: a metal salt mixture(CIGS), a polymer fullerene blend (polymer solar cells) or a precursor of mixed organic and inorganic salts (perovskite solar cells). These components are dissolved in an appropriate solvent. Additional components might be added to affect the viscosity and the surface tension of the ink for improved <b>printability</b> and wetting on the substrate. The ink is contained in a cartridge from where it is transferred onto a substrate which can vary. The printing is accomplished usually by a piezoelectric driver in the nozzles of the printhead, that is programmed to apply pre-set patterns of pressure to eject droplets. In most cases several layers of functional materials are deposited {{on top of each other}} to generate a working solar cell. The entire printing process can be done in ambient conditions, though in most cases further heat treatments are needed. Important factors for the efficiency of inkjet printed organic solar cells are the inkjet latency time,the inkjet printing table temperature, and the effect of the chemical properties of the polymer donor.|$|E
5000|$|The boron {{concentration}} of ulexite is commercially significant because boron compounds {{are used in}} producing materials for many branches of industry. Boron is primarily used in the manufacturing of fiberglass along with heat resistant borosilicate glasses such as traditional Pyrex, car headlights, and laboratory glassware. Borosilicate glass is desirable because adding B2O3 lowers the expansion coefficient, therefore increasing the thermal shock resistance of the glass. Boron and its compounds are also a common ingredients in soaps, detergents, and bleaches, which contributes to the softening of hard water by attracting the calcium ions. Boron usage in alloy and metal production has been increasing because of its excellent metal oxide solubilizing ability. Boron compounds are used as a reinforcing agent in order to harden metals for use in military tanks and armor. Boron is used extensively for fire retardant materials. Boron is an essential element for plant growth and is frequently used as a fertilizer, however in large concentrations boron can be toxic, and therefore boron is a common ingredient in herbicides and insecticides. Boron {{is also found in}} chemicals used to treat wood and as protective coatings and pottery glazes. [...] Additionally, when ulexite is dissolved in a solution of carbonate, calcium carbonate forms as a by-product. This by-product is used in large amounts by the pulp and paper industry as a paper filler and as a coating for paper that allows for improved <b>printability</b> (Demirkiran and Kunkul, 2011).Recently, as more attention is being given to obtaining new sources of energy, the use of hydrogen as a fuel for cars has come to the forefront. The compound sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is currently being considered as an excellent hydrogen storage medium due to its high theoretical hydrogen yield by weight for future use in cars. Piskin (2009) validates that the {{boron concentration}} in ulexite can be used as the boron source or the starting material in the synthesis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4).|$|E

Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.In unidirectional metal layers, tip-to-tip spacing is one of the more severe issues for single exposure patterning. For the 40 nm pitch vertical lines, an 18 nm nominal tip-to-tip drawn gap resulted in an actual tip-to-tip distance of 29 nm with OPC (optical proximity correction), while for 32 nm pitch horizontal lines, the tip-to-tip distance with a 14 nm nominal gap went to 31 nm with OPC. These actual tip-to-tip distances define a lower limit of the half-pitch of the metal running in the direction perpendicular to the tip. In this case, the lower limit is around 30 nm. With further optimization of the illumination (discussed in the section on source-mask optimization), the lower limit can be further reduced to around 25 nm. For larger pitches, where conventional illumination can be used, the line tip-to-tip distance is generally larger. For the 24 nm half-pitch lines, with a 20 nm nominally drawn gap, the distance was actually 45 nm, while for 32 nm half-pitch lines, the same nominal gap resulted in a tip-to-tip distance of 34 nm. With OPC, these become 39 nm and 28 nm for 24 nm half-pitch and 32 nm half-pitch, respectively.|$|E
40|$|As the VLSI {{feature size}} has already {{decreased}} below lithographic wavelength, the <b>printability</b> problem due to strong diffraction effects poses {{a serious threat}} to the progress of VLSI technology. A circuit layout with poor <b>printability</b> implies {{that it is difficult to}} make the printed features on wafers follow designed shapes without distortions. The development of Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET) can alleviate the <b>printability</b> problem but cannot reverse the trend of de-terioration.

Thus, there is a strong demand to consider the sub-wavelength <b>printability</b> problem in circuit layout designs.

40|$|Determining the <b>printability</b> of {{substrate}} defects {{beneath the}} extreme ultraviolet (EUV) reflecting multilayer stack {{is an important}} issue in EUVL lithography. Several simulation studies have been performed in the past to determine the tolerable defect size on EUV mask blank substrates but the industry still has no exact specification based on real <b>printability</b> tests. Therefore, it is imperative to experimentally determine the <b>printability</b> of small defects on a mask blanks that are caused by substrate defects using direct printing of programmed substrate defect in an EUV exposure tool. SEMATECH fabricated bump type program defect masks using standard electron beam lithography and performed printing tests with the masks using an EUV exposure tool.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{attention given to}} the <b>printability</b> of reticle defects {{and their impact on}} wafer yields. Over the last year the <b>printability</b> risk from small defects increased due to the wider application of Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) structures and the inclusion of more phase shifting reticles. There have been several simulation studies on the <b>printability</b> of subhalfmicron defects using lens and illumination parameters of 5 X reduction steppers. Since submicron 1 X projection systems are being incorporated into numerous fabrication lines, there is a clear need to determine if these systems show similar sensitivity to sub-halfmicron defects as reduction steppers. Earlier experimental work examined the <b>printability</b> of several classes of sub-halfmicron 25 μm defects on a submicron 1 X stepper. To extend this work, a three dimensional (3 D) optical lithography simulation tool has been employed to predict the <b>printability</b> of various reticle defect scenarios. Experimental data was used to validate the 3 D simulator by comparing modeling data to SEM measurements of wafers exposed with a reticle containing programmed clear pinhole and opaque pindot defects. A statistically designed simulation study was performed to quantify the critical dimension (CD) variation resulting from defects of varying sizes, proximity to a feature edge and variations in the pitch of the impacted line/space features. An additional statistically designed simulation was then used to predict the <b>printability</b> behavior of defects relative to different feature sizes over a range of numerical aperture and partial coherence settings applicable to a 1 X lens design. Finally, the impact of defect length and width on <b>printability</b> were characterized for rectangular defects over a range of sizes. Overall, this analysis enhances the understanding of the relationship between reticle defects and 1 X projection optics and allows for determination of optimal reticle defect specifications for cost effective lithography applications...|$|E
