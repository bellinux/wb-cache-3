5|$|The goal of tuning a {{pipe organ}} is {{to adjust the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> each pipe so that they all sound in tune with each other. How the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> each pipe is {{adjusted}} depends on the type and construction of that pipe.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two sets}} of tones (male and female) {{dividing}} the twelve-tone scale were generated by the [...] "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," [...] or sanfen sunyi, which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of {{a third of the}} length <b>of</b> the preceding <b>pitch</b> pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by Sima Qian in the Records of the Grand Historian (91 BCE) as <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> [...] "superior generation," [...] that is, the <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> [...] "inferior generation," [...] that is, the <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> Ling Lun’s female phoenix.|$|R
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> these notes.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all soprano and piccolo {{clarinets}} have keywork {{enabling them}} to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that sounds D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo clarinet), though some B clarinets go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A clarinet. On the B soprano clarinet, the concert <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E
50|$|A {{simultaneity}} succession is {{a series}} of different groups <b>of</b> <b>pitches</b> or <b>pitch</b> classes, each <b>of</b> which is played {{at the same time as}} the other <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> its group. Thus, a simultaneity succession is a succession of simultaneities.|$|R

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|Basing {{the plot}} {{partially}} {{on a story}} told to her by a stranger, Kim began {{an early version of}} 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope with the end of a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death.|$|E

5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|On {{the return}} to Australia, the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively. In a short tour, the four Tests were the only fixtures. Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, the first between the two countries. Moving to India, he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay, scoring runs all around the ground. Due to {{injuries}} and illness {{to many of the}} bowlers, the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice. In the final match, Australia were in trouble after taking a 41-run first innings lead. In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding, but made 69 out of 9/189 in the low-scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2–0 series win. He ended with 253 runs at 63.25 for the series. His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive footwork in moving down to meet the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the ball. After seven months away, the Australians returned home.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E

5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E
5|$|The males arrive {{first and}} remain in the {{location}} for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting {{for the right to}} mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.|$|E
5|$|The pitch has two ends, the Pavilion End and Media Centre End. The Media Centre End {{was renamed}} in 2011 to the Willie Rodriguez End {{in honour of}} the former Queen's Park and Trinidad and Tobago player. Natural turf {{was used in the}} early years however Mole crickets caused too much damage on the {{original}} pitch which was laid directly onto the natural soil, so soon after the ground was purchased a <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> clay was laid over a wicket made of coir matting. A 1932 study into cricket pitches ruled that clay pitches lacking in calcium carbonate were ideal for cricket play. However, the Queen's Park Oval clay surface was disproportionately suited to batting. A score of 681/8d in 1954, and double-centuries by Everton Weekes in consecutive series during that same year, prompted the laying of a turf wicket in 1955 in an attempt to balance batting and bowling. Five 20-metre-wide and 26-metre-long pitches were dug, each with a depth of one meter.|$|E
