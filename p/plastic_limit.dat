25|$|The {{liquidity}} index (LI) {{is used for}} scaling the natural water content of a soil sample to the limits. It can be calculated as a ratio of difference between natural water content, <b>plastic</b> <b>limit,</b> and liquid limit: LI=(W-PL)/(LL-PL) where W is the natural water content.|$|E

25|$|Atterberg limits : The Atterberg limits {{define the}} {{boundaries}} of several states of consistency for plastic soils. The boundaries are defined {{by the amount of}} water a soil needs to be at one of those boundaries.

The shrinkage limit is also a part of the Atterberg limits. The results of this test can be used to help predict other engineering properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} (A) of a soil is the PI {{divided by}} the percent of clay-sized particles (less than 2 μm) present. Different types of clays have different specific surface areas which controls how much wetting is required to move a soil from one phase to another such as across the liquid limit or the <b>plastic</b> <b>limit.</b> From the activity, one can predict the dominant clay type present in a soil sample. High activity signifies large volume change when wetted and large shrinkage when dried. Soils with high activity are very reactive chemically.|$|E
25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (friable) semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the shrinkage limit, is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's <b>plastic</b> <b>limit</b> will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this plastic state until its liquid limit is exceeded, which causes it to transform into a viscous liquid that flows when jarred.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{transitions}} from one state to another are gradual, the tests have adopted arbitrary definitions {{to determine the}} boundaries of the states. The liquid limit is determined by measuring [...] the water content for which a groove closes after 25 blows in a standard test. Alternatively, a fall cone test apparatus may be use to measure the liquid limit. The undrained shear strength of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa. The <b>Plastic</b> <b>Limit</b> is the water content below which {{it is not possible to}} roll by hand the soil into 3mm diameter cylinders. [...] The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the <b>plastic</b> <b>limit</b> is quite stiff, having an undrained shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>plastic</b> <b>limit</b> (PL) is {{determined}} by rolling out a thread of the fine portion of a soil on a flat, non-porous surface. The procedure is defined in ASTM Standard D4318.

As the moisture content falls due to evaporation, the thread will begin to break apart at larger diameters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plasticity}} index (PI) {{is a measure}} of the plasticity of a soil. [...] The {{plasticity index}} is the size of the range of water contents where the soil exhibits plastic properties. [...] The PI is the difference between the liquid limit and the <b>plastic</b> <b>limit</b> (PI = LL-PL). [...] Soils with a high PI tend to be clay, those with a lower PI tend to be silt, and those with a PI of 0 (non-plastic) tend to have little or no silt or clay.|$|E
2500|$|The Atterberg {{limits are}} a basic {{measure of the}} {{critical}} water contents of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, <b>plastic</b> <b>limit,</b> and liquid limit. As a dry, clayey soil takes on increasing amounts of water, it undergoes distinct changes in behavior and consistency. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid. In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on {{a change in the}} soil's behavior. The Atterberg limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. These limits were created by Albert Atterberg, a Swedish agriculturist. They were later refined by Arthur Casagrande. These distinctions in soil are used in assessing the soils that are to have structures built on. [...] Soils when wet retain water and some expand in volume. [...] The amount of expansion is related to the ability of the soil to take in water and its structural make-up (the type of atoms present). These tests are mainly used on clayey or silty soils since these are the soils that expand and shrink due to moisture content. [...] Clays and silts react with the water and thus change sizes and have varying shear strengths. Thus these tests are used widely in the preliminary stages of designing any structure to ensure that the soil will have the correct amount of shear strength and not too much change in volume as it expands and shrinks with different moisture contents.|$|E
