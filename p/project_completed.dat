Cedar Lane underwent a $3.9 million Streetscape <b>project,</b> <b>completed</b> in 2006, designed to attract additional business to the area through new sidewalk paving with brick edging, bump-outs to allow easier pedestrian crossing, old-fashioned lamp posts and street plantings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1961, the US27 freeway through Isabella County was {{completed}} and the divided highway was upgraded to full freeway status. With this <b>project</b> <b>completed,</b> the connector between the freeway and Mission Street south of Mount Pleasant and the former routing along Mission in town was rechristened Bus. US27. A new divided highway connector on {{the north end of}} town was built to complete the business route. In 2002, when US127 replaced US27 north of Lansing, the Mount Pleasant business loop was given its current moniker to match.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Manahawkin Bay Bridge was {{dedicated}} the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge {{in honor of}} Dorland J. Henderson, {{who was one of}} NJDOTâ€™s top engineers that designed the lighting system for the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs to the deck of the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This <b>project,</b> <b>completed</b> in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge is to undergo a rehabilitation project and a parallel bridge will be built to the south. Construction began on May 3, 2013 with completion expected in 2019.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} a freeway along the US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, {{which was to be}} maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure {{announced}} a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road {{will lead to}} a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel will pass under the Botanic Road intersection, then curve to the west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surface in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. It is still expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|E
5|$|Renovation {{started in}} November 2001. During this time, Coney Island Terminal {{was given a}} full, $310 million reconstruction, with one {{platform}} at a time for the West End W train remaining open during construction. The original BMT station building facade was restored, and a new roof with solar panels was installed, {{as part of this}} renovation. The new terminal opened on May 23, 2004, with the restoration of F and Q services, and the moving of W service to tracks 1 and 2. The <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> on May 29, 2005, with full restoration of N service, the replacement of the W route with the D route on the West End Line, and all eight tracks in service. The accelerated 42-month schedule, as well as the partial service from the West End Line throughout construction, was largely to minimize impact on the surrounding community.|$|E

5|$|The seven {{islands that}} came to {{constitute}} Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were {{under the control of}} successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation <b>project,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.|$|E
5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. In a hurry to see the 2,000-seat <b>project</b> <b>completed,</b> the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into a divided highway, which at the time was the best {{superhighway}} and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were constructed while others were widened into divided highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> during that time was the construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to divided highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into a divided highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing a divided highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E

5|$|Sir William Hillary {{moved to}} the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a {{national}} lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, {{with the help of}} Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock â€“ a <b>project</b> <b>completed</b> in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase <b>project,</b> <b>completed</b> {{during the second half of}} 2009, {{involved}} the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E
