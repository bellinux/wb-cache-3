40|$|Recently, {{printing}} {{technologies have}} been adapted for the manufacturing of flexible electronic {{devices such as}} RFID antennas, capacitors, rectifiers, organic thin film transistors, photovoltaics, etc. In contrast to traditional production of electronics, printing technologies can enable low cost, high throughput, and large-area processing on flexible polymer materials. Photolithographical processes can be substituted by direct printing, e. g. of metal nanoparticles NPs or organic inks on flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>foils.</b> After the deposition of the materials by printing, curing, drying and/or sintering is required to remove solvents and additives, {{and to develop a}} functional layer. The operating temperatures of these post-printing processes are usually higher than the tolerable temperature of the <b>polymer</b> <b>foils,</b> which results in plastic thermal deformations of the foils. Photonic sintering is considered as one of the promising technology, especially for R 2 R processing, to prevent t he thermal deformation of the substrate. It allows processing in ambient conditions without damaging the <b>polymer</b> <b>foils</b> due to energy exposure in microseconds-scale. In this paper, the effect of photonic sintering conditions on inkjet printed copper oxide CuO layers was investigated. We found that the conductivity is proportional to the exposure energy. However, excessive energy will lead to ''over-sintering'' and thus destroys the copper layer. Optimized photonic sintering parameters were proposed to obtain inkjet-printed copper layers with high conductivity and no layer ablation. © 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology...|$|R
