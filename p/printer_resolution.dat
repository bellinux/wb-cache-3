As of 2016, monitors typically have a resolution of between 102 and 125 pixels per inch. <b>Printers</b> generally have <b>resolutions</b> between 240 and 1440 pixels per inch; in some <b>printers</b> the horizontal <b>resolution</b> {{is different from the}} vertical.

50|$|Because {{of their}} fixed resolution, {{printing}} bitmap images can easily produce grainy, jaggy, or blurry results if the resolution is not {{ideally suited to}} the <b>printer</b> <b>resolution.</b> In addition, bitmap images become grainy when they are scaled larger than their intended resolution. A few bitmap file formats (such as Apple's PICT format) support alpha channels, which allow bitmap images to have transparent backgrounds or an image selection which uses antialiasing. Most common web-based file formats such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG are bitmap file formats. The GIF file format {{is one of the}} simplest, low-resolution bitmap file formats, only supporting 256 colors per image. As a result, however, GIF files can be extremely small in file size. Other common bitmap file formats are BMP (Windows bitmap), TGA, and TIFF. Most clip art is provided in a low resolution, bitmap file format which is unsuitable for scaling, transparent backgrounds, or good-quality printed materials. However, bitmap file formats are ideal for photos, especially when combined with lossy data compression algorithms such as those available for JPEG files.|$|E
40|$|Resolution is {{a measure}} of the ability of an imaging system to {{reproduce}} fine details, something an increasing number of digital printer users care passionately about. Despite this interest, resolution is not routinely measured or specified by printer manufacturers. Among the reasons is the absence of industry standard resolution metrics for digital printers. In this initial paper, the authors explore some of the reasons resolution metrics for digital printing systems are not well established or widely used. In particular, we examine the idea that <b>printer</b> <b>resolution</b> can be determined from input test patterns composed of arbitrary or continuously varying spatial frequencies. Methods based on this approach risk confounding information losses due to image sampling with printing limitations of the system under test. We propose an alternative metric based on test patterns that are matched to the addressability of the target printer. A procedure for measuring prints of these test patterns and determining resolution from those measurements is described. It is hoped that printer manufacturers and others with an interest in <b>printer</b> <b>resolution</b> will evaluate this proposed metric and contribute to its refinement and adoption as a standard for defining, measuring and reporting this important imaging characteristic of digital printing system...|$|E

AM techniques are used to print both permanent components and sacrificial molds for deposited resins and inserted parts. Design strategies and prac-tical techniques for developing these structures and molds are described, taking into account considerations such as <b>printer</b> <b>resolution,</b> build direction, and printed material strength. The strengths of interfaces between printed and deposited materials commonly used in the authors ’ implementation of the process are measured to characterize the robustness of the resulting parts. The process is compared to previously documented lay-ered manufacturing methodologies, and the authors present examples of systems pro-duced with the process, including robot fingers, a multimaterial airless tire, and an articulated camera probe. This effort works toward simplifying fabrication and assembly complexity over comparable techniques, leveraging the benefits of AM, and expanding the range of design options for robotic mechanisms.

The aim is to investigate the effect of building direction in Polyamide (PA) 3 D printed samples and to assess whether a crack can be initiated directly from the sintering process for fracture mechanics study purposes. Six different configurations of Mode I Compact Tension (CT) specimens were manufactured and tested; the experiments were monitored by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and fractured surfaces were analyzed using microscopy. Results showed that samples with better mechanical performance are those in which all the layers contain a portion of the crack. On the other hand, those with layers parallel to the crack plan offer a preferential pathway for the crack to propagate. DIC and fractography investigations showed that, under certain conditions, small-radius geometries, or too-close surfaces may glue depending on <b>printer</b> <b>resolution.</b> Experiments also showed that SLS is capable of printing specimens with internal cracks {{that can be used to}} study fracture mechanics of complex parts or parts with internal cracks...|$|E
40|$|Mask Projection micro-Stereolithography (MPμSL) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique {{capable of producing}} solid parts with micron-scale resolution from a vat of photocurable liquid polymer resin. Although the physical mechanism remains the same, the process differs from traditional laser-galvanometer based stereolithography (SL) in its use of a dynamic mask UV projector, or digital light processor (DLP), which cures each location within each 3 D layer at the same time. One area where MPµSL has garnered considerable attention is {{in the field of}} microfluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip, where complex multistep microfabrication techniques adopted from the semiconductor industry are still widely used, and where MPµSL offers the ability to fabricate completely encapsulated fluidic channels in a single step and at low cost [1 – 3]. However, a significant obstacle exists in the prevention of channel blockage due to overcuring of the polymer resin [4, 5]. Overcuring {{can be attributed to the}} so-called ‘back side effect’ [2] which occurs during the build process as light from successive layers penetrates into the resin to a depth greater than the layer thickness. This effect is most prevalent in channels or features oriented horizontally (in a parallel plane to that of the build platform). Currently there are two main approaches in controlling the cure depth; 1. the chemical approach, which involves doping the resin material with a chemical light absorber [6 – 8]; and 2. by improving the system 2 ̆ 7 s hardware and optical elements to improve the homogeneity of the light dosage and control the cure depth [9]. Here we investigate a third approach through modification of the 3 D CAD file prior to printing to mitigate for UV light leakage from successive build layers. Although used here in conjunction with the MPμSL technique, this approach can be applied to a range of SL techniques to improve <b>printer</b> <b>resolution</b> and enable production of internal features with higher dimensional accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years {{a wealth of}} linkage maps and {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) mapping results have become available. The pace of generating this genetic infor-mation is accelerating owing to advances in molecular marker technology {{and the development of}} software for linkage anal-ysis and QTL mapping. A graphical presentation of this infor-mation is often needed, both for publica-tion purposes and for easy and intuitive interpretation. However, the development of tools for the graphical presentation of linkage maps and QTLs has lagged behind. DrawMap (Van Ooijen 1994) was an early program capable of drawing genetic link-age maps. However, the output of this pro-gram was not very well suited for use in modern word processors and presenta-tion software. Authors in this field have therefore, of necessity, resorted to the use of general graphics software to compose charts of their linkage and QTL maps. This is always a laborious process, with some-times disappointing results. Also, each time a map is recalculated when new data become available, this process has to be repeated. For this reason I developed MapChart, a software package that takes as input the linkage and QTL data and gen-erates charts of linkage maps and QTLs. These charts can easily be exported to word processing or presentation software. The charts are exported as vector graph-ics (Windows enhanced metafiles) rather than bitmaps, which makes them easy to rescale and to edit further if desired. User Interface MapChart has a standard Windows inter-face, with a main menu, toolbar, and pop-up menus.

While numerical and experimental analyses of sedimentary-rock pore systems have {{advanced to the}} characterization of nanometer-scale features, correlation of data across multiple scales of investigation (e. g., between seismic data, core samples, thin-section images, and SEM images) is still challenging. The differences arise in petrophysical properties (e. g., permeability) calculated on the same pore network under varying experimental conditions (e. g., pressure, temperature). 3 D printing is a rapidly evolving technology that enables the manufacture of intricate 3 D pore-network models (defined in this research as proxies) that can be investigated experimentally and compared to numerical simulations repeatedly. The main objective of my Ph. D. research has been to improve {{our understanding of the}} accuracy of 3 D-printed pore networks in comparison to natural rocks. In addition, the researched aimed at: 1) the improvement of building and post-processing workflows for accurate geometric replication of pore networks by each 3 D printing technique; 2) the establishment and enhancement of validation workflows to test transport properties of rock proxies (e. g., porosity and permeability); and 3) the characterization of artifacts related to 3 D printing, post-processing, and validation methods for several common 3 D printing methods. While all 3 D printers build models layer-by-layer, the physical and chemical properties of build materials, the build process itself, and post-processing methods vary widely. My research results provide the extent to which major 3 D printing techniques (binder jet, polyjet, stereolithography, and fused depositional modelling) and associated materials (powders, polymers, resins, and plastics) can generate useful proxies of common porous sandstones (Idaho gray, Berea, and Fontainebleau) that can be tested in the laboratory as natural porous rocks.

In computer games, you can see the grit on your opponent’s racing car and enjoy an instant response to your every twitch of the steering wheel. Building such a display would be extremely difficult. A wall-sized display that supports human visual acuity during close-up viewing would require about 670 megapixels, with 190 dpi.

40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet <b>printers</b> and at <b>resolutions</b> between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet <b>printers</b> at <b>resolutions</b> between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic <b>printers</b> at <b>resolutions</b> between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|R

In addition to intrinsic features (intrinsic signatures) of the printer, modulating the printing process to embed specific features (extrinsic signatures) will further extend the encoding capacity and decoding accuracy. One {{of the key}} issues with embedding extrinsic signatures is that the embedding should not degrade the image quality, but needs to be detectable by a detection algorithm. In this dissertation, we will demonstrate the feasibility of embedding code sequences in EP halftone images by modulating dot size through laser intensity modulation. We have developed corresponding embedding and detection algorithms to embed and extract information. Experimental results indicate that using a 600 dpi native <b>resolution</b> <b>printer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s default halftone algorithm, we can encode 5 bits of information in every 310 printer scan-lines or approximately every 0. 5 inches. ^ We also develop a printing-scaning model incorporating {{the impact of the}} process modulation parameter, e. g. laser intensity, with a stochastic dot interaction model and scanner modulation transfer function (MTF) to estimate the impact of the modulation on a known halftone pattern. This model can be used to examine the embedding and detection algorithm without extensive measurements. Experimental data validates the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the impact of laser intensity modulation on the reflectance of the printout. ^ To ensure the extrinsic signature is detectable, the modulation amplitude can not be too low. To find the minimum modulation amplitude with required detection performance, significant amount of printing and measurements are needed. To reduce the required time and effort, a fast search based on a computational model is developed based on the proposed printing-scanning model. With the proposed fast search method, experimental data indicates that more than 90...|$|R
