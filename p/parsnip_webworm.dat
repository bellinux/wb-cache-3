50|$|The parsnip moth or <b>parsnip</b> <b>webworm</b> (Depressaria radiella) is a moth of the Depressariidae family. It {{is found}} in most of Europe, except Portugal {{and most of the}} Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} weeds to proliferate into nonindigenous {{habitats}} has {{been attributed to}} escape from their native natural enemies, allowing reallocation of resources from chemical defense into growth and reproduction. Many invasive weeds, however, eventually encounter their native, coevolved enemies in areas of introduction. Examination of herbarium specimens of an invasive phototoxic European weed, Pastinaca sativa, through 152 years reveals phytochemical shifts coincident in time with the accidental introduction of a major herbivore, the <b>parsnip</b> <b>webworm,</b> Depressaria pastinacella. Plants collected before the introduction of webworms in North America and during the earliest stages of establishment (1850 – 1889) are lower in toxic furanocoumarins than all plants subsequently collected in North America and lower than European plant samples collected before 1889. Thus, introduction of a major specialist herbivore can increase noxiousness of a species in its area of introduction, illuminating a potential consequence of classical biocontrol programs involving insect herbivores and poisonous weeds...|$|E
40|$|In nature some organisms may {{facilitate}} others by creating shelter or other niches {{that they use}} for variable periods. We describe a natural tnultitrophic-species complex in the Netherlands involving a plant, the common hogweed (Heracteum sphondylium) a specialist chewing herbivore, the <b>parsnip</b> <b>webworm</b> (Depressaria pastinacella) and various arthropods associated with them. Larvae of D. pastinacella feed on H [...] sphondylium seeds and, after they have finished feeding, chew holes in the hollow stems where they pupate. In {{some areas of the}} country almost 50 % of plants are attacked by webworms. The holes are used by other arthropods {{to gain access to the}} stems including herbivores, omnivores, predators and decomposers. The duration of plant occupancy varies between 3 and 4 months, until the plants die. Plants without moth-produced holes were always free of other arthropods, whereas plants with holes, in addition to pupae (and/or mummified-parasitized webworm larvae), often contained many woodlice, earwigs and/or spiders. Earwigs and woodlice perform important ecological functions as predators (in orchards) and decomposers respectively. Our results show that the simple biological activity of one herbivore species can have at least short-term effects on the local arthropod community...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between Depressaria pastinacella (<b>parsnip</b> <b>webworm)</b> and wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), in its native Europe {{and in its}} longstanding nonindigenous range in the midwestern United States, is characterized by chemical phenotype matching, ostensibly mediated by reciprocal selective responses. The first appearance of D. pastinacella on P. sativa in New Zealand in 2004 provided an opportunity to quantify selective impacts of a coevolved herbivore and calibrate rates of phytochemical response in its host plant. Webworms in 2006 reduced seed production up to 75 % in New Zealand populations, and in 2007 infestations increased in severity in all populations except one. Most New Zealand populations fall into a furanocoumarin phenotype cluster distinct from European and U. S. phenotypes, although one heavily attacked population clusters with two U. S. populations and one European population long associated with webworms. Multivariate selection analysis substituting realized fitness (with webworms present) for potential fitness (absent webworms) {{as the dependent variable}} revealed that reassociation with a coevolved specialist in a nonindigenous area profoundly altered the selection regime, favoring trait remixing and rapid chemical changes in parsnip populations, as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory. That uninfested populations of New Zealand parsnips contain higher amounts of octyl acetate, a floral volatile used by webworms for orientation, suggests that plants that escape from specialized enemies may also experience selection to increase kairomones, as well as to reduce allomones...|$|E
40|$|Two {{potential}} {{outcomes of}} a coevolutionary interaction are an escalating arms race and stable cycling. The general expectation {{has been that}} arms races predominate in cases of polygenic inheritance of resistance traits and permanent cycling predominates in cases in which resistance is controlled by major genes. In the interaction between Depressaria pastinacella, the <b>parsnip</b> <b>webworm,</b> and Pastinaca sativa, the wild parsnip, traits for plant resistance to insect herbivory (production of defensive furanocoumarins) as well as traits for herbivore “virulence” (ability to metabolize furanocoumarins) are characterized by continuous heritable variation. Furanocoumarin production in plants and rates of metabolism in insects were compared among four midwestern populations; these traits then were classified into four clusters describing multitrait phenotypes occurring in {{all or most of}} the populations. When the frequency of plant phenotypes belonging to each of the clusters is compared with the frequency of the insect phenotypes in each of the clusters across populations, a remarkable degree of frequency matching is revealed in three of the populations. That frequencies of phenotypes vary among populations is consistent with the fact that spatial variation occurs in the temporal cycling of phenotypes; such processes contribute in generating a geographic mosaic in this coevolutionary interaction on the landscape scale. Comparisons of contemporary plant phenotype distributions with phenotypes of herbarium specimens collected 9 – 125 years ago from across a similar latitudinal gradient, however, suggest that for at least one resistance trait—sphondin concentration—interactions with webworms have led to escalatory change...|$|E

In der Natur können manche Organismen andere begünstigen, indem sie Refugien oder andere Nischen erschaffen, die sie für unterschiedliche Zeiträume nutzen. Wir beschreiben einen natürlichen multitrophischen Artenkomplex in den Niederlanden, der den Wiesen-Bärenklau (Heracleum sphondylium), die Pastinakmotte (Depressaria pastinacella) und verschiedene mit ihnen assoziierte Arthropoden umfasst. Die Larven der Pastinakmotte fressen an Bärenklausamen und beißen später Löcher in die hohlen Stengel, um sich darin zu verpuppen. Die Löcher werden von anderen Arthropoden genutzt, um Zugang ins Stengelinnere zu erhalten. Die Pflanze wird für etwa drei bis vier Monate besiedelt bis sie abstirbt. Pflanzen ohne Mottenlöcher wurden niemals von anderen Arthropoden besiedelt, während Stengel mit Löchern zusätzlich zu den Mottenpuppen bzw. parasitierten Larvenmumien häufig viele Asseln, Ohrwürmer und/oder Spinnen enthielten. Ohrwürmer und Asseln erfüllen wichtige ökologische Funktionen als Räuber in Obstplantagen bzw. als Zersetzer. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die einfache biologische Aktivität einer Herbivorenart zumindest kurzfristige Auswirkungen auf die lokale Arthropodengemeinschaft haben kann. </p...|$|E
