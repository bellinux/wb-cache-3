50|$|For {{women with}} extreme pain, a <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> {{may be very}} rarely {{performed}} where the nerves to the uterus are cut. However, this technique is almost never used due to {{the high incidence of}} associated complications including presacral hematoma and irreversible problems with urination and constipation.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> is {{typically}} conducted to decrease severe pain and menstrual cramps {{in the lower}} abdomen. Pain in this region is difficult to treat with noninvasive treatments. Endometriosis {{is the most common}} cause for this severe pain. One solution that doctors often mistakenly recommend as a cure is a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus. However, this often does not relieve endometriosis pain because the disease is left behind on other organs such as the bladder, bowels, or pelvic side walls, and it can thrive on its own hormone supply. Another is to perform a <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy.</b> This is a procedure that interrupts the nerves going towards and/or around the uterus. [...] Pain located {{on either side of the}} lower abdomen (but not mid line) should not be treated with a neurectomy. Only individuals with pain that is not relieved by the use of NSAIDs should consider this procedure. Techniques have been developed for this procedure to be performed laparoscopically.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-one laparoscopic presacral neurectomies were {{performed}} in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung Center over a 1 -year period {{for patients with}} primary dysmenorrhea who {{failed to respond to}} medical management. Eighty-three percent (50) had complete relief of pain, 10 % (6) had significant relief, 3. 5 % (2) had moderate relief, and 3. 5 % (2) had no relief from their dysmenorrhea at their first menstruation after the procedure. One vascular complication requiring laparotomy occurred. Average total operation time was 24 minutes, and the average hospital stay was 2 days. Six months follow-up was done in 35 patients with complete symptom relief, and all reported continued relief of menstrual pain. The efficacy of laparoscopic <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> for the pain relief of primary dysmenorrhea is justified in this report.

30|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of CPP is usually by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Treatment for CPP {{depends on the}} underlying cause. In some patients, a cause cannot be identified, so conservative treatments will be tried. If these medical treatments fail, conservative surgical treatment options which include vaginal uterosacral ligament resection, uterine nerve ablation, and <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> may be beneficial [1 – 4].|$|E

30|$|When she was {{reviewed}} a year later, her menorrhagia was subjectively cured, {{and she was}} satisfied with the procedure. She was no longer anaemic or taking iron supplementation. Her haemoglobin was 11.7  g/dl with a mean cell volume of 83.9  fl. However, the procedure had done nothing for her dysmenorrhoea, which persisted and required multiple analgaesics. Further treatment options were discussed, and she subsequently had a laparoscopic <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> that finally relieved her dysmenorrhoea. No adhesions were identified at this laparoscopy, and her peritoneum had healed as normal.|$|E
30|$|A laparoscopic <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> was not {{performed}} simultaneously at {{the time}} of the first procedure. It was thought that impairing the uterine perfusion could have had a beneficial effect on prostaglandin production. Likewise, some women experience uterine cramping as they pass clots, and it was postulated that if the procedure resulted in less bleeding it could have reduced the production of clots. Wang et al. [9] showed a positive effect on dysmenorrhoea, with 75 % of their patients achieving “control” of it and 37.5 % being free of analgaesia.|$|E
40|$|Background: The chronic {{pelvic pain}} as non-cyclical pain is {{serious enough to}} cause {{disability}} or lead to medical care. While these treatments are very successful {{there is still a}} 20 to 25 % failure rate and surgery has been an option for such cases. Effectiveness of laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) and <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> (PSN) can be useful for alleviating chronic pelvic pain. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrheal in the chonic pelvic pain.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ectopic endometrial {{tissue is}} found in 1. 5 % to 6. 2 % of women of {{reproductive}} age, in up to 60 % of those with dysmenorrhoea, and in up to 30 % of women with subfertility, with a peak incidence at around 40 years of age. However, symptoms may not correlate with laparoscopic findings. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed {{to answer the following}} clinical questions: What are the effects of hormonal treatments given at diagnosis of endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatments before surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of non-hormonal medical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of surgical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after conservative surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) for endometriosis? What are the effects of treatments for ovarian endometrioma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 40 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: combined oral contraceptives, danazol, dydrogesterone, gestrinone, gonadorelin analogues, aromatase inhibitors, hormonal treatment before surgery, hormonal treatment, laparoscopic cystectomy, laparoscopic removal of endometriotic deposits (alone or with uterine nerve ablation), laparoscopic removal plus <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy,</b> laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> alone, and progestogens other than dydrogesterone...|$|E
40|$|Endometriosis, i. e. extragonadal {{localization}} of endometrial stroma and glands {{is predominantly}} found inreproductive age women, {{however it is}} also diagnosed in teenagers and postmenopausal women. Prevalenceof postmenopausal endometriosis is 2 - 5 % of all endometriosis cases, with majority found in patients usingestrogen replacement therapy (ERT). Etiopathogenesis of endometriosis after menopause is related toextragonadal aromatase activity (androstendione to estradiol conversion). The aim of endometriosis therapyis to relief pain. This effect can be achieved either through pharmacological or surgical treatment. Majorityof endometriosis medications relies on reduction of estradiol production. Combined hormonal contraceptivedrugs (oral, transdermal, transvaginal) and gestagens constitute first-line pharmacological therapy. Second-lineconsists of GnRH analogs, intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel, danazol, and gestrinone. Progressivelymore and more experimental treatments are applied in postmenopausal endometriosis, just to name aromataseinhibitors suppressing local estrogen production. Surgical therapy may be also considered as first-line approach. Depending {{on the history of}} illness, pain intensity, and patient expectations surgery can cover wide spectrumfrom local excision of endometriosis through interruption of neural pathways (<b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy)</b> finishingwith total hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingoophoorectomy...|$|E
40|$|Study Objective. To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} effectiveness of <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> (PSN) {{in women with}} severe dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis treated with conservative laparoscopic surgical intervention. Design. Randomized, controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting. University-affiliated department of obstetrics and gynecology. Patients. One hundred forty-one sexually active women of reproductive age. Intervention. Conservative laparoscopic surgery without (group A) or with (group B) PSN. Measurements and Main Results. At entry and 24 -months after surgical procedures, cure rates; frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain; {{and quality of life}} were evaluated. At follow-up visit, the cure rate was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in group B (83. 3 %) than in group A (53. 3 %). The frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in both groups compared with baseline values, and only severity was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in group B. A significant (P< 0. 05) improvement in quality of life was observed after surgery in both groups and was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased in group B compared with group A. Conclusion. PSN improves long-term cure rates and quality of life in women treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery for severe dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{pelvic pain}} (CPP) {{is a common}} {{condition}} in women and rates of consultation for CPP in general practice {{are similar to those}} for asthma and migraine. US and UK population-based studies, together with data from UK hospital settings demonstrate a substantial impact of CPP on health-related quality of life. In this review, we will examine the current evidence on the aetiology and management of CPP, focussing on the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that are available to date. CPP is a heterogeneous condition and causation is often unclear. There are associations with specific pathological processes but a barrier to understanding is that many studies have data that are not comparable. In the community setting, as many as 60 % of women with CPP have not received a specific diagnosis and up to 20 % have not undergone any investigation. The factor most commonly associated with CPP in the community is irritable bowel syndrome, although in a tertiary setting with laparoscopy, pathology associated with CPP in ascending order of frequency is endometriosis (33 %), adhesions (24 %) and 'no pathology' (35 %). Current RCT evidence provides some support for the use of ultrasound scanning as an aid to counselling and reassurance, progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate) or goserelin for pelvic congestion and a multidisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment. Adhesiolysis is not shown to be of benefit other than in women with extensive adhesions. While studied in relation to dysmenorrhoea rather than CPP, the short term results for <b>presacral</b> <b>neurectomy</b> (PSN) and laparoscopic utero-sacral nerve ablation (LUNA) seem to be similar, although PSN has better results in the long term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants have not been shown to be of benefit in CPP. Most of these conclusions are based on the outcome of single randomised trials and therefore need replication...|$|E
