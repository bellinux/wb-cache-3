50|$|Following the {{standardization}} {{most of the}} European industry switched over to use Euro-pallets with trucks, forklifts and high-rack warehouses {{optimized for}} their size. National associations developed framework agreements for pallet exchange in that freight would be delivered on Euro-pallets and be given {{the same number of}} Euro-pallets in return ("pallet for pallet"). The Euro-pallets are controlled by the association and the association takes care of repairing or removing old pallets from the pool. With the ongoing European integration, the European <b>Pallet</b> <b>Pool</b> allowed for pallet exchange even in cross-border dealings.|$|E

40|$|Pallet pooling is a {{basis for}} the {{operation}} of a city joint distribution system. Pallet allocation is a key problem for the success of a <b>pallet</b> <b>pool.</b> This article considers a multi-station, multi-period, and multi-type pallet allocation problem over a <b>pallet</b> <b>pool</b> in a city joint distribution system. First of all, we develop a deterministic model to optimally allocate pallets when managers have perfect knowledge of the information that will be available. By case studies, we show that this model can help managers to make scientific decisions. The influence of transportation capacity on decisions is shown by numerical simulation. And we propose managers should use both demand forecasting and leasing and renting tactics to minimization allocation cost. Then, we propose a multi-scenario model to optimally allocate pallets when some uncertain parameters cannot be estimated through historical data. The application of this multi-scenario model is also illustrated...|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Brambles {{streamlined}} {{its operations}} {{to focus on}} its <b>pallet</b> <b>pooling</b> business, CHEP and its record management business, Recall. To this end, the company’s Australian waste management business, Cleanaway Australia and its Brambles Industrial Services business were sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for about A$1.2 billion. Then the Company sold Cleanaway UK to Veolia of France in a £651 million deal. Subsequently, Following these divestments, Brambles unified its Australian and British-listed entities into a single entity, Brambles Limited, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.|$|R
50|$|Brambles traces {{its history}} to 1875, when Walter Bramble {{established}} a butchery business in Newcastle, {{the operations of}} which he gradually expanded into transport and logistics. Brambles first listed in Australia in 1954, as W E Bramble & Sons Limited and entered the <b>pallet</b> <b>pooling</b> business in 1958 through {{the purchase of the}} Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool (CHEP), from the Australian Government. This same year the company changed its name to Brambles Industries Limited and moved its head office from Newcastle to Sydney. In the years that followed, Brambles entered a number of new sectors including the waste management sector in 1970, through its Cleanaway business and the record management sector in 1979 through its Recall business.|$|R
40|$|Pallet management, which {{involves}} direct and reverse logistic models, {{is one of}} the most critical activity in supply chain management. Pallets are needed in order to ship products from the producers/distributors to the retailers. Performances of pallet management could be improved by an advance tracking system based on Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). RFID systems could increase effectiveness in acquiring data about properties of any entity - such as each pallet - that can be physically easily tagged. In this paper, authors propose an effective model of activity-based costing (ABC) for evaluating RFID investments in pallet management. The purpose is to investigate how different organizational procedures in pallet management could affect total logistic costs aiming to evaluate information technology investment. Therefore, the ABC model proposed has been applied according to different operational scenarios - such as direct management, outsourcing and <b>pallet</b> <b>pooling.</b> Results obtained highlight how an RFID application is economically sustainable to reduce the overall cost of pallet management activities...|$|R

40|$|Pallets, {{the most}} common unit-load platform, allow the {{transportation}} of goods in an efficient and reliable way. Every year, 700 million new pallets are manufactured and {{become part of the}} approximately 2 billion pallets that are in circulation in the U. S. The total life-cycle environmental impact of pallets depends on materials, manufacturing, handling processes, and the disposal practice (end-of-life). Plastic pallets can be lighter and might last longer but their manufacturing processes are energy intensive and could contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, wooden pallets can be cheaper and easily repaired but present a shorter life. The ability to control the end-of-life of the pallets and the associated environmental impacts of each scenario allows <b>pallet</b> <b>pooling</b> service companies to provide logistics arrangements that are attractive to those companies seeking to better manage their carbon footprint. The appropriate choice of pallet type (i. e. material, durability, etc.) and management structure (e. g. cost, lease vs. buy, etc.) may lead to a more sustainable logistics operation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a model that would determine the impact of pallet materials, manufacturing, distribution, and take back operations on an environmental performance metric (such as carbon dioxide emissions) as well as cost. Mixed integer programming (a minimum cost multi-commodity network flow problem) is used to design the system that determines the mix of pallets (type, quantity, and pallet management system) for product distribution that balances overall environmental impacts and costs according to companies 2 ̆ 7 needs. Such a tool would aid in decision making at the logistics and distribution levels. Results from a case study of a large grocery distributor/retailer in the Northeast is presented...|$|R
40|$|A rather {{new area}} {{identified}} by managers {{as a potential}} for increasing returns has received great attention. Industry analysts predicts that approximately 450 million EPAL Euro pallets are in constant circulation in the world. Traditionally, pallets have been disregarded and perceived {{as a source of}} cost with the single mean to transport products to customers. Lately, actors in supply chains have started to perceive pallets in a total cost approach and, hence, as significant for the overall result of the supply chain. In parallel with an increased attention of the pallets importance on the supply chain performance, a shift towards an increased utilization of <b>pallet</b> <b>pooling</b> systems has been indicated. This is related to the constant increase in raw material prices as well as costs associated with repair, maintenance and recovery of pallets. This study aims to answer two issues. The first issue relates to investigating the pallet logistics process at SCA’s paper mill in Lilla Edet, which includes the mapping of flows to the Danish and Norwegian markets as well as reviewing the design of the pallet warehouse. The second issue concerns evaluating the current inspection control process related to inbound deliveries of pallets. Established standards and routines will be reviewed in order to clarify whether these are complied with. A case study approach has been selected as a method in order to fulfil the aim of this thesis. Since a mixed methods approach is considered useful, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected. Interviews, observations and access to internal documents are the major sources of information. Further, the empirical findings were analysed based on the theoretical framework in order to provide solutions that addressed the stated issues. Improvement suggestions can be grouped in two major measures that should be considered. Firstly, three errors associated with defective pallets are correlated with the temperature. Consequently, during winter months’ pallets should be stored in the pallet warehouse in order to avoid rising defect levels. Secondly, a redesign of the current pallet warehouse should be performed since the current design is not optimal from wooden pallet’s perspective. Further, {{it should be noted that}} an increased information sharing between pallet suppliers and the SCA Edet mill is a huge facilitator for improving the studied issues...|$|R

40|$|A {{certain amount}} of {{construction}} waste comes from disposable packaging and this waste is ecologically damaging, one solution would be to reduce the disposable by using returnable packaging for non-specific construction products. To find out if this solution is feasible a study {{has been carried out}} on the economical and ecological consequences. A housing construction project was chosen to get insight into the sizes of the construction products and in the amount of packaging used in the construction products. Based on these results a transportation system has been developed. First an inventory was made of all the functions needed in the transportation system. For every function a solution is developed, and for the functions together, a principle design was chosen. This study led us to design a synthetic crate with the floor dimensions of 400 by 600 and 400 mm height, and a lid which {{can be used as a}} small pallet. The crates are transported to the building site on EURO-pallets and are manually handled into the building by a specially designed handcart. The handcart has the functions of a palletcart, wheel barrow and sack car. To manage these crates,lids and <b>pallets</b> a <b>pool</b> system was also designed. The principle of this system is that the pool organisation buys the crates and lends them to the packers with a deposit. The packer pay a fee to the pool organisation to can fill a crate. The transportation firm gets paid from the pool organisation for bringing back the empty crates to the packers. Based on this systern, calculations are made on what the fee should be. The use of the crate is economically and ecologically more interesting for construction products which use a high proportion of disposable packaging. What important is in introducing a returnable crate is an efficient pool organisation. The packers must be the owners of tbe pool organisation. The returnable crate is not only interesting for the environment, but it also has advantages for tbe working circumstances and the logistics between the producers and users of building materials...|$|R
