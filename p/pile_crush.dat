40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} study conducted on floating granular piles constructed in soft black cotton soil. The soil beds were prepared in a model tank of diameter 173 mm and height 605 mm. The granular pile of diameter 55 mm was constructed at the centre of soil bed using crushed stone chips as the pile material. The load test {{was conducted on the}} granular pile. The length to diameter ratio (L/d ratio) of the pile was varied, from 1 to 11 with an interval of two, and the effect of pile length on load carrying capacity was studied. Further, to observe the effect of encasement of pile material, it was wrapped by geogrid and the load test was conducted. The test results show that the ultimate load carrying capacity, Qult of the granular pile increases as L/d ratio increases in both the cases i. e. without and with geogrid encasement. The increasing trend of Qult with L/d is observed continuing for the maximum L/d ratio i. e. 11, for the granular pile tested in the study. No well-defined critical length of granular pile is observed in the present investigation of floating granular piles in soft black cotton soil.

As she descended the staircase of her beautiful London house, one Monday morning, late in April, between flower- stands filled with lovely ferns and graceful statues, she had still the same eager girlish look. It was true that her little cap was of the most costly lace, her hair manipulated by skilful hands, and her thin black summer dress was of material and make such as a scientific eye alone could have valued in their simplicity. But dignity still was wanting. Silks and brocades that would stand alone, and velvets richly <b>piled</b> only <b>crushed</b> and suffocated the little light swift figure, and the crisp curly hair was so much too wilful for the maid, {{that she had been}} even told that madame's style would be to cut it short, and wear it a l'ingenue, which she viewed as insulting; and altogether her general air was precisely what it had been when her dress cost a twentieth part of what it did at present.|$|R
50|$|Many {{aggregate}} {{products of}} various types are often recycled for other industrial purposes. In Bay City, Michigan, for example, a recycle program exists for contractors and their own unused products. These piles are composed of unused mixed concrete, block, brick, gravel, pea stone, and other used materials. Composed of several alternating piles that grow to hundreds of feet in height and diameter. These <b>piles</b> are then <b>crushed</b> to provide subbase for roads and driveways, among other purposes. This program has huge economic and environmental benefits to the local and surrounding area. Contractors save on disposal costs and less aggregate is buried or piled and abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|Most thermal {{stations}} use coal as {{the main}} fuel. Raw coal is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about [...] size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage <b>pile.</b> Normally, the <b>crushed</b> coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.|$|R
40|$|Heap {{leaching}} in {{the mining}} industry {{had become a}} fairly sophisticated practice at least 500 years ago. It {{is defined as a}} mineral processing technology whereby large <b>piles</b> of <b>crushed</b> Run-of–Mine (ROM) rock are leached with various chemical solutions to extract the valuable minerals. The main goal of this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} behavior of a heap leach pad by using coupled Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical (HMC) simulations and optimize its design by improving the pad stability and the ore recovery efficiency. The methodology of the work has been the following. First, an exhaustive review of the state of the art of heap leach pad construction is included, describing the coupled equations of the involved physical and chemical phenomena. Then, the implementation of numerical methods to solve the complete system of equations is described. The commercial Finite Element (FE) code COMSOL Multiphysics has been used as a numerical tool. Afterwards, several benchmark examples involving the different physics are solved to check the proper implementation of these numerical tools. Finally, a simulation of a general heap leach pad with a complete system of equations is performed. The numerical tool used in this work is able to solve simultaneously unsaturated flow, soil mechanics and reactive transport in porous media. The changes in porosity, permeability due to mineral dissolution/precipitation and irrigation time affect significantly the hydromechanical behavior of the heap leach pad. The stability of the pad and the ore recovery efficiency improves because the variable saturation and the mechanical deformation are considered during the construction and operation process...|$|R
40|$|The {{excavated}} building pit is a {{frequently used}} building technique during {{the construction of}} structures below ground level. A temporary structure of sheet piles and underwater concrete is designed to retain soil and water. Ribbed tension piles are driven to compensate the hydrostatic pressure after de-watering of the construction pit. Generally, {{the top of the}} foundation <b>piles</b> are <b>crushed</b> before concreting the structural. The uncovered pile reinforcement is combined with the slab reinforcement which results in a monolithic floor with an optimal connection between slab and pile. During some construction projects it is desirable to avoid <b>pile</b> head <b>crushing</b> for economic reasons or to prevent the stray current phenomena. The question that arises is to what extend does the partly penetrated ribbed foundation pile influence the punching shear behaviour of the structural slab when the pile is loaded in compression during the exploitation phase. At the heart of this debate lies the problem of the effectiveness of the present ribs and the associated punching cone perimeter. In order to investigate the punching shear behaviour, simulations by nonlinear finite element analyses have been performed using the software ATENA developed by Cervenka Consulting. Initially, conducted experiments were simulated in order to validate the modelling technique. The contact area is modelled with interface material, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for shear planes. The FEM analyses showed good agreement with the conducted experiments regarding to crack propagation which induces punching shear. The case study is made up of a number of subsequent modelling steps to investigate each influence separately. The case study starts with a parameter study to investigate the influence of the shear transfer capacity from slab to pile on the punching behaviour. The maximum allowable shear stress depends of a cohesion parameter and a coefficient of friction parameter. Various combinations of both parameters are investigated with respect to the punching shear behaviour. A clear distinction in failure behaviour is observed between a friction coefficient of 1. 0 and 1. 4. Up to a friction coefficient of 1. 0, the critical shear crack propagates from pile head towards the slab surface which indicates that only the top part of the slab is responsible for punching shear resistance. From a friction coefficient of 1. 4 the critical shear crack propagates from slab bottom towards slab surface, which indicates that the full slab height is active in punching resistance. This change in punching cone size results in a failure load which is more than twice as high. No significant increase of failure load is observed during analyses with different cohesion values. The second step consists of adding reinforcement to the initial model. The influence of bending reinforcement was neglectable due to the limited slab deflections. However, the influence of shear reinforcement was significant. For friction coefficients from 0. 0 to 1. 0, the failure load increased with a magnitude of roughly four compared to the failure load without shear reinforcement. An increase of roughly two is observed for friction coefficients of 1. 4 or greater. Also a change in failure behaviour is observed. For friction coefficients of 1. 0 or greater, the brittle punching behaviour changes into ductile flexural behaviour. This is highly desirable because large structural deflections insinuates an upcoming failure. Although full scale laboratory tests are needed to verify the numerical results, the recommendation for practical use is that for structural slabs provided with shear reinforcement and a foundation pile with at least two ribbed sides, a fully punching cone develops.

60|$|Both royalty and {{religion}} {{have been accused}} of despising humanity, and in practice it has been too often true; but after all both the conception of the prophet and that of the king were formed by paying humanity the supreme compliment of selecting from it almost at random. This daring idea that a healthy human being, when thrilled by all the trumpets of a great trust, would rise to the situation, has often been tested, but never with such complete success {{as in the case of}} our dead Queen. On her was <b>piled</b> the <b>crushing</b> load of a vast and mystical tradition, and she stood up straight under it. Heralds proclaimed her as the anointed of God, and it did not seem presumptuous. Brave men died in thousands shouting her name, and it did not seem unnatural. No mere intellect, no mere worldly success could, in this age of bold inquiry, have sustained that tremendous claim; long ago we should have stricken Cæsar and dethroned Napoleon. But these glories and these sacrifices did not seem too much to celebrate a hardworking human nature; they were possible because at the heart of our Empire was nothing but a defiant humility. If the Queen had stood for any novel or fantastic imperial claims, the whole would have seemed a nightmare; the whole was successful because she stood, and no one could deny that she stood, for the humblest, the shortest and the most indestructible of human gospels, that when all troubles and troublemongers have had their say, our work can be done till sunset, our life can be lived till death.|$|R

40|$|Usually, {{phosphate}} deposits contain 238 U and 232 Th {{in addition}} to their decay products. Due to their different pathways in the environment, the 238 U/ 232 Th activity concentration ratio usually found to be greater than unity in phosphate sediments. The presence of these radionuclides creates a potential need to control exposure of workers in the mining and processing activities of the phosphate minerals in accordance with IAEA safety standards. The greatest dose to workers comes from exposure to radon, especially 222 Rn from the uranium series, and has to be controlled. In this regard, radon (222 Rn) was measured in the atmosphere (indoor and outdoor) of Al-Jalamid phosphate-mines working area using a portable radon-measurement instrument RAD 7, in a purpose of radiation protection. Radon was measured in 61 sites inside the open phosphate mines, the phosphate upgrading facility (offices and rooms of the workers, and in some open-air sites) and in the dwellings of the workers residence-village that lies at about 3 km from the mines working area. The obtained results indicated that the average indoor radon concentration was about 48. 4 Bq/m 3. Inside the upgrading facility, the average outdoor concentrations were 10. 8 and 9. 7 Bq/m 3 in the concentrate <b>piles</b> and <b>crushing</b> areas, respectively. It was 12. 3 Bq/m 3 in the atmosphere of the open mines. These values are comparable with the global average values. Based on the average values, the annual effective dose due to radon inhalation was calculated and risk estimates have been done. The average annual effective dose to workers due to the radon inhalation was estimated by 1. 32 mSv. The potential excess risk of lung cancer mortality that could be attributed to radon, when considering the lifetime exposure, was estimated by 53. 0 x 10 - 4.
