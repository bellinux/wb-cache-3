5|$|A new, <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote}} more time to cricket. Constantine {{realised}} that to succeed as a professional cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E

25|$|Özgecan {{was born}} into a poor Alevi family, who traced their origins to Dersim. She was a first-year {{psychology}} student in the Çağ University in Tarsus. She {{was born and raised in}} Mersin, and wanted to study psychology, for which she had developed a strong passion while she was studying at the tourism high school. Her parents were supportive of her, with her mother returning to the workforce in order to fund her education, to augment the 50% scholarship she had earned. Her father is a graphic designer, but he lacked a <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> at the time of the murder, while her mother had previously retired from a cargo company. She was also planning to work at a hotel in Northern Cyprus during the summer to help with her fees. She had an elder sister who was studying opera and singing in Adana; Özgecan was also described as an avid opera listener and reader.|$|E

He then enrolled at Tel Aviv University and entered a pre-academic course, completing his matriculation. During this period, he worked in a variety of places, including in a bakery and retirement home. He entered university and studied physics. After failing two exams {{at the end of his}} first year and realizing that the full-time work he needed to pay for his education interfered with his studies, Vanunu dropped out and returned to his parents' home in Beersheba, and worked in a series of odd jobs. He applied for a job with Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, but was rejected for reasons of incompatibility.|$|E

40|$|The {{share of}} {{flexible}} jobs on the Dutch labour market {{is among the}} highest in Western countries, in particular for recent graduates. In this study we examine why recent graduates enter into temporary contracts and whether flexible jobs match their qualifications worse than <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs</b> do. Graduates that enter into flexible jobs face large wage penalties, a worse job match and less training participation than those entering into <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs,</b> even after correcting for ability differences. When the labour market situation for a particular field of education deteriorates, a larger share of recent graduates is forced into flexible jobs, which may threaten their position on the labour market in the long run. Flexible work among graduates is unrelated to their willingness to take risks. Only for university graduates are there any indications that flexible jobs may provide stepping stones to <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs.</b> Keywords: labour economics...|$|R
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, the family {{moved back to the}} United States, after William and Kate fell ill. The family spent the summer of that year in New Hampshire on a farm with Kate’s sister before they {{relocated}} to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1908, the family moved to Farson, Wyoming where they settled for the next five years, living in a small three-room house. During the five years in Farson, Rambo and the family planted crops and raised chickens for food, often struggling to produce enough for all members of the household. When Rambo was sixteen, he began working as a water boy to earn money for the family. He soon got a more <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> driving a Fresno scraper, a metal basket that dumped dirt into an irrigation ditch, but was subsequently fired after he joined a group of workers protesting the wage. He then worked as an orderly in the local hospital and caught the attention of the resident doctor, who began to teach him common procedures such as catheterization. After the doctor left the hospital, Rambo performed many of the former doctor's duties, assisting in the operating room and helping out with emergencies at midnight. He learned to recognize and use different surgical knives and other tools and started handling the catheterization of paraplegics. He attended a nursing class and was two months short of graduating with a registered nurse's certificate when the family suddenly moved to Idaho after William was asked to preach in Emmett. In March 1914, the family moved again to Chehalis, Washington, where Rambo remained until September 1915, graduating from high school at the age of twenty-one.|$|E
500|$|On 10 February 1964, {{barely a}} month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a {{physically}} imposing police sergeant outside the Windsor Arena and, {{in front of a}} large crowd of people, leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the Windsor Star (published three years later), Lamb did this [...] "for no apparent reason". Lamb was convicted of assault under the Juvenile Delinquents Act and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near London, Ontario, run by the Salvation Army. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended Assumption College School, where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out to look for work. He was unable to hold down a <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months.|$|E
500|$|John Arlott later commented that, on {{his first}} tour of England, Constantine [...] "learnt much that he never forgot, by no means all of it about cricket: and he {{recognised}} the game as his only possible ladder {{to the kind of}} life he wanted." [...] When Constantine returned to Trinidad, he had no <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> and little prospect of advancement in any suitable profession. He took several temporary jobs but was often forced to rely financially upon his family. However, his success had inspired him to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England, and he began to practise to reach the required standard. Although he scored 167 for Shannon in 1924, and took eight for 38 for Trinidad against Barbados, Constantine's cricket was steady but not consistently successful. He was initially dropped from the West Indies team to face the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) touring team during 1926, though he was recalled for the second match, once again at the insistence of Austin, who wanted a good cover fielder in the team. In the match Constantine was involved in an incident over short-pitched bowling. The MCC fast bowlers had bowled short at the 49-year-old Austin; in retaliation, Constantine bounced the MCC captain, Freddie Calthorpe, and only stopped after James pointed out the diplomatic row which would follow if Calthorpe, a respected figure in the British establishment, was hit by the ball. Once more, Constantine's performances were not statistically exceptional, but his style impressed critics and spectators, and he came top of the West Indies bowling averages.|$|E

Poppy tells Janine and Tanya about her [...] "plush" [...] new lifestyle, but when she arrives home her living {{arrangements}} are far from glamorous, {{and there is an}} eviction notice on her front door. Poppy is subsequently evicted from her bedsit, but Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) offers her a place to stay, and Tanya offers Poppy a <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> at the salon. Poppy then moves into Dot Cotton's (June Brown) house after being offered a room by Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). Poppy forgives Anthony, and begins a new friendship with Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). She starts a relationship with Fatboy, after her sister Tansy Meadow's (Daisy Wood-Davis) visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, {{in an effort to make}} herself look good in front of her younger [...] "successful" [...] sister. Although it is revealed that Tansy is not that successful, she tells Poppy that Fatboy loves her. The two start a relationship and later declare their love for each other. After a few months, Poppy sees text messages on Fatboy's phone from a girl called Chloe (Siobhan Athwal), and suspects he is cheating on her, and is further upset when she sees them together. However, Fatboy reveals that Chloe is his colleague and he has started working at McKlunkies again. Poppy is then made redundant when owner Sadie Young (Kate Magowan) decides to leave Walford after discovering that her husband Jake Stone (Jamie Lomas) has been having an affair with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), which causes Poppy to act cold towards Lauren.|$|E
