50|$|There are six- and five-light {{high-speed}} signals (kōsoku shingōki) {{with two}} green lights. In a six-light signal, the additional green light is located above the yellow light; in a five-light signal, the additional green light replaces the top yellow light (eliminating the speed-restriction signal). The high-speed signal was introduced on the Hokuetsu Express Hokuhoku Line—where limited express trains travel at 160 kph mph—in 1997; and also introduced on Keisei Narita Airport Line in 2010. Two green lights indicate high-speed (no speed limit), and one green light (<b>proceed</b> <b>signal)</b> indicates a 130 kph mph speed limit. High-speed are displayed only for limited express Hakutaka trains using 681 series and 683 series EMUs.|$|E
50|$|At the junction, the Leeds-Ilkley driver, Archibald McLay, despite {{acknowledging}} {{that he had}} been given a clause 16 permission, and in spite of his four and a half year's service on the line, mistook the <b>proceed</b> <b>signal</b> given to the Bradford-Harrogate train as relating to his line. In fact, his signal was at danger, but obscured by vegetation at the time he looked at it. By the time his train arrived at the junction, it was being crossed by the Ilkley-Bradford train. The Ilkley-bound train ploughed through the last six carriages of the Bradford bound train, overturning the last of these; the engine and tender of the Ilkley bound train also turned over. Five passengers, all on the Ilkley-Bradford train were killed, one instantly, one en route to and three in hospital. Twenty-six passengers were injured and McLay and his fireman, Walter Bolton, received serious injuries, as did the guard on his train and one of the guards on the Bradford-bound train.|$|E

5000|$|Canada uses {{a signal}} system {{similar to the}} United States' {{signalling}} system, in that signals are either one-, two- or three-headed, and each one can show any of the aspects described above. There are different signal systems for rapid transit and other urban rail systems in Canada. There are also various types of signs that can be placed on a signal mast, which can modify a signal. An [...] "L" [...] plate upgrades any medium-speed signal to limited speed. An [...] "A" [...] plate is indicative of an absolute signal: you cannot pass that signal at all red signals. An [...] "R" [...] plate upgrades a regular all-red signal from a stop and <b>proceed</b> <b>signal</b> to a restricting signal.

Note Canadian railways use miles per hour not kilometres per hour, even though road speed limits are in kilometres per hour.|$|E
50|$|I {{was called}} shortly after 8 p.m. June 21, for {{deadhead}} equipment west, engine 8485, for 10.15 p.m., and left Kalamazoo, Michigan at 10.35 p.m. Had been up since 5 a.m., June 21, dead heading {{from my home}} in Jackson on Train No. 41, and had {{had little or no}} sleep during the day. Had had a couple of heavy meals before going out, realizing that I would not get anything more to eat until some time the next morning. Leaving Kalamazoo, followed freight train to Michigan City yard and stopped at signal near Center Street. Got <b>proceed</b> <b>signal</b> from some one on ground, pulled up to Michigan City, stopped at standpipe and took water. While following this freight train, we stopped first between Dowagiac and Pokagon on account signal at danger. Stopped again at Pokagon and Niles for same reason, this freight train being ahead.Leaving Michigan City, had clear track to East Gary and there caught block of train ahead, reduced speed, but did not have to stop, as block cleared before I reached it. Reduced speed going though Gary to comply with rules, and saw no more signals at caution or danger until approaching curve east of Ivanhoe, where I found second signal east of wreck at caution. Was going about 25 miles per hour at this point, but did not reduce speed, as I expected that the next signal would probably clear before I got to it, or that I would see it, if at danger, in time to stop. The wind was blowing very hard into cab on my side and I closed the window, which made the inside of cab more comfortable. Before reaching the next signal I dozed on account of heat in cab and missed it. Not realizing what had happened to me until within 75 to 90 feet, I awoke suddenly and saw the tail or marker lights showing red on a train directly ahead of me. Not realizing that the rear end of this train was so close. I started to make a service application, but before completing it placed brake-valve handle into emergency position. We struck almost instantly after making the brake application. Don't know whether I closed the throttle or not, but think I did. Looked to see where the fireman was and saw he was running toward the gangway. Did not see a fusee, hear a torpedo, or see any other warning signal up to the time I saw the red tail lights. Wreck happened at about 4.05 a.m., June 22, and I stayed there for an hour or more assisting in getting people out of the wreckage. I have been {{in the service of the}} Michigan Central Railroad Co. for approximately 28 or 29 years, the last 16 of which I have been continuously employed as an engineer. I am in perfect physical condition, as well as mental condition, and have had no illness within 25 or 30 years requiring the service of a doctor. There was nothing defective about the air brakes or other mechanism of the engine or train that I was operating, nor was there any defective condition of any of the signals or track upon which I was operating to the best of my knowledge. The accident was due solely to the fact that I accidentally fell asleep, and I had no intent to injure any person, nor was same done with malice, but solely through an accident, as aforesaid.|$|E

60|$|Two {{or three}} {{brooding}} minutes followed. Then Bunting returned {{to say the}} pennant was there, a fact he had quite overlooked in his former observations, confounding the narrow flag in question with the regular pennant of the king. This short red pennant denoted that the communication was verbal, according to a method invented by Bluewater himself, and by means of which, using the ordinary numbers, he was enabled to communicate with his friend, {{without any of the}} captains, or, indeed, without Sir Gervaise's own signal-officer's knowing what was said. In a word, without having recourse to any new flags, but, by simply giving new numbers to the old ones, and referring to a prepared dictionary, it was possible to hold a conversation in sentences, that should be a secret to all but themselves. Sir Gervaise took down the number of the signal that was flying, and directed Bunting to show the answering flag, with a similar pennant over it, and to continue this operation so long as the rear-admiral might make his signals. The numbers were to be sent below as fast as received. As soon as Bunting disappeared, the vice-admiral unlocked a secretary, the key of which was never out of his own possession, took from it a small dictionary, and laid it by his plate. All this time the breakfast <b>proceeded,</b> <b>signals</b> of this nature frequently occurring between the two admirals.

40|$|Abstract: Hair {{follicle}} morphogenesis {{depends on}} Wnt, Shh, Notch, BMP and other signaling pathways interplay between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The Wnt pathway plays {{an essential role}} during hair follicle induction, Shh is involved in morphogenesis and late stage differentiation, Notch signaling determines stem cell fate while BMP is involved in cellular differentiation. The Wnt pathway {{is considered to be}} the master regulator during hair follicle morphogenesis. Wnt <b>signaling</b> <b>proceeds</b> through EDA/EDAR/NF-κB <b>signaling.</b> NF-κB regulates the Wnt pathway and acts as a signal mediator by upregulating the expression of Shh ligand. Signal crosstalk between epithelial and mesenchymal cells takes place mainly through primary cilia. Primary cilia formation is initiated with epithelial laminin- 511 interaction with dermal β- 1 integrin, which also upregulates expression of downstream effectors of Shh pathway in dermal lineage. PDGF signal transduction essential for crosstalk is mediated through epithelial PDGF-A and PDGFRα expressed on the primary cilia. Dermal Shh and PDGF signaling up-regulates dermal noggin expression; noggin is a potent inhibitor of BMP signaling which helps in counteracting BMP mediated β-catenin inhibition. This interplay of signaling between the epithelial and dermal lineag...|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg), the major coat protein of {{hepatitis}} B virus, is also independently secreted from infected cells as a lipoprotein particle. Secretion <b>proceeds</b> without <b>signal</b> sequence removal or cleavage of other {{segments of the}} polypeptide. We have examined the synthesis and transport of HBsAg in cultured cells expressing the cloned surface antigen gene. Our results show that HBsAg is initially synthesized as a integral membrane protein. This transmembrane form is slowly converted to a secreted lipoprotein complex in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum via a series of definable intermediates, after which it is secreted from the cell. This unusual export process shares many features with the assembly and budding reactions of conventional enveloped animal viruses. However, it differs importantly in its absence of a requirement for the participation of nucleocapsid or other viral proteins...|$|R
40|$|We find {{evidence}} of income-increasing earnings management in Malaysian IPOs, which occurs primarily for IPOs {{during a period of}} severe economic stress (the East Asian crisis). Within the high-ownership-concentration Malaysian market, post-IPO control concerns also appear to constrain IPO earnings management: owners seem willing to accept reduced IPO <b>proceeds</b> and <b>signaling</b> opportunities to increase the likelihood of retaining control of the company post-IPO. The requirement to provide a profit guarantee does not seem to greatly affect earnings management. IPO companies engaging in aggressive income-increasing earnings management have significantly worse market-based performance than their more conservative counterparts, but again only for IPOs issued during the economic crisis period. Overall, the results suggest that personal liquidity concerns are an important factor in IPO decisions during the economic crisis.

40|$|When cells {{within the}} gastric mucosa {{progress}} from metaplasia to dysplasia to cancer, they acquire a Fas Ag apoptosis-resistant phenotype. It is unusual to completely abolish the pathway, suggesting {{other forms of}} Fas Ag signaling may be important or even necessary for gastric cancer to progress. Little is known about alternate signaling of the Fas Ag pathway in gastric mucosal cells. Using a cell culture model of rat gastric mucosal cells, we show that gastric mucosal cells utilize a type II signaling pathway for apoptosis. Under conditions of low receptor stimulation or under conditions where apoptosis is blocked downstream of the death-inducing signal complex, Fas Ag <b>signaling</b> <b>proceeds</b> toward proliferative <b>signaling.</b> Under conditions favoring proliferative signaling, cFLIP is recruited to the Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin- 1 beta-converting enzyme at the death-inducing signal complex and activates ERK 1 / 2. ERK 1 / 2 in turn activates NF-kappaB. ERK 1 / 2 stimulates proliferation, whereas NF-kappaB activation results in upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin, further promoting proliferation over apoptosis. These results suggest that factors that inhibit apoptosis confer a growth advantage to the cells beyond the survival advantage of avoiding apoptosis and in effect convert the Fas Ag signaling pathway from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter...|$|R

40|$|In liver wound healing, {{transforming}} growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays {{a critical}} role in stellate cell activation as well as signaling cascades in the fibrogenic response to injury. We postulate that the TGF-β-dependent downstream signaling pathway may vary according to the mechanism of stellate cell activation; this study was undertaken to ascertain whether the downstream signaling pathways mediated by TGF-β vary in different liver injury models. We measured Smad 3 and MAP kinase activation after isolating stellate cells from rat livers injured by either bile duct ligation (BDL) or repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) administration. Phospho-Smad 3 was dramatically up-regulated in stellate cells after CCl 4 injury, but not after BDL-induced injury. TGF-β signaling in stellate cells activated after BDL was mediated prominently through ERK activation, whereas activation induced by CCl 4 injury or culture led to a cross-signaling mechanism involving both Smad 3 and p 38. The divergent Smad signaling pathways observed appeared to be attributable to the differential regulation of the early growth response gene- 1 (Egr- 1), an apparent negative transcriptional factor for Smad 3 in our system. In addition, inhibition of ERK activation in stellate cells from BDL-injured liver led to a decrease in expression of endothelin-converting enzyme- 1, a critical regulator of endothelin- 1.
