40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{research on}} the design {{and implementation of the}} unequal error protection (UEP) mechanism for the RaptorQ forward error correction (FEC) scheme. As part of this research, existing UEP mechanisms for various fountain codes were evaluated. Two new UEP methods were proposed for the RaptorQ coding scheme, and these methods were designed with the assumption that all of the symbols in a source block have the same priority. The first method, known as priority based overhead number (PBON), was based on the priority encoding transmission model, wherein the error-correction capability was altered by making the number of overhead symbols proportional to the priority of the information symbols. This method was extended to the RaptorQ codes with some changes and evaluated for failure probability and performance. The second method, known as priority based <b>precode</b> ratio (PBPR), was designed by changing the <b>precode</b> properties of the RaptorQ codes. The ratio of <b>precode</b> symbols to Luby-Transform symbols in the RaptorQ codes was changed to achieve different error correction capabilities for each priority group. The scheme with the higher number of <b>precode</b> symbols provided superior error-correction capabilities compared to those with fewer <b>precode</b> symbols. Both methods were empirically verified through simulation in the C++ programming language. The results demonstrated that the higher-importance class depicted a better error-correction capability than the lower-importance class...|$|E

However, most existing hybrid <b>precoding</b> schemes are based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Due to the very different sub-channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) after SVD, complicated bit allocations is usually required to match the sub-channel SNRs. To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean decomposition (GMD) -based hybrid <b>precoding</b> scheme to avoid the complicated bit allocation. Its basic idea is to seek a pair of analog and digital <b>precoding</b> matrices that are sufficiently close to the optimal unconstrained GMD <b>precoding</b> matrix.

CRL distribution utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications is preferred to an infrastructure-only approach. One approach to V 2 V CRL distribution, using rateless coding at the source and forwarding at vehicle relays is vulnerable to a pollution attack in which a few malicious vehicles forward incorrect packets which then spread through the network leading to denial-of-service. This paper develops a new scheme called Precode-and-Hash that enables efficient packet verification before forwarding thereby preventing the pollution attack. In contrast to rateless codes, it utilizes a fixed low-rate <b>precode</b> and random selection of packets from the set of precoded packets.
