40|$|The {{current state}} of the social studies {{classroom}} comprises one of uninspired students using unexciting textbooks as their guide for learning U. S. history (Hope, 1996; NCES, 1993; Banks, 1990; Wakefield, 2006). With multiple intelligences gaining popularity in education, renewed hope exists for social studies to produce quality textbooks with differentiated instruction to reach all learners. The purpose was to design a rubric for measuring the presence of multiple intelligences structured tasks in teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> of four 11 th grade U. S. history textbooks. Using 1995 to 2007 as a purposeful sample of consistent authorships and similar publications, the study looked at teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> of U. <b>S.</b> history textbooks to create a reliable and valid rubric for measuring the presence of multiple intelligences tasks in the teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> of four high school history textbooks. Using this analytical rubric, the researcher analyzed trends of tasks offered in teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> of textbooks to determine whether multiple intelligences tasks were being offered. Findings suggested that teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> do reflect a MI/directive framework over a non-directive framework, with MI/directive tasks appearing much more frequently. However, linguistic/verbal tasks were more likely to appear as the MI/directive task of choice over other categories. Changes were noted in number of tasks found in mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> to mid- 2000 <b>s</b> <b>editions</b> with a decrease in verbal/linguistic and spatial/visual tasks in The Americans. Yet Pathways to the Present saw an increase in spatial/visual tasks. Hence, it is implied that textbook publishers have not embraced MI whole-heartedly and have not met all learner 2 ̆ 7 s needs in terms of curriculum design. Furthermore, textbooks authors and publishers need to incorporate more variety in learning tasks to include other categories of multiple intelligences...|$|R
