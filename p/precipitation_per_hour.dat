40|$|A {{method for}} {{simulating}} rain storms {{at the rate}} of 63 mm of <b>precipitation</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> for an hour, using a rotating boom rainfall simulator, is described. The soils subjected to this treatment ranged from a weak structureless sand to a well structured clay and included Cartref, Longlands, Kroonstad, Hutton. Bonheim and Fernwood soil forms. The measured erodibilities for the less structured soils showed a close correlation with those determined by the nomograph method developed in the United States of America. The results obtained for the structured Bonheim soil showed little correlation between the factor predicted by the nomograph and that determined by actual measurements in the trials...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the grain drying quality and {{automation}} level, combined with the structural characteristics of the cross-flow circulation grain dryer designed and developed by us, the temperature, moisture, and other parameters measuring sensors {{were placed on the}} dryer, to achieve online automatic detection of process parameters during the grain drying process. A drying model predictive control system was set up. A grain dry predictive control model at constant velocity and variable temperature was established, in which the entire process was dried at constant velocity (i. e., <b>precipitation</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> is a constant) and variable temperature. Combining PC with PLC, and based on LabVIEW, a system control platform was designed...|$|R
