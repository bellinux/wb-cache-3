5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> {{role within}} cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct {{the assembly of}} proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Singapore, the club's anti-Japanese agenda became redundant and it reverted being a club {{for social and}} business interaction once again. Its members were later active {{in the struggle for}} citizenship, voters' registration campaign and other philanthropic activities. After Singapore's independence in 1965, it became a focal point where local Chinese businessmen socialised and forged ties, and it continued to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in community services such as charity work and giving public talks. Among its 200-odd members today are luminaries of the Chinese business community such as the founder of the Overseas Union Bank, Lien Ying Chow, and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw. It is still an all men's club– the youngest members are mainly in their 50s and membership is by invitation only.|$|E
5|$|Anarawd's brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, {{took over}} {{as head of the}} family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen castle in 1145 then began a {{campaign}} to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals {{for the first time in}} 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, and left for dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.|$|E

In January 2015, it was revealed that shortly after losing to Shaheen, Brown, age 55, filed an application to the Massachusetts State Retirement Board to claim a state pension. Brown has not ruled out running for office again in the future. Brown is also working as a contributor for Fox News Channel and as an on-call host for Fox & Friends. Brown served as a featured speaker at the 2015 Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire. Brown continues to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in politics, campaigning and fundraising with senatorial and congressional candidates and meeting with Republican candidates for President in New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> {{role in the}} cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark {{for the city and}} a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E

5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, {{the party}} was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and {{generally}} ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in the civil war, however, soured {{relations between the two}} parties, and the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E

5|$|From early April 1965, Ubon {{became an}} {{important}} base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No.79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25June. This changed {{the status of the}} squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No.79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards. While the squadron did not <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in the war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No.79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement. On 2March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made {{on the grounds that the}} expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.|$|E
