5|$|Bismarck then shifted fire to <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales.</b> The British {{battleship}} {{scored a}} hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room.

40|$|Most acute {{cases of}} {{infection}} with hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Hong Kong were autochthonous, sporadic, and occurred in older adults. All except 1 isolate belonged to genotype 4; most were phylogenetically related to swine isolates. The epidemiology {{is similar to}} that in industrialized countries, where zoonosis is the major source of HEV infection in humans. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Large outbreaks resulting from fecal contamination of drinking water are confined mainly to developing countries (1), whereas sporadic cases in industrialized countries are thought to be zoonotic, with swine being the most likely reservoir (2). Studies in Hong Kong reported a seroprevalence of 16 %– 19 % (3). No large outbreak has been recorded in Hong Kong, and the sporadic cases are believed to be imported (4). Our study examined the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HEV infections in Hong Kong in an effort to improve control of this disease.

It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> of many of her electric pumps.
