5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the number}} of {{navigation}} algorithms calculating simultaneously to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays. The research focused on visual perception. The first part was focused on the simultaneous localization and mapping with an extended Kalman filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy or incomplete measures. The second focused on the location and the detection of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Spain's General Francisco Franco briefly {{considered}} a naval building program after seizing {{power in the}} Spanish Civil War. Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that {{would have seen the}} building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could handle a vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, Warren {{met with}} Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the {{director}} of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E
5|$|The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was {{requested}} to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> records regarding the internal inspection of Line 901 conducted in 2012 and details {{of all other}} inspections since 2013 such as maintenance data, monitoring information, incident reports and repair logs. The Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara (EDC), who had requested {{the release of the}} records along with the Santa Barbara Channelkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the agency in December 2015 since it had been over six months and they had not received any of the requested documents.|$|E

5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> materials {{related to an}} election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E
5|$|Unicamp offers 70 {{different}} degree-granting undergraduate programs, covering {{nearly all}} {{different areas of}} science. Completing an undergraduate program grants either a bachelor's degree or a licentiate degree, although some programs offer both degrees. In line with the Brazilian educational system, no graduate education is required to practice any profession, including law and medicine, so undergraduate programs vary in length to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the necessary training. Most programs at Unicamp last a total of 4 years, with engineering programs typically lasting 5 years and medicine lasting 6 years.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, Süß suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Reynolds and Reynolds won a {{contract}} to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> of the business forms for Chevrolet dealerships. The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices {{by the end of}} the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the Reynolds family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. Reynolds became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, Reynolds expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive business unit of Windsor Office Supply, forming Reynolds and Reynolds (Canada) Ltd. By the end of the decade it had about $50 million in revenues.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick seven rural communities, an {{increase}} from four {{as of the}} 2011 census following the incorporations of Kedgwick in 2012 and Cocagne and Hanwell in 2014. These seven rural communities had a cumulative population of 19,616 in the 2016 Census. New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities. Rural communities that include a former village or town are an exception, as they are responsible to <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> services that were previously provided by their former municipality.|$|E

Another point in the manifesto stated that DAP would <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> Sarawakians aged above 60 a minimum of RM100 per annum as a gift for their contributions to the state. A minimum wage of RM750 per month for workers in the peninsula and RM830 for workers in Sarawak will be introduced and on education, DAP promised that all schools would be given allocations according to their needs as practised in Penang, Selangor and Kelantan. The three other points in the manifesto concerned oil royalty, land reform, and competency, accountability and transparency in governance.|$|E
