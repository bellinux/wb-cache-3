40|$|Service survey {{estimates}} sales on {{a calendar}} month basis. However, some "period reporters " report sales covering either a 4 -week or 5 -week period that rarely coincides with the exact beginning and ending dates of the calendar month. These <b>period</b> <b>reports</b> are adjusted to {{a calendar month}} basis using trading day weights computed {{as part of the}} seasonal adjustment process. This research examines whether the current methodology adequately accounts for the increased holiday sales that occur in November and December. During these months, survey analysts attempt to re-contact large period reporters to convert their original <b>period</b> <b>report</b> to a calendar basis. The companies that have both a period and a calendar report are used in this research to estimate the effects of unadjusted <b>period</b> <b>reports,</b> the current adjustment method and a simple adjustment {{based on the number of}} days contained in the period. The purpose is to measure the error caused by adjusting the <b>period</b> <b>reports</b> and discuss ways to improve measurement of the error...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Estimating {{effective}} {{population size}} (Ne) from allele frequency changes in Bavarian Simmental (FV) and Tyrolean Grey (GV) cattle Frequencies of 10 to 16 alleles of blood group, hemo- and lactoprotein loci were estimated for FV in 1960, 1986 and 200, for GV in 1969, 1979 and 1998. Rates of inbreeding {{in the intervening}} periods and Ne`s were derived from Wahlund variances. The Ne`s for the two <b>part</b> <b>periods</b> of FV, spanning 2. 2 resp. 4. 1 generations, were 152 resp. 147, for the whole period of 6. 25 generation intervals 373. This {{is due to the}} opposing signs of the changes in the two <b>part</b> <b>periods</b> and it may reflect the large influence of a top sire on the gene pool in the first period and ensueing change to a FV gene reservoir similar to that in 1960. For GV the Ne`of the two <b>part</b> <b>periods</b> were 139 and 56, for the whole 97, roughly in agreement with the one expected from the two short periods. The lower Ne of the second <b>part</b> <b>period</b> agrees well with an estimate by the inbreeding increment in roughly the same time period...|$|R

Acute symptom burden, measured by TSS and individual symptom increases, significantly increased as the high school football season advanced. Progressively higher measures of symptom burden were observed across season periods, with athletes in the late-season <b>period</b> <b>reporting</b> twice the post-injury TSS compared to athletes in the early-season period.

40|$|Abstract. We present optical {{photometry}} of {{the galactic}} bulge low-mass X-ray binary GX 349 + 2 (Sco X- 2) obtained in July 1993 and March 1996. Short-term variations {{up to one}} magnitude are present on time scales of a few hours, which {{are related to the}} known X-ray behaviour of the source. We find (equally strong) evidence for a periodicity at either 22. 3 hours or at 14. 9 days. These periodicities are close to the 22 hour reported by Wachter & Margon (1996) and the 14 day <b>period</b> <b>reported</b> by Southwell et al. (1996). The two periods are related to each other through aliasing with the frequency of observations, which is approximately one day. We therefore suggest that one of the <b>periods</b> <b>reported</b> is the true (orbital) period, whereas the other is the ∼ 1 day alias. This confirms that both <b>reported</b> <b>periods</b> are present in the data. Independent of which is the real one, we conclude that the orbital period if Sco X- 2 is relatively long...|$|R
