40|$|The Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, Oregon, {{houses a}} {{remarkable}} permanent collection of Asian art and antiquities, modern art, and sculpture, and also hosts traveling exhibitions. In {{the winter and}} spring of 2011, a series of digital photographs by artist Chris Jordan, titled "Running the Numbers," was exhibited in the Coeta and Donald Barker Special Exhibitions Gallery. These works graphically illustrate waste (energy, money, health, consumer objects, etc.) in contemporary culture. The Bonneville Power Administration and the Eugene Water and Electricity Board provided a set of Cree 12 W light-emitting diode (LED) <b>PAR</b> 38 replacement <b>lamps</b> (Cree LRP 38) for the museum to test for accent lighting in lieu of their standard Sylvania 90 W PAR 38 130 V Narrow Flood lamps (which draw 78. 9 W at 120 V).

40|$|We ran {{some tests}} {{on the effect of}} dimming of metal halide (MH) lamps upon the {{stability}} and the spectral quality of the light output. Lamps used were a new Philips lamp HPI-T 250 W, a similar Philips lamp with a few thousand burning hours and a new Osram lamp HQI-T 250 W/D. The ballast was a BBC type DJ 250 / 2 KS, the starter a BAS TORGI type MZN 250 SE and the dimmer an Elstrom Control System type ERHQ-T 250. Power was derived from a Philips stabilizer, type PE 1602. Lamp output was monitored with a PAR meter. Spectra were taken at 100 % and at 50 % output as measured with the <b>PAR</b> meter. <b>Lamps</b> were allowed to stabilize at any setting for 30 minutes before measurements were made. Lamp manufacturers advise against dimming for fear of poor stability and intolerable changes of the spectrum. However, none of the lamps showed a decrease in stability, no flicker or wandering of the discharge, and the changes of the spectrum were not negligible, but certainly not dramatic. Lamps of either manufacture retain their white color, relative peak heights of spectral lines did shift, but no gaps in the spectrum occurred. Spectra taken at 50 % with 30 minutes intervals coincided. Differences between the new and the older Philips lamp were noticeable, but not really significant...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Replacing {{incandescent}} lamps with {{compact fluorescent lamps}} (CFLs), which are three to six times more efficient, {{is one of the}} easiest methods to achieve energy efficiency. The present study aimed to evaluate relationships between UV emissions radiated and illuminance CFLs. Material and Methods. This pilot study was conducted on 16 single envelope CFLs. The illuminance and UV irradiance of various types of CFLs are measured on a three-meter long optical bench, using a calibrated lux meter and UV meter, and measurement was done in 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 [*]cm, in three angles, including 0 Â°, 45 Â°, and 90 Â°, at the ages of 0, 100, and 2000 hours. Result. UVC irradiance was not observed at the distance of 10 [*]cm in all of lamps. The lowest value of UVB irradiance was recorded in <b>Pars</b> Khazar <b>lamp,</b> while the highest value was recorded in Etehad lamps. UVR values measured at different times showed negligible differences; the highest asset value was detected in zero times. One way ANOVA indicated that relationships between UVA irradiance and illuminance were significant (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. UVB irradiance in most of the lamp in 10 and 25 [*]cm was more than occupational exposure and UVA {{except for the fact that}} Pars Khazar 60 watts and Nama Noor 60 watts were less than occupational exposure...|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 {{authorized}} the Department of Energy (DOE) {{to establish the}} Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize competition, known as the [...] "L Prize", the first government-sponsored technology competition designed to challenge industry to develop replacements for 60 W incandescent <b>lamps</b> and <b>PAR</b> 38 halogen <b>lamps.</b> The EISA legislation established basic requirements and prize amounts {{for each of the}} two competition categories, and authorized up to $20 million in cash prizes. The competition also included the possibility for winners to obtain federal purchasing agreements, utility programs, and other incentives. In May 2008, they announced details of the competition and technical requirements for each category. Lighting products meeting the competition requirements could use just 17% of the energy used by most incandescent lamps in use today. That same year the DOE also launched the Energy Star program for solid-state lighting products. The EISA legislation also authorized an additional L Prize program for developing a new [...] "21st Century Lamp".|$|R
40|$|The use of lamps for {{improvement}} of CO 2 -assimilation of greenhouse crops has increased enormously during the last 15 years in The Netherlands. The main reasons {{for the use of}} assimilation lighting are not only to increase crop production and product quality, especially in winter time, but also more and more to ensure a year round production and quality level which meets market demands. Assimilation lighting is often used for plant propagation and rose production, while its use in other ornamental crops is increasing rapidly. In addition, few producers of vegetables started to apply assimilation lighting. Some new trends are higher light intensities during longer periods, techniques to improve light output per lamp by enlarging the voltage and moveable lamps with high light intensities. The coming years the use of artificial lighting in the Netherlands will be affected by liberalization and legislation of the trade of energy (gas and electricity). Nowadays explanatory crop models are available that can predict crop growth quite accurately. These models in combination with models simulating the greenhouse climate are powerful tools to analyse effects of artificial lighting. Some results of a combined model for crop growth and greenhouse climate are shown with respect to different strategies for the operation of artificial lighting. It is shown that the light use efficiency (unit production per unit of <b>PAR</b> from <b>lamps)</b> decreases when intensive lighting regimes are applied. Besides light, lamps produce heat. Therefore, the energy demand of the heating system decreases when lights are turned on. This simulation study showed {{that it is possible to}} increase the energy use efficiency (unit production per unit of energy input from lamps and heating system together) by the use of lighting...|$|R
40|$|PUE_P and PUE_L, photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) energy utilization efficiencies {{were calculated}} by dividing the chemical energy fixed in plants by the PAR energy measured {{at the top of}} plant populations and by the theoretical value of total <b>PAR</b> energy on <b>lamp</b> surfaces, respectively. EUE, electric energy utilization efficiency of a closed transplant production system, was also calculated using the total electric energy consumed in the system as a denominator. Tomato seedlings on plug trays were grown for 20 days in the closed system in which air current speed and CO_ 2 concentration were controlled at 0. 53 Â± 0. 07 m s^ and 1040 Â± 50 Î¼mol mol^, respectively, and the effect of leaf area index (LAI) of tomato seedling populations on PUE_P, PUE_L and EUE were investigated. The maximal values of PUE_P, PUE_L and EUE during the present study were 0. 10, 0. 075 and 0. 015, respectively, which were obtained when the LAI reached the maximal value of 2. 4. The maximal value of PUE_P (0. 10) obtained {{in the present study was}} greater than the theoretical maximal value that Beadle and Long (1985) reported for C_ 3 plants grown under ambient CO_ 2 concentration.

40|$|The CALiPER program {{first began}} {{investigating}} LED lamps sold at retail stores in 2010, purchasing 33 products from eight retailers and covering six product categories. The findings revealed a fragmented marketplace, with large disparities in performance of different products, accuracy of manufacturer claims, and offerings from different retail outlets. Although {{there were some}} good products, looking back many would not be considered viable competitors to other available options, with too little lumen output, not high enough efficacy, or poor color quality. CALiPER took another look in late 2011 purchasing 38 products of five different types from nine retailers and the improvement was marked. Performance was up; retailer claims were more accurate; and the price per lumen and price per unit efficacy were down, although the price per product had not changed much. Nonetheless, there was still {{plenty of room for}} improvement, with the performance of LED lamps not yet reaching that of well-established classes of conventional lamps (e. g., 75 W incandescent A 19 lamps). Since the second retail lamp study was published in early 2012, there has been substantial progress in all aspects of LED lamps available from retailers. To document this progress, CALiPER again purchased a sample of lamps from retail stores 46 products in total, focusing on A 19, PAR 30, and MR 16 lamps but instead of a random sample, sought to select products to answer specific hypotheses about performance. These hypotheses focused on expanding ranges of LED equivalency, the accuracy of lifetime claims, efficacy and price trends, as well as changes to product designs. Among other results, key findings include: There are now very good LED options to compete with 60 W, 75 W, and 100 W incandescent A 19 lamps, and 75 W halogen <b>PAR</b> 30 <b>lamps.</b> MR 16 lamps have shown less progress, but there are now acceptable alternatives to 35 W, 12 V halogen MR 16 lamps and 50 W, 120 V halogen MR 16 lamps for some applications. Other uses, such as in enclosed luminaires, may require more development. At the same price point, lamps purchased in 2013 tended to have higher output and slightly higher efficacy than in 2011 or 2010. Over 30 % of the products purchased in 2013 exceeded the maximum efficacy measured in 2011 (71 lm/W), with the most efficacious product measured at 105 lm/W. There appears to be increasing consistency in color quality, with a vast majority of products having a CCT of 2700 K or 3000 K and a CRI between 80 and 85. There were also fewer poor performing products tested and more high-performing products available in 2013 than in previous years. The accuracy of equivalency and performance claims was better than in 2011, but remains a concern, with 43 % of tested products failing to completely meet their equivalency claim and 20 % of products failing to match the manufacturerâ€™s performance data. Although progress has been substantial, on average LED lamps remain more expensive than other energy efficiency lighting technologies [...] although some aspects can be superior. Although not universal to all product lines or all product types, the issue of insufficient lumen output from LED lamps is waning. Thus, manufacturers can focus on other issues, such as reducing cost, improving electrical/dimmer compatibility, eliminating flicker, or improving color quality. While these issues are not inherent to all products, they remain a concern for the broader market...|$|R
