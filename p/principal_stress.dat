25|$|Maximum <b>Principal</b> <b>Stress</b> Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850). Yield {{occurs when}} the largest <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> exceeds the {{uniaxial}} tensile yield strength. Although this criterion allows for a quick and easy comparison with experimental data it is rarely suitable for design purposes. This theory gives good predictions for brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there exists}} a {{hierarchy}} of stress level in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels. This can easily be understood by considering {{the direction of the}} greatest <b>principal</b> <b>stress,</b> the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest <b>principal</b> <b>stress)</b> equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' {{in the direction of the}} least <b>principal</b> <b>stress,</b> namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the least <b>principal</b> <b>stress.</b> Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Glacial loads {{provided}} more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada {{and more than}} 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress {{is supported by the}} mantle and the flexure of the lithosphere. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today.|$|E

40|$|Most {{sedimentary}} {{soils are}} inherently ansiotropic. Their response to loading {{will depend on}} the directions of the <b>principal</b> <b>stresses.</b> In most geotechnical problems the <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> gradually rotate during loading. As a consequence, deformations occur due to both change in the magnitude and change {{in the direction of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>stresses.</b> The Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA) is the only soil test device that can facilitate independent control of both the magnitude and the direction of the <b>principal</b> <b>stresses.</b> The stress history and loading conditions at a point in a soil deposit can be reproduced on a hollow cylindrical specimen and its constitute behaviour and pore pressure response measured. This paper is divided into two sections: First, an example showing the influence of the <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> on the strength and deformation characteristics of a soil is discussed. Second, an overview of a unique HCA currently being commissioned in the Department of Civil Engineering, University College Dublin (UCD) is presented.

500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{describes}} {{a series of}} conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, [...] "The <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, {{of nature and the}} human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream." [...] Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant [...] "voice" [...] within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This {{is not to say that}} the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] perform this when he says, [...] "we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions". However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale.|$|E
