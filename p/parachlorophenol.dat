40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study is to remove Phenol and <b>Parachlorophenol</b> from {{synthetic}} wastewater using prepared activated carbon from agricultural wastes (rice husk, (RH) date stones, (DS) and palm fronds, (PF)) utilizing chemical and physical activation methods. Three principal operating parameters have been considered which are activation temperature, activation time, and impregnation ratio. The results showed that the activated carbon prepared from rice husk by chemical method at a temperature of 700 ̊ C, activation time of 3 hours, and impregnation ratio of 3 : 1 gives highest removal of phenol and <b>Parachlorophenol.</b> The results also showed that the activated carbon prepared by physical method from rice husk gives higher removal efficiency for phenol and <b>Parachlorophenol</b> than that of activated carbon prepared from date stones and palm fronds. The results also showed that the rate of removal of Phenol and <b>Parachlorophenol</b> increases with the increase of activation temperature, activation time, and impregnation ratio. The highest removal of phenol and <b>Parachlorophenol</b> are (84. 38 % and 94. 65 %) respectively. Application of the most prominent adsorption models shows acceptable agreement with Langmuir and Temkin models. Maximum adsorption capacity for the prepared activated carbon is found to be 39 mg/g an...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) in acetonitrile-water solution was investigated under electrochemical oxidation on a platinum electrode. The related mechanism was proposed through the organic analysis and electrochemical measurements such as chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetric measurements. The cyclic voltammogram curves of p-DCB, <b>parachlorophenol,</b> parahydroquinone, 2, 5 -dichlorophenol, and 2, 5 -dichlorohydroquinone showed two oxidation peak...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This was a histologic {{study of}} {{continued}} apical {{development in the}} pulpless permanent teeth of dogs. The vital pulps {{were exposed to the}} oral fluids for one week. The root canals were filled with either calcium hydroxide and camphorated <b>parachlorophenol</b> (CMCP) or calcium hydroxide and distilled water. A vital dye, Procion red was injected to demonstrate the formation of calcified tissue. After four months, the animals were sacrificed. Decalcified semi-serial sections were studied. In 31 of 61 pulpless permanent teeth, with incompletely developed roots, continued apical development occurred. Apical calcified tissue resembling cementum was observed in 55 per cent of the specimens treated with calcium hydroxide and CMCP and in 42 per cent of those, with calcium hydroxide and distilled water. Complete closure of the apical foramen was observed in 29 and 11 per cent of the specimens respectively. Inflammation of the periapical tissues was present in 48 per cent of the calcium hydroxide and CMCP group and in 79 per cent of the other group. A significant association was found between the degree of inflammation and apical closure, (P<. 001) for the calcium hydroxide-CMCP group, (P<. 005) for the calcium hydroxide-distilled water group. The results suggest that calcium hydroxide and CMCP was superior to calcium hydroxide and distilled water and that the addition of CMCP to the paste reduced inflammation. Procion dye was shown to be an effective in vivo dental hard tissue marker...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Enterococcus faecalis is the {{dominant}} microbial species responsible for persistent apical periodontitis with ability to deeply penetrate into the dentin. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) contribute to the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (CH), camphorated <b>parachlorophenol</b> (CMCP), and chlorhexidine (CHX) against E. faecalis in dentinal tubules. Material and Methods: Decoronated single-canal human teeth and semicylindrical dentin blocks were incubated with E. faecalis for 3 weeks. Samples were randomly assigned to six medication groups for 1 week (n= 10 per group) : CH + 40 % glycerin-water solution (1 : 1, wt/vol); CMCP; 2 % CHX; CH + CMCP (1 : 1, wt/vol); CH + CMCP (2 : 3, wt/vol); and saline. Bacterial samples were collected and assayed for colony-forming units. After dentin blocks were split longitudinally, confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to assess the proportion of viable bacteria and EPS production in dentin. Results: CMCP exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, while CH was the least sensitive against E. faecalis (p 0. 05). CH combined with CMCP inhibited EPS synthesis by E. faecalis, which sensitized biofilms to antibacterial substances. Moreover, increasing concentrations of CMCP decreased EPS matrix formation, which effectively sensitized biofilms to disinfection agents. Conclusion: The EPS matrix dispelled by CH paste with CMCP may be related to its bactericidal effect; the visualization and analysis of EPS formation and microbial colonization in dentin may be a useful approach to verify medicaments for antimicrobial therapy...|$|E
40|$|Primary tooth endodontic filling {{materials}} {{should be}} bio-compatible with periodontal tissue. The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze the biologic effects of different endodontic filling materials for primary teeth on a human osteosarcoma cell line (U 2 OS). Materials and methods: Experimental groups comprised different mixes of endodontic filling materials: zinc oxide-eugenol (ZnOE) + formocresol (FC); calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] + FC; Ca(OH) 2 + iodoform + deionized water; Ca(OH) 2 + iodoform +camphorated <b>parachlorophenol</b> (CPC); Ca(OH) 2 + CPC; and Vitapex. These were prepared and used to fill special glass rings, which were subsequently eluted in 10 mL of cell culture medium at 37 ºC in a 5 % carbon dioxide-in-air atmosphere for 24 hours. Cell culture medium alone was used as the control group. A DNA fragmentation assay was performed to determine the genotoxicity of each mix of materials. The level of cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 protein expression, the extent of dental material-elicited inflammation of U 2 OS cells, and the degree of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase expression were determined using Western blot analysis. Results: The results revealed that no DNA breakage was apparent after U 2 OS cells were treated with the various materials. COX- 2 band expression dramatically declined in the ZnOE + FC group compared with the control group, although high levels of expression of the COX- 2 band were noted for the Ca(OH) 2 + FC and Ca(OH) 2 + iodo-form + CPC groups. Band levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK- 1 and ERK- 2) expression declined in the ZnOE + FC and Ca(OH) 2 + CPC groups compared with the control group. p 53 and caspase- 3 protein bands appeared in all experimental groups. Conclusion: The cytotoxic mechanism of endodontic filling materials on U 2 OS cells was induced by means of activation of the p 53 and caspase- 3 apoptosis signaling pathways...|$|E
