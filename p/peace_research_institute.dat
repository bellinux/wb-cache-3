50|$|China {{has made}} {{significant}} progress in modernising its air force in recent decades, purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the Sukhoi Su-30, and also manufacturing its own modern fighters, most notably the Chengdu J-10, J-20 and the Shenyang J-11, J-15, J-16, and J-31. China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones. Air and Sea denial weaponry advances have increased the regional threat {{from the perspective of}} Japan as well as Washington. China has also updated its ground forces, replacing its ageing Soviet-derived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern Type 99 tank, and upgrading its battlefield C3I and C4I systems to enhance its network-centric warfare capabilities. In addition, China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems, including anti-satellite missiles, cruise missiles and submarine-launched nuclear ICBMs. According to the Stockholm International <b>Peace</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute's</b> data, China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010-14, an increase of 143 per cent from the period 2005-09.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{interesting}} aspects of Canadian politics and society is the wide commitment within Canada, both by civil society and government, to peace and to <b>peace</b> <b>research</b> and education. Evidence of this commitment is quite extensive. Canadian governments {{have a history of}} active promotion of the United Nations and United Nations programmes and policies, with the commitment to the United Nations programme for a culture of peace one recent example. Within Canadian foreign policy, there has been active support for and participation in international peacekeeping operations. In September 2000, the Canadian Government established the independent International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, in response to concerns from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the importance of developing guidelines for international humanitarian intervention. There has been widespread popular support by Canadian citizens for United Nations programmes, such as the International Year for the Culture of Peace in 2000. UNESCO is the prime agency for encouraging education for peace and Canada has a highly active Canadian National Commission for UNESCO, actively encouraging citizens to become involved with UNESCO and UNESCO activities. Within academia, there is a similar strong tradition of commitment to <b>peace</b> <b>research</b> and education. There are numerous <b>peace</b> <b>research</b> <b>institutes</b> and centres throughout Canada, with the most recent initiative being the planned Toronto Campus of the United Nations University for Peace (UPEACE).

50|$|According to the Stockholm International <b>Peace</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute's</b> data, China {{became the}} world's third largest {{exporter}} of major arms in 2010-14, an increase of 143 per cent from the period 2005-2009. China's share of global arms exports hence increased from 3 to 5 per cent. China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010-14. A significant percentage (just over 68 per cent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010-14 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply {{of a number of}} unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 per cent between 2005-2009 and 2010-14. Russia accounted for 61 per cent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 per cent and Ukraine with 13 per cent. Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China. Over the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles. It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010-14 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and for naval ships. It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.|$|R
25|$|The {{country has}} a large and fully {{indigenous}} arms industry, producing most of its own military equipment with only few types of weapons imported. Russia {{is one of the}} world's top supplier of arms, a spot it has held since 2001, accounting for around 30% of worldwide weapons sales and exporting weapons to about 80 countries. The Stockholm International <b>Peace</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute,</b> SIPRI, found that Russia was the second biggest exporter of arms in 2010–14, increasing their exports by 37 per cent from the period 2005–2009. In 2010–14, Russia delivered weapons to 56 states and to rebel forces in eastern Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|These trades {{appear to}} be mostly small arms sales to {{middlemen}} arms dealers who in turn sell to both governments and rebels in Africa. The available evidence suggests these amounts are not major, especially compared to the U.S. supply of nearly 50% of the world's weapons, and that the direct leverage of the Peoples Liberation Army or the civilian ministries is modest in most African conflicts. The Stockholm International <b>Peace</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute</b> estimates China's 2000–2004 unpublished arms exports at about $1.4b, and US exports at about $25.9b. A 2005 UN arms destruction operation in Congo reported that 17% of them were Chinese made, while the remaining 83% came from other manufacturers. China also disagrees to sell weapons to unrecognized countries. According to Dr. Wilson, on the whole, arms sales have been the least significant factor relative to other instruments of China's statecraft.|$|E
