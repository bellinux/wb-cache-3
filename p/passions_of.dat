5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight years in office, with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so he lifts up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} the <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, {{the head of}} Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E
6000|$|I justify them in {{this view}} not only because I hate what is cheap and meretricious, and hold in {{peculiar}} loathing the cant of the critics who require [...] "passion" [...] as something in itself admirable and desirable in a novel, but because I prize fidelity in the historian of feeling and character. Most of these critics who demand [...] "passion" [...] {{would seem to have}} no conception <b>of</b> any <b>passion</b> but one. Yet there are several other passions: the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> grief, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> avarice, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> pity, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> ambition, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> hate, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> envy, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> devotion, the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> friendship; and all these have a greater part in the drama of life than the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> love, and infinitely greater than the <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> guilty love. Wittingly or unwittingly, English fiction and American fiction have recognized this truth, not fully, not in the measure it merits, but in greater degree than most other fiction.|$|R

The <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Perpetua therefore displays the signs of having been written as an adaptation and application of the Jewish apocalyptic texts to the specific challenges faced by the early North African Christian communities. 28 page(s...|$|R

25|$|In the Samantapasadika, {{a work of}} the 5th century CE Theravadin {{commentator}} and scholar Buddhaghosa's, paṇḍaka {{are described}} as being filled with defiling passions (ussanakilesa), unquenchable lusts (avapasantaparilaha) and are dominated by their libido (parilahavegabhibhuta). The 4th century mahayana Buddhist writers Vasubandhu and Asanga contend that the paṇḍaka has no discipline for spiritual practice, due to their defiling <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> {{both male and female}} sexes. They lack the moral fortitude to counter these passions because they lack modesty and shame. Incapable of showing restraint, such a being is abandoned by their parents and lacking such ties are unable to hold strong views. Asanga, like Vasubandhu, refuse the pandaka recognition as a layman on the grounds that such persons are unfit to associate with or serve the Sangha. Asanga, however, considers them capable to practice the path of a layman individually if they so desire, but without receiving recognition as a layman or being introduced in the sangha. A position similar to Asanga view was also featured in the Lotus Sutra, where sangha members were advised to avoid the paṇḍaka.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1559 the {{anonymous}} Beggars' Summons was {{posted on the}} doors of friaries, threatening friars with eviction {{on the grounds that}} their property belonged to the genuine poor. This was calculated to appeal to the <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> the populace of towns who appeared to have particular complaints against friars. Knox returned to Scotland and preached at the church of St. John the Baptist's at Perth on 11 May on Christ cleansing the temple. The congregation responded by stripping the shrines, images and altars of the church and then sacked the local friaries and Carthusian house. The regent responded by sending troops to restore order and Glencairn led a force to defend the town's new Protestant status. A royal delegation, including Argyll and James Stuart persuaded the burgh to open its gates, but the heavy handed treatment by the regent's forces led to a breakdown in negotiations. Argyll and Stuart changed sides and the Lords of the Congregation now began raising their followers for an armed conflict.|$|E
