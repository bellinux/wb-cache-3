5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as <b>phytophotodermatitis.</b> The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

50|$|When {{in contact}} with the skin, the Key lime can {{sometimes}} cause <b>phytophotodermatitis,</b> in which a chemical reaction makes the skin extra sensitive to ultraviolet light.|$|E
50|$|When {{human skin}} {{is exposed to}} {{ultraviolet}} light after contact with lime peel or juice, a reaction known as <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> can occur, which can cause darkening of the skin, swelling or blistering. Bartenders handling limes and other citrus fruits when preparing cocktails may develop <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> due to the high concentration of furocoumarins and other phototoxic coumarins in limes.The main coumarin in limes is limettin which has manifold higher content in peels than in pulp. Persian limes have a higher content of coumarins and potentially greater phototoxicity than do Key limes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytophotodermatitis</b> can be {{prevented}} by staying indoors after handling the above substances. However, the primary triggering mechanism is UV-A radiation (320-380 nm) which windows are not guaranteed to filter out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytophotodermatitis</b> {{can affect}} people of any age. Because of the bruise-like {{appearance}} {{that is usually}} {{in the shape of}} handprints or fingerprints, it can be mistaken in children for child abuse.|$|E
5000|$|Chervil {{has also}} been implicated in [...] "strimmer dermatitis", or <b>phytophotodermatitis,</b> due to spray from weed {{trimmers}} {{and other forms of}} contact. Other plants in the family Apiaceae can have similar effects.|$|E
5000|$|Photo {{dermatitis}} {{can also}} be caused by plants like the Dictamnus (commonly known as the [...] "Burning Bush") which is a genus of the flowering plant in the Rutaceae family. This is called <b>phytophotodermatitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sap {{of giant}} hogweed causes <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> in humans, {{resulting}} in blisters and long-lasting scars. These serious reactions {{are due to}} the furocoumarin derivatives in the leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and seeds of the plant.|$|E
50|$|A. majus {{contains}} {{large amounts}} of the chemicals furanocoumarin, xanthotoxin, and bergapten. The furanocoumarin can cause <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> and hyperpigmentation. In India, A. majus is cultivated for the furancoumarins which are used to treat vitiligo and psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|Ingestion of {{pigments}} {{capable of}} producing singlet oxygen with activation by light can produce severe photosensitivity of skin (see phototoxicity, photosensitivity in humans, photodermatitis, <b>phytophotodermatitis).</b> This is especially a concern in herbivorous animals (see Photosensitivity in animals).|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} in the family Apiaceae, {{subfamily}} Apioideae. Although it {{is in the}} same family as edible plants such as the carrot and herbs such as fennel and dill, it is not edible and touching it can cause severe blistering particularly if the irritant chemicals are exposed to sunlight (<b>phytophotodermatitis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Extra caution {{should be}} used when {{collecting}} D. carota because it bears a close resemblance to poison hemlock. In addition, {{the leaves of the}} wild carrot may cause <b>phytophotodermatitis,</b> so caution should also be used when handling the plant.

50|$|Many {{different}} topical {{and oral}} medications {{can be used}} to treat the inflammatory reaction of <b>phytophotodermatitis.</b> A dermatologist may also prescribe a bleaching cream to help treat the hyperpigmentation and return the skin pigmentation back to normal. If they do not receive treatment, the affected sites may develop permanent hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.|$|E
50|$|Many furanocoumarins are toxic and are {{produced}} by plants as a defense mechanism against various types of predators ranging from insects to mammals. This class of phytochemical {{is responsible for the}} <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> seen in exposure to the juices of the wild parsnip and the giant hogweed. There are also reports of these chemicals in the species Dictamnus albus.|$|E
50|$|The {{stems and}} leaves contain furocoumarins, {{chemicals}} {{responsible for the}} characteristic rash of erythematous vesicles (burn-like blisters) and subsequent hyperpigmentation that occurs after getting the clear sap onto one's skin. The chemical is photosensitive, with the rash occurring only after exposure to ultraviolet light. Because of this, <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> may occur after using a weed-eater to remove the plants on a sunny day.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} are equivalent to photodermatitis, but vary in severity.The skin condition is a cutaneous phototoxic inflammatory eruption resulting from contact with light-sensitizing botanical substances—particularly {{from the plant}} families Umbelliferae, Rutaceae, Moraceae, and Leguminosae—and ultraviolet light, typically from sun exposure. <b>Phytophotodermatitis</b> usually results in hyperpigmentation of the skin that often appears like a bruise. This may be accompanied by blisters or burning. The reaction typically begins within 24 hours of exposure and peaks at 48-72 hours after the exposure.|$|E
5000|$|The sap of {{the giant}} hogweed plant is phototoxic; when the {{contacted}} skin is exposed to sunlight or to ultraviolet rays, it can cause <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> (severe skin inflammations). Initially, the skin colours red and starts itching. Blisters form as it burns within 48 hours. They form black or purplish scars that can last several years. Hospitalisation may be necessary. Although many media reports on giant hogweed suggest the plant can lead to temporary or permanent blindness, existing research on the plant does not back up this claim.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phytophotodermatitis,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "lime disease" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with Lyme disease), [...] "Berloque dermatitis", or [...] "Margarita photodermatitis" [...] is a chemical reaction which makes skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light. It is frequently mistaken for hereditary conditions such as atopic dermatitis or chemical burns, but it is caused by contact with the photosensitizing compounds—such as furanocoumarins—found naturally in some plants and vegetables like parsnips, citrus fruits and more. Symptoms include burning, itching and large blisters that slowly accumulate over time.|$|E
5000|$|Heracleum mantegazzianum, giant hogweed, is {{a native}} of the Caucasus Mountains, grows to 4-5 m tall, and can cause severe <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> if the sap gets on human skin. The main {{mechanism}} for this dermatitis is extreme photosensitivity, causing severe sunburn on exposure to relatively small amounts of sunlight, with rash and blistering appearing within a few minutes: accordingly immediately covering sap-affected skin can prevent the dermatitis in many cases. It has become a serious invasive weed in many areas of Europe and North America, after being introduced as a garden plant.|$|E
5000|$|The skin {{response}} resembles {{an exaggerated}} sunburn. The involved chemical may {{enter into the}} skin by topical administration or it may reach the skin via systemic circulation following ingestion or parenteral administration. The chemical needs to be [...] "photoactive", which means that when it absorbs light, the absorbed energy produces molecular changes that cause toxicity. Many synthetic compounds, including drug substances like tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones, are known to cause these effects. Surface contact with some such chemicals causes photodermatitis; many plants cause <b>phytophotodermatitis.</b> Light-induced toxicity is a common phenomenon in humans; however, it also occurs in other animals.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. {{dermatitis}} bullosa pratensis (<b>phytophotodermatitis)</b> is {{an acute}} phototoxic reaction caused by photosensitizing substances present in {{different kinds of}} plants, activated by ultraviolet radiation exposure. An acute phototoxic reaction manifests as erythema, vesicles and even blisters with morphology of burns. Objective. We present a case report of <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> due to Heracleum sosnowskyi. Heracleum sosnowskyi was discovered in 1772 and described as a separate species in botanical literature in 1944 by I. P. Mandenova. Case report. In our case, skin lesions coexisted with erythema multiforme. Implemented therapy – corticosteroids, antihistamines and topical medications – was successful. After clinical resolution post-inflammatory hyperpigmentations were observed. Conclusions. Appropriate diagnosis of phytophototoxic reaction may constitute a challenge in everyday practice...|$|E
40|$|A 30 -year-old woman {{presented}} to the emergency department with a 2 -day history of painful blistering wounds over the dorsum of both hands. She reported her hands “began to peel ” 24 hours after she had sliced limes for a beach party; no other precipitating events (chemical or thermal trauma) were mentioned. QUESTIONS 1. What is the diagnosis? 2. What is the mechanism of injury? 3. How would you treat this patient? 4. What are the long-term sequelae of this injury? DISCUSSION A diagnosis of <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> was made. Tender erythematous patches studded with blisters were noted over the dorsum of both hands. <b>Phytophotodermatitis</b> is a nonimmunologic phototoxic cutaneous eruption resulting from contact with photosensitizing substances found in plants; furocoumarins (present in limes and other plants) are typically implicated and get activated following exposure to sun...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{epidermis}} in induced <b>phytophotodermatitis</b> using {{transmission electron microscopy}} in order to detect histologic changes even before lesions are visible by light microscopy. INTRODUCTION: In the first six hours after the experimental induction of <b>phytophotodermatitis,</b> no changes are detectable by light microscopy. Only after 24 hours can keratinocyte necrosis and epidermal vacuolization be detected histologically, and blisters form by 48 hours. METHODS: The dorsum of four adult rats (Rattus norvegicus) was manually epilated. After painting the right half of the rat with the peel juice of Tahiti lemon, they were exposed to sunlight for eight minutes under general anesthesia. The left side {{was used as the}} control and exposed to sunlight only. Biopsies were performed immediately after photoinduction and one and two hours later, and the tissue was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: No histological changes were seen on the control side. Immediately after induction, vacuolization in keratinocytes was observed. After one hour, desmosomal changes were also observed in addition to vacuolization. Keratin filaments were not attached to the desmosomal plaque. Free desmosomes and membrane ruptures were also seen. At two hours after induction, similar changes were found, and granular degeneration of keratin was also observed. DISCUSSION: The interaction of sunlight and psoralens generates a photoproduct that damages keratinocyte proteins, leading to keratinocyte necrosis and blister formation. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission electron microscopy can detect vacuolization, lesions of the membrane, and desmosomes in the first two hours after experimental induction of <b>phytophotodermatitis...</b>|$|E
