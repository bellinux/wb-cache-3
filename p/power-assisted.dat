5|$|The first <b>power-assisted</b> {{steering}} on {{any type}} of vehicle dates to 1876, but little is recorded of the system. Other {{attempts were made to}} add <b>power-assisted</b> steering to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical hydraulic power system was invented by Francis W. Davis. It was used on some armored vehicles and heavy trucks during World War II, but it took more than decades before the system was commercialized in passenger automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The Honda HPE60, an {{electric}} <b>power-assisted</b> wheelbarrow, {{was produced in}} 1998.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, eight provinces {{currently}} {{allow the}} operation of motorized bicycles using low-powered electric motors capable of a maximum speed of 32km/hour under the definition of <b>power-assisted</b> bicycles. The Province of Ontario introduced a three-year trial ending October 2009 for these bicycles, which are now officially defined as <b>Power-Assisted</b> Bicycles by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation with specific parameters.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of pushing}} or pulling the door {{triggers}} {{the open and}} close cycle. These are also known as <b>power-assisted</b> doors.|$|E
25|$|The SIBMAS {{was built}} with <b>power-assisted</b> steering, {{automatic}} transmission, and run-flat tyres. It {{could also be}} fitted with night vision sights, a {{nuclear biological and chemical}} (NBC) protection suite, an electrical air conditioning system, heater, and a winch.|$|E
25|$|RFB {{also built}} two {{examples}} of a higher-powered version, the RW 3C-90 Passat and on these and all other RW 3s, they offered optional wingtip extension panels which enabled the Multoplan to be flown as a <b>power-assisted</b> sailplane. The extensions increased the span from 34ft 9 ins to 50ft 6 in.|$|E
25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a <b>power-assisted</b> recirculating ball design.|$|E
25|$|While some of {{the initial}} batch of Sea Hawks would see {{operational}} service, many of the F1 aircraft would be mostly used for various service trials. Amongst these, WF143 would later be rebuilt as the prototype for the Sea Hawk F2, featuring <b>power-assisted</b> ailerons in place of their unpowered counterparts on the F1, to which flight trials had demonstrated a weakness in lateral control leading to instances of oscillation. On 24 February 1954, the first production Sea Hawk F2, WF240, conducted its maiden flight at Bitteswell. A total of 40 F2 aircraft would be produced.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin was {{reportedly}} easy to fly even on one engine. The flight controls were fully <b>power-assisted</b> and production aircraft adopted a hydraulic 'feel' {{system for the}} pilot. The Javelin featured an infinitely variable airbrake; the airbrake proved to be extremely responsive and effective, allowing pilots to conduct rapid descents and heavy braking manoeuvres, enabling equally rapid landings to be performed. The turnaround time between sorties was significantly shorter than with the preceding Gloster Meteor, due to improved ground accessibility and engine ignition sequence. Unlike the Meteor, the Javelin was fitted with ejector seats, at the introduction to service of the type.|$|E
25|$|July 1982 saw the {{introduction}} of the range topping Alfetta Quadrifoglio Oro (meaning Gold Cloverleaf, a trim designation already used on the Alfasud), which took the place of the discontinued 2000 L. The Quadrifoglio Oro was powered by a 128PS (DIN) version of the usual 1962cc engine, equipped with the SPICA mechanical fuel injection used on US-spec Alfettas; standard equipment included several digital and <b>power-assisted</b> accessories like a trip computer, check control panel and electrically adjustable seats. Visually the Quadrifoglio Oro was distinguished by twin round headlights, concave alloy wheels, and was only available in metallic grey or brown with brown interior plastics and specific beige velour upholstery.|$|E
500|$|Chrysler {{introduced}} the first commercially available passenger car power-steering {{system on the}} 1951 Chrysler Imperial, marketed {{under the name of}} Hydraguide. [...] The option was available for less than $200. General Motors followed suit the next year, offering it as an option for the 1952 Cadillac. Two years later, Cadillac was the first manufacturer to offer <b>power-assisted</b> steering as standard equipment.|$|E
500|$|By 1939, all {{the major}} car makers were using unassisted {{hydraulic}} brakes; Ford {{was the last to}} switch from cable-manipulated systems. [...] <b>Power-assisted</b> Vacuum servo brakes had been invented in 1903, but did not become generally available as an option until the 1950s. Self-adjusting brakes initially were offered on the 1957 Mercury and 1958 Edsel, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. Buick offered power brakes as standard equipment on several of its vehicles by the 1954 model year.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was later}} used by Napier & Son at Luton for {{trials of the}} firm's inflight de-icing systems. It was then briefly used for ground-training purposes beginning on 30 April 1952, until scrapped shortly afterwards. The second prototype {{was used by the}} Royal Navy Carrier Trials Unit at RNAS Ford, Sussex, until it was sold for scrap on 15 September. The third prototype conducted ASV Mk.XV radar trials, but was damaged in a heavy landing on 1 September 1949 and sold for scrap on 22 August 1950 as uneconomical to repair. The fourth prototype never flew and was used as a source of spares. The sole Heaton Chapel-built aircraft was the closest to the planned production configuration and it was used for engine-cooling and <b>power-assisted</b> flying-control trials, until it was [...] charge on 24 July 1951.|$|E
500|$|The same 12-cylinder engine {{as in the}} Tetrarch {{was fitted}} to the Mk VIII, {{although}} the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to [...] The armament remained {{the same as the}} Tetrarch's: one machine-gun and a 2 pounder [...] main gun. The tank also kept the unusual steering system used in the Tetrarch design; this steering and mechanical system accomplished turns by the lateral movement of road wheels, which bowed the tracks. When the driver turned the steering wheel all eight road wheels not only turned but also tilted in order to bend the tracks and make the tank turn; the idea was to reduce the mechanical strain and waste of power caused by the traditional system used to turn tanks by braking one track. Unlike the Tetrarch, the steering system of the Mk VIII was <b>power-assisted.</b>|$|E
500|$|Terai Engineering {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} J2X-C at the 500 km of Suzuka in April 1992, but the car was far from ready, and did not attend. The J2X-C was first tested on 9 July 1992, with Costas Los selected to drive it at Pembrey Circuit. He said of the car; [...] "the J2X felt very different to a regular Group C car... Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven, {{it was a lot}} more tuneable than I was accustomed to." [...] However, he did state that the car's lack of <b>power-assisted</b> steering was a problem. The team struggled to find a buyer for the car, as the Group C era was drawing to a close by 1992 and 1993; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs, and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with federal law, all <b>power-assisted</b> bicycles, regardless of province, must 1) have {{a maximum of}} three wheels; 2) have steering handlebars and pedals; 3) use an electric motor of 500W output or less for propulsion; 4) must not be capable of speeds faster than [...] on level ground using motor power alone; and 5) bear a permanently affixed label by the manufacturer stating in both official languages that the vehicle conforms to the federal definition of a <b>power-assisted</b> bicycle. <b>Power-assisted</b> bicycles are required to use electric motors only, {{and may not be}} operated on certain provincial controlled-access highways or where prohibited by municipal law. Age restrictions vary from province to province, but all require an approved helmet. Some versions (e.g., if capable of operating without pedaling) of e-bikes require a drivers license in some provinces and have age restrictions. Vehicle licenses and liability insurance are not required. E-bikes are required to follow the same traffic regulations as regular bicycles.|$|E
2500|$|The performance-upgrade [...] "Go Package" [...] {{provided}} {{the choice of}} a 360 or 401 4-barrel engine, and included [...] "Rally-Pac" [...] instruments, a handling package for the suspension, “Twin-Grip” limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling, <b>power-assisted</b> disc brakes, white-letter E60x15 Goodyear Polyglas tires on 15x7-inch styled slotted steel wheels) used on the Rebel Machine, a T-stripe hood decal, and a blacked-out rear taillight panel.|$|E
2500|$|Taihos {{original}} design specified installation of two catapults on her forward bow for <b>power-assisted</b> take-offs. However, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had not developed a workable catapult for carrier decks {{by the time}} of Taihos construction, these were eventually deleted from the requirements. The IJN instead opted to use rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) when necessary. This consisted of two solid-propellant (cordite) rockets attached to either side of a plane's fuselage. Generating [...] of thrust for three seconds, {{they were able to get}} an aircraft airborne in a much shorter distance than normally required.|$|E
2500|$|A {{motorized}} bicycle is {{a bicycle}} with an attached motor or engine [...] and transmission used either {{to power the}} vehicle unassisted, or to assist with pedalling. Since it always retains both pedals and a discrete connected drive for rider-powered propulsion, the motorized bicycle is in technical terms a true bicycle, albeit a <b>power-assisted</b> one. However, for purposes of governmental licensing and registration requirements, the type may be legally defined as a motor vehicle, motorcycle, moped, or a separate class of hybrid vehicle. Powered {{by a variety of}} engine types and designs, the motorized bicycle formed the prototype for what would later become the motorcycle.|$|E
2500|$|The Ridgeline has a four-wheel {{independent}} suspension with MacPherson struts {{in front and}} a multi-link trailing arm rear with upright springs and dampers. [...] It has a turning diameter of [...] using variable <b>power-assisted</b> rack-and-pinion steering. [...] It has four-wheel disc brakes with [...] ventilated front discs with floating twin piston calipers. [...] The rear brakes use [...] solid rear discs with floating single piston calipers and integrated emergency/parking brakes using a [...] "drum-in-hat" [...] design. [...] The disc brakes are controlled via a four-channel Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and Brake Assist. [...] Although [...] to 0 stopping distances of [...] to [...] have been reported, the average appears to be between [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|The car was {{introduced}} in September 1968. <b>Power-assisted</b> steering and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8L De Luxe and 4.2L models and air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2L. Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, {{in a series of}} television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as [...] "the finest Jaguar ever". An unusual feature, inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons, was the provision of twin fuel tanks, positioned {{on each side of the}} boot / trunk, and filled using two separately lockable filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear wheel arches. Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.|$|E
2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} taper leaf springs. The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with differential locks. Steering is <b>power-assisted,</b> {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) S-cam drum brakes are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A Run Flat mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses <b>power-assisted</b> four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Power-assisted</b> front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin driving lights remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|E

In 1992, the United States Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which mandated that beginning in 1994 common flush toilets use only [...] In response to the Act, manufacturers produced low-flow toilets, which many consumers did not like because they often required more than one flush to remove solids. People unhappy with the reduced performance of the low-flow toilets resorted to driving {{across the border to}} Canada or Mexico, or buying salvaged toilets from older buildings. Manufacturers responded to consumers' complaints by improving the toilets. The improved products are generally identified as high efficiency toilets or HETs. HETs possess an effective flush volume of [...] or less. HETs may be single-flush or dual-flush. A dual-flush toilet permits its user to choose between two amounts of water, depending on whether they generated solid or liquid waste. Some HETs are pressure-assisted (or <b>power-assisted</b> or pump-assisted or vacuum-assisted).|$|E
2500|$|T-55 (Ob'yekt 155) - Produced 1958–1963, in Poland 1958–1964, in Czechoslovakia from 1958 to 1983. It {{has a new}} turret with floor, PAZ nuclear-blast {{protection}} and over-pressure NBC system, gamma ray detector, improved V-55 engine developing [...] (the engine output was boosted by increasing both pressure of injected fuel and degree of compression) and <b>power-assisted</b> clutch, MC-1 internal oil filter, AK-150S compressor which allows pneumatic start of the engine (the electric starter was removed), new internal fuel tanks with a capacity of 300 l situated {{in the front of}} the hull (this increased the overall capacity of the internal fuel tanks to 680 l), ammunition load for the main gun was increased from 34 rounds to 43 (18 of which are stored in [...] "wet containers" [...] situated inside the hull fuel tanks), [...] "Rosa" [...] fire-protection system and TDA exhaust smoke generator. The engine compartment was equipped with a heating system. To compensate for the increase in mass caused by the new equipment the rear hull armour was thinned. The loader's DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun was removed. The T-55 also lacks a turret dome ventilator. Early units had flush loader's hatch. [...] "Starfish" [...] road wheels replaced earlier [...] "spider" [...] style. Also a snorkel can be placed on T-55 (unlike its predecessors) to allow it to cross 5.5 m depths at a speed of [...] (without preparation T-55 can cross 1.4 m depths).
