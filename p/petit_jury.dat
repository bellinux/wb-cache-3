Attorney Martin A. Martin (President of the Danville NAACP) developed information that both the grand jury that indicted Waller and <b>petit</b> <b>jury</b> that convicted him were composed only of white men who paid polled taxes (thus excluding most blacks and Waller's peers), although the county clerk initially gave him the runaround. The groups hoped that the case would lead the US Supreme Court to rule that the poll tax was unconstitutional. [...] In December, Virginia Governor James H.

Finally, it is the aim of this document to present this historical record of cases in such a manner as to allow the prediction of certain potential developments visible in the course of justice.

25|$|Besides <b>petit</b> <b>juries</b> for jury {{trials and}} grand juries for issuing indictments, juries are {{sometimes}} used in non-legal or quasi-legal contexts. Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad-hoc {{body in the}} executive branch of a government. Outside government, a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in competition, such as at a wine tasting, art exhibition, talent contest, or reality game show. These types of contests are juried competitions.|$|R
5000|$|After petitioners, who are Negroes, {{were convicted}} {{of murder in the}} Georgia courts, they filed a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts, attacking the {{composition}} of the grand and <b>petit</b> <b>juries</b> which indicted and convicted them.

2500|$|A grand jury, {{a type of}} jury now {{confined}} {{almost exclusively}} to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a criminal trial to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a prosecutor and issuing indictments, or by investigating alleged crimes and issuing [...] A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the <b>petit</b> <b>jury</b> used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings.

60|$|Which {{leads me}} {{to say a few}} words of the <b>petit</b> <b>jury,</b> not forgetting Mr. Walters. I am assured by an eminent lawyer, that the power and office of a <b>petit</b> <b>jury</b> is judicial, that they only are the judges from whose {{sentence}} the indicted are to expect life or death. Upon their integrity and understanding the lives of all that are brought in judgment do ultimately depend; from their verdict there lies no appeal, by finding guilty or not guilty. They do complicately resolve both law and fact. As it hath been the law, so it hath always been the custom and practice of these juries (except as before) upon all general issues, pleaded in cases civil as well as criminal, to judge both of the law and fact. So it is said in the report of the Lord Chief Justice Vaughan in Bushell's case, That these juries determine the law in all matters where issue is joined and tried, in the principal case whether the issue be about trespass or debt, or disseizin in assizes, or a tort or any such like, unless they should please to give a special verdict with an implicate faith in the judgment of the Court, to which none can oblige them against their wills.|$|E

50|$|The first Supreme Court {{decisions}} to reverse state criminal convictions for constitutional procedural reasons involved {{the exclusion of}} African-Americans for grand and <b>petit</b> <b>juries</b> - Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), Virginia v. Rives (1880), Neal v. Delaware (1881), Carter v. Texas (1900), Rogers v. Alabama (1904), and Norris v. Alabama (1935) - and the conviction African-American defendants for crimes involving white victims in the southern states: by a mob-dominated trial, as in Moore v. Dempsey (1923); and without counsel, as in Powell v. Alabama (1932).|$|R
50|$|However, the Fifth Amendment {{right to}} a grand jury {{indictment}} does not apply against the state governments because the grand jury provision has not been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the information has always been the dominant charging document in the western U.S. states, where extremely dispersed population distribution during the American frontier era made it difficult to select and convene <b>petit</b> <b>juries</b> to hold trials. In that era, convening even larger grand juries just to indict criminals was seen as an unnecessary extravagance.|$|R
25|$|In {{another such}} case, Clawson v. United States (1885), the Court held {{that there was}} no right to bail on appeal where a {{defendant}} had been sentenced to imprisonment (there was such a right where the only punishment was a fine). Reaching the merits that same year, the Court held that the Congressional statute permitting for-cause challenges of jurors who believed that polygamy was divinely compelled applied to grand juries as well as <b>petit</b> <b>juries,</b> and that the marshall could call a second venire if the 200-person venire was exhausted before a full jury was seated.|$|R
50|$|Once {{charges have}} been brought, the case is then brought before a <b>petit</b> <b>jury,</b> (or what is {{commonly}} recognized as the normal courtroom jury of six to twelve members), or is tried by a judge alone, if the defense requests it.

50|$|The {{majority}} {{opinion of the}} Court was delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark. Justice Clark states that the appeal is not whether the defendants were wrongfully convicted of murder but if the jury selection purposely excluded the admittance of African Americans from the grand and <b>petit</b> <b>juries.</b> The system of selecting jurors comes from the books of the county tax receiver but {{questions have been raised}} about if the system is rigged with notations that signify which males on the tax receiver’s list are African American. The court granted certiorari and found the circumstances surrounding the state were sufficient enough to support the claims of racial discrimination.|$|R
2500|$|Jones was {{the first}} lawyer in Arkansas to raise the {{question}} that African Americans had not been permitted {{to serve on the}} grand and <b>petit</b> <b>juries,</b> although many were qualified. He contended that this was discrimination on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude, and was prohibited by the US Constitution. [...] Jones raised this question before it was raised in the Carter case of Texas, which was afterwards appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. [...] The Supreme Court held that it was a discrimination on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. Many cases were dismissed in Texas in which indictments had been made without Negro persons being on the jury.|$|R
50|$|On January 23, 1967, in a nine to zero {{unanimous}} decision, the Supreme Court {{state the}} case of Whitus v. Georgia should be reversed and the law in question, being the 14th Amendment concerning equal protections, should be upheld and seen as constitutional. From the opinion of Justice Clark, the decision was overturned because {{the circumstances surrounding the}} case supported the claims of the petitioners. The claims were claims of discrimination which the Court had realized and therefore reversed the judgement. The Court of Appeals held that African Americans were purposely being excluded from the grand <b>juries</b> and the <b>petit</b> <b>juries.</b> The ruling to reverse the judgment and prove discrimination was based on the finding that 45% of the population was African American yet no African American had ever actually served on a jury.|$|R

50|$|In 1907-1910, Adams and Moorer {{served as}} the defence for Pink Franklin {{in a case that}} wen to the Supreme Court. Franklin killed a white constable who came to his house to arrest him.

Washington, Oswald Garrison Villard, Joel Elias Spingarn, Frances Blascoer, Bernard Hagood, and Claude Sawyer. Between 1906 and 1926, Moorer was in seven criminal and 14 civil cases before the South Carolina Supreme Court, winning one criminal and four civil appeals.
