25|$|On 31 August 2007, the Japanese Ministry of Defense {{revealed}} {{that they will}} procure four production airframes. The request in the FY2008 budget is 67.9 billion yen, or about US$566 million, the unit price for each aircraft at US$141.5 million. In 2013, the ministry ordered two units for ¥44.5 billion. These P-1s were reported to possess increased detection/discrimination capability, flight performance, information <b>processing</b> <b>capability,</b> and strike capabilities as a successor to the existing P-3C fixed-wing patrol aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a third branch of machine learning, distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn {{what to do in}} order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum <b>processing</b> <b>capability</b> of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations of these kinds of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} quasi-digital device was very {{successful}} from a practical point of view because of the low power consumption and compact size.

2500|$|Although both variable-depth sonar such as ESS-1 medium-frequency VDS (the Chinese {{development}} of French DUBV-43 VDS) and H/SJG-206 linear towed-array sonar were successfully tested on board, these were abandoned because incorporating these extra sonars {{would lead to}} significant redesign of the hull and increased cost. [...] While extra <b>processing</b> <b>capability</b> is reserved in the combat data system for the towed sonar and VDS when needed, {{it is highly unlikely}} that the towed sonar and VDS will be incorporated in the near future. [...] The high-frequency obstacle/mine-avoidance sonar once originally planned to equip this class failed to materialize due to the same financial concern of reducing the cost.|$|E

2500|$|The {{follow-on}} to META {{was named}} [...] "BETA", for [...] "Billion-channel Extraterrestrial Assay", and it commenced observation on October 30, 1995. The heart of BETA's <b>processing</b> <b>capability</b> consisted of 63 dedicated fast Fourier transform (FFT) engines, each capable of performing a 222-point complex FFTs in two seconds, and 21 general-purpose personal computers equipped with custom {{digital signal processing}} boards. This allowed BETA to receive 250 million simultaneous channels with a resolution of 0.5 hertz per channel. It scanned through the microwave spectrum from 1.400 to 1.720 gigahertz in eight hops, with two seconds of observation per hop. An important capability of the BETA search was rapid and automatic re-observation of candidate signals, achieved by observing the sky with two adjacent beams, one slightly {{to the east and}} the other slightly to the west. A successful candidate signal would first transit the east beam, and then the west beam and do so with a speed consistent with Earth's sidereal rotation rate. A third receiver observed the horizon to veto signals of obvious terrestrial origin. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged. This forced the BETA project to cease operation.|$|E

[...] The Ka-28 helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200nbsp&km from the host ship, but its onboard dipping sonar only has half {{the range of the}} Chinese copy of the French dipping sonar on board Z-9, furthermore, it lacks the <b>processing</b> <b>capability</b> to process the information gathered, so the information has to be passed back to the host ship for processing via data links, while in contrast, Z-9 can process information gathered on board the helicopter, but with shorter range.

2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually no leverage in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, feed mills, fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's business, accounting for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 percent over the next few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and service field, making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food <b>processing</b> <b>capability,</b> the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E
