40|$|Consider the {{following}} two seemingly unrelated questions.

It is often thought that Rousseau’s oppo-sition to factions can be interpreted in reference to the Condorcet Jury Theorem (e. g. Grofman and Feld 1988). The Condorcet Jury Theorem states that if voters {{are more likely to be}} right on some issue than not and cast their votes independently, then the chance that the majority is correct converges to one as the number of voters goes to infinity.

40|$|In {{this study}} in 437 women born in 1948 {{selected}} from five European towns {{we show that}} several anthropometric measurements are consistently and significantly associated with a metabolic risk profile in premenopausal women of 38 years of age. Among the circumferences, breast and waist circumference were, after adjustment for body mass index positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (negative associations), serum triglycerides, and serum insulin. The optimal level for measuring waist circumference was determined as being midway between the lower rib margin and the superior anterior iliac crest. Circumference ratios generally did show less consistent and similar or lower correlations with diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol and serum insulin. Waist/thigh circumference ratio showed the strongest <b>partial</b> <b>associations</b> with HDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides among all anthropometric variables studied.

40|$|Purpose This study {{examined}} bivariate, unique, and multivariate associations between psychopathy facets and other Personality Disorders (PDs). Method 76 incarcerated males were assessed with clinical interviews measuring psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) {{was used to}} examine multivariate associations between dimensional scores of psychopathy facets and other PDs. Results Preliminary analyses of bivariate and <b>partial</b> <b>associations</b> revealed that much of the covariation between psychopathy and PD traits reflected shared variance among psychopathy facets and among PD traits. After controlling for the shared variance, unique relationships were limited to positive relationships between Narcissistic PD and interpersonal facet and between Paranoid PD and antisocial facet ratings. Canonical Correlation Analysis yielded two pairs of functions that explained the shared variance between psychopathy and PDs. In the first pair of functions, elevations on the interpersonal and antisocial facets were associated with symptoms of Paranoid, Narcissistic, Histrionic, and Antisocial PDs. In the second pair of functions, high levels of the antisocial facet and low levels of the interpersonal facet were related to Borderline PD. Conclusion Results suggest that associations between psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs go beyond established links with Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs to include associations with Histrionic, Borderline, and Paranoid PDs.

The scatterplot matrix shows all painvise (bivariate marginal) views of a set of variables in a coherent display. One analog for categorical data is a matrix of mosaic displays showing some aspect of the bivariate relation between all pairs of variables. The sim-plest case shows the bivariate marginal relation for each pair of variables. Another case shows the conditional relation between each pair, with all other variables partialled out.

Impairments in these processes can lead to relationship difficulties; relationships are instrumental in the management and recovery from difficulties. Few studies have focused on emotional recognition in a PTSD population, this study aimed to expand on the current literature by looking at the associations between emotional recognition and interpersonal relationships. Twenty-seven individuals were recruited to participate, along with age and gender matched healthy controls. They completed two emotional recognition tasks (auditory and facial) and self-report questionnaires measuring views on interpersonal relationships and social support. Those with PTSD were found to have generalised impairments in facial recognition when compared to controls and specific impairments in auditory recognition. The emotions of fear, sadness and disgust were consistently recognised with less accuracy across tasks. No gender differences in accuracy on tasks were found in the PTSD group performance.

40|$|Awareness can be {{measured}} by investigating the patterns of associations between discrimination performance (first-order decisions) and confidence judgments (knowledge). In a typical post-decision wagering (PDW) task, participants judge their performance by wagering on each decision made in a detection task. If participants are aware, they wager advantageously by betting high whenever decisions are correct and low for incorrect decisions. Thus, PDW - like other awareness measures with confidence ratings - quantifies if the knowledge upon which they make their decisions is conscious. The present study proposes a new method of assessing the association between advantageous wagering and awareness in the PDW task {{with a combination of}} log-linear (LLM) modeling and neural network simulation to reveal the computational patterns that establish this association. We applied the post-decision wagering measure to a backward masking experiment in which participants made first-order decisions about whether or not a masked emotional face was present, and then used imaginary or real monetary stakes to judge the correctness of their initial decisions. The LLM analysis was then used to examine whether advantageous wagering was aware by testing a hypothesis of <b>partial</b> <b>associations</b> between metacognitive judgments and accuracy of first-order decisions. The LLM outcomes were submitted into a feed-forward neural network. The network served as a general approximator that was trained to learn relationships between input wagers and the output of the corresponding log-linear function. The simulation resulted in a simple network architecture that successfully accounted for wagering behavior. This was a feed-forward network unit consisting of one hidden neuron layer with four inputs and one output. In addition, the study indicated no effect of the monetary incentive cues on wagering strategies, although we observed that only low-wager input weights of the neural network considerably contributed to advantageous wagering...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} algorithmically recommending items to users on a Yahoo! front page module. Our approach {{is based on a}} novel multilevel hierarchical model that we refer to as a User Profile Model with Graphical Lasso (UPG). The UPG provides a personalized recommendation to users by simultaneously incorporating both user covariates and historical user interactions with items in a model based way. In fact, we build a per-item regression model based on a rich set of user covariates and estimate individual user affinity to items by introducing a latent random vector for each user. The vector random effects are assumed to be drawn from a prior with a precision matrix that measures residual <b>partial</b> <b>associations</b> among items. To ensure better estimates of a precision matrix in high-dimensions, the matrix elements are constrained through a Lasso penalty. Our model is fitted through a penalized-quasi likelihood procedure coupled with a scalable EM algorithm. We employ several computational strategies like multi-threading, conjugate gradients and heavily exploit problem structure to scale our computations in the E-step. For the M-step we take recourse to a scalable variant of the Graphical Lasso algorithm for covariance selection. Through extensive experiments on a new data set obtained from Yahoo! front page and a benchmark data set from a movie recommender application, we show that our UPG model significantly improves performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in the literature, especially those based on a bilinear random effects model (BIRE). In particular, we show that the gains of UPG are significant compared to BIRE when the number of users is large and the number of items to select from is small. For large item sets and relatively small user sets the results of UPG and BIRE are comparable. The UPG leads to faster model building and produces outputs which are interpretable.
