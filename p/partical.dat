In this paper, a kinetic model of clusters formed from laser ablation was suggested with considering different experimental conditions such as ablating laser power, backing pressure, expansion of the laser vaporized plasma, thermal radiation and etc., and numerical solution of the relevant kinetic equation was obtained. According to the calculation, about 8 x 10 (- 9) mole of <b>particals</b> can be produced from each laser pulse and their initial pressure is about 1. 9 x 10 (5) Pa. Mainly due to the diffusion of the <b>particals,</b> formation reaction of the clusters cannot succeed at 7. 85 mu s of the ablation laser pulse, but the yields of different cluster products reach their maxima at first 0. 4 mu s.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the wedge and seat ring of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning. This paper will share the need, requirement and application of lapping during the reconditioning of valve. This paper will explore the current working condition of lapping machine in valve industry. It will elaborate the effect of abrasive <b>particals,</b> working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters. What are the difficulties they are facing during the valve reconditioning related to lapping, will be disscussed.

40|$|By {{applying}} {{electromagnetic field}} {{to a system}} consisting of tungsten wires and grey cast iron melt, the grey cast iron matrix composite reinforced by either in-situ WC particles or the combination of in-situ WC particles and the residual tungsten wire was obtained. By means of differential thermal analysis (DTA), the pouring temperature of iron melt was determined at 1, 573 K. The microstructures of the composites were analyzed by using of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and pin-on-disc abrasive wear test. The obtained results indicated that, with the enhancing frequency of electromagnetic field, the amount of in-situ WC particles gradually increases, leading to continuous decrease of the residual tungsten wires. When the electromagnetic field frequency was up to 4 kHz, tungsten wires reacted completely with carbon atoms in grey cast iron melt, forming WC <b>particals.</b> The electromagnetic field appeared to accelerate the elemental diffusion in the melt, to help relatively quick formation {{of a series of}} small Fe-W-C ternary zones and to improve the kinetic condition of in-situ WC fabrication.

40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{low power}} and the {{chemical}} modifiction properties of organic gas-sensing material, the organic semiconductor material of molecule hybrid CuPc and PANI was used as gas-sensing film, and the gas sensor which has high selectivity to toxic gas was investigated. CuPc was synthesized with Phthalonitrile and p-Cresol as the source material of benzene ring by the template synthesis method of two steps reaction. Through doping with perchloric acid, vitriol and nitric acid, semiconducting doped PANI was obtained. By means of molecular hybrid modification, the intermediate substance of CuPc and PANI was polymerized and formed a kind of new organic semiconductor material CuPcxPANI 1 -x. Sensor chip was made by virtue of semiconductor technology; the combination of chip and new sensitive material was achieved by virtue of vacuum coating technology.

40|$|Increase in {{population}} growth and the associated activities have increased the nutrient input to the Lake Victoria through atmosphere and river discharge. Atmospheric input of nutrient is believed to exceed that of river discharge due to relatively higher contribution of water mass to the Lake from atmosphere. However, precipitation characteristics with respect to nutrients have not been well studied to allow qualification and quantification of atmospheric contribution to the Lake Victoria. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate influence of land use activities on spatial and temporal variation of nutrient inputs from atmosphere and to estimate atmospheric loading to the Lake Victoria. The results re vealed that there is significant spatial and temporal variation of nutrient deposition in the study area. High concentra tions of nutrients were observed during short rains starting from September to December. This was attributed to dissolu tion of nutrients from soil <b>particals</b> and ash residues due to biomass burning accumulated in the atmosphere during dry season of June to August. Spatial variation of nutrients reflects land use activities. Urban and peri-urban areas showed very high concentration of nitrate nitrogen due to industrial and vehicle emission while rural area showed high concen tration of phosphorous species and reduced forms of nitrogen species reflecting agricultural activities and animal keep ing. Generally, nutrient deposition load was higher in rural area compared to urban with respective values of 15. 5 and 13. 9 kg · ha ˉ 1 · y ˉ 1 for total nitrogen and 6. 1 and 2. 8 kg · ha ˉ 1 · y ˉ 1 for total phosphorous. These results suggest that in order to realize significant reduction of nutrient input to the Lake Victoria, measures should be taken to control agricultural activities through proper land use planning. The measure may be directed to reduce biomass burning, emission from industries and vehicle as well as animal residue. </p...|$|R

40|$|Resumo: O recente aumento mundial da infecção feminina pelo HIV suscitou a necessidade de novas linhas de estudo da transmissão do vírus onde vários fatores parecem interferir com a infectividade do agente. Particularmente na transmissão heterossexual, acredita-se que modificações do ecossistema, e conseqüentemente da flora vaginal, poderiam exercer papel preponderante. Para analisar as características clínicas e microbiológicas do conteúdo vaginal destas mulheres, desenvolveu-se, no CAISM, um estudo clínico analítico controlado com 75 mulheres soronegativas para o HIV, sob risco de tal infecção, e 77 mulheres HIV soropositivas. Avaliando-se o tipo de flora microbiana vaginal, a intensidade do processo inflamatório e a freqüência de infecções genitais, encontrou-se que mulheres com AIDS, apresentaram um maior percentual global de corrimento vaginal, de flora vaginal alterada, de processo inflamatório acentuado e de tricomoníase vaginal. Estudou-se também o grau de acerto do diagnóstico clínico do corrimento vaginal evidenciando-se um maior índice de acerto clínico dos corrimentos causados por Candida sp quanto pior o estádio clínico imunológico da paciente. Com estas observações, concluiu-se que o ecossistema vaginal de mulheres HIV soropositivas sem AIDS é muito semelhante ao observado em mulheres HIV soronegativas sob risco. Por outro lado, ambos apresentaram diferenças significativas do ecossistema vaginal quando comparadas às mulheres com AIDS. Isso leva a crer que as modificações da flora microbiana vaginal de mulheres imunossuprimidas, usuárias de antimicrobianos, poderiam facilitar a transmissibilidade heterossexual do HIV uma vez que o processo inflamatório carreia para esta região um maior aporte de células alvo da infecção pelo HIV e conseqüentemente maior quantidade de partículas virais. Além disso, o baixo índice de acerto no diagnóstico clínico sugere também que não se façam tratamentos antimicrobianos indiscriminados de vulvovaginites diagnosticadas apenas clinicamente, pois o mesmo poderia agravar tal situação;;Abstract:The recent {{worldwide}} {{increase of}} HIV infection among women {{has given rise}} to the necessity of new researches into the transmission of the virus where various factors seem to interfere with the infectiousness of the agent. Especially in heterosexual transmission, it is believed that modifications in the ecosystem and, consequently, in vaginal flora could exercise a preponderant role to be able to analyse the clinical and microbiological characteristics of vaginal content among these women, a clinically controlled analytical study of 75 righ risk HIV seronegative women and 77 HIV seropositive women was carried out at the CAISM. By evaluating the type of vaginal flora, the intensity of the inflammatory process and the frequency of genital infections women with AIDS where observed to present a greater overall percentage of vaginal discharge, altered vaginal flora, acute inflammation and vaginal trichomoniasis. Also, the level of correction in the clinical diagnosis of vaginal discharge was studied and a greater degree of clinically correct diagnosis of candidiasis was observed as the patient's clinical immunological state worsened. These observations led {{to the conclusion that the}} vaginal ecosystem of HIV seropositive women without AIDS is very similar to that observed in high risk HIV seronegative women On the other hand both presented significant differences in the vaginal ecosystem when compared to women with AIDS. This leads to the belief that modifications of vaginal microbian flora in immune-suppressed women, who use antimicrobials, could facilitate the heterosexual transmission of HIV, as the inflammatory process carries a great amount of target cells for HIV infection therefore a greater number of virus <b>particals.</b> Apart from this, the difficulties of correct clinical diagnosis suggest that indiscriminate antimicrobial treatments of vulvovaginitis, only clinically diagnosed, should also not be applied, since this could aggravate such a situatio...|$|R

Mobile dislocations in the specimen surface were employed more homogeneous plastic deformation there and resulted in higher resistance against crack generation, since strain incompatibility at grain boundaries due to heterogeneous planer slip causes local stress concentration. Electron backscatter diffraction analyses made clear fatigue damage structures such as plastic deformation in the surface layer, crystal rotation in grains and localied deformation bands in large grains.
