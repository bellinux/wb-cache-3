25|$|The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States {{copyright}} law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as {{digital rights management}} or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, {{whether or not there}} is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.|$|E
25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 Lockhart Commission {{recommended}} eliminating all {{criminal penalties}} for pornography except for pornographic depictions of minors, or sale of pornography to minors. However, prior to 1977, only two states had laws which prohibited {{the use of}} children in the production or distribution of pornographic materials or performances. In 1977, the Department of Justice strongly endorsed legislation which banned the <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of child pornography. These efforts have been unsuccessfully challenged in the 1982 New York v. Ferber case ("The States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children..."). Although the states have a different age of consent, in accordance with the Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law all models featured in pornographic content should be at least 18 years of age. This kind of material is often labeled as [...] "adult" [...] and the appropriate disclaimers are common. They are based on what [...] "depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs".|$|E
2500|$|The focus {{areas for}} global warming {{politics}} are Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology and Losses which are well quantified and studied but {{the urgency of}} the global warming challenge combined with the implication to almost every facet of a nation-state's economic interests places significant burdens on the established largely-voluntary global institutions that have developed over the last century; institutions that have been unable to effectively reshape themselves and move fast enough to deal with this unique challenge. [...] Rapidly developing countries who see traditional energy sources as a means to fuel their development, well funded aggressive environmental lobbying groups and an established fossil fuel energy paradigm boasting a mature and sophisticated political lobbying infrastructure all combine to make global warming politics extremely polarized. [...] Distrust between developed and developing countries at most international conferences that seek to address the topic add to the challenges. [...] Further adding to the complexity is the advent of the Internet and the development of media technologies like blogs and other mechanisms for disseminating information that enable the exponential growth in <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of competing points of view which make it nearly impossible for the development and dissemination of an objective view into the enormity of the subject matter and its politics.|$|E
2500|$|A draft law [...] "On Amendments to the Criminal and the Procedural Criminal Codes of Ukraine" [...] was {{submitted}} by President Viktor Yushchenko for consideration by the Ukrainian Parliament. [...] The draft law envisaged prosecution for public {{denial of the}} Holodomor Famine of 19321933 in Ukraine as a fact of genocide of the Ukrainian people, and of the Holocaust as the fact of genocide of the Jewish people. The draft law foresaw that public denial as well as <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of materials denying the above shall be punished by a fine of 100 to 300 untaxed minimum salaries, or imprisonment of up to two years. The draft law, however, failed to receive support from incoming President Viktor Yanukovych, who, following his inauguration in 2010, declared: [...] "it would be wrong and unfair to recognize the Holodomor {{as an act of}} genocide against one nation"this among a number of actions seen as his pursuing a more Russocentric policy. However, in 2011 he stated: [...] "Terrible years of totalitarianism have been a spiritual catastrophe: numerous churches were demolished, hundreds of thousands of peasants, workers, and intellectuals were physically eliminated or sent to the Gulag camps, almost every Ukrainian family suffered," [...] and in 2012 affirmed: [...] "This crime has changed the history of Ukrainian people forever.
