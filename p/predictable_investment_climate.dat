50|$|The UN Charter promotes, inter alia, {{the goal}} of {{economic}} and social progress. The UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The “Monterrey Consensus” of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and <b>predictable</b> <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development, which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} promote a more {{balanced}} trade relationship, China will continue {{to take steps to}} expand domestic consumption and imports in accordance with the 12th Five-Year Plan; and the United States will increase domestic savings and exports, including through the National Export Initiative. China takes promotion of employment as the priority objective for economic development, and strives to achieve full employment. China strives to raise the proportion of residents’ income in gross national income, increase the proportion of wages in the primary income distribution, and realize the increase of people’s income in line with economic development and the increase of workers’ pay in line with gains in labor productivity. China’s minimum wage has steadily increased in recent years {{and will continue to do}} so in the future. China will raise the ratio of services value-added to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by four percentage points over the next five years, with measures to develop the services sector including expanding areas open to foreign involvement, encouraging and guiding a variety of categories of capital into the services sector, and actively developing services enterprises with diversified forms of ownership. The U.S. economy is rebalancing toward sustainable growth, emphasizing higher domestic savings, a commitment to improving long-term fiscal sustainability and productivity-enhancing investments. The personal savings rate was 5.8 percent in 2010, which is the highest rate since 1993 and well above the 2.7 percent average between 2000 and 2007. Thus, much of the transition on the private side to higher saving has already taken place. To increase public saving, the President’s Budget freezes discretionary spending for five years, freezes government salaries for two years, and brings the deficit to three percent of GDP by the second half of this decade - a path consistent with the Administration’s commitments to cut the deficit in half by 2013, and to stabilize or reduce the national debt as a share of the economy. To lay the foundation for future growth, including through greater U.S. exports, the United States will increase and improve investment in innovation, infrastructure, and education. …… The two countries reiterate their support for the G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, and reaffirm their commitments to improve the living standards of our citizens through strong economic and jobs growth, and use the full range of policies required to strengthen the global recovery and to reduce excessive external imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels. The two sides support a bigger role for the G-20 in international economic and financial affairs, and pledge to strengthen communication and coordination to follow through on the commitments of the G-20 summits and push for positive outcomes at the Cannes summit in November. …… II. Strengthening Financial Systems and Improving Financial Supervision [...] The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on financial sector investment and regulation, in order to enhance global regulation, establish stronger international coordination to prevent future crises, and ensure a level playing field. Recognizing the positive contributions that financial institutions from each country can play, the two sides pledged to support open environments for investment in financial services and cross-border portfolio investment, consistent with prudential and national security requirements. The United States and China commit to further promote and strengthen financial sector reform.Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the United States is implementing comprehensive financial reform that better serves households, workers, entrepreneurs, and businesses by reducing systemic risk, raising prudential standards, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivatives, ending the problem of “too big to fail” financial institutions, creating a Federal Insurance Office, and ensuring robust consumer financial protection. China will continue to deepen the reform of its financial system, which has supported the process of transforming its economic development model, developing a financial system that consists of diverse institutions, provides efficient service, controls risks, and encourages financial innovation. China will increase the use of direct financing channels, including stocks, bonds and private equity, to better satisfy the diverse demands in its economy for investment capital and financing. In accordance with the medium- and long-term development perspectives, China will push forward the market-based reform of interest rates. …… The United States and China committed to further strengthen their respective financial systems against money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism financing, and WMD proliferation financing activities. China will continue to develop and strengthen its regulatory framework for freezing terrorist assets. The two countries will continue to enhance both policy and operational cooperation on combating illicit finance. The two countries will also continue to work collaboratively in the freezing, seizing, and forfeiture of criminal proceeds. Both countries seek to rely on bilateral mutual legal assistance to implement forfeiture orders, and seek to avoid unilateral enforcement action of forfeiture orders to the extent possible. III. Enhancing Trade and Investment Cooperation [...] The two countries, recognizing the importance of open trade and investment in fostering economic growth, job creation, innovation, and prosperity, re-affirmed their commitment to take further steps to liberalize global trade and investment, and to oppose all forms of trade and investment protectionism. The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work proactively to resolve bilateral trade and investment disputes in a constructive, cooperative, and mutually beneficial manner. China will take stock of the results of the Special Campaign against IPR Infringement and Fake and Shoddy Products (Special Campaign), and improve on the high-level, long-term mechanism of IPR protection and enforcement, building on the Special Campaign currently in place. China will strengthen the government inspection mechanism so as to make sure that the software being used by the government agencies at all levels is legitimate. China and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the JCCT IPR Working Group on software legalization. …… China and the United States reaffirm their prior SED outcomes on transparency. The United States welcomes China’s statement that it will issue a measure in 2011, to implement the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the SCLAO website for a public comment period of not less than 30 days from the date of publication, except as specified in China’s Protocol of Accession to the WTO or in public emergency situations. China will steadily increase its solicitation of public opinions on regulatory documents with a direct influence on the rights and obligations of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations. China welcomes the United States’ commitment to implement measures in 2011, to enhance regulatory transparency, including by taking steps to ensure the online publication of the text of proposed regulations, as well as supporting technical and scientific information, at www.Regulations.gov for a public comment period of 60 days, and the United States’ decision to strengthen the Office of Management and Budget’s participation in the ongoing Transparency Dialogue. …… The United States and China agree on the importance of fostering an open, transparent and <b>predictable</b> <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> The United States and China affirm that the enforcement policies of their national competition agencies are not to discriminate on the basis of nationality. …… ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we first analyze {{theoretically}} how the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> {{can affect the}} impact of corporate taxation on investment in a simple tax competition model where the corporate tax revenues are used to improve the <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> We find that an improvement of the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> increases the sensitivity of capital to the tax rate if the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is very {{effective at enhancing the}} productivity of capital or if the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> enhances the productivity of capital much more when the initial <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is unattractive than when the initial <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is already attractive. As a result, the model calls for the estimation of an investment equation where the tax variable is moderated by an <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variable. We estimate such an investment equation using a unique panel dataset of effective corporate tax rates of 80 countries, including countries with an unattractive and countries with an attractive <b>investment</b> <b>climate,</b> for the period 2005 - 2008. We find two important results. First, a better <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> increases the sensitivity of FDI to the tax rate. Second, in the worst <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> countries, FDI reacts not negatively to a rise in the tax rate. These results have important policy implications.

Key factors affecting the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> through their impact on costs are: corruption, taxes, the regulatory burden and extent of red tape in general, factor markets (labor, intermediate materials and capital), the quality of infrastructure, technological and innovation support, and the availability and cost of finance.

40|$|Drawing on the World Bank <b>Investment</b> <b>Climate</b> Assessment surveys, {{this paper}} investigates the {{relationship}} between firm-level technical efficiency and the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> for 22 developing economies and eight manufacturing industries. The authors first propose three measures of firms'productive performance: labor productivity, total factor productivity, and technical efficiency. They show that, on average, enterprises in the Middle East and North Africa have performed poorly compared with {{other countries in the}} sample. The exception is Morocco, whose various measures of firm-level productivity rank close to the ones of the most productive economies. The analysis also reveals that the competitiveness of countries in the region has been handicapped by high unit labor cost, compared with main competitors like China and India. The empirical results show then? that the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> matters for firms'productive performance. This is true (depending on the industry) for the quality of various infrastructure, the experience and education level of the labor force, the cost of and access to financing, as well as different dimensions of the government-business relation. The analysis reveals that some industries, more exposed to international competition, are more sensitive to <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> deficiencies. For some industries, this is also true for small and medium domestic enterprises that do not have the possibility to influence their <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> or choose their location. These findings bear clear policy implications by showing that increasing firms'size and improving the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> (in particular of small and medium firms and industries more exposed to international competition) could constitute a powerful means of industrial development and competitiveness, in the Middle East and North Africa region in particular.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} are increasingly concerned about improving country competitiveness and productivity, as {{they face the}} increasing pressures of globalization and attempt to improve economic growth and reduce poverty. Among such countries, <b>Investment</b> <b>Climate</b> Assessments (ICA) surveys at the firm level, have become the standard way for the World Bank to identify key obstacles to country competitiveness, in order to prioritize policy reforms for enhancing competitiveness. Given the surveys objectives and the nature and limitations of the data collected, this paper discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using different productivity measures. The main objective is to develop a methodology to estimate, in a consistent manner, the productivity impact of the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variables. The paper applies it to the data collected for ICAs in four countries: Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Observations on logarithms (logs) of the variables are pooled across three countries (Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Endogeneity of the production function inputs and of the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variables is addressed by using a variant of the control function approach, based on individual firm information, and by aggregating <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variables by industry and region. It is shown that it is possible to get robust results for 10 different productivity measures. The estimates for the four countries show how relevant the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variables are to explain the average level of productivity. IC variables in several categories (red tape, corruption and crime, infrastructure and, quality and innovation) account for over 30 percent of average productivity. The policy implications are clear: <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> matters and the relative impact of the various <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variables indicate where reform efforts should be directed in each country. It is argued that this methodology can be used as a benchmark to assess productivity effects in other ICA surveys. This is important because ICA surveys are available now for more than 65 developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Philippines' <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> in its many dimensions, relating these {{to the performance}} of the economy at the national, regional, and provincial levels. The central thesis is that the economy's slow growth {{over the past two decades}} or more can be attributed in large measure to its poor <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> that constricted capital formation and hampered the productivity improvements and competitiveness of firms; by extension, the differential development of regional and provincial economies can be explained by, among other factors, differences in their <b>investment</b> <b>climates.</b> From a cross-country comparative perspective, the Philippines appears to rate quite poorly in terms of a number of <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> dimensions, including entry and exit of firms, regulatory burden and corruption, and infrastructure. These macro-level observations are largely corroborated by the results of more rigorous analysis of micro (firm-level) and provincial and regional data.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a policy {{review of the role}} of <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> in post-conflict situations. It {{summarizes}} the broad range of ways in which conflict negatively affects the <b>investment</b> <b>climate,</b> from macroeconomic instability to a degraded regulatory framework. It stresses that attention needs to be paid to the broader"enabling environment,"including institutions, governance, capacity, and social capital. It suggests that a vibrant private sector underpinned by a good <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is particularly important in the post-conflict recovery phase for three reasons: it generates employment, provides public services where the state has retrenched, and builds social capital. By addressing these important"greed and grievance"factors, the private sector helps reduce the likelihood of a return to conflict. The paper concludes by distilling key lessons relating to the management of the post-conflict reform process. Despite the importance of a good <b>investment</b> <b>climate,</b> greater effort is needed to ensure that private sector development reforms are included {{in the first round of}} post-conflict policymaking. Local ownership of reforms and enhanced local capacity to implement them is key to sustainable improvements in the <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> Development partners have an important role to play in facilitating dialogue and promoting partnerships between public and private sector stakeholders. At the same time, development partners need to ensure that their presence in fragile post-conflict economies does not damage the very sector they are trying to support.
