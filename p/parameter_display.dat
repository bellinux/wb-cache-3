40|$|This study {{identifies}} improved {{methods to}} present system parameter information for detecting abnormal conditions {{and to identify}} system status. Two workstation experiments were conducted. The first experiment determined if including expected-value-range information in traditional <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> formats affected subject performance. The second experiment determined if using a nontraditional <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> format, which presented relative deviation from expected value, was better than traditional formats with expected-value ranges included. The inclusion of expected-value-range information onto traditional parameter formats {{was found to have}} essentially no effect. However, subjective results indicated support for including this information. The nontraditional column deviation <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> format resulted in significantly fewer errors compared with traditional formats with expected-value-ranges included. In addition, error rates for the column deviation <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> format remained stable as the scenario complexity increased, whereas error rates for the traditional <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> formats with expected-value ranges increased. Subjective results also indicated that the subjects preferred this new format and thought that their performance was better with it. The column deviation <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> format is recommended for display applications that require rapid recognition of out-of-tolerance conditions, especially for a large number of parameters...|$|E

The onboard data system (ODS) and the ground data system (GDS) were utilized. The air-to-ground link was simulated by a hardwired computer-to-computer interface. A patch board system was used on board to select experiment inputs, and the downlink configuration from the ODS was changed by a crew keyboard entry to support each experiment. The ODS provided a CRT display of experiment parameters to enable the crew to monitor experiment performance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{backup power}} plays an {{important}} emergency supply role in industrial field and agricultural field. The emergency supply power (such as generator and Uninterrupted Power System etc.) is a standby state {{in most of the}} time. These devices only start to ensure electricity supply on the condition of power lose or power failure. It is difficult for users to know its real load performance. This paper designed a kind of intelligent AC (Alternating current) load test system based on PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to solve the problem. There are signal acquisition part ， the dummy load component and <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> control part in testing load testing system, which can meet the general users of emergency power supply in daily inspection.

40|$|The {{approach}} to instrument surveillance and calibration verification (ISCV) through plant wide monitoring proposed {{in this paper}} is an autoassociative neural network (AANN) which will utilize digitized data presently available in the Safety <b>Parameter</b> <b>Display</b> computer system from Florida Power Corporations Crystal River # 3 nuclear power plant. An autoassociative neural network {{is one in which}} the outputs are trained to emulate the inputs over an appropriate dynamic range. The relationships between the different variables are embedded in the weights by the training process. As a result, the output can be a correct version of an input pattern that has been distorted by noise, missing data, or non-linearities. Plant variables that have some degree of coherence with each other constitute the inputs to the network. Once the network has been trained with normal operational data it has been shown to successfully monitor the selected plant variables to detect sensor drift or failure by simply c [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of the quantum Ising chain following a zero-temperature quench of the transverse field strength. Focusing on the behavior of two-point spin correlation functions, we show that the correlators of the order <b>parameter</b> <b>display</b> an effective asymptotic thermal behavior, i. e., they decay exponentially to zero, with a phase coherence rate and a correlation length dictated by the equilibrium law with an effective temperature set by the energy of the initial state. On the contrary, the two-point correlation functions of the transverse magnetization or the density-of-kinks operator decay as a power-law and do not exhibit thermal behavior. We argue that the different behavior is linked to the locality of the corresponding operator with respect to the quasi-particles of the model: non-local operators, such as the order parameter, behave thermally, while local ones do not. We study which features of the two-point correlators are a consequence of the integrability of the model by analizing their robustness with respect to a sufficiently strong integrability-breaking term.
