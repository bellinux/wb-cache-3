500|$|The {{glass cockpit}} {{is covered by}} a transparent, acrylic canopy that {{provides}} the pilot with a good, all-round field of view. A centre stick is used for pitch and roll control while rudder pedals control yaw. A throttle is located {{to the left of}} the pilot. The cockpit incorporates hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a Martin-Baker Mk-16LE zero-zero ejection seat. The cockpit incorporates an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and a wide-angle, holographic head-up display (HUD), which has a minimum total field of view of 25 degrees. The EFIS comprises three colour multi-function displays, providing basic flight information, tactical information, and information on the engine, fuel, electrical, hydraulics, flight control, and environment control systems. The HUD and MFD can be configured to show any available information. Each MFD is [...] and [...] tall and is arranged side-by-side in <b>portrait</b> <b>orientation.</b> The central MFD is placed lowest to accommodate a control panel between it and the HUD.|$|E
500|$|As {{with all}} {{previous}} generations of iPhone and iPad hardware, {{there are four}} buttons and one switch on the fourth-generation iPad. [...] With the device in its <b>portrait</b> <b>orientation,</b> these are: a [...] "home" [...] button {{on the face of}} the device under the display that returns the user to the home screen, a wake/sleep button on the top edge of the device, and two buttons on the upper right side of the device performing volume up/down functions, under which is a switch whose function varies according to device settings, generally functioning either to switch the device into or out of silent mode or to lock/unlock the orientation of the screen. Externally, the fourth-generation iPad is identical to its predecessor apart from the differences between dock connectors used and change of manufacturers that produce the display. In addition, the Wi-Fi only version weighs 652 grams while the cellular model weighs 662 grams– 2 grams heavier than their respective predecessors. The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.|$|E

50|$|These {{effects are}} also seen when {{investigating}} the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek {{is found in}} the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other <b>portrait</b> <b>orientations.</b> Theories for this preference suggest that {{the left side of the}} face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better. Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images. Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the first}} time in 1996, the Bundesliga was given its own logo to {{distinguish}} itself. Six years later, the logo was revamped into a <b>portrait</b> <b>orientation,</b> which was used until 2010. A new logo was announced for the 2010–11 season in order to modernise the brand logo for all media platforms. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Bundesliga, a special logo was developed for the 2012–13 season, featuring a [...] "50" [...] and [...] "1963–2013". Following the season, the 2010 logo was restored. In December 2016, it was announced that a new logo would be used for the 2017–18 season, modified slightly for digitisation requirements, featuring a matte look.|$|E
2500|$|The 1917–20 {{series was}} {{perforated}} 11 and included all the denominations {{found in the}} two preceding series, but added three new Franklin-heads of 13-cents, 2 and 5-dollars. The two higher denominations appeared late in this issue as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was busy replacing worn printing plates and dealing with various experiments and innovations that delayed production of the 2 & 5 dollar plates. Perhaps to identify these stamps as luxury items, they were printed in two tones, with the vignette head in black and the frame in color. They were further distinguished from lower values by their use of landscape format rather than the normal <b>portrait</b> <b>orientation.</b> Because the 2 & 5 dollar Franklin-head stamps were the two largest denominations they are often referred to by collectors as the 'Big Bens'. The 2-dollar Franklin {{was intended to be}} printed in carmine-red and black, but somehow the color of the printing ink from the particular lot that was used turned out to have a distinct orange tone. [...] in printing ink is somewhat common in stamp production, but the variance in this case ventured into a different color completely—orange. By the time this acute color variance was {{brought to the attention of}} officials a good number of sheets had already been distributed among the various post offices and were most likely already in circulation. In 1920 a second printing of the 2-dollar Franklin was issued, this time with the colors that were originally intended, carmine-red and black. These were printed and remained in use for some 3 to 4 years and therefore quantities of the red and black variety out number the orange and black approximately 15 to 1. Quantities issued are, for 2-dollar orange and black, 47,700 (470 sheets of 100), and 2-dollar carmine-red and black, 743,600 (7,436 sheets of 100).|$|E

50|$|<b>Portrait</b> screen <b>orientation</b> is {{also used}} for {{computer}} displays, though less commonly than landscape, and {{is the most popular}} orientation for mobile devices. Portrait is preferred for editing page-layout work, in order to view the entire page on the screen at once without wasted space along the sides, and for script-writing, legal work (in drafting contracts etc.), and other applications where it is useful to see a maximum number of lines of text. It is also common in public information displays.|$|R

50|$|Accelerometers measure linear {{acceleration}} and tilt angle. Single and multi-axis accelerometers detect the combined magnitude {{and direction of}} linear, rotational and gravitational acceleration. They {{can be used to}} provide limited motion sensing functionality. For example, a device with an accelerometer can detect rotation from vertical to horizontal state in a fixed location. As a result, accelerometers are primarily used for simple motion sensing applications in consumer devices such as changing the screen of a mobile device from <b>portrait</b> to landscape <b>orientation.</b> The early generation Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii incorporated accelerometers.|$|R
50|$|Another {{product was}} the Pivot Display: a full-page display that rotated between {{landscape}} and <b>portrait</b> <b>orientation</b> with real-time remapping of the menus, mouse and screen drawing. The award-winning product design was by Terry Oyama, former ID lead at Apple Computer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Portrait</b> <b>orientation</b> {{is still}} used {{occasionally}} within some arcade and home titles (either giving {{the option of}} using black bars or rotating the display), primarily in the vertical shoot 'em up genre due to considerations of aesthetics, tradition and gameplay.|$|E

50|$|In most versions, {{there are}} no time {{constraints}} during the game. However, some implementations gradually push the rows upward or drop blocks from above. Sometimes the player can control the number and timing of blocks that drop from above in certain ways. For example, on some implementations for the iOS, {{this can be done}} by shaking the device. The game ends if a timer runs out or if no more blocks can be removed. Some versions, including some versions for Windows Mobile, include both <b>portrait</b> and landscape <b>orientations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Office 2010 {{introduces}} {{improvements to}} the image crop process in Excel, Outook, PowerPoint, Word. The crop selection rectangle now grays out the portions of an image to be removed during a crop process and displays the result area in color, instead of completely removing all portions of an image outside of the selection rectangle from view as in previous versions of Office; images can now be repositioned underneath the selection rectangle while it is active. A new Aspect Ratio option under the Crop command on the ribbon presents a drop-drop down menu with options for both landscape and <b>portrait</b> page <b>orientations</b> to customize the aspect ratio of the selection rectangle before users crop an image, which automatically resizes the selection rectangle when users start the crop process; users can manually resize the selection rectangle and simultaneously preserve its aspect ratio by resizing it from its corners while pressing the [...] key.
