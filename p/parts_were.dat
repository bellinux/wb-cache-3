5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral <b>parts</b> <b>were</b> reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
