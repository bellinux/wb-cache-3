It is a Holarctic species, the distribution area includes the United States and Canada.The wingspan is 27-30 mm. The length of the forewings is 13-16 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is deep yellow. There is a purple, variable in width median fascia extending from the costa. Antemedian and post median lines are reduced to purple dots.
