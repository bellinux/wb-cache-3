5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues {{the benefits of}} allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material during the Han dynasty; {{it was used to}} build palace halls, multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses. Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles. The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.|$|E
50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If <b>the</b> assassin is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R

Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope cannot leave due to her glitch. When Calhoun <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Cy-Bugs can be destroyed by a beacon of light as per Hero's Duty, Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt to replicate it. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with a Cy-Bug that devoured him, and Turbo carries him away. Ralph breaks free, hits the mountain, and causes it to erupt, but Vanellope saves him using her glitch. The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it has}} hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E
5|$|Greg Retallack's {{hypothesis}} that Ediacaran organisms were lichens is not widely {{accepted by the}} scientific community. He argues that the fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish, and their relief is closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders. He <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction, and claims the large size of the organisms (up to 1.5 metres long, far larger {{than any of the}} preserved burrows) also hints against classification with animals. Finally, Ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols, interpreted as soils of well-drained temperate desert soils. Such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi, but other Ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies.|$|E

5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy {{in the eyes}} of many, and contributed to the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fact that both rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fact that the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of}} a horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E
