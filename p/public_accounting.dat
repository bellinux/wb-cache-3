Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision.

25|$|On January 30, 1939, the Committee on Auditing Procedure {{was formed}} by the AICPA to evaluate, discuss, and issue {{guidance}} exclusively on auditing-related matters. This Committee is considered the antecessor of the Auditing Standards Board, {{and was the first}} to issue Statements on auditing standards and principles to the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> community. In 1941 it issued a pamphlet titled Statements on Auditing Procedure, which discussed the auditor’s responsibility in applying judgment in audits. It was followed by a series of numbered pronouncements called Statements on Auditing Procedures, or SAP (the antecessors of Statements on Auditing Standards), issued between 1939 up to the early 1970s for a total of 54 SAP pronouncements. During that time, the Securities Exchange Commission required public accountants to include a representation in their independent audit reports that the audit was performed in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards, and the Committee issued a booklet titled Generally Accepted Auditing Standards—Their Significance and Scope to adopt the SEC’s requirement. In 1963, the Committee issued Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 33 to consolidate and replace various pronouncements issued between 1949 and 1963, including pamphlets and statements.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MPA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. Since its {{inception}} in 1861 when the first <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee {{was established in the}} United Kingdom, this oversight mechanism has developed into a model for non-executive financial oversight and accountability at the national and provincial levels of government throughout the Commonwealth and beyond. A few municipalities in South Africa have also established <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committees, but they are a few isolated cases. The hesitance on the part of South African municipalities to establish a good governance mechanism with a proven track record is a cause of concern, especially in view of the poor financial management that prevails throughout the local sphere of government. In this case study of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee established in the City of Cape Town in 2006, the researcher explores the feasibility of the implementation of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee model within the local government sphere in South Africa. Twenty internationally recognised <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee practices were identified and used to probe the selected case to gain in-depth knowledge {{of the extent to which}} the committee adheres to these recognised practices. Where the committee deviated from accepted practices, the reasons for the deviation and its impact on the effectiveness of the committee were analysed. Finally, the key lessons learnt from the experience of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee in the City of Cape Town are used in order to make two sets of recommendations: Firstly, recommendations on how the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee of the City of Cape Town can become more effective than it currently is – recommendations which are also relevant to any municipality wishing to establish a <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee. The second set of recommendations is addressed to the national authorities in charge of finance and local government, as the challenge of establishing improved governance systems in local government is of national importance, and it is within the power of these authorities to remove a few key obstacles in the way of establishing municipal <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committees...|$|R
