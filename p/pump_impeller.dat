40|$|Oil sand {{pumps are}} widely used in the mining {{industry}} for the delivery of mixtures of abrasive solids and liquids. Because they operate under highly adverse conditions, these pumps usually experience significant wear. Consequently, equipment owners are quite often forced to invest substantially in system maintenance to avoid unscheduled downtime. In this study, an approach combining relevance vector machines (RVMs) with a sum of two exponential functions was developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of field <b>pump</b> <b>impellers.</b> To handle field vibration data, a novel feature extracting process was proposed {{to arrive at a}} feature varying with the development of damage in the <b>pump</b> <b>impellers.</b> A case study involving two field datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed method.

5000|$|... {{centrifugal}} pump, marine {{centrifugal pump}} {{is used to}} transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow.

5000|$|The 2GM20 series uses {{either a}} direct {{seawater}} cooling system, or an indirect freshwater cooling system (specified by the suffix letter F i.e. 2GM20F). Seawater is {{pumped into the}} engine through a seawater <b>pump</b> (<b>impeller</b> type). In the engines equipped with a direct seawater cooling system, seawater is used to cool the internals of the engine directly. The engines equipped with a freshwater cooling system have an additional heat exchanger, where heat transfer occurs between the seawater and internal freshwater.|$|E
50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must {{be filled with}} liquid before the pump is started, or the pump {{will not be able}} to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the pump suction under pressure supplied by another pump placed in the suction line.|$|E
50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} {{inlet flow}} {{to meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the <b>pump</b> <b>impeller,</b> it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{progresses}} {{in developing}} pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> and <b>impeller</b> total heart, {{as well as}} in applying streamlined impeller vanes, the best results in application of artificial heart pumps have been achieved by nonpulsatile univentricular assist <b>pump</b> with straight <b>impeller</b> vanes until now.

5000|$|Specific {{speed is}} an index {{used to predict}} desired pump or turbine performance. i.e. it predicts the general shape of a <b>pumps</b> <b>impeller.</b> It is this impeller's [...] "shape" [...] that predicts its flow and head {{characteristics}} so that the designer can then select a pump or turbine most appropriate for a particular application. Once the desired specific speed is known, basic dimensions of the unit's components can be easily calculated.|$|R

50|$|Circulator pumps {{as used in}} {{hydronic}} {{systems are}} usually electrically powered centrifugal pumps. As used in homes, they are often small, sealed, and rated {{at a fraction of}} a horsepower, but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the electric motor is usually separated from the pump body by some form of mechanical coupling. The sealed units used in home applications often have the motor rotor, <b>pump</b> <b>impeller,</b> and support bearings combined and sealed within the water circuit. This avoids one of the principal challenges faced by the larger, two-part pumps: maintaining a water-tight seal {{at the point where the}} pump drive shaft enters the pump body.|$|E
50|$|As {{for later}} Dennis fire engines, the water pump was a {{centrifugal}} pump, {{rather than the}} piston pumps used by other makers. This was more complex to build than the long-established piston pumps, but had advantages in operation. Where water was supplied under pressure from a hydrant, rather than by suction from a pond, this additional pressure was boosted through the centrifugal pump, whereas a piston pump would have throttled it. Piston pumps also gave a pulsating outlet pressure which required an air-filled receiver to even this out. A drawback of the usual centrifugal design was the considerable axial force generated by the <b>pump</b> <b>impeller,</b> requiring a thrust bearing. Dennis avoided this by using a doubled-sided impeller which balanced the overall force.|$|E
50|$|If left in {{standing}} water, pedestal pumps {{should be}} manually run {{from time to}} time, even if {{the water in the}} sump isn't high enough to trip the float switch. This is because these pumps are incapable of removing all the water in a sump and the lower bearing or bushing for the <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> shaft tends to remain submerged, making it prone to corrosion and eventually freezing the drive shaft in the bearing. In the alternative, a pedestal pump that is expected to remain idle for an extended time should be removed from the sump and stored out of water, or the sump should be mopped out to bring the level of the remaining water well below the lower shaft bearing.|$|E
40|$|Cavitation is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in pump systems, negatively influencing their operating parameters and components such as impellers and, thus, causing considerable financial losses. This paper explains the problem of cavitation and cavitation erosion. The causes of cavitation in pump systems are analyzed.

The authors also discuss ways of preventing cavitation and cavitation erosion in pump systems. Finally, relevant conclusions are drawn...|$|R

40|$|Problems of {{vibrating}} centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>impellers</b> {{and likewise}} structures with complex geometry, are usually being analysed {{by means of}} Finite Element Method or experimental methods. The first step in dynamic analysis is to determine natural frequencies and mode shapes. To classify natural frequencies according to vibration mode shapes, theory of circular plates vibration can be used. This paper shows how impeller vibration mode shapes can be classified for one type of centrifugal pump, and it proves that the impeller presented acts very similarly to circular plate...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve high delta-v, the {{structural}} mass of a launch vehicle should be as low as possible. Liquid fuel tanks can be constructed lighter if the pressure within those tanks is kept low. Typically, for pump-fed rocket engines, the propellant tank pressures (and masses) are 1/10 to 1/40 of those in a pressure-fed rocket. The structural weight constraint also makes the rotating speed of the turbopump rotor as high as possible. For example, the rotating speed of the oxygen turbopump of the Japanese LE-7 rocket engine is 18300rpm. These two factors above combine to make the <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> very susceptible to cavitation. If cavitation occurs in the impeller, {{the performance of the}} pump will be severely degraded and the pump itself may be damaged.|$|E
50|$|Suction {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at {{the eye of the}} <b>pump</b> <b>impeller.</b> This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.|$|E
50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} sump pumps—pedestal and submersible. In {{the case of the}} pedestal pump, the motor is mounted above the sump—where it is more easily serviced, but is also more conspicuous. The <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> is driven by a long, vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump. The submersible pump, on the other hand, is entirely mounted inside the sump, and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits. There is debate about which variety of sump pump is better. Pedestal sump pumps usually last longer (25 to 30 years) if they are installed properly and kept free of debris. They are less expensive and easier to remove. Submersible pumps will only last 5 to 15 years. They are more expensive to purchase but can take up debris without clogging.|$|E
5000|$|Cavitation is a {{significant}} cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called [...] "cavitation". The most common examples {{of this kind of}} wear are to <b>pump</b> <b>impellers,</b> and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.|$|R
40|$|In {{one of the}} SWCC Desalination plants, severe {{premature}} {{damage to}} the <b>pump</b> <b>impellers</b> used for <b>pumping</b> Monoethnolamine (MEA) solution containing adsorbed CO 2 (hereinafter referred to as Rich MEA) was reported. The <b>impellers</b> of the <b>pump</b> circulating MEA solution devoid of adsorbed CO 2 (hereinafter referred to as Lean MEA) was free from such damage. The Rich MEA <b>pump</b> <b>impellers</b> used in the pumps were satisfactorily performing the operation since 10 years. The problem of severe damage came to light only when new impellers replaced the old impellers as routine maintenance practice by the plant people with in one year of operation, on the contrary to those impellers, which have performed well for decade of service life. The damaged impellers and also the Rich MEA and Lean MEA solutions were subjected to investigation for determining the cause of failure. Metallography, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive spectroscopy were carried out on the damaged impellers. Some of the corrosion product found on the Rich MEA and Lean MEA impellers were characterized by chemical analysis. Electrochemical corrosion experiments were carried out on {{the old and new}} <b>pump</b> and <b>impeller</b> materials in Rich and Lean MEA solutions to determine the corrosion rates. Open Circuit Potential measurements were carried out in these solutions under dynamic condition. The results of the investigation indicated that the severe damage to the Rich MEA impeller was due to graphitic corrosion. The graphitic corrosion is imparted by anion impurity build up in Rich MEA solution and also through galvanic corrosion effected by electrical coupling of the new impeller to the old casing of the Rich MEA pump body...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} rebuild 3 D models for <b>pump</b> <b>impeller,</b> the total inner complex {{construction}} data must be obtained at first.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimization of vibrations of centrifugal pump considering fluid-structure interaction (FSI). A set of centrifugal pumps with various blade shapes were studied using FSI method, {{in order to}} investigate the transient vibration performance.

40|$|Lecturepg. 61 Consideration of {{torsional}} vibration in pump/driver shaft trains has become of increasing importance {{with the development}} of electronically controlled variable speed electric motors. Such motors not only provide a static driving toque, but develop superimposed continuous torque pulsations. The frequency of these torque pulsations varies with speed, such that typically resonance situations with a torsional natural mode at distinct speed cannot be avoided. Whether such resonance situations can be sustained during extended time periods without endangering the shafts by fatigue depends primarily on the total amount of damping available in the shaft train. Besides material and structural damping, which are internal damping sources, <b>pump</b> <b>impellers</b> are expected to provide external damping by convective energy dissipation into the pumped fluid. From literature, predictions of impeller damping on a theoretical basis are known, but almost no information about an experimental identification of torsional damping coefficients is available. The authors describe the development of a test rig for the identification of torsional damping and added mass moment of inertia of <b>pump</b> <b>impellers.</b> To find a suitable method to excite the test shaft train within a sufficiently large frequency band was the main difficulty to solve when developing the test rig.
