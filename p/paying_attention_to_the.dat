Pulse-type fishes conduct species recognition by <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> differences of EOD waveform, which include properties such as: EOD duration, number of phases, and form of the phases. Meanwhile, some indirect properties hidden in waveform are also used by pulse-type fishes: amplitude gradient, duration ratios of phases, and the order and signs of phases.|$|E

25|$|Poincaré {{made clear}} the {{importance}} of <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, {{and was the first}} to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928) in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating {{at the speed of light}} as being required by the Lorentz transformations.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of satellite television in Iran in the early 1990s and world-wide recognition of hip hop and its American artists such as Tupac Shakur, NWA and Eminem, hip hop found a following among the Iranian youth (mostly born after the Iranian Revolution of 1979). They started <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhythmic beats and lyrics present in hip hop. Soon they turned from rap enthusiasts to poets and rap producers, bringing to light how they saw life as Iranians and what they wanted from the world. Iranian hip hop, in its true form as its own genre emerged by the 2000s, from Tehran, the capital of Iran.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile cervical mucus promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body is gearing up for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise. The rise in progesterone causes a distinct change in {{the quantity and quality}} of mucus observed at the vulva.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 February 1964, the two ships were {{performing}} manoeuvres off Jervis Bay. Melbournes aircraft were performing flying exercises, and Voyager was tasked as plane guard, positioned behind and to port (left) of the carrier in order to rescue the crew of any ditching or crashing aircraft. After a series of turns effected to reverse the courses of the two ships, Voyager ended up ahead and to starboard (right) of the carrier. The destroyer was ordered to resume plane guard position, which would involve turning to starboard, away from the carrier, then looping around behind. Instead, Voyager began a starboard turn, but then came around to port. The bridge crew on Melbourne assumed that Voyager was zig-zagging to let the carrier overtake her, and would then assume her correct position. Senior personnel on Voyager were not <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manoeuvre. At 20:55, officers on both ships began desperate avoiding manoeuvres, but by then a collision was inevitable.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} home game at Soldier Field, the Bears emerged victorious {{defeating}} the Pittsburgh Steelers (17–15). The victory was short-lived as the Bears finished 6–8 {{leading to the}} termination of head coach Jim Dooley. New Coach Abe Gibron did not start his tenure any better with the Bears. The team was last place in the NFC Central division {{with a record of}} 4–9–1. The era under Gibron took a deeper dive during the 1973 season as the team finished in last place again with a record of 3–11 as the Bears were limited to just 195 total points during the entire season. Dick Butkus, who had terrorized enemy offensive players for the last eight years, retired early in the season after being hobbled by knee injuries. The 1974 season proved to be Gibron's final one with the Bears as the team finished yet again in last place, this time with a record of 4–10. The Gibron era was marked with a combined record of 11–30–1 and with the only memory was not a play or moment, but Gibron's appearance in an NFL Films production where he was taped singing Joy to the World not <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game in front of him.|$|E

Other influences and favorites of Shinoda's include Led Zeppelin, Run–D.M.C., The Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, Purity Ring, Arctic Monkeys and Santigold. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shinoda explained, [...] "People just want junk food. They want throw-away junk food music that's going to make them lethargic and fat.

500|$|Some {{experiments}} give subjects a [...] "distractor" [...] task {{to ensure}} that subjects are not consciously <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, {{regardless of whether the}} subject devotes attentional resources to it. [...] For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. [...] The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attentionor at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.|$|E
