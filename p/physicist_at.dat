On {{returning}} to the United States, he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16, 1926. They had two sons.|$|E
5|$|Compton asked {{theoretical}} physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to {{take over}} research into fast neutron calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from Gregory Breit, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security. John H. Manley, a <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and hydrodynamics—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.|$|E

5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> the Lawrence Livermore {{nuclear weapons}} laboratory, {{forwarded}} a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was {{a computer programmer}} from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

Klein's mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, née Kayser). He attended the Gymnasium in Düsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bonn, 1865–1866, intending to become a <b>physicist.</b> <b>At</b> that time, Julius Plücker held Bonn's chair of mathematics and experimental physics, {{but by the time}} Klein became his assistant, in 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry.

25|$|Previous {{experiments}} of neutrino speed {{played a}} role in the reception of the OPERA result by the physics community. Those experiments did not detect statistically significant deviations of neutrino speeds from the speed of light. For instance, Astronomer Royal Martin Rees and theoretical physicists Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking stated neutrinos from the SN 1987A supernova explosion arrived almost at the same time as light, indicating no faster-than-light neutrino speed. John Ellis, theoretical <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> CERN, believed it difficult to reconcile the OPERA results with the SN 1987A observations. Observations of this supernova restricted 10 MeV anti-neutrino speed to less than 20 parts per billion (ppb) over lightspeed. This was one of the reasons most physicists suspected the OPERA team had made an error.|$|E

25|$|Sheldon is {{a senior}} {{theoretical}} <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> Caltech and shared an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). However, Sheldon now lives across the hall with his fiancée Amy, in the former apartment of Leonard's wife Penny. He is a former child prodigy with genius level IQ, but displays an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm in other people, although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic behavior and {{a general lack of}} humility or empathy. He also lacks toleration. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and asexuality, co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction {{can start}} with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been found to}} work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both {{for the sake of a}} larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.|$|E
25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a <b>physicist</b> <b>at</b> the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the Iraqis to take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E
