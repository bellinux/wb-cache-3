25|$|As {{demand for}} silver {{increased}} and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products {{became much more}} standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used lost-wax casting, in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an investment casting was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. <b>Permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting,</b> an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas {{of the most commonly}} used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating some work to apprentices and journeymen. For instance, after 1780, Paul Revere's sons took on more significant roles in his shop, and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork. For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere, artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting. Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient.

To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of <b>cast</b> iron <b>mold</b> which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades {{governmental}} regulation and consumer demands have lead the automotive companies towards vehicle lightweighting. Powertrain components offer significant potential for vehicle weight reductions. Recently, magnesium alloys have shown promise for use in powertrain applications where creep has been a limiting factor. These systems are Mg-Al based, with alkaline earth or rare earth additions. The solidification, microstructure, and creep behavior of a series of Mg- 4 Al- 4 X:(Ca, Ce, La, and Sr) alloys and a commercially developed AXJ 530 (Mg – 5 Al – 3 Ca – 0. 15 Sr) alloy (by wt%) have been investigated. The order of decreasing freezing range of the five alloys was: AX 44, AXJ 530, AJ 44, ALa 44 and ACe 44. All alloys exhibited a solid solution primary α-Mg phase surrounded by an interdendritic region of Mg and intermetallic(s). The primary phase was composed of grains approximately an order of magnitude larger than the cellular structure. All alloys were <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> directly to creep specimens and AXJ 530 specimens were provided in die-cast form. The tensile creep behavior was investigated at 175 °C for stresses ranging from 40 to 100 MPa. The order of decreasing creep resistance was: die-cast AXJ 530 and <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> AXJ 530, AX 44, AJ 44, ALa 44 and ACe 44. Grain size, solute concentration, and matrix precipitates were the most significant microstructural features that influenced the creep resistance. Decreases in grain size or increases in solute concentration, both Al and the ternary addition, lowered the minimum creep rate. In the Mg-Al-Ca alloys, finely distributed Al 2 Ca precipitates in the matrix also improved the creep resistance by a factor of ten over the same alloy with coarse precipitates. The morphology of the eutectic region was distinct between alloys but did not contribute to difference in creep behavior. Creep strain distribution for the Mg-Al-Ca alloys developed heterogeneously on the scale of the α-Mg grains. As additional bulk strain accumulated, strain localized along grain boundaries between grains with significantly different Schmid factors. At these locations cavities and cracks formed that led to the eventual creep failure. Grain size influenced the plastic strain distribution during creep...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, heat {{treatment}} technologies {{have been developed}} by the CSIRO Light Metals Flagship in Australia that allow the 0. 2 % proof stress of conventional aluminum alloy high pressure diecastings (HPDC’s) {{to be more than}} doubled without encountering problems with blistering or dimensional instability [1, 2].

However, the current commercial HPDC Al-Si-Cu alloys have not been developed to exploit {{heat treatment}} or to optimize these specific mechanical properties, and one potential limitation of heat treating HPDC’s is that fracture resistance may be reduced as strength is increased. The current paper presents the outcomes of a program aimed at developing highly castable, secondary Al-Si-Cu HPDC alloys which display significantly enhanced ductility and fracture resistance in both the as-cast and heat treated conditions. Kahn-type tear tests were conducted to compare the fracture resistance of the conventional A 380 alloy with a selection of the newly developed compositions.

The results reveal that the microstructure of the PMC alloy consists of coarse and equiaxed α dendrites and interdendritic net-like eutectic phases. However, the microstructure of the PTF composite, {{similar to that of the}} PTF alloy, consists of near-spheroidal primary particles and intergranular secondarily solidified structures except SiCp, which are distributed in the secondarily solidified structures. The eutectics amount in the PTF materials is distinctly lower than that in the PMC alloy, and the microstructures of the former materials are quite compact while that of the latter alloy is porous. Therefore, the PTF alloy shows better tensile properties than the PMC alloy. Owing to the existence of the SiC reinforcing particles, the PTF composite attains an ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of 230 MPa and 128 MPa, representing an enhancement of 27. 8 % and 29. 3 % than those (180 MPa and 99 MPa) of the PTF alloy.

It was possible to pour the composite melt into the sand mold through a filter. (3) Trials were run to determine the required amount of the wetting agent, magnesium, to ensure appropriate mixing of the aluminum alloy and fly ash. The magnesium content required to mix ''F'' fly ash was much lower compared to that required to mix hybrid ''C-F'' fly ash in similar melts. Fly ash particles of less than 100 microns were mixed in aluminum melt.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{applications of}} cast Al-Si alloys depend {{to an important}} extent on controlling the morphology of the eutectic silicon through thermal modification in the solid state and/or chemical modification of the melt before {{the production of the}} casting. The effects of modification and/or heat treatment on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of 356 alloy have been investigated on both <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> and sand <b>cast</b> samples. Strontium (0. 02 %) and sodium (0. 01 %) were used to produce well modified microstructures. The importance of the amount of modifier used was also examined in producing castings with 0. 002 % Sr and 0. 08 % Sr. Production parameters such as solution heat treatment time and artificial aging time were examined. Microstructural assessment was done by quantitative metallography using image analysis coupled to SEM while mechanical testing comprised tensile testing, hardness and microhardness measurements as well as impact tests. The greatest improvement in mechanical properties obtained with modification was observed for the lower rates of solidification, i. e sand casting. The effect of modification on the heat treatment response of 356 alloy was investigated. The differences between unmodified and modified microstructures were more important in sand cast samples than in <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> samples. After one hour of solution heat treatment at 540 $ sp circ$C, both <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> unmodified and modified microstructures became similar in terms of silicon particle size and sphericity. The processes which led to this were different. Silicon platelets in the unmodified structures segmented while silicon particles in the modified alloy coarsened. The final result was however the same. In sand cast alloy, the initial microstructural differences persisted after up to 12 hours of solution treatment. The coarser the initial as-cast microstructure, the greater the improvements associated with modification and heat treatment. It was also found that porosity caused by modification can negate many of the microstructural benefits by decreasing tensile strength and percent elongation. It was demonstrated that modification also has an influence on the aluminum matrix. The hardness of modified alloy was found to be less after the T 6 temper than in unmodified alloy. This was reflected in a lower yield strength of modified 356 alloy. Quantitative microstructure-mechanical property relationships were established for the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> samples. The best silicon-structure characteristics to predict the tensile properties were found to be the particle count per unit area and the particle area.

C = 206. 28, 280. 43, 211. 07, 235. 28, 682. 28. and D = 682. 28, 235. 37, 215. 25, 168. 67, 148. 79 and price the highest violence in part C 5 and D 1 amounting to 682. 28, while the lowest rates of violence in parts of the A 1 and D 5 of 148. 79. Based on these data can be conclude that every part has a level of violence that in price, because every point or part that has the content of carbon in the test. The higher the carbon content then it will be the higher level of violence as well as affect the physical properties of grey cast iron...|$|R
