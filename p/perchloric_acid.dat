5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of <b>perchloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate combinations between acid digestion techniques and spectrophotometric quantification to measure chromium concentration in cattle feces. Digestion techniques were evaluated based {{on the use of}} nitric and <b>perchloric</b> <b>acids,</b> sulfuric and <b>perchloric</b> <b>acids,</b> and phosphoric acid. The chromium quantification in the solutions was performed by colorimetry and by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). When AAS was used, the addition of calcium chloride to the solutions as a releasing agent was also evaluated. Several standard samples containing known chromium contents were produced (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g of chromium per kg of feces) using cattle feces obtained from three different animals to evaluate the accuracy of the different combinations of techniques. The accuracy was evaluated by adjusting a simple linear regression model of the estimated values on the actual values of chromium content in the standard samples. Regardless of the digestion technique, the chromium content estimates in the standard samples obtained by colorimetry were not accurate (P 0. 05). The use of the digestion technique in phosphoric acid provided incomplete recovery of the fecal chromium (P 0. 05) fecal chromium contents...|$|R

25|$|The {{halide ions}} - chloride, bromide and iodide - are too weakly basic to react quantitatively with acetous <b>perchloric</b> <b>acid.</b> Addition of mercuric acetate (which is undissociated in acetic acid solution) to a halide salt replaces the halide ion by an {{equivalent}} quantity of acetate ion, {{which is a}} strong base in acetic acid.|$|E
25|$|When a weak base, such as pyridine, is {{dissolved}} in acetic acid, the acetic acid exerts its levelling effect and enhances the basic {{properties of the}} pyridine.

25|$|Strong bases (e.g. sodium hydroxide), strong oxidizers (e.g. <b>perchloric</b> <b>acid),</b> {{and certain}} metals (e.g. aluminum). Violent {{reactions}} and splattering of dangerous chemicals can occur upon mixing H3PO4 {{with a strong}} base.

Phosphoric acid will attack many metals and drive the formation of highly flammable and potentially explosive hydrogen gas. If flammable combustion occurs, toxic fumes of phosphorus oxides will form.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A strong acid is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent). In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H+ (as hydronium ion H3O+) and one mole of the conjugate base, A−. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), <b>perchloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.|$|E
25|$|A weakly basic solvent {{has less}} {{tendency}} than a strongly basic one {{to accept a}} proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as <b>perchloric</b> <b>acid</b> exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.|$|E
