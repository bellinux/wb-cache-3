5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go <b>penalty</b> for {{overtaking}} a lapped car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This <b>penalty</b> involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds, and the rules state that a driver must serve his <b>penalty</b> within three laps of the <b>penalty</b> being issued. On the third lap after receiving the <b>penalty,</b> Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his <b>penalty,</b> but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving the <b>penalty.</b> The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the <b>penalty</b> completely due to the irregularities in how the <b>penalty</b> had been issued.|$|E
5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} <b>penalty</b> box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the <b>penalty</b> time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the <b>penalty</b> box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E

50|$|<b>Penalties</b> may be {{monetary}} or {{may involve}} forfeiture of property. Criminal <b>penalties</b> may include jail time, but are imposed {{only by a}} federal judge after a defendant is convicted. Most monetary <b>penalties</b> are based on the amount of tax not properly paid. <b>Penalties</b> may increase with the period of nonpayment. Some <b>penalties</b> are fixed dollar amounts or fixed percentages of some measure required to be reported. Excise taxes used as <b>penalties</b> are imposed in the Code sections relating to particular kinds of transactions. Some <b>penalties</b> may be waived or abated where the taxpayer shows reasonable cause for the failure.|$|R
40|$|In the United States, federal, state, {{and local}} governments are {{involved}} with the regulation of {{the safety of the}} food supply. Food safety regulations that set standards for food processors usually include inspection policies for monitoring performance and <b>penalties</b> for processors who do not comply with regulatory standards. In this analysis, we examine how <b>penalties</b> and inspection policies interact to influence processor behavior. We distinguish between internal <b>penalties</b> (imposed by the regulator) and external <b>penalties</b> (imposed by the market or by the court). Using a model of the processor's expected annual cost, we find that under a given inspection policy internal <b>penalties</b> are only relevant under specific conditions. For cases in which internal and external <b>penalties</b> can be influenced, we use comparative statics to discover that internal <b>penalties</b> are more economically efficient for motivating processors than external <b>penalties.</b> These results imply that regulators should utilize internal <b>penalties</b> for noncompliance rather than rely on market- or court-imposed <b>penalties.</b> Key words: food safety, inspection, quality control, quality costs, regulatio...|$|R
5|$|A two-minute minor <b>penalty</b> {{is often}} called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the <b>penalty</b> box when either the <b>penalty</b> time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major <b>penalty).</b>|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Clinton was a death <b>penalty</b> {{opponent}} {{in his early}} years, but he eventually switched positions. During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death <b>penalty</b> had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death <b>penalty</b> was reinstated in 1988.|$|E

50|$|Under the 1980 law, these offenses were {{punishable}} when {{criminal liability}} could be ascribed. Criminal liability {{was attributed to}} intentional offenses and those acts of negligence specifically provided for by the law. There were principal and supplementary <b>penalties.</b> Principal <b>penalties</b> were public surveillance, detention, fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death. Supplementary <b>penalties</b> were fines, deprivation of political rights, and confiscation of property. Supplementary <b>penalties</b> could be imposed exclusive of principal <b>penalties.</b> Foreigners could be deported with or without other <b>penalties.</b>|$|R

5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} <b>penalty</b> against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play, during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another <b>penalty</b> less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the <b>penalty</b> box for holding. A Flyers <b>penalty</b> against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second <b>penalty</b> of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

5|$|Extra time {{provided}} little action; {{the only}} player that looked like changing the scoreline was Conti, whose runs at Neal caused the Liverpool defender problems. Despite this, the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time and the match went to a penalty-shoot-out. Liverpool {{were the first to}} take a <b>penalty,</b> but Nicol put his shot over the crossbar. Graziani stepped up to take Roma's first <b>penalty,</b> but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei took the ball from him and took the <b>penalty</b> instead, scoring to give Roma the lead. Liverpool's next <b>penalty</b> was taken by their regular <b>penalty</b> taker Neal who scored to level the shoot-out. Conti took the next <b>penalty</b> for Roma, but like Nicol he put his shot over the crossbar. Souness and Ubaldo Righetti converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline2–2. Rush scored Liverpool's next <b>penalty</b> to make the score 3–2. Graziani stepped up again to take Roma's fourth <b>penalty.</b> While he was placing the ball on the <b>penalty</b> spot, Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar was wobbling his legs in the Liverpool goal, hoping to distract Graziani. The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his <b>penalty</b> over the crossbar. Alan Kennedy was the next player to take a <b>penalty</b> and if he scored Liverpool would win the match. Kennedy scored the <b>penalty</b> sending Tancredi the wrong way. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2, thereby winning their fourth European Cup.|$|E
