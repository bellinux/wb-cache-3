40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to discover whether measurement of cervical length and cervical volume at term is helpful in predicting the onset of labor in VBAC candidates. Methods: Transvaginal sonographic evaluations of the cervixes of pregnant women who desired to undergo VBAC were performed between 36 - 40 weeks gestation. Clinical information such as labor onset time, gestational age at delivery and delivery mode was gathered from medical records. Results: A total of 514 pregnant women participated in this study. Cervical length was significantly longer in the group that delivered 7 days or more after measurement than in the group that delivered within 7 days of measurement (43 &# 177; 0. 77 cm vs. 2. 99 &# 177; 0. 72 cm, p &# 60; 0. 001). Cervical volume was significantly larger in the group that delivered at and after 7 days than in the group that delivered within 7 days (29. 21 &# 177; 11. 62 cm 3 vs. 34. 07 &# 177; 13. 41 cm 3, p = 0. 014). The cervical length ROC curve was significantly more predictive than the cervical volume ROC curve (AUC: 0. 711 vs 0. 594, p = 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences between}} the combined cervical length/volume ROC curve and the cervical length ROC curve alone (p = 0. 565). The AUC of the cervical length ROC curve to predict postterm pregnancy was 0. 729. Conclusion: Measuring cervical length is helpful in predicting the onset of spontaneous labor within 7 days and <b>posterm</b> <b>delivery</b> in VBAC candidates. </p...|$|E
