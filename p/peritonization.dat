30|$|The {{importance}} of fascial approximation when closing the vaginal cuff has been emphasized [14, 46]. <b>Peritonization</b> was previously performed systematically in hysterectomies. However, {{it has been}} abandoned by many [59, 60]. In the series of Ramin et al., 11 of the 18 cases had peritoneal closure, with five unknown. Thus, peritoneal closure {{does not seem to}} be protective, and the lack of <b>peritonization</b> in hysterectomies performed laparoscopically would not appear to be a risk factor for tubal prolapse [9].|$|E
30|$|V-Loc barbed suture {{was used}} to close myometrial defects in laparoscopic myomectomies, vaginal cuffs in total laparoscopic hysterectomies and <b>peritonization</b> in laparoscopic sacrocolpopexies. Three {{patients}} submitted to a total laparoscopic hysterectomy presented post-operative vaginal bleeding.|$|E
30|$|Surgical technique: The {{surgical}} technique is divided in: (1) exposure, (2) promontory dissection and mesh bed preparation, (3) dissection of the rectovaginal and vesicovaginal spaces, (4) fixation of the mesh and (5) <b>peritonization.</b> Exposure {{is a critical}} step in sacrocolpopexy because bowel suspension gives freedom to {{the hand of the}} assistant and enables an easy fixation of the mesh in the promontory. During the dissection of the vesicovaginal space the critical point is to grasp the whole bladder and not only the overlying peritoneal fold, because this reduces the risks of bladder damage. Some tips about mesh fixation in puborectalis muscle, vagina and promontory will be given. Since the majority of ureteral complications in open sacrocolpopexy occur during <b>peritonization,</b> the right ureter must be clearly identified during this step.|$|E
30|$|Barbed suture (Quill® SRS) is {{presented}} as a highly useful tool for minimally invasive surgeries. Its design allows for tissue approximation without the need to keep a constant tension and avoids intrasurgical knots. Several types of surgery can benefit from this tool. Barbed sutures are used in colporrhaphy of laparoscopic hysterectomies or <b>peritonization</b> of the mesh in sacrocolpopexy. Unlike other barbed sutures, the barbs of the Quill® SRS are set facing in opposite directions from the midpoint, also known as transition point, with a needle on each end. One of the arms of the suture is used for deep layer closure and the second arm is used for superficial or seromuscular layer closure.|$|E
30|$|Treatment of viable non-ischemic FWHs is not {{standardized}} [7]. Some authors {{limit the}} procedure to hernia reduction, especially when achieved under laparoscopy [8 – 10, 13]. Although recommended by some authors [2, 18], {{there are no}} current guidelines for foramen of Winslow closure [1]. This exposes to the serious risk of injury of the porta hepatis while the inflammatory postoperative adhesions seem to most often close the foramen [3]. Alternatively, the foramen of Winslow can be packed with omentum [11, 14]. Systematic right colectomy, even for viable bowel, has been proposed when appropriate <b>peritonization</b> cannot be achieved due to redundant colon [19 – 21]. We agree that lack of posterior attachment of the caecum and ascending colon is a confirmed risk factor for FWH and consider that caecopexy to the lateral wall is the most suitable option when the bowel is deemed viable after reduction [2, 6]. Being easily achieved under laparoscopy, it combines the advantages of avoiding porta hepatis injury, protecting against theoretical recurrence and allowing bowel sparing.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This report {{reviews the}} {{clinical}} and functional outcomes of implanted meshes during a second-look evaluation of 85 cases after {{a large number}} (733) of laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repairs (LIVHR), of which 608 were controlled throughout a period of 5 to 10 years. This report demonstrates a minimal occurrence of adhesions and a low rate of recurrences and other complications related to mesh usage. Methods Eighty-five re-operated cases after LIVHR were reviewed retrospectively. In every redo surgery, the first trocar was always inserted on a lateral side, external to the previous skin incisions of the transabdominal fixations. Mueller's adhesion scale was used to estimate adhesion severity (Mueller 0 indicates no adhesion; Mueller I indicates adhesion of the omentum; and Mueller II indicates serosal adhesions). The mechanism of recurrence is of paramount interest and is analyzed herein. If recurrence was observed, the defect was closed and a larger mesh of ParietexTM was implanted under the previous one, with transparietal fixation achieved by pulling the threads with the Endoclose ® device. Results In all of our "second-look" surgeries, the neoperitoneum perfectly covered the mesh. In 47. 05 % of the cases, we observed no adhesions (Mueller 0), 42. 3 % had adhesions of the omentum (Mueller I), and 10. 58 % had serosal adhesions (Mueller II). There was no shrinking or wrinkling of the prosthesis {{in any of the}} cases, confirming its total <b>peritonization</b> on the anterior abdominal wall. Within the first 3 years, only 4. 1 % of the controlled patients contracted recurrences, with a mean follow-up of 52 months. Conclusion With the double-suturing technique used for LIVHR and the use of a composite mesh, we observed a low rate of recurrences and limited side effects as compared with the use of tacks intra-abdominally. Redo surgeries after LIVHR are feasible, but care must be taken due to unpredictable mesh adhesions. © Springer-Verlag 2010. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
