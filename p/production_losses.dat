40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate, from the {{perspective}} of society, the costs of sick leave and rehabilitation of recently sick-listed workers with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) or mental disorders (MD). Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 812 sick-listed workers with MSD (518) or MD (294) were included. Data on consumption of health care and <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> were collected over six months from an administrative casebook system of the health care provider. <b>Production</b> <b>loss</b> was estimated based on the number of sick-leave days. Societal costs were based on the human capital approach. Results: The mean costs of <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> per person were EUR 5978 (MSD) and EUR 6381 (MD). Health care interventions accounted for 9. 3 % (MSD) and 8. 2 % (MD) of the costs of <b>production</b> <b>loss.</b> Corresponding figures for rehabilitation activities were 3. 7 % (MSD) and 3. 1 % (MD). Health care interventions were received by about 95 % in both diagnostic groups. For nearly half of the cohort, no rehabilitation intervention at all was provided. Conclusions: Costs associated with sick leave were dominated by <b>production</b> <b>loss.</b> Resources invested in rehabilitation were small. By increasing investment in early rehabilitation, costs to society and the individual might be reduced. Implications for Rehabilitation Resources invested in rehabilitation for sick-listed with musculoskeletal and mental disorders in Sweden are very small in comparison with the costs of <b>production</b> <b>loss.</b> For policy makers, there may be much to gain through investments into improved rehabilitation processes for return to work.

Methods The Helsinki Health Study follow-up survey made in 2007, including 3935 employees, was used in the analysis. Physical activity was based on the questionnaire data and classified into inactive, moderately active and vigorously active. Sickness absence and salary data were derived from the employer's registers. The follow-up for sickness absence was three years. The effect of physical activity on the cost of absence was analyzed with a two-part model. Results On average, an employee was absent six days a year due to short-term sickness absence, with a <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> of 2350 EUR in / during the three years. The vigorously active were less likely to have sickness absences and their absence spells were shorter than those in the less active groups. The <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> of a vigorously active employee was 404 EUR less than of an inactive employee. The average annual salary varied according to employees' physical activity, with higher physical activity associated to higher salary. Conclusions <b>Production</b> <b>loss</b> is associated with physical activity.

5000|$|Congress {{was also}} {{concerned}} that the tax had increased the nation's dependence on imported oil. The tax was an excise tax on oil produced domestically in the United States; it was not imposed on imported oil. Domestic oil producers could not shift the tax forward as a higher oil selling price because the purchaser would merely substitute imported or tax-exempt crude. The tax caused domestic oil <b>production</b> <b>losses</b> in every year until 1986, when crude prices declined below adjusted base prices resulting in zero windfall profit tax. Over the 1980-1986 period, it is estimated that, depending on the assumed supply curve price elasticity, the tax reduced domestic oil production from between 320 million barrels (1.2% of domestic production) and 1,268 million barrels (4.8% of domestic production). The effect of reducing domestic oil production was to increase the level of imported oil. The estimated <b>production</b> <b>losses</b> caused by the tax, as a % of the actual level of imported oil, under three assumed supply curve elasticities range from 3.2% of total imports to 12.7% of imports for this period, depending on price elasticity.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to extend the {{knowledge}} of factors that from an employer perspective could increase the use of research based {{occupational safety and health}} (OSH) interventions and work-place health promotion (WHP). The aim of Study I was to explore and describe what incentives influence when employers make their decisions about engaging in OSH interventions and WHP. The aim of Study II was to examine if work related stress is associated with <b>production</b> <b>loss.</b> Methods: In Study I, focus group interviews were carried out with 20 representatives from 19 workplaces across Sweden. The study population was managers with responsibility for making decisions about OSH interventions and WHP, or employees directly involved in this work with equivalent knowledge and mandate from their managers to answer questions about these decisions. The interviews were transcribed and the data were analyzed using latent content analysis. In Study II, a cross-sectional study design was used. Data was collected through a work environment and health survey sent out to all employees at a medium sized municipality in Sweden (n= 2, 766). Job strain and exhaustion were used as indicators of work-related stress. <b>Production</b> <b>loss</b> at work was measured on a 10 -point scale to capture the influence of work environment problems and health problems on performance during the last seven days. The scale was converted from 0 - 10 to 0 - 100 to capture the percentage loss of work time. Associations were investigated using a general linear model (GLM) regression analysis, and confounders were checked for by a mixture of backward and forward selection. Results: In Study I, the following incentives were identified in the analysis: “law and provisions,” “consequences for the employer,” “knowledge of worker health and workplace health interventions,” “characteristics of the intervention,” and “communication and collaboration with the provider. ” The incentives seemed to influence the decision making parallel with each other and the employers most often considered several incentives at the same time when deciding on whether or not to engage in OSH interventions and WHP. In Study II, the average <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> associated with job strain was 8. 2 % (work environment-related <b>production</b> <b>loss)</b> and 4. 3 % (health-related <b>production</b> <b>loss).</b> For mild and severe exhaustion the association was 2. 0 % and 12. 7 % regarding work environment-related production loss; for health-related <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> it was 5. 4 % and 17. 8 %. Conclusion: The present thesis contributes to further knowledge of factors that could increase the use of research-based OSH interventions and WHP. The conclusion of Study I was that employers’ decisions to engage in OSH interventions and WHP were influenced by several incentives. Some incentives led to a desire to engage in these kinds of interventions, while other incentives were related to other aspects such as the characteristics of the employer, the provider, and the intervention. All incentives seemed important to consider {{in order to understand the}} decision making process for OSH interventions and WHP, and to bridge the gap between what is produced through research and what is used in practice. The conclusion of Study II was that work-related stress, measured as job strain and exhaustion, was associated with increased <b>production</b> <b>loss</b> at the workplace resulting in economic consequences for the employer. If employers would be able to reduce the proportion of employees experiencing job strain and/or exhaustion, this could have a positive effect on work productivity and efficiency, and thereby be used as an economic incentive to reduce work-related stress...|$|R
