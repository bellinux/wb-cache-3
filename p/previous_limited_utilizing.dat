50|$|From the gamma-ray {{polarization}} data of GAP, Toma et al. puts a stricter {{limit on}} CPT violation. It is an improvement of eight {{orders of magnitude}} over <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{arrangements}} were debated over the preceding three {{years following the}} <b>previous</b> <b>limited</b> liability company (controlled by minority shareholders) trading insolvently which forced UCSA to inject funds and restructure the organisation.|$|R
50|$|A city-center plan {{adopted in}} February 2007 allows mixed-use {{buildings}} {{of up to}} seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks. The <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> was three stories.|$|R
25|$|As {{more and}} more {{processes}} become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This {{is an example of}} exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may however set new limits that surpass the <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{bypassed}} in 2013 with {{the completion of}} the freeway standard road routed on {{the eastern side of the}} town, from the <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> of the freeway, to 6 km north of Nagambie.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other closed stations, TfL {{provided}} a temporary service to Shoreditch {{until the new}} line fully opened in 2010 {{in the form of}} a non-stop bus service connecting Shoreditch with Whitechapel using the station's <b>previous</b> <b>limited</b> opening hours.|$|R
5000|$|Arkansas General Assembly: {{sixteen years}} total {{in either the}} House or the Senate. (Prior to the 2014 election, the <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> of three two-year terms for House members (six years) and two {{four-year}} terms for Senate members (eight years) applied).|$|R
40|$|Sub{{ependymoma}}s (SE) are slow-growing {{brain tumors}} {{that tend to}} occur within the ventricles of middle-aged and elderly adults.

5000|$|The {{album is}} a {{continuation}} to the previous chronological album in the series Pumpkin as it is seen on the track numeration and cover theme and title. Pikes was signed with orange ink instead of the traditional black ink used in the <b>previous</b> <b>limited</b> editions.|$|R
5000|$|California State Legislature: {{twelve years}} total in either Assembly or Senate. (For legislators first elected on or before June 5, 2012, the <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> (enacted in 1990) of either three two-year terms for Assembly members (six years) and two {{four-year}} terms for Senate members (eight years) apply).|$|R
30|$|Total hip {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most popular surgical procedures, with a worldwide successful application related to its high standardized outcome. Nevertheless, the clinical and functional results of prostheses have shown, during the last decades, a significant improvement that has gradually pushed their performances beyond their <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Limited was succeeded as {{the highest}} level trim by the Limited Platinum, which is near {{identical}} to the <b>previous</b> <b>Limited</b> save for a few changes. The Limited still continued production, although with a few standard features removed or made optional (such as HID headlamps) due to the Limited Platinum.|$|R
40|$|Similarly as {{known from}} laser {{sintering}} and microwave or millimeter wave sintering, optimized spark plasma sintering can reproduce the grain size - density relationship and the properties (e. g. transparency) generated by conventional solid state sintering, but until present without {{the option to}} exceed the <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> {{in the case of}} alumina ceramics...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>limited</b> edition {{versions}} of the game came with handmade wood tiles, the version now available comes on 1/8" [...] card stock. The rules have been modified from earlier versions for easier game play. The gameplay {{is described as a}} cross between RoboRally and Chess. Reviews of the game have been generally positive.|$|R
40|$|Results of the 2015 early {{searches}} for supersymmetric particles {{obtained by the}} CMS experiment with 13 TeV data are reviewed. With an integrated luminosity of 2. 2 fb^- 1, limits on the gluino mass have been lifted up to higher values with respect to <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> from 19. 5 fb^- 1 of 8 TeV data...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the underlying economic issues the DFB made only a token response, raising the <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> on transfer fees and player salaries, but not by {{enough to make the}} Bundesliga a truly professional league in the broader European context. This laid the groundwork for a second similar scandal some six years later.|$|R
5000|$|The cap {{for money}} spent on players' {{salaries}} was set at £1.8 million per club from the 2002 season. The <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> had allowed the clubs to spend either £0.75 million per year or a higher amount {{as long as it}} was no more than 50% of the clubs [...] "salary cap relevant income".|$|R

The <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> on the number of flavours becomes even more stringent; i. e. only six flavours are allowed. The mass of the t-quark has to be smaller than 155 GeV...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe use the {{constraints}} arising from primordial nucleosynthesis to bound a putative electric charge density |e|nq of the universe. We find |nq/nγ|≲ 10 − 43, four {{orders of magnitude}} more stringent than <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b> We also work out the bounds on nq in models with a photon mass, that allows to have a charge density without large-scale electric fields...|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} along with Thank you Ohlinger's on November 2 digitally {{with a limited}} edition consisting of 300 copies of an untitled white album signed by Buckethead himself to be released on November 22. Like Feathers, the album was signed with red ink instead of the traditional black ink used in all the <b>previous</b> <b>limited</b> editions.|$|R
50|$|The Korean War was {{a period}} of {{transition}} for the men of the UDT. They tested their <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> and defined new parameters for their special style of warfare. These new techniques and expanded horizons positioned the UDT well to assume an even broader role as the storms of war began brewing to the south in Vietnam.|$|R
5000|$|The team {{returned}} {{the following year}} and passed their <b>previous</b> <b>limit,</b> but to their great disappointment the cave sumped almost immediately {{at a depth of}} 751 m and could be explored no further. To be [...] "Ghar Paraued" [...] became a term used in British caving for a small, disappointing breakthrough following great effort to discover new passage.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{formation}} of boroughs within its <b>previous</b> <b>limits,</b> South Hackensack is split into three sections. The northeastern, primary residential section is adjacent to Hackensack, Little Ferry and Teterboro. A small section western portion is sandwiched in between Garfield, Lodi, Wallington and Wood-Ridge, while a southern sliver containing only industrial properties lies in the Meadowlands between Carlstadt, Moonachie, and Ridgefield.|$|R
50|$|In May 2015 the Spanish {{government}} approved {{an agreement}} granting the U.S. military a permanent {{presence on the}} base. Under the agreement, up to 3,000 American troops and civilians of the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force - Crisis Response - Africa can be stationed there, {{while the number of}} aircraft can be increased to 40, up from the <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> of 14.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} result of our most recent search for T-violation in 205 Tl, which is {{interpreted}} {{in terms of an}} electric dipole moment of the electron de. We find de = (6. 9 plus/minus 7. 4) times 10 {sup - 28 } e cm. The present apparatus is a major upgrade of the atomic beam magnetic resonance device used to set the <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> on de...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the phase conjugating {{element of a}} two element Fourier transform beam shaping scheme and the impact this element has on the resulting propagation. We show that there are stricter limitations placed on the system when using such a phase correcting element, and that even at 10 × the <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> one can observe intensity errors due to inaccurate phase conjugation. Conference Pape...|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{high-temperature}} superconductivity {{was discovered}} in some materials at temperatures up to about 130 K, considerably above the <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> of about 30 K. It is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play. These effects are still not yet fully understood; {{it is possible that}} they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.|$|R
50|$|Mayor La Guardia {{appointed}} a dynamic young Robert Moses as Commissioner of Parks who, in the West Side Improvement, separated the freight {{service of the}} West Side Line (NYCRR) from street life, {{to the benefit of}} both and of parks. Later, Moses extended parkways beyond <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b> After 1950 the federal government's priority shifted to freeways, and Moses applied his usual vigor to that kind of construction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>previous</b> <b>limit</b> of {{a maximum}} of four teams per {{association}} will be increased to five, meaning that if the Champions League title holders finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association will not be prevented from participating in the tournament. Although, an exception being; when both the Champions League and Europa League title holders finish outside the top four.|$|R
40|$|We present {{limits on}} the {{production}} of neutral penetrating states produced in 28 GeV proton nucleus collisions. We obtain limits for light, heavy and unstable neutral states. For light stable states our limit [sigma]I[sigma]P- 69 cm 4 /nucleon 2 {{is more than a}} factor of 5. 5 better than <b>previous</b> <b>limits.</b> Time of flight techniques are used to study heavy states. We have poor sensitivity to short-lived states...|$|R
40|$|GammeV is an axion-like {{particle}} photon regeneration experiment {{conducted at}} Fermilab that employs the light shining {{through a wall}} technique. They obtain limits on the coupling of a photon to an axion-like particle that extend <b>previous</b> <b>limits</b> for both scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like particles in the milli-eV mass range. They are able to exclude the axion-like particle interpretation of the anomalous PVLAS 2006 result by more than 5 standard deviations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{announced}} and released on August 16 {{in a digital}} format [...] and also as a limited edition, untitled album signed by Buckethead himself. Unlike the <b>previous</b> <b>limited</b> editions released during 2013, this one was limited to 300 copies. This trend was followed on every pike album after this one.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} high-precision measurements, beyond the standard quantum <b>limit,</b> <b>utilizing</b> non-classical states. Although entanglement {{has been considered}} a resource for achieving the Heisenberg limit in measurements, we show that any advantage expected from using entanglement {{is dependent on the}} measurement in question. We investigate several measurement scenarios and illustrate the role of entanglement as a resource for quantum high-precision measurement. In particular, we demonstrate that there is a regime wherein entanglement not only does not help, but prevents the achievement of the fundamental limit. Comment: 6 pages, no figures.
