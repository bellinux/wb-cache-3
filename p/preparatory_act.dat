5000|$|The {{physical}} proximity {{doctrine is}} a standard in criminal law for distinguishing between preparation and attempt. [...] "Physical" [...] refers to the physical element of a criminal act (actus reus), as distinguished from the mental element of a guilty mind (mens rea). When a person makes preparation to commit a crime, {{and one of the}} preparatory acts is close or proximate to the completed crime, the preparation is considered to have merged into being an actual attempt. The standard is not a clear bright line standard. The closer the <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> is to the completed crime, the stronger the case for calling it an attempt. The determination as to whether the standard has been met is a matter for the jury to determine.|$|E
50|$|The World War I system {{served as}} a model for that of World War II. The 1940 STSA instituted {{national}} conscription in peacetime, requiring registration of all men between 21 and 35, with selection for one year's service by a national lottery. The term of service was extended by one year in August 1941. After Pearl Harbor the STSA was further amended (December 19, 1941), extending the term of service to the duration of the war and six months and requiring the registration of all men 18 to 64 years of age. In the massive draft of World War II, 49 million men were registered, 36 million classified , and 10 million inducted.President Roosevelt's signing of the STSA on September 16, 1940, began the first peacetime draft in the United States. It also established the Selective Service System as an independent agency responsible for identifying and inducting young men into military service. Roosevelt named Hershey to head the Selective Service on July 31, 1941, where he remained until 1969. This <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served {{as the basis for the}} conscription programs that would continue to the present. The act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at any given time and limited military service to 12 months. An amendment increased this 18 more months in August 1941. Later legislation on December 20, 1942 amended the act to require all men from 18 to 64 to register, with those aged 20 to 44 being able for induction. 18 and 19 year olds were made liable for induction and the upper age limit for the draft was reduced to 37 beginning on November 13, 1942. Service commitments for inductees were set at the length of the war plus six months. As manpower need increased during World War II, draftees were inducted into the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.|$|E
30|$|Further analysis, by the International Law Clinic, {{brings to}} light that, ‘ordering’ if {{considered}} as a punishable <b>preparatory</b> <b>act,</b> must be consistent with other preparatory acts. The first, ‘punishable preparatory act’, which is contained in RS Art 25 (3) (e), regards genocide and states: ‘In respect {{of the crime of}} genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide’. Furthermore, the crime lay ‘in (…) the instigator’s intent to cause the required state of mind in a third party’. Cassese et al. (2013) holds that any <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> of ordering, that may lead to a crime provided for under the ICC Statute, is prohibited (Olásolo et al. 2016).|$|E

30|$|An initial {{study of}} legal theory and {{international}} law by the research team found that if the intention is to displace is unlawfully acted upon criminal liability immediately attaches. In this case, the intention is enacted through an ‘order’. Therefore, under RS Art 8 (2)(e)(viii), an order whether the displacement is carried out or not constitutes a punishable <b>preparatory</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
30|$|The International Law Clinic team, however, {{highlighted}} {{a number}} of subjective elements we should consider {{in relation to the}} ordering of forced displacement and in establishing who is responsible for ensuring that illegal forced displacement does not take place. The ICC has no case law on forced displacement or on the punishable <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> of ordering. Therefore, the investigation team construed its objective and subjective elements in light of criminal justice notions (i) punishable preparatory acts; (ii) ‘ordering’ as mode of individual criminal liability; (iii) effective control and command responsibility; and (iv) indirect perpetration as an organized structure of power. The team also analysed the concept of military necessity under Hague and Geneva Law (Olásolo et al. 2016).|$|E
30|$|The El Rosario International Law Clinic {{found two}} {{established}} positions regarding {{the definition of}} ordering as a criminal act. One position based on the broad intention of AP II (1977) Art. 17 found that; ‘(…) “ordering” should be interpreted as any voluntary action that causes the displacement’ (Willms 2009 p 558 - 559). Consequentially parties are responsible for acts which directly, or indirectly, cause the displacement of the civilian population. The second position based on the drafting process of the RS Article in question maintains that “ordering” is a <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> prohibited in itself and that other acts, such as instigating, may not be considered orders. Accordingly, under this position liability would only attach in the issuance of an order, {{regardless of whether the}} order leads to civilian displacement or not (Dörmann 2003 p 431 - 407; Olásolo et al. 2016 p 70 - 71).|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{analyses}} of antiepileptic drugs have indicated {{an increase in}} the risk of suicidality. The objective of this report was to provide clinical information and an independent meta-analysis of divalproex sodium and suicidality events by analyzing data from 13 placebo-controlled studies and 1 low-dose controlled study. Methods: Adverse events considered to be possibly suicide related were identified using the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) methodology. Indications included epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, impulsive aggression, and dementia. Narratives were produced for every event, and suicidality event ratings were performed by a third party blinded to treatment assignment. Statistical analyses were conducted using methodology similar to that reported by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results: Suicidality events were identified in 5 of the 13 placebo-controlled studies. Of the 1, 327 (0. 83 %) subjects taking divalproex sodium, 11 had suicidality events: 2 suicide attempts and 9 suicidal ideation. Of 992 (0. 91 %) subjects taking placebo, 9 had suicidality events: 1 <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> toward suicide, 2 suicide attempts, and 6 suicidal ideation. Across placebo-controlled studies, the overall estimated odds ratio (OR) of suicidal behavior or ideation was 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 29 to 1. 84). The OR for suicidal behavior was 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 04 to 2. 58), and the OR for suicidal ideation was 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 31 to 2. 79) ...|$|E

I shall first try to rebut a general argument against the criminalization of <b>acts</b> that are <b>preparatory</b> to the commission of serious offences. Grooming is one such act, but there are others, sometimes associated with terrorism. According to me, the general argument misapplies certain considerations about autonomy that are alleged {{to be in force}} in other areas of criminal law. Contrary to that general argument, criminalization of <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> does not, in general, bypass the agency of citizens. Moreover, the criminalization of <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> can disrupt activity that would have led to very serious crime, and with relatively low costs to the perpetrators, costs that reflect the non-occurrence of the more serious crime. There is evidence that grooming is harmful in itself, and so another point against the general argument is its assumption that preparatory offences are often harmless or at least victimless. There are objections to some of the undercover policing techniques that lead to a Section 15 prosecution, but these objections are not all weighty...|$|R
