25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called <b>phoresy.</b>|$|E

50|$|In biology, {{the term}} phoresis, also called <b>phoresy,</b> is an inter-species {{biological}} interaction in ecology and {{refers to a}} form of symbiosis where the symbiont, termed the phoront, is mechanically transported by its host.

5000|$|A {{striking}} {{example of}} <b>phoresy</b> is that planidia of beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe will form a group and produce a pheromone that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species; when the male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen, and from there they transfer in turn to a female bee, and finally to the bee nest, where they attack the bee larvae as their hosts.http://esa.confex.com/esa/2007/techprogram/paper_32157.htm ...|$|E

50|$|First-instar mantispids use two {{strategies}} to locate spider eggs: larvae may burrow directly through the silk of egg sacs they find, {{or they may}} board and be carried by female spiders prior to sac production (<b>phoresy),</b> entering the sac as it is being constructed.

Larvae maintain themselves aboard spiders by feeding on spider hemolymph. Transfers of larvae from spider to spider are possible during spider mating or cannibalism.

50|$|The {{harlequin}} beetle (Acrocinus longimanus) {{is a large}} tropical longhorned beetle {{native to}} the Americas, especially from southern Mexico to Brazil in South America. The harlequin beetle feeds on sap and is given this name because of its elaborate pattern of black, red and greenish yellow markings on the wing covers of both sexes. The species name longimanus is a Latin word that refers to the extremely long forelegs (manus) of the males, which are usually longer than the beetle’s entire body. As an adult, the species is very large, with a body that can measure nearly 76 mm (3 inches) in length. It is also famous for carrying pseudoscorpions {{as a form of}} <b>phoresy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Depending {{on their}} species, planidial larvae either {{wait for a}} passing host or {{actively}} seek one out.

Typically such a planidium then enters the body of the host larva, but some of the species attack host eggs [...] - [...] for example some Meloidae feed on the subterranean egg pods of grasshoppers and locusts, and Mantispidae feed on egg purses of spiders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between a remora and its host is most often taken {{to be one of}} commensalism, specifically <b>phoresy.</b> Though it was originally thought that the host to which it attaches for transport gains nothing from the relationship, research [...] indicates that hosts also benefit, given that remoras feed on parasites (such as copepods) and clean sloughing epidermal tissue as well as ingesting scraps of food, feces, and small nekton and zooplankton. The remora benefits by using the host as transport and protection, and also feeds on materials dropped by the host. Controversy surrounds whether a remora's diet is primarily leftover fragments, or the feces of the host. In some species (Echeneis naucrates and E. neucratoides), consumption of host feces is strongly indicated in gut dissections. For other species, such as those found in a host's mouth, scavenging of leftovers is more likely.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} explain male-biased parasitism. Physiological {{costs of}} male sexually selected characteristics can reduce immunocompetence. Alternatively, ecological differences could generate male-biased parasitism. One method of comparing {{the importance of}} the two theories is to investigate patterns of <b>phoresy,</b> which are only likely to be generated by ecological rather than immunological differences between the sexes. Here we studied the pattern of <b>phoresy</b> of the mite, Thinoseius fucicola, on two species of seaweed by hosts, Coelopa frigida and Coelopa pilipes. We found a highly male-biased pattern of <b>phoresy</b> of T. fucicola on both species. These are the first reported instances of sex-biased <b>phoresy</b> in a solely phoretic parasite. We also show the first two cases of size-biased <b>phoresy.</b> We suggest that ecological factors, particularly, male mate searching, generated male biased patterns of <b>phoresy.</b> We highlight the potential importance of studies of <b>phoresy</b> in determining the relative roles of the immunocompetence and ecological theories in generating male-biased parasitism.

40|$|<b>Phoresy</b> is {{a common}} {{dispersal}} behavior among pseudoscorpions.

Twelve flies, each carrying a young pseudoscorpion, were collected in Caatinga vegetation in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Sphenochernes camponoti is a myrmecophilous pseudoscorpion that lives in Camponotus and Acromyrmex colonies.

40|$|Dispersal {{capacity}} plays {{a central}} role in the radiation of animals, facilitating the exploitation of habitats variously distributed in space or in time or both. Many living species are unable to leave a host, crawl around, and find a new host, so they must rely on external factors to be transmitted. Biotical factors may be important in passive transport and the process, by means of which an animal is passively transported by a selected carrier of different species, is known as "phoresy". <b>Phoresy</b> is a phenomenon in which one animal (the phoretic) seeks out and attaches to an animal of another species, with which it does not share any phase of the life cycle, for dispersal, during which time the phoretic animal becomes quiescent, stopping feeding and development. Activity starts again beginning with detachment, induced by stimuli originating from its carrier or the microhabitat. The adaptive traits of <b>phoresy</b> may be categorized as follow: host surface, quiescence, recognition of signals to abandon the carrier and, if needed, synchronization with the host life cycle. <b>Phoresy</b> is exploited by many Arthropods. In Acarina, there are basically four main types of <b>phoresy.</b> First, there is a type in which adult females are the only forms becoming phoretic and attachment is by means of chelicerae, palpal hooks and ambulacral claws, which grasp a seta or a fold of the integument of carrier-host. The second type is represented by mites, in which deutonymphs are phoretic; there is generally no cheliceral or sucker attachment in this group, mites instead hanging on by their ambulacral claws. The third type is similar to the second in that deutonymphs are phoretic; however, in this case, attachment to the host is by means of an anal pedicel formed by a substance, extruded through the anus, which hardens upon coming in contact with air and literally glues the mite to its host. In the fourth type there is a very highly modified deutonymph stage, called hypope, which only occurs at certain times, presumably when environmental conditions are no longer appropriate for the mite. Hypope is simplified morphologically, may have many sucker-like discs or claspers for efficient attachment, and is much more resistant to desiccation than are other stages of the life cycle...|$|E
