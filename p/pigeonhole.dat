5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including <b>pigeonhole</b> sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pigeonhole</b> sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to <b>pigeonhole</b> with different descriptions.|$|E

This innovative way of displaying the postcards was designed by Fiona Coffey.|$|R

25|$|He {{first used}} the <b>pigeonhole</b> principle, a basic {{counting}} argument, in {{the proof of}} a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet's approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat's last theorem, for which he proved the cases n=5 and n=14, and to the biquadratic reciprocity law. The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other researchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{line graph}} L(G) of any graph G is claw-free; L(G) has a vertex for every edge of G, and {{vertices}} are adjacent in L(G) whenever the corresponding edges share an endpoint in G. A line graph L(G) cannot contain a claw, because if three edges e1, e2, and e3 in G all share endpoints with another edge e4 {{then by the}} <b>pigeonhole</b> principle {{at least two of}} e1, e2, and e3 must share one of those endpoints with each other. Line graphs may be characterized in terms of nine forbidden subgraphs; the claw is the simplest of these nine graphs. This characterization provided the initial motivation for studying claw-free graphs.|$|E

25|$|Developments within {{analytic}} {{number theory}} are often refinements of earlier techniques, which reduce the error terms and widen their applicability. For example, the circle method of Hardy and Littlewood was conceived as applying to power series near the unit {{circle in the}} complex plane; it is now thought of in terms of finite exponential sums (that is, on the unit circle, but with the power series truncated). The needs of diophantine approximation are for auxiliary functions that are not generating functions—their coefficients are constructed by use of a <b>pigeonhole</b> principle—and involve several complex variables. The fields of diophantine approximation and transcendence theory have expanded, {{to the point that}} the techniques have been applied to the Mordell conjecture.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Sondheim was {{approached}} by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would <b>pigeonhole</b> him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star {{would be a good}} learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.|$|E
25|$|Shannon's theorem also {{implies that}} no {{lossless}} compression scheme can shorten all messages. If some messages come out shorter, {{at least one}} must come out longer due to the <b>pigeonhole</b> principle. In practical use, this is generally not a problem, because we are usually only interested in compressing certain types of messages, for example English documents as opposed to gibberish text, or digital photographs rather than noise, and it is unimportant if a compression algorithm makes some unlikely or uninteresting sequences larger. However, the problem can still arise even in everyday use when applying a compression algorithm to already compressed data: for example, making a ZIP file of music, pictures or videos that are already in a compressed format such as FLAC, MP3, WebM, AAC, PNG or JPEG will generally result in a ZIP file that is slightly larger than the source file(s).|$|E

25|$|Suppose {{the edges}} of a {{complete}} graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, v. There are 5 edges incident to v and so (by the <b>pigeonhole</b> principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, v, to vertices, r, s and t, are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (r, s), (r, t), (s, t), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red {{and we have an}} entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, any K6 contains a monochromatic K3, and therefore R(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers.|$|E
500|$|Radix sort is a sorting {{algorithm}} {{that works}} for larger keys than <b>pigeonhole</b> sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data.

500|$|<b>Pigeonhole</b> sort or {{counting}} sort {{can both}} sort [...] data items having {{keys in the}} range from [...] to [...] in time [...] In <b>pigeonhole</b> sort (often called bucket sort), pointers to the data items are distributed to a table of buckets, represented as collection data types such as linked lists, using the keys as indices into the table. Then, all of the buckets are concatenated together to form the output list. Counting sort uses a table of counters in place of a table of buckets, to determine the number of items with each key. Then, a prefix sum computation is used to determine the range of positions in the sorted output at which the values with each key should be placed. Finally, in a second pass over the input, each item is moved to its key's position in the output array. Both algorithms involve only simple loops over the input data (taking time [...] ) and over the set of possible keys (taking time [...] ), giving their [...] overall time bound.|$|E
