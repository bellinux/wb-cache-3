In the first part, effective atomization of Jatropha PPO is demonstrated at gas-to-liquid ratios (GLRs) on the order 0. 1.

40|$|Atomization of fuel is an {{important}} pre-requisite for efficient combustion in devices such as gas turbines, liquid propellant rocket engines, internal combustion engines and incinerators. The overall objective of the present work is to explore air-assisted atomization strategies for high viscosity fuels and liquids. Air-assisted atomization is a twin-fluid atomization method in which energy of the gas is used to assist the atomization of liquids. Broadly, three categories of air-assisted injection, i. e., effervescent, impinging jet and pre-filming air-blast are studied. Laser-based diagnostics are used to characterize the spray structure in terms of cone angle, penetration and drop size distribution. A backlit direct imaging method is used to study the macroscopic spray characteristics such as spray structure and spray cone angle while the microscopic characteristics are measured using the Particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique. Effervescent atomization is a technique in which {{a small amount of}} gas is injected into the liquid at high pressure in the form of bubbles. Upon injection, the two-phase mixture expands rapidly and shatters the liquid into droplets and ligaments. Effervescent spray characteristics of viscous fuels such as Jatropha and Pongamia <b>pure</b> <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> and diesel are studied. Measurements are made at various gas-to-liquid ratios (GLRs) and injection pressures. A Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the order of 20 µm is achieved at an injection pressure of 10 bar and GLR of 0. 2 with viscous fuels. An image-based method is proposed and applied to evaluate the unsteadiness in the spray. A map indicating steady/unsteady regime of operation has been generated. An optically accessible injector tip is developed which has enabled visualization of the two-phase flow structure inside the exit orifice of the atomizer. An important contribution of the present work is the correlation of the two-phase flow regime in the orifice with the external spray structure. For viscous fuels, the spray is observed to be steady only in the annular two-phase flow regime. Unexpanded gas bubbles observed in the liquid core even at an injection pressure of 10 bar indicate that the bubbly flow regime may not be beneficial for high viscosity oils. A novel method of external mixing twin-fluid atomization is developed. In this method, two identical liquid jets impinging at an angle are atomized using a gas jet. The effect of liquid viscosity (1 cP to 39 cP) and surface tension (22 mN/m to 72 mN/m) on this mode of atomization is studied by using water-glycerol and water-ethanol mixtures, respectively. An SMD of the order of 40 µm is achieved for a viscosity of 39 cP at a GLR of 0. 13 at a liquid pressure of 8 bar and gas pressure of 5 bar. It is observed that the effect of liquid properties is minimal at high GLRs where the liquid jets are broken before the impingement as in the prompt atomization mode. Finally, a pre-filming air-blast technique is explored for transient spray applications. An SMD of 22 µm is obtained with diesel at liquid and gas pressures as low as 10 bar and 8. 5 bar, respectively. With this technique, an SMD of 44 µm is achieved for Jatropha oil having a viscosity 10 times higher than that of diesel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the work on}} detailed characterization of effervescent spray of Jatropha and Pongamia pure plant oils. The spray characteristics of these biofuels are {{compared with those of}} diesel. Both macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics at different injection pressures and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) have been studied. The particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique along with direct imaging methods are used for the purpose of spray characterization. Due to their higher viscosity, pure plant oils showed poor atomization compared to diesel and a blend of diesel and <b>pure</b> <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> at a given GLR. <b>Pure</b> <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> sprays showed a lower spray cone angle when compared to diesel and blends at lower GLRs. However, the difference is not significant at higher GLRs. Droplet size measurements at 100 mm downstream of the exit orifice showed reduction in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) diameter with increase in GLR. A radial variation in the SMD is observed for the blend and pure plant oils. Pure oils showed a larger variation when compared to the blend. Spray unsteadiness has been characterized based on the image-to-image variation in the mean droplet diameter and fluctuations in the spray cone angle. Results showed that <b>pure</b> <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> sprays are more unsteady at lower GLRs when compared to diesel and blend. A critical GLR is identified at which the spray becomes steady. The three regimes of spray operation, namely ``steady spray,'' ``pulsating spray,'' and ``spray and unbroken liquid jet'' are identified in the injection pressure-GLR parameter space for these pure plant oils. Two-phase flow imaging inside the exit orifice shows that for the pure plant oils, the flow is highly transient at low GLRs and the bubbly, slug, and annular two-phase flow regimes are all observed. However, at higher GLRs where the spray is steady, only the annular flow regime is observed...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for measurement of planar liquid volume fraction in dense sprays {{using a combination}} of Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Particle/Droplet Imaging Analysis (PDIA) is presented in this work. The PLIF images are corrected for loss of signal intensity due to laser sheet scattering, absorption and auto-absorption. The key aspect of this work pertains to simultaneously solving the equations involving the corrected PLIF signal and liquid volume fraction. From this, a quantitative estimate of the planar liquid volume fraction is obtained. The corrected PLIF signal and the corrected planar Mie scattering can be also used together to obtain the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) distribution by using data from the PDIA technique at a particular location for calibration. This methodology is applied to non-evaporating sprays of diesel and a more viscous <b>pure</b> <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> at an injection pressure of 1000 bar and a gas pressure of 30 bar in a high pressure chamber.

The majority of particle bound PAH {{were associated with the}} ultra-fine fraction (diameter range of 0. 01 e 0. 14 mm). The use of a diesel particulate filter reduced B 0 emissions to levels of B 100. While our study was conducted under ideal controlled conditions, our data support the widely held view that biodiesel emissions have a different chemical composition than emissions from petro-diesel. The consequences of this in terms of health and environmental impact should be assessed in wider studie...|$|E

40|$|Distinguishing {{animal fats}} from <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> in archaeological {{residues}} is not straightforward. Characteristic plant sterols, such as beta-sitosterol, are often missing in archaeological samples and specific biomarkers {{do not exist}} for most plant fats. Identification is usually based {{on a range of}} characteristics such as fatty acid ratios, all of which indicate that a <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> may be present, none of which uniquely distinguish <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> from other fats. Degradation and dissolution during burial alter fatty acid ratios and remove short-chain fatty acids, resulting in degraded <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> with similar fatty acid profiles to other degraded fats. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of delta C- 13 (18 : 0) and delta C- 13 (16 : 0), carried out by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS), has provided a means of distinguishing fish oils, dairy fats, ruminant and non-ruminant adipose fats, but <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> are rarely included in these analyses. For modern <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> where C- 18 : 1 is abundant, delta C- 13 (18 : 1) and delta C- 13 (16 : 0) are usually measured. These results cannot be compared with archaeological data or data from other modern reference fats where delta C- 13 (18 : 0) and delta C- 13 (16 : 0) are measured, as C- 18 : 0 and C- 18 : 1 are formed by different processes resulting in different isotopic values. Eight samples of six modern <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> were saponified, releasing sufficient C- 18 : 0 to measure the isotopic values, which were plotted against delta C- 13 (16 : 0). The isotopic values for these oils, with one exception, formed a tight cluster between ruminant and non-ruminant animal fats. This result complicates the interpretation of mixed fatty residues in geographical areas where both animal fats and <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> were in use. ...|$|R
