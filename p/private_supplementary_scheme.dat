40|$|In {{this paper}} we pay {{attention}} to the legitimacy of the principles, scope and purpose of redistribution in Czech society. We use data from international surveys from {{the second half of the}} nineties, including European Values Study 1999 and ISSP 1996 – module Role of the Government and some national Czech surveys. We claim that Czech society does not favour extensive redistribution at the level of principles. Nevertheless, demand for redistribution is stronger compared to the other European countries and preferences for state responsibility and redistribution increased during nineties. Furthermore, the purpose of redistribution seems to play a central role. While benefits for marginalised groups are not supported, mainstream benefits should be increased according to the public, and the strategies to improve human capital and capabilities to adapt in the labour market gain support as well. The Czech public also prefers to combine collective (social) protection with <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> insurance <b>schemes</b> against risks of the contemporary society. There are remarkable differences in most of the above described attitudes among social classes. The above described findings may be explained by the social consequences of market transition: specifically by impacts of new social risks differentiated according to class position combined with restrictive social policies implemented during the nineties.

40|$|Background & Problem discussion: In recent years, private {{tutoring}} in Hong Kong {{and elsewhere}} has expanded into a vast enterprise. <b>Private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring {{could be found}} in Japan and many other countries. <b>Private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring has for decades been provided to primary and secondary school children in Hong Kong. During recent years, there is an increasing number of preschool children who receive <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring. However, it is less vigorous at this level compared to primary and secondary schools. Rather than that, most of the research done has been focused on the factors underlying the demand for <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring for primary and secondary levels, but less focus on the determinants of demand for <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring for preschoolers. Purpose: The purpose of this dissertation is to identify the determinants of demand for <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring for preschool children in Tsuen Wan New Town in Hong Kong. Theoretical framework: The history of preschool education in Hong Kong since 1950 s is presented. Moreover, factors underlying the demand for <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring for primary and secondary levels in two contexts, particularly Asia and Europe are presented. Such theory assisted me in identifying the determinant of demands for private tutoring for preschool children in Tsuen Wan New Town. Method: A qualitative research approach is applied to the dissertation. I have conducted face-to face interviews with four parents whose children study in Discovery Funful Kindergarten in Tsuen Wan New Town. All of the interviews were tape-recorded. Conclusion: The findings show that parents’ attitude towards <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring are positive. Four of the parents perceived tutoring as essential and supplement to kindergarten. They believed that supplementary tutoring could bring a lot of benefits to their children and they recognized the importance of private tutoring. They perceived academic results were not the only determinants when considering sending their children to private tutoring; other determinants of demand particularly personal determinants did play important role. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine a rapidly growing {{educational}} phenomenon in the United States: <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction (<b>private</b> tutoring). This instruction is offered out-of-school time, focused on academic subjects, and provided mostly for a fee. Its primary goal is to help students prepare for college entrance examinations (advancement), or address difficulties in academic subjects (remedial). Using the concept of human capital as the primary theoretical framework, the study examines possible reasons for the use of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction and possible benefits that accrue to individuals from its use. The study examines if families with higher levels of educational aspirations or less academic satisfaction with their schools are more likely to use <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction. It also considers whether students who use supplementary instruction have higher gains in mathematics achievement or higher likelihood of college acceptance. Data for this study come from the National Education Longitudinal Study and includes approximately 7, 600 students who attended high school between 1990 and 1992. Students and parents were asked about the use of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction when students were 12 th graders. Follow-up surveys in 1994 indicated students' post-secondary enrollment status two years later. Analyses of the use and effects of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction are calculated using OLS and logistic regressions. The research findings indicate that families with higher levels of educational aspirations are more likely to use advancement supplementary instruction, and doing so improves students' chance of college acceptance. Advancement instruction may also improve the academic performance of students, particularly students from high-income families. Use of remedial instruction, however, does not seem to improve academic performance or the likelihood of college acceptance for most students, though Asian Americans and African Americans may be exceptions. Family income also appears to play a role in both the use and effects of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction. Although human capital theory helps to explain specific aspects of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction, especially aspects associated with the use of advancement instruction, the study also demonstrates that issues related to use and effects of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> instruction require additional theories to account for social and cultural factors...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} possibility of a relationship between students’ learning approach and attendance to <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring. The phenomenon of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring is prevalent in Hong Kong because of the public examination at the end of senior secondary. There have been numerous researches on <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring in Hong Kong. However there has not been any research relating <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tutoring to learning approach. The research was done using mixed method. For qualitative data Kember, Biggs and Leung’s (2004) Revised Learning Process Questionnaire (R-LPQ- 2 F) was used to identify student’s learning approach. For quantitative date a semi-structured interview was used, containing questions pertaining to learning approach of students. The result of the research was that there was not a strong relationship between students’ learning approach and attendance in private tutorial center. This {{is due to the fact}} that learning approach of students is a dynamic entity and is not stagnant. External and internal factors affect students’ learning approach. Therefore learning approach does not seem to have a strong relationship to attendance to a private tutorial center. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tuition is a {{field of}} study that has almost been {{neglected}} worldwide, by academic scholars and governments alike, despite its complex social and economic implications for society. International research on the field defines all <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tuition programmes as shadow education. By increasing the cost that parents {{have to pay for}} their children to succeed at school, it is argued that shadow education exacerbates already existing social inequalities. Yet, in South Africa, contrary to international literature on the field, innovative funding models exist to assist children of poor individual households and/or parents to benefit from the service provided by shadow entrepreneurs who are paid either by government or the private sector through Corporate Social investment (CSI). Thus, this study aims to add to the literature on shadow education by investigating how one privately administered supplementary tuition programme in South Africa can assist in closing the gap of educational inequalities for some families. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the nature of one <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> tuition programme provided by a service provider, through the experiences of a sample of seven grade 12 learners from Johannesburg that in 2010 took part in the programme. This research takes the form of a qualitative case study and the sources of data used in the research are programme records and interviews. The finding of the study shows that such a tuition programme funded through private funds and delivered by a private service provider provides new opportunities for how such shadow education can help curb rather than exacerbate already existing inequalities in society. Such an outcome therefore calls for more research into the different forms of shadow education that exist in many poor developing countries...|$|R

40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>supplementary</b> {{tutoring}} {{has long}} been a major phenomenon in parts of East Asia, including Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. In recent times it has grown dramatically in other parts of Asia and in Africa, Europe and North America. The factors underlying the growth of private tutoring vary, but in all settings it has major implications for learning and livelihood. Families with the necessary resources are able to secure not only greater quantities but also better qualities of private tutoring. Children receiving such tutoring are then able to perform better in school, and in the long run to improve their lifetime earnings. By contrast, children of low-income families who do not receive such benefits {{may not be able to}} keep up with their peers and may drop out of school at an earlier age. Tutoring also of course has a direct impact on the livelihoods of the tutors, providing employment and incomes for a range of professionals and amateurs of different age groups.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the degree of}} elitism of public education under two different social objectives. It illustrates a potential conflict between welfare and social mobility. In the absence of <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> education, utilitarian welfare increases with the degree of elitism of the public education system. On the other hand, elitism decreases the steady state proportion of heterogenous dynasties (those comprised of a skilled parent and an unskilled child, or vice versa) which is our measure of social mobility. Consequently, social mobility is maximized under the least elitist public education system. We then open up the possibility for skilled parents to invest in <b>private</b> <b>supplementary</b> education for their child. We show that when private education is available, the degree of elitism that maximizes social mobility increases, while the welfare-maximizing degree of elitism decreases, provided that the inequality in productivity between {{the two types of}} agents is large enough.

Besides, It will be also investigated that private tutoring has any positive effects or not. To conduct this research, thirty five respondents were surveyed successfully with a written questionnaire. And classroom observation was done successfully to find out where there was any lacking in English teaching or not. The findings from the survey show that most of the primary level learners receive private tutoring and they are satisfied with the English lesson provided by their private tutor rather than their school teacher. But learners should not fully depend on private tutor. Private tuition has both positive and negative effects.
