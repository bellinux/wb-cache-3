40|$|Ocean {{acoustic}} recordings {{were obtained}} from January through June of 2007 {{at the site of}} a former Unites States Navy listening station to the west of Point Sur, California. These data were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the ambient acoustic noise. Direct comparisons to previous studies conducted at the same location revealed a near identical match of the <b>pressure</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>level</b> in the 50 to 120 Hz frequency band to a 1994 - 2001 study. Comparison to a 1963 - 1965 study revealed a 3 to 5 dB increase in ambient noise over the 60 to 300 Hz frequency band. As expected, relating ambient noise to wind speed revealed a significant (correlation coefficient greater than 0. 5) correlation between 400 Hz and 10 kHz with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0. 78 near 2 kHz. Comparing shipping data from San Francisco and Los Angeles-Long Beach ports to ambient noise in the 10 to 1000 Hz band revealed obvious patterns in the relationship of the number of ships arriving or departing each day and noise level. Due to its proximity, the San Francisco shipping data had a greater effect on the ambient noise level at Point Sur. The largest value of the correlation coefficient between ambient noise and shipping traffic was 0. 55 and occurred at 700 Hz. US Navy (USN) author...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} kinematics {{of waves}} in the surf zone is examined with extensive measurements from the DUCK 94 experiment. Field data {{used in the study}} were obtained from vertical stacks of bi-directional current meters and a pressure sensor mounted on a rigid frame at 3 locations along a cross-shore transect in depths of 2, 4, and 8 m. Observed <b>pressure</b> and velocity <b>spectra</b> are compared to transfer functions based on linear finite depth theory and a simple nonlinear model that accounts for harmonic generation in shallow water. At high frequencies, the observed vertical aftenuation of horizontal velocity spectra in 8 and 4 m depth is much weaker than predicted by linear theory and generally in good agreement with the nonlinear model predictions. In 2 m depth, differences between the linear and nonlinear transfer function are small and both predictions are in reasonable agreement with the observed weak vertical decay. At infragravity frequencies in shallow water depths, observed velocity spectra often show significant vertical decay that is not predicted by either model. Velocity and <b>pressure</b> <b>spectra</b> measured in 4 m depth are in good agreement with the nonlinear transfer function. <b>Pressure</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>levels</b> at high frequencies are shown to be significantly reduced by the nonlinear Bernoulli term in the second order pressure field. Analysis of the slopes of the high-frequency tails of the observed velocity spectra shows considerable scatter with a general tendency for spectra to flatten as waves rotate through the surf zone. U.

This interval is laying in fact on {{the boundary between}} ultra low (ULF) and low frequency (LF) ocean pressure fields. To derive such estimate two types of results are used - results of direct pressure measurements in the frequency range (30 - 10000) mHz obtained by authors in sea coastal regions of former USSR (the Black sea, the Japanese sea, the Barentz sea) during multiyear observation cycles, results of pressure measurements fulfilled by other authors, as well as materials of indirect long period gravity waves parameters measurements fulfilled on the sea surface. The latter results were obtained by oceanologists {{in the form of}} surface wave oscillations spectra and were transformed by authors in bottom pressure variations by recalculation. On the basis of pressure measurement statistical treatment important conclusion is obtained, that pressure fields observed on ocean bottom in frequency range below 1000 mHz are formed presumably by pressure pulsations produced by long period and wind ocean gravity waves...|$|R

40|$|Underwater {{ambient noise}} was {{investigated}} in the stream-mouths of Clear, Cub and Pelican Creeks. Noise levels were determined from 0. 1 to 10 KHz during periods of high stream discharge and wave action. Minimum noise levels could not be determined due to instrument noise interference. Two noise sources contributed to ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>levels</b> in the stream-mouths: (1) flow noise and/or bubbles, and (2) surf-beats. The former is mainly composed of frequencies below 4 KHz while the latter is above 5 KHz. Four cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki) sounds were recorded and analyzed. The 2 ̆ 7 thump 2 ̆ 7 sound occurred when fish were alarmed and gave a sudden tail-flip. The principal frequency was 150 Hz in the band from 100 to 200 Hz. The 2 ̆ 7 squawk 2 ̆ 7 sound had principal frequencies in the band from 600 to 850 Hz. The 2 ̆ 7 squeak 2 ̆ 7 sound was infrequent and usually of low intensity. A sound with maximum energy above 2 KHz was created when a trout shifted bottom materials while preparing a redd. The response to low frequency sound was tested with 29 cutthroat trout. The conditioned response technique was applied using shock or light as the unconditioned stimulus. A positive response was not readily obtained. A natural response to sound stimuli was found in six fish with an average upper frequency limit of 443 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modified}} TNO {{model for the}} prediction of aerofoil trailing-edge noise for wind turbine applications. The capabilities of the current modified model and four variants of the TNO model are analysed through a comprehensive study which includes 10 aerofoils and involves two different wind tunnels. The Reynolds numbers considered are between 1. 13 and 3. 41 million, and the effective angles of attack are between − 2. 20 ° and 13. 58 °. The merit of a model is assessed by comparing two aspects of the numerically predicted and the experimentally measured sound pressure level spectra: the sound pressure level difference between two different aerofoils at similar lift coefficients within a certain frequency range (referred to as the delta noise); and the closeness in terms of spectral magnitude {{and shape of the}} predicted and measured sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectra.</b> The current modified model is developed by deriving new formulations for the computation of the wall <b>pressure</b> fluctuation <b>spectrum.</b> This is achieved by using the approximate ratio of the normal Reynolds stress components for an anisotropic flow over a flat plate to estimate the vertical Reynolds stress component, and by introducing new stretching factors to take the effects of turbulent flow anisotropy into account. Compared with the four TNO model variants tested, the current modified model has strong delta noise prediction ability, and is able to predict sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectra</b> that are more consistent and closer to measurements {{for the vast majority of}} aerofoils and flow conditions tested in the two wind tunnels...|$|R

The point source approximation yields accurate results for the overall sound pressure level, but exaggerates interference dips in the spectrum and thus overestimates the strength of amplitude modulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{set of 2}} -in. {{diameter}} nozzles is used {{to investigate}} the effect of varying exit boundary layer state on the radiated noise from high-subsonic jets. It is confirmed that nozzles involving turbulent boundary layers are the quietest while nozzles involving a "nominally laminar" boundary layer are loud especially on the high-frequency side of the sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The latter boundary layer state involves a "Blasius-like" mean velocity profile but higher turbulence intensities compared {{to those in the}} turbulent state. The higher turbulence in the initial region of the jet shear layer leads to increased high-frequency noise.

Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the fully compressible, three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations {{are used to}} generate an axisymmetric vortex ring to which 3 D stochastic disturbances are added. The disturbances cause instability and turbulent transition of the vortex ring. Detailed information about temporal evolution of sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level,</b> <b>spectrum</b> and directivity associated with modes of oscillation and their turbulent breakdown are investigated. The peak frequency agrees well with experiments, and the modal directivities agree well with predictions of vortex sound theory. Based on the self-similar decay of the turbulent near field, the self-similar decay of the sound field is investigated. We also explore the connections with jet noise by modeling the jet as a de-correlated train of vortex rings. ...|$|R

The noise signals were analyzed by an automated spectrum analyzer which yielded 1 / 3 -octave band sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectra</b> for each microphone, and the data were corrected to remove the effects of atmospheric attenuation and jet noise. It is found that the effect of thickness is large and must be accounted for in any fundamental airfoil noise theory that attempts to describe the noise emitted from real airfoils. Incident mean velocity gradients and compressibility must also be taken into account. The effect of thickness increases with frequency, with thick airfoils being quieter than thin ones...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{are used}} to investigate transonic flow acoustic resonance in an open cavity. The numerical scheme minimizes the errors due to dispersion and dissipation of acoustic waves, and resolves both the unsteady flow and radiated acoustic field. Implicit solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is obtained using a compact high-order spacial differencing scheme, coupled with high-order implicit filters. Second order temporal accuracy is achieved using a time-implicit approximately-factorization, and Newton-like subiterations.

For certain locations of the plate relative to the jet, the resonance takes place with a loud accompanying tone. The sound <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> <b>spectra</b> are often marked by multiple peaks. The frequencies of the spectral peaks are studied {{as a function of}} the streamwise length of the plate, its relative location to the jet as well as the jet Mach number. It is demonstrated that the tones are not due to a simple feedback between the plate's trailing edge and the nozzle's exit; the leading edge of the plate also comes into play in the frequency selection. With parametric variation, it is found that there is an order in the most energetic spectral peaks; their frequencies cluster in distinct bands.
