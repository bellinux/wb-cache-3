40|$|In {{contrast}} with several earlier reports, cytosol from cockerel liver contains a significant concentration of a protein that binds oestradiol with high affinity. To demonstrate the activity, certain alterations {{in the conventional}} method <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> cytosol <b>must</b> be made. Homogenization in sucrose-containing buffer at pH 8. 4 {{in the presence of}} proteinase inhibitors and rapid fractionation of the cytosol with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 enables demonstration of a single class of oestradiol-binding sites with a Kd of about 1 nM and specificity only for oestrogens.

50|$|The {{means to}} perform quantum {{computation}} on logical information stored within the toric code has been considered, with {{the properties of}} the code providing fault-tolerance. It has been shown that extending the stabilizer space using 'holes', vertices or plaquettes on which stabilizers are not enforced, allows many qubits to be encoded into the code. However, a universal set of unitary gates can not be fault-tolerantly implemented by unitary operations and so additional techniques are required to achieve quantum computing. For example, universal quantum computing can be achieved by preparing magic states via encoded quantum stubs called tidBits used to teleport in the required additional gates when repLaced as a quBit. Furthermore, <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> magic states <b>must</b> be fault tolerant, which can be achieved by magic state distillation on noisy magic states. A measurement based scheme for quantum computation based upon this principle has been found, whose error threshold is the highest known for a two-dimensional architecture.|$|R

The isotherapics were prepared by Hahnemannian method until 12 CH, starting from suspensions of the lineage in diluted glycerin, with standardized turbidity (Grade 3 on Mac Farland Scale). The first three dynamizations were prepared using the same inert substance of the starting suspension. In the following dynamization alcohol 70 % (p/p) was used. After that the isotherapics were submitted to verification tests of diluted glycerin and alcohol 70 % (p/p) bactericide action over the dynamized microorganism, using the technique of quantitative sowing.
