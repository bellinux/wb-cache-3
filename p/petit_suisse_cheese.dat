40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the age of}} introduction of <b>petit</b> <b>suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> and instant noodles in the diet of infants attending nurseries of public day care centers and to compare the nutritional composition of these foods with the healthy recommended diet (breast milk and salt meal) for this age, in order to estimate nutritional errors. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 366 children (from nine to 36 months old) who attended day care centers, whose mothers were interviewed {{about the age of}} introduction of those foods. The means of the nutrients indicated on the labels of the most consumed brands were considered. For the calculation of the percent composition of breast milk and salt meal, Tables of Food Composition were used. To assess the nutritional adequacy, we used the Dietary Reference Intakes by age group. The percentage of adequacy evaluation of the <b>petit</b> <b>suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> and the instant noodles nutritional compositions was made by comparing them with those of the human milk and the salt meal, respectively. Results: The <b>petit</b> <b>suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> and the instant noodles were consumed by 89. 6 and 65. 3 % {{of the children in the}} first year of life. The percentages of adequacy for carbohydrates were more than twice and the percentages for sodium were 20 times higher than those found in the recommended foods. Conclusions: Both industrialized products are inappropriate for infants, emphasizing the need for adoption of norms that can inform health professionals, educators and parents about the risks of consumption...|$|E

40|$|As in {{the case}} of {{probiotic}} functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with added sweeteners. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present. Thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored <b>Petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> during its shelf life. The ideal sucrose concentration was determined using the just-about-right (JAR) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. Microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. The results showed that the compounds Neotame (NutraSweet, Chicago, IL) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. None of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E

40|$|Seis amostras comerciais de queijo petit suisse foram coletadas em supermercados da cidade de Campinas e analisadas quanto à composição química, capacidade de retenção de água, propriedades reológicas e aceitação sensorial. Os produtos comerciais diferiram especialmente em relação ao tipo de hidrocolóide adicionado e na relação proteína/gordura. O produto B apresentou uma capacidade de retenção de água maior que o dobro da apresentada pelas demais amostras. Este produto apresentou uma relação proteína/gordura intermediária e continha os hidrocolóides concentrado protéico de soro (CPS) e pectina. A amostra E apresentou os maiores valores de viscosidade aparente (etaa), viscosidade complexa (eta*), módulo de armazenamento (G&# 146;), módulo de dissipação (G&# 146;&# 146;) e também apresentou a maior relação proteína/gordura, sugerindo haver boa correlação entre a razão proteína/gordura e os parâmetros reológicos. A relação proteína/gordura influenciou significativamente os valores G&# 146;, G&# 146;&# 146; e eta*, confirmando a influência da composição do produto na estrutura e na elasticidade do queijo petit suisse. Todas as amostras mostraram comportamento viscoelástico, sendo que G&# 146; (o caráter elástico) foi maior que G&# 146;&# 146; (o caráter viscoso), em todas as freqüências estudadas. Todas as amostras apresentaram características de "gel fraco" com a relação G&# 146;/G&# 146;&# 146; entre 3 e 4. Houve diferença significativa (p The {{chemical}} composition, water holding capacity, {{rheological properties}} and sensory acceptability of six commercial brands of Brazilian petit suisse cheeses collected from local markets, where analyzed after 20 days of storage at temperatures between 8 and 12 °C. The commercial products differed mainly {{with respect to}} the type of hydrocolloid added and protein/fat ratio. Product B showed more than two times the water holding capacity as compared to the other samples presenting an intermediate protein/fat ratio and whey protein concentrate and pectin added. The highest apparent viscosity, complex viscosity, G&# 146; and G&# 146;&# 146; where presented by product E which also showed the highest protein/fat ratio, suggesting that there was a good correlation between these rheological parameters and protein/fat ratio. The protein/fat ratio significantly influenced (p< 0, 05) G&# 146;, G&# 146;&# 146; and the complex viscosity, showing the impact of product composition on the <b>petit</b> <b>suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> structure and elasticity.

40|$|Companies are {{in direct}} {{competition}} and increasingly use quality programs {{to try to}} maintain market share. In this context, the customer becomes a fundamental part {{of the success of}} any product launched, being a rich source of ideas. The satisfaction of customer needs is a quality definition. A quality tool that aims to translate the customer's desire is QFD (Quality Function Deployment). This piece of research was motivated by a situation observed in a Dairy Industry located in CearÃ in relation to low demand production with negative impact on productivity rates, packet loss and overall efficiency of the processing line for <b>Petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese.</b> Thus, the objective was to study the identification of quality characteristics with regard to <b>Petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese,</b> jointly applying QFD methodologies and Sensory Analysis for product improvement using Matrix of Quality of the final product. Four brands of <b>Petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese</b> were selected, two international (reference top business minds in the industry) and two regional (local reference companies in the Northeast). A focus group technique was applied using questions directed at the characteristics of the product, and in this way it was possible to obtain information about the concept and product quality. Two groups of seven participants, chosen from the young adult segment, formed focus groups. Exploratory research was also used (qualitative questionnaires) with general questions about the product. Sensory acceptance tests and measurement of expectation were applied to verify acceptance and consumer expectations regarding the product were studied. To quantify the data obtained in the qualitative stage, we applied quantitative questionnaires consisting of items concerning required qualities. The data obtained during the previous steps have been inserted in the Matrix Quality, which presented the items of required quality (requirements of consumers) versus the quality characteristics of the final product. In the qualitative questionnaires, the nutritious aspects, those related to the product being healthy, and those meaning it was affordable were highlighted as ideal product. For the consumerâs focus group, {{it was found that the}} most striking feature was the consistency of the product followed by the flavor attribute and then the color. The sensory analysis showed that the Petit Suisse product is well accepted and the products of regional and international brands achieved equal acceptance in the blind test, showing the competitive potential of regional brands. The measure of expectations revealed consumer loyalty to brands. Regarding the physicochemical analyses, the international samples (M 2 and M 3) showed higher protein. The M 1 sample showed the highest percentage of fat and the M 4 sample had high acidity. The application of the Sensory Analysis and QFD together made it possible to prepare the Quality Matrix for identifying which quality characteristics are most relevant to the Petit Suisse product in the opinion of the 11 consumer, namely: the expiration date, being nutritious, having nutrition information on the la bel, creamy consistency, absence of supernatant liquid, characteristic flavor and sweet taste. The color and aroma attributes had less importance in the Quality Matrix. Thus, it was possible to highlight which features should be considered important when responding to consumersâ wishes regarding the Petit Suisse product. As empresas estÃo em plena competiÃÃo e cada vez mais utilizando programas de qualidade para tentar manter-se no mercado. Nesse contexto, o cliente torna-se parte fundamental do sucesso de um produto lanÃado, sendo uma fonte rica de ideias. A satisfaÃÃo das necessidades dos clientes Ã uma das definiÃÃes de qualidade. Uma ferramenta de qualidade que tem o objetivo de traduzir o desejo do cliente Ã o QFD (Desdobramento da FunÃÃo Qualidade). Esta pesquisa foi motivada por uma situaÃÃo observada em uma IndÃstria de LaticÃnios localizada no CearÃ em relaÃÃo Ã baixa demanda de produÃÃo com impacto negativo nos Ãndices de produtividade, de perda de embalagem e de eficiÃncia global da linha de processamento do queijo Petit Suisse. Dessa forma, objetivou-se estudar a identificaÃÃo de caracterÃsticas de qualidade do queijo Petit Suisse, aplicando conjuntamente as metodologias QFD e AnÃlise Sensorial para melhoria do produto atravÃs da Matriz da Qualidade do produto final. Selecionaram-se quatro marcas de queijo Petit suisse, sendo duas internacionais (empresas de referÃncia top of mind no setor) e duas regionais (empresas locais de referÃncia no Nordeste). Aplicou-se a tÃcnica de grupo focal utilizando roteiro de perguntas direcionadas Ãs caracterÃsticas do produto, em que foi possÃvel obter informaÃÃes sobre o conceito e qualidade do produto. Dois grupos com sete participantes do segmento de consumidores referentes a adultos jovens formaram os grupos de foco. Utilizou-se ainda a pesquisa exploratÃria (questionÃrios qualitativos) com questionamentos gerais sobre o produto. Testes sensoriais de aceitaÃÃo e medida de expectativa foram aplicados para verificar a aceitaÃÃo e a expectativa do consumidor em relaÃÃo ao produto estudado. Para quantificaÃÃo dos dados conseguidos na etapa qualitativa, aplicaram-se questionÃrios quantitativos constituÃdos dos itens de qualidade exigida. Os dados obtidos nas etapas anteriores foram inseridos na Matriz da Qualidade, que apresentou os itens de qualidade exigida (requisitos dos consumidores) versus as caracterÃsticas de qualidade do produto final. Na aplicaÃÃo de questionÃrios qualitativos os aspectos nutritivos, os relacionados ao produto ser saudÃvel e preÃo acessÃvel foram ressaltados como caracterÃsticas de produto ideal. Para os consumidores do grupo de foco, verificou-se que a caracterÃstica mais marcante do produto foi a consistÃncia seguida do atributo sabor e, posteriormente da cor. As anÃlises sensoriais mostraram que o produto Petit suisse Ã bem aceito e que os produtos das marcas regionais e internacionais alcanÃaram iguais mÃdias de aceitaÃÃo no teste cego, mostrando o potencial competitivo das marcas regionais. A medida de expectativa revelou fidelizaÃÃo dos consumidores Ãs marcas conhecidas. Em relaÃÃo Ãs anÃlises fÃsico-quÃmicas as amostras internacionais (M 2 e M 3) apresentaram maiores valores de proteÃna. A amostra M 1 apresentou maior percentual de gordura e a amostra M 4 apresentou acidez elevada. AtravÃs da aplicaÃÃo conjunta da AnÃlise Sensorial e QFD foi possÃvel elaborar a Matriz da Qualidade para identificaÃÃo de quais caracterÃsticas de qualidade sÃo mais relevantes do produto Petit suisse na visÃo do consumidor, sendo elas: data de validade, ser nutritivo, informaÃÃes nutricionais no rÃtulo, consistÃncia cremosa, ausÃncia de lÃquido sobrenadante, sabor caracterÃstico e gosto doce. Os atributos cor e o aroma ficaram com pesos menores na Matriz da Qualidade. Dessa forma, foi possÃvel destacar quais caracterÃsticas devem ser consideradas como relevantes para o atendimento do desejo do consumidor em relaÃÃo ao produto Petit Suisse...|$|E

40|$|Introdução: As concentrações séricas pós-operatórias de cálcio (Ca) ou paratormônio (PTH) têm sido aventadas como preditoras de hipoparatireoidismo após tireoidectomia total (TT). Porém, ainda não foram estabelecidos padrões mundialmente aceitos para tal fim. Objetivos: Identificar precocemente o hipoparatireoidismo pós-operatório, em pacientes submetidos à TT, por meio da dosagem de Ca e PTH séricos nas primeiras 24 horas após a cirurgia. Casuística e Métodos: Foram estudados, prospectivamente, 76 pacientes operados entre 2013 e 2014. Foram dosados Ca sérico na véspera, durante a TT, com 1, 8, 14 e 24 horas (h) de pós-operatório (PO), e PTH antes, durante, com 1 e 8 h PO. Os pacientes foram reavaliados com 7, 30 dias e com 6 meses PO e classificados como: sem hipoparatireoidismo (SH), com hipoparatireoidismo temporário (HT) ou com hipoparatireoidismo permanente (HP). Resultados: 40 pacientes (52, 6 %) foram incluídos no SH, 24 (31, 6 %) no HT e 12 (15, 8 %) no HP. O sexo feminino foi mais prevalente nos três grupos [SH: 85 %; HT: 91, 7 %; HP: 100 %; p G 2 >G 1; p 6 % do Ca em 24 h associado a queda do PTH > 70 % em 1 h ou 36 % em 8 h apresentou sensibilidade combinada de 94 % e 97 % para predição de hipocalcemia. Valores de Ca 8, 4 mg/dL em 24 h associados a PTH 15, 6 pg/mL em 1 h predizem hipocalcemia com sensibilidade de 94 % e especificidade de 68 %. Quedas mais acentuadas (93 %) do PTH, associadas a Ca 8, 4 mg/dL mostraram sensibilidade de 100 % e especificidade de 80 % para HP. Conclusões: As dosagens de Ca e PTH séricos nas primeiras 24 horas após TT foram preditoras de hipoparatireoidismo. Os valores absolutos e a variação percentual negativa do Ca maior que 10 % e do PTH maior que 75 % nas primeiras 24 h, quando comparados aos valores basais, aumentaram o risco para HT, enquanto que reduções de Ca maiores que 20 % e de PTH maiores que 90 %, aumentaram o risco para HP. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the production, physical-chemical characteristics, {{and the application of}} betalains derived from beetroots (Beta vulgaris L.) microencapsulated by spray drying using carrier agents. Initially, we assessed the influence of process conditions (temperature and drying air flow-rate, concentration and formulation of carrier agents) on the water content of the microcapsules, process yield, solubility, betalain retention and color parameters through a central composite design 24. Particles were produced using blends of two carrier agents: maltodextrin 10 DE (Md) and modified corn starch (Am). Taking into account the results of the experimental design, a group of four samples was selected to be further evaluated regarding morphology, particle size distribution, sorption isotherms, antioxidant activity, glass transition temperature and stability to light and pH. In addition, these samples were applied as natural colorant in a model formulation of <b>petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese,</b> which was subjected to sensory evaluation for acceptance and purchase intention along with a sample of the corresponding commercial product. In all the production trials, the microcapsules presented low water content values (0. 16 to 2. 91 %) and high solubility (> 90 %). The yield ranged from 2. 96 to 81. 34 %, and betalain retention in the microcapsules ranged between 40 and 46 %. Samples with higher total carrier concentration resulted in larger particles and smoother walls, which are related to increased viscosity of the mixture to be dried; further, they were more stable under light exposure, presenting lower color changes up to 98 days of study. The encapsulation process provided high protection to the antioxidant compounds of betalains, keeping more than 70 % of the activity in these samples when compared to the results obtained for the pure extract. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in capsules with higher amount of modified starch in the formulation, as opposed to the glass transition temperature that showed higher values, thus more convenient, for the samples containing more maltodextrin, which demonstrated the protective role of these carrier agents when used together. With respect to pH, microencapsulated samples were more stable than the liquid extract, with preservation of the color, particularly at pH 8, at which there was an evident browning in the extract. The capsules also remained stable regarding color parameters in a wider range of pH when compared to the pure extract. The particles showed low hygroscopicity and the best mathematical adjustment for the sorption isotherms was obtained by the BET model. In the sensorial analysis of <b>petit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>cheese,</b> the samples containing beet extract microcapsules as a natural dye obtained answers that were in the majority among "I would probably buy" and "I doubt whether I would buy or not" the product displayed.
