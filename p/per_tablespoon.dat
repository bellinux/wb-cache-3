25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5grams <b>per</b> <b>tablespoon</b> of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{ratio of}} coffee to {{water for the}} style of coffee most {{prevalent}} in Europe, America, and other Westernized nations (evident in publications such as textbooks on coffee and instruction manuals for drip-brew machines) is between one and two tablespoons of ground coffee per six ounces (180 millilitres) of water; the full two <b>tablespoons</b> <b>per</b> six ounces tends to be recommended by experienced coffee lovers. A more exact weight ratio of 1:17 coffee and water is also used in publications.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} form of non-chemical {{control is}} to wipe and wash affected plant parts with lukewarm water and soap, insecticidal soap or dish soap, one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>per</b> gallon of water; strong soaps or detergents may damage the plant. This {{can also be}} sprayed if the plant is large but is much less effective than when combined with physical removal. After allowing the soap to sit for a while the sooty mold is rinsed off with a hose/ water. Sooty mold will regrow, unless the underlying reason for its growth is eliminated.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the amount of Candida albicans in vaginal secretion of Vaginal Candidiasis patients administered with Zn-enriched virgin coconut oil. Thirty respondents were selected based on several criteria as follows: the number of C. albicans colonies in the vaginal secretion was more than 105 cfu. ml- 1, voluntary, healthy, willing to sign the informed consent and resided in Purwokerto. In Group A, 10 women were administered 2 <b>tablespoons</b> <b>per</b> day of Zn-enriched virgin coconut oil. In Group B, 10 women were administered 1 <b>tablespoon</b> <b>per</b> day of Zn-enriched virgin coconut oil; and in Group C, 10 women served as control group. Vaginal secretions were taken 3 times, before intervention (at baseline time), at 1 month and 2 months after intervention. Samples were taken by collecting vaginal secretions from the vaginal proximal region using a sterile cotton bud, which was then put into a tube containing sterile carrier media. The vaginal secretions were tested {{for the number of}} total C. albicans using Pour Plate Method. Two months after treatment, the number of colonies decreased from 4. 4 x 106 to 2. 5 x 106 cfu ml- 1 (p= 0. 03) in Group A. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of colonies between Group A and Group B, the number of C. albicans colonies was still above the normal range. Therefore, the recommended dosage of intervention with Zn-enriched virgin coconut oil is one tablespoon a day...|$|R

500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no {{more than a couple}} of <b>tablespoons</b> <b>per</b> [...] cups of oil" [...] used. This oil absorption rate is around the same as occurs with shallow frying, such as in a pan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proportions}} of linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>per</b> day (15 ml) of hempseed oil easily provides human daily requirements for EFAs. Advocates of hempseed oil hold that unlike flaxseed oil, hempseed oil {{can be used}} continuously without developing a deficiency or other imbalance of EFAs. This has supposedly been demonstrated in a small clinical study of 14 people, where the daily ingestion of flaxseed oil [...] "resulted in {{a higher proportion of}} ALA" [...] in serum cholesteryl esters and triglycerides as compared with the ingestion of hempseed oil. However, the hempseed oil [...] "resulted in higher {{proportions of}} both LA and gamma-linolenic acid" [...] as compared with the flaxseed oil ingestion, and the conclusion talks of [...] "only minor effects on concentrations of fasting serum total or lipoprotein lipid".|$|R
50|$|Guppies {{prefer a}} hard-water {{aquarium}} with a temperature between 25.5 and 27.8 C and salt levels equivalent to one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>per</b> 5 gal. They can withstand levels of salinity up to 150% that of normal seawater, {{which has led}} to them being occasionally included in marine tropical community tanks, as well as in freshwater tropical tanks. Guppies are generally peaceful, though nipping behaviour is sometimes exhibited between male guppies or towards other top swimmers like members of the Xiphophorus genus (platies and swordtails), and occasionally other fish with prominent fins, such as angelfish. Guppies should not be kept as a single fish in an aquarium because both males and females show signs of shoaling, and are usually found in large groups in the wild. Its most famous characteristic is its propensity for breeding, and it can breed in both freshwater and marine aquaria.|$|R

40|$|Figure 1. A plain {{abdominal}} radiograph for an HIV-infected {{patient who}} was disoriented and had tachypnea and tinnitus on presentation. Note that bismuth precipitation (arrow) within the bowel gives the illu-sion of a barium study. This radiograph also demonstrates that bismuth is a radiopaque material, which was {{collected in the}} colonic mucosa. Diagnosis: Pepto-Bismol Poisoning This patient presented {{with a history of}} consuming 16 oz of Pepto-Bismol (Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) per day; the patient was receiving 4, 160 mg of salicylate and 8, 383 mg of bismuth per day. He was self-medicating himself in an effort to relieve unrelenting abdominal pain. The maximum dosage listed for Pepto-Bismol is 8 <b>tablespoons</b> <b>per</b> 24 -hour period. This patient was exceeding the daily dosage by at least four times the recom-mended amount, but it is of more interest that he was accumulating chronic stores of both salicylate and bismuth...|$|R
50|$|The Holland Lop rabbit {{should be}} fed daily with good quality pellets, fresh vegetables, and {{unlimited}} grass or timothy hay, {{as well as}} fresh water. Pellets should be fed one ounce per pound of body weight. Rabbits enjoy {{many different types of}} fresh vegetables, such as romaine lettuce, endives, parsley, coriander, dill, fennel and arugula, as well as carrots. Fresh leafy vegetables should be fed at a rate of at least 1 packed cup per 2 pounds of body a day. Leafy greens high in oxalic acid, such as parsley and spinach, should not be fed every day. Non-leafy vegetables such as carrots or peppers should be fed in much smaller quantities, about 1 <b>tablespoon</b> <b>per</b> 2 pound of body weight per day. Alfalfa hay or alfalfa based pellets should only be fed to juvenile rabbits under 1 year. Treats from pet supplies stores are often not particularly safe for rabbits to ingest. They often are high in sugar or fat, or contain foods that rabbits cannot digest.|$|R
40|$|Amoebiasis is {{the disease}} of large {{intestine}} or liver caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It is anaerobic parasitic protozoan, motile, {{commonly found in}} human intestine {{and it is also}} found in animals example like cat and goat but it's definitive host is human beings. It's Infective stage is quadric nucleated cyst is called trophozoite. Invasive intestinal amoebiasis is initiated with attachment of trophozoite to the colonic mucous layer and it starts the mucous disruption and depletion. Mucous secreted by fecal. Infection spread mainly by soiled hands, contaminated water and food or direct contact with carrier containing cysts of the protozoa. Man who has sex with man can also become infected. Approximately 50 million people have invasive disease resulting in 1, 00, 000 death/year. After malaria it is the second severe disease because the parasite has a worldwide distribution so it is called worldwide disease. More than 10 % of the population has been reported from various developing countries. A 1998 study in Africa suggests that 2 <b>tablespoons</b> <b>per</b> week of papaya seeds may have some antiamoebic action and aid in prevention of amoebiasis, but this remains unconfirmed. Papaya fruit and seeds are often considered beneficial to digestion in areas where this plant is common...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{guidelines}} recommend avoiding foods high in saturated fat. Yet, emerging {{evidence suggests}} cardiometabolic benefits of dairy products and dairy fat. Evidence {{on the role}} of butter, with high saturated dairy fat content, for total mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the association of butter consumption with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in general populations. We searched 9 databases from inception to May 2015 without restriction on setting, or language, using keywords related to butter consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes. Prospective cohorts or randomized clinical trials providing estimates of effects of butter intake on mortality, cardiovascular disease including coronary heart disease and stroke, or diabetes in adult populations were included. One investigator screened titles and abstracts; and two reviewed full-text articles independently in duplicate, and extracted study and participant characteristics, exposure and outcome definitions and assessment methods, analysis methods, and adjusted effects and associated uncertainty, all independently in duplicate. Study quality was evaluated by a modified Newcastle-Ottawa score. Random and fixed effects meta-analysis pooled findings, with heterogeneity assessed using the I 2 statistic and publication bias by Egger's test and visual inspection of funnel plots. We identified 9 publications including 15 country-specific cohorts, together reporting on 636, 151 unique participants with 6. 5 million person-years of follow-up and including 28, 271 total deaths, 9, 783 cases of incident cardiovascular disease, and 23, 954 cases of incident diabetes. No RCTs were identified. Butter consumption was weakly associated with all-cause mortality (N = 9 country-specific cohorts; <b>per</b> 14 g(1 <b>tablespoon)</b> /day: RR = 1. 01, 95 %CI = 1. 00, 1. 03, P = 0. 045); was not significantly associated with any cardiovascular disease (N = 4; RR = 1. 00, 95 %CI = 0. 98, 1. 02; P = 0. 704), coronary heart disease (N = 3; RR = 0. 99, 95 %CI = 0. 96, 1. 03; P = 0. 537), or stroke (N = 3; RR = 1. 01, 95 %CI = 0. 98, 1. 03; P = 0. 737), and was inversely associated with incidence of diabetes (N = 11; RR = 0. 96, 95 %CI = 0. 93, 0. 99; P = 0. 021). We did not identify evidence for heterogeneity nor publication bias. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests relatively small or neutral overall associations of butter with mortality, CVD, and diabetes. These findings do not support a need for major emphasis in dietary guidelines on either increasing or decreasing butter consumption, in comparison to other better established dietary priorities; while also highlighting the need for additional investigation of health and metabolic effects of butter and dairy fat...|$|R
