He worked at Standard & Poor’s in the Corporate Bond Rating division, with <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to assign bond ratings to electric, gas and telephone industries. From 1982-1988, Scotto served as Director of Corporate Bond Research for L. F. Rothschild and head of its utility analytical team. Mr. Scotto then moved to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) where he was Director of High Grade and High Yield Corporate Bond research until 1994, and was then recruited by Bear Stearns as Managing Director of High Grade, High Yield, and Emerging Market Research as well as Senior Electric Utility analyst. In April 2000, Mr. Scotto moved to BNP Paribas as Director of U.S. High Grade Research and Senior Utility Analyst. Following the Enron report released while at BNP Paribas and his subsequent firing, in 2002 Mr. Scotto founded Whitehall Financial Advisors LLC to offer independent research, forensic financial analysis, consulting services to corporate clients, institutional investors and State and Federal legislators.|$|R

A {{potential benefit}} of profiling of tissue samples using microarrays is the generation of molecular fingerprints that will define subtypes of disease. Hierarchical clustering has been the <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> tool used to define disease subtypes from microarray experiments in cancer settings. Assessing cluster reliability poses a major complication in analyzing output from these procedures. While much work has been done on assessing the global question of number of clusters in a dataset, relatively little research exists on assessing stability of individual clusters. We address this problem by developing cluster stability scores using subsampling techniques. These scores exploit the redundancy in biologically discriminatory information on the chip. Our approach is generic and can be used with any clustering algorithm. We propose procedures for calculating cluster stability scores for situations involving both known and unknown numbers of clusters. The methods are illustrated on data from a childhood cancer study (Khan et al., 2001) ...|$|R

Drawing on two empirical studies on the life plans of young adults in Switzerland, the chapter then fleshes out how neoliberal subjectivity manifests in young people’s understandings of themselves. The final section relates the findings to studies from other contexts and discusses {{the consequences of this}} selfconcept of young adults.

40|$|Abstract] A major task in urine {{drug testing}} is to detect heroin intake.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of the unique heroin metabolite 6 -acelylmorphine (6 -AM) as the <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> target in combination with morphine in the screening assay. A total number of 3521 randomly collected urine samples from 707 patients undergoing heroin substitution treatment were investigated for 6 -AM and opiates by CEDIA (cloned enzyme donor immunoassay) and for opiates by DRI immunoassays and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (free 6 -AM, free morphine, total morphine, and total codeine).

Numerical integration techniques are applied to compute the structural reliability. The predicted reliability accounts for scatter due to variability in material strength, applied load, fabrication and assembly processes. The influence of structural geometry and mode of failure are also considerations in the evaluation. Example problems are given to illustrate various levels of analytical complexity...|$|R

30|$|Ivanov et al. [19, 20] have convincingly {{documented}} the oscillatory condensation of organosilanols (e.g., R 2 Si(OH) 2 or RR'Si(OH) 2). There are several analogies between the results presented {{in their studies}} and those found in our own laboratory, which have inspired us {{to focus on the}} dynamics of condensation or peptidization of chiral low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids. For this reason, and because of the potential importance of this process in synthetic biology and chemical evolution, we have decided to focus on the issue of peptidization of amino acids coupled to their oscillatory chiral conversion [16]. More specifically, we scrutinize here the dynamics of peptidization of the low-molecular-weight amino acids, R-, S-, and rac-phenylglycine. The <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> tool that we employ to monitor the spontaneous peptidization of phenylglycine samples dissolved in 70 % aqueous ethanol is a non-chiral high-performance liquid chromatographic system with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). We also supplement this technique with mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, we propose three models that go beyond the schemes developed earlier [11] to capture key aspects of the condensation and oscillatory chiral conversion processes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} present {{paper is to}} study the {{flexural}} behaviors of concrete T-beams prestressed with external carbon fiber reinforced polymer(CFRP) tendons. Tests were carried out on 5 beams under four-point load, of which four beams were reinforced with hybrid both external CFRP tendons and internal steel rebars and another one only reinforced with internal steel rebars. Such parameters as the different initial loading states at external CFRP tendon jacking and different jacking stress in tendon were considered in experiment. A program was developed to predict the behaviors of those beams prestressed with externally prestressed tendons and the parametric study was conducted using the program. The predicted results from the program were in good agreement with the test results. Such parameters as jacking stress, elastic modulus of external tendons, configuration of deviators and ratio of span to effective depth of beam were chosen as <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> factors for the study on the flexural behaviors of beams prestressed with external tendons. The initial loading state on the beam before tendon jacking has no significant influence on the ultimate loading capacity and deflection. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{contemporary}} {{studies of}} Africa the Westphalian style ‘sovereign state’ is often utilised as the <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> tool. As {{this concept of}} sovereignty presumes {{that the state is}} in a sense ‘all powerful’, it often glosses over the complex discourses that take place in the creation of effective networks of power within African countries. This dissertation will challenge this Westphalian concept of sovereignty in regards to Africa through examining the recent growth of resource extraction on the continent. Resource extraction brings in a diverse group of both internal and external actors who all seek to forge their own networks of power within the countries in which they operate. This reality requires a more nuanced concept of sovereignty, which holds more real world explanatory power. Through a case study of the rapid growth of oil extraction in Angola, this dissertation seeks to form a more subtle picture of Angolan sovereignty, with ramifications for Africa as a whole. What will be concluded is that Westphalian sovereignty does not hold the necessary explanatory power, with a theory of ‘complex sovereignty’ being seen as more appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of metabolic pathways for dysfunction {{has been used}} for many years in the scientific and medical community to determine overall health. Metabo-nomics (metabolomics), the global profiling of metabolites, has experienced a rekind-ling of interest due, in part, to advances in analytical instrumentation for conducting measurements and informatics available for interpretation of the data acquired in this area of biomedical research. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches are two <b>primary</b> <b>analytical</b> methods of choice for conducting metabonomic measurements. To overcome the complexity and wide dynamic range of concentrations of metabolites present in biological samples, a common practice is to couple online an analytical separation, typically high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with the mass spectrometer. Hence, of critical importance are not only the MS acquisition parameters, but also optimization of those variables that impact the analytical HPLC separation as well.
