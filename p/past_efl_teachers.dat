The purposes of this study were to examine whether there is any significant difference between inexperienced and experienced <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> regarding their classroom management, and also this study investigated whether there is any significant difference between males and females <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> in terms of classroom management. One hundred and eighty four teachers completed Behaviour and Instructional Management Scale (BIMS) (Martin & Sass, 2010). The findings showed statistically significant difference between the mean scores of inexperienced and experienced <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> regarding their classroom management. Experienced <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> were found to be more controlling (interventionist) on both behaviour and instructional management subtests. The findings also demonstrated that there was statistically significant difference between male and female <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> in terms of classroom management, which is that male <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> were more interventionist than their female counterparts on two subtests of the BIMS Inventory...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{perceptions}} of South Korean English as a Foreign Language (<b>EFL)</b> <b>teachers</b> {{on the use of}} corporal punishment in the classroom, including cultural factors and factors stemming from the educational system that lead Korean <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> to use corporal punishment, whether Korean <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> believe that benefits of corporal punishment outweigh the negatives, and whether Korean <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> use corporal punishment because they truly believe it helps their students, or because of factors stemming from the educational system. An interview-based, qualitative study method was used in a Korean public middle school; six Korean <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> were interviewed. It was determined that educational system factors led Korean <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> to use and/or support the use of corporal punishment—rather than the belief that corporal punishment helped their students. The teachers acknowledged some of the negative effects, but most of them believed the benefits outweighed the negatives, which in turn led them to perceive corporal punishment as beneficial in managing Korean EFL classrooms—particularly classrooms with 40 or more students...|$|R

The effective/good {{characteristics of the}} <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> perceived by the students have been extensively investigated by the previous research works. However, {{the perceptions of the}} students from different backgrounds to <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> may vary in different learning settings. In addition, the research works on both favorable and unfavorable characteristics of <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> are comparatively scarce. This study aimed to investigate the favorable and unfavorable characteristics of the <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> perceived by Thai university students. The data were collected from 6 o students at Vongchavalitkul University. Open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used as the main instruments for data collection. Useful information about EFL teachers’ personal trait-related characteristics and classroom teaching-related characteristics emerged from the data. The information is very useful and beneficial for the <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> to reflect their personal characteristics and reconsider their classroom teaching, which may be very helpful for them to do some adjustment and preparation in their teaching to achieve better education results...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{experience}} of prospective English as a Foreign Language (<b>EFL)</b> <b>teachers</b> enrolled in pre-service teacher education in Indonesia. Some studies argue that Indonesian graduate <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> {{do not meet the}} standard of mature English language use or pedagogical competence. This triggers questions regarding the quality of teacher education programs that principally produce the existing in-service and pre-service teachers. It is important to trace the problems from pre-service teacher education that may present difficulties for English teachers during their training. In this paper we focus on {{the experience of}} preservice <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> who have completed the first round of what is called microteaching in the Indonesian preservice <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> education program. Data for the paper was drawn from semi-structured interviews and group meetings with <b>EFL</b> preservice <b>teachers.</b> Analysis of data indicates first that students enroll in an <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> education course for many reasons, not all of them in order to become a teacher.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a program for {{training}} teachers of English as a foreign language at all levels of instruction in Thailand. The study was designed to determine levels of performance in English as well as courses of high value for a Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher.</b> So that an effective program for training Thai EFT, teachers could be established, literature pertaining to qualifications of teachers of English to speakers of other languages was reviewed, and questionnaires relevant to the {{purpose of the}} study were prepared. The Form A questionnaire was utilized to determine present: qualifications of Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> and existing impediments to better instruction of English in Thailand. The Form B question was used to obtain judgments regarding the courses to be of high value for a Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> as well as general suggestions, concerning an effective program for training teachers of English in Thailand. The Form A questionnaire was mailed to <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> In Thailand and the Form B questionnaire was mailed to recognized specialists in the United States in the field of teaching English to speakers of other languages. The return of more than 75 percent of each of the questionnaires was analyzed according to the {{purpose of the study}}. The following findings were based upon the analysis of the questionnaire data. 1. A majority of Thai EFL college and university teachers have completed courses recommended by ESOL specialists; however, very few of these teachers have high competence in English language skills. 2. A majority of Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> indicated high need for intensive training in the four language skills and methods of teaching and preparing materials for teaching English as a foreign language. 3. The impediments to better English instruction in higher education of Thailand were: overcrowded classrooms, poor knowledge of English by students, variations in students' knowledge of English, and poor motivation on the part of students. 4. Courses recommended to be of high value for a Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> at all levels of instruction were: introduction to linguistics, English phonology and morphology, methods of teaching English as a foreign language, psychology of learning, Thai lin- guistics, and contrastive analysis of Thai and English. Based upon the review of related literature and the analysis of questionnaire data, ideal qualifications for an <b>EFL</b> <b>Teacher</b> were determined. Additionally, basic qualifications for a Thai ELL teacher and guidelines for the training program for Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> were established. Ideal qualifications for an <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> and basic qualifications for a Thai <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> were determined in these areas: 1. Characteristics of an <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> 2. Attitude toward, knowledge and skill of English for an <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> 3. Knowledge of Thai 4. Knowledge and skill in general education 5.

Many <b>EFL</b> <b>teacher</b> educators in Indonesia have debated the employment of these teachers in primary schools because {{they were prepared to}} teach English to secondary school students; it has been assumed that their educational background is not relevant to undertake the teaching task at the primary level. The research investigated motivational factors that have brought secondary-trained <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> in Indonesia to choose the EFL teaching profession and to teach English to children in primary schools, and analysed the EFL teaching knowledge these teachers used to work with children in primary classrooms. The overarching questions of the study are: “What motivational factors have led secondary-trained <b>EFL</b> <b>teachers</b> to teach English in primary classrooms?” and “How do these teachers approach the work of EFL teaching in primary classrooms in Indonesia?” The study used a qualitative research approach underpinned by interpretive phenomenology (Heidegger, 1962; van Manen, 1997) to understand the motivational factors and the EFL teaching knowledge of the participants.
