25|$|In {{many parts}} of ancient India, the {{inscriptions}} were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered {{on top of one}} another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.|$|E
25|$|The American League's white knight, Charles Somers, {{provided}} the seed money {{to start the}} Athletics and several other American League teams. However, plans called for local interests to buy out Somers as soon as possible. To that end, Mack persuaded sporting goods manufacturer Ben Shibe, a minority owner of the rival Philadelphia Phillies, to buy a 50 {{percent stake in the}} team—an offer sweetened by Mack's promise that Shibe would have the exclusive right to make baseballs for the American League. In return, Mack was allowed to buy a 25 percent stake, and was named treasurer of the team. Two local sports writers, Frank Hough and Sam Jones, bought the remaining 25 percent, but their involvement was not mentioned in the incorporating papers; in fact, no agreement was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> until 1902. Mack and Shibe did business on a handshake.|$|E

500|$|Taraborrelli was proven wrong, and, in 1990, he {{considered}} writing her biography, but put the thought aside, thinking such a venture was premature. He {{pointed out that}} [...] "most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths, before their stories are ripe enough to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> Madonna was in an ambitious, self-involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career." [...] He picked up the writing again in 1994, but {{felt the same way}} about her, and hoped the time would come when the singer would focus on her personal life, rather than her career. A personal evolution occurred in her life with the birth of daughter Lourdes in 1996, and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography.|$|E

However, {{the large numbers of}} civilian refugees crowding the Yongdong area trying to move south helped the North Koreans infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division's positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean National Police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes. The North Koreans continued to move into the city in civilian clothing with concealed weapons, and US troops started shooting any Koreans moving through their lines at night. The chain of command which issued these orders is not clear as they were generally not <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> However, these orders are thought to have contributed to war crimes committed against civilians by the 1st Cavalry Division, namely the No Gun Ri massacre, which took place {{around the time of the}} fighting at Yongdong.

2500|$|In early 1940, after a {{few weeks}} in retreat to compose and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> oracles, prayers and teachings, Sổ {{launched}} a major campaign through the Mekong Delta. He recruited tens of thousands of converts to his movement, many of whom followed him around in his travels. His reputation grew immensely after a series of his predictions came true: the outbreak of World War II, the fall of France to Nazi Germany, and the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. His prediction of a Japanese invasion prompted many rice farmers to desert their farms en masse and flee to the hills. His critics derided him as the [...] "mad bonze". As his movement became politicised, it began to attract aspiring politicians, with the likes of Le Cong Bo, a prominent landowner, and its future military commanders, Trần Văn Soái and Lâm Thành Nguyên. Nguyen claimed that Sổ had cured him from illness.|$|E

2500|$|Given writing {{materials}} {{in the hope that}} he would <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> his retraction, Penn wrote another inflammatory treatise, No Cross, No Crown: A Discourse Shewing The Nature and Discipline of the Holy Cross of Christ and that the Denial of Self, and Daily Hearing of Christ's Cross, is the Alone Way to Rest and Kingdom of God. In it, Penn exhorted believers to adhere to the spirit of Primitive Christianity. This work was remarkable for its historical analysis and citation of 68 authors whose quotations and commentary he had committed to memory and was able to summon without any reference material at hand. Penn petitioned for an audience with the King, which was denied but which led to negotiations on his behalf by one of the royal chaplains. Penn bravely declared, [...] "My prison shall be my grave before I will budge a jot: for I owe my conscience to no mortal man." [...] He was released after eight months of imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|Some early piano rags are {{entitled}} marches, and [...] "jig" [...] and [...] "rag" [...] were used interchangeably in the mid-1890s.

In 1895, black entertainer Ernest Hogan composed {{two of the}} earliest sheet music rags, one of which ("All Coons Look Alike to Me") eventually sold a million copies. The other composition was [...] called La Pas Ma La which was also a hit. As fellow black musician Tom Fletcher said, Hogan was the [...] "first to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> the kind of rhythm that was being played by non-reading musicians." [...] While the song's success helped introduce the country to ragtime rhythms, its use of racial slurs created a number of derogatory imitation tunes, known as [...] "coon songs" [...] because of their use of racist and stereotypical images of blacks. In Hogan's later years he admitted shame {{and a sense of}} [...] "race betrayal" [...] for the song while also expressing pride in helping bring ragtime to a larger audience.|$|E
