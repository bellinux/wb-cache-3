The results show that tunnel excavation can result in four different stress path divisions of the soil strata, which have deferent failure to the tunnel stability. Deferent paths have respective failure forms, and the failure strengths are basically the same when the forms are identical (extrusion failure or compression failure) even if the paths are different, but to deferent forms, the failure strength are deferent, generally speaking, the strength of extrusion failure will be 10 % ~ 25 % {{lower than that of}} compression failure.

40|$|Millimeter wave (mmWave) {{communication}} is a promising technology for 5 G cellular systems. To {{compensate for the}} severe path loss in mmWave systems, large antenna arrays are generally used to achieve significant beamforming gains. However, due to the high hardware and power consumption cost associated with radio frequency (RF) chains, it is desirable to achieve the large-antenna gains, but with only limited number of RF chains for mmWave communications. To this end, we study in this paper a new lens antenna array enabled mmWave MIMO communication system. We first show that the array response of the proposed lens antenna array at the receiver/transmitter follows a "sinc" function, where the antenna with the peak response {{is determined by the}} angle of arrival (AoA) /departure (AoD) of the received/transmitted signal. By exploiting this unique property of lens antenna arrays along with the multi-path sparsity of mmWave channels, we propose a novel low-cost and capacity-achieving MIMO transmission scheme, termed orthogonal <b>path</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing (OPDM). For channels with insufficiently separated AoAs and/or AoDs, we also propose a simple path grouping technique with group-based small-scale MIMO processing to mitigate the inter-path interference. Numerical results are provided to compare the performance of the proposed lens antenna arrays for mmWave MIMO system against that of conventional arrays, under different practical setups. It is shown that the proposed system achieves significant throughput gain as well as complexity and hardware cost reduction, both making it an appealing new paradigm for mmWave MIMO communications.

40|$|Millimeter wave (mmWave) {{communication}} by utilizing {{lens antenna}} arrays is a promising technique for realizing cost-effective 5 G wireless systems with large MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) but only limited radio frequency (RF) chains. This paper studies an uplink multi-user mmWave single-sided lens MIMO system, where only {{the base station}} (BS) {{is equipped with a}} full-dimensional (FD) lens antenna array with both elevation and azimuth angle resolution capabilities, and each mobile station (MS) employs the conventional uniform planar array (UPA) without the lens. By exploiting the angle-dependent energy focusing property of the lens antenna array at the BS as well as the multi-path sparsity of mmWave channels, we propose a low-complexity <b>path</b> <b>division</b> multiple access (PDMA) scheme, which enables virtually interference-free multi-user communications when the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of all MS multi-path signals are sufficiently separable at the BS. To this end, a new technique called path delay compensation is proposed at the BS to effectively transform the multi-user frequency-selective MIMO channels to parallel frequency-flat small-size MIMO channels for different MSs, for each of which the low-complexity single-carrier(SC) transmission is applied. For general scenarios with insufficient AoA separations, analog beamforming at the MSs and digital combining at the BS are jointly designed to maximize the achievable sum-rate of the MSs based on their effective MIMO channels resulting from path delay compensation. In addition, we propose a new and efficient channel estimation scheme tailored for PDMA, which requires negligible training overhead in practical mmWave systems and yet leads to comparable performance as that based on perfect channel state information (CSI).

The 1988 team had to endure one of the most difficult schedules in school history while playing with only 65 scholarships - the allotted amount for Division I-AA teams.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringTodd EastonThroughout an NFL season, 512 {{games are}} played in 17 weeks.

The goal of this {{research}} is to provide substantial reasons for fans to watch other games. This research finds the easiest <b>path</b> to a <b>division</b> championship for each team. This easiest path requires winning the least number of games. Due to NFL’s complicated tiebreaker rules, games not involving the fan’s team can have major implications for that team. The research calls these games critical because if the wrong team wins, then the fan’s team must win additional games to become the division champion. To identify both the easiest path and the critical games, integer programming is used. Given the amount of two-team, three-team, and four-team division tie scenarios that can occur, 31 separate integer programs are solved for each team to identify the easiest <b>path</b> to the <b>division</b> championship. A new algorithm, Shortest Path of Remaining Teams (SPORT) is used to iteratively search through every game of the upcoming week to determine critical games.

We then prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a routing to be survivable and use these conditions to formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Due to the excessive run-times of the ILP, we develop simple and effective relaxations for the ILP that significantly reduce the time required for finding survivable routings. We use our new formulation to route various logical topologies over a number of different physical topologies and show that this new approach offers a much greater degree of protection than alternative routing schemes such as shortest path routing and a greedy routing algorithm. Finally, we consider the special case of ring logical topologies for which we are able to find a significantly simplified formulation.

40|$|This paper proposes and {{analyzes}} {{a strategy}} for protection and restoration of optical <b>paths</b> in wavelength <b>division</b> multiplexing (WDM) networks for next-generation Internet infrastructure. Assuming a network model in which a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) layer is overlaid {{on top of a}} WDM layer, and a segregation of the traffic on a wavelength basis, the strategy is based on a network dimensioning aiming at: 1) the support of different types of traffic, relating to different service categories; 2) the guarantee that all the wavelength paths carrying mission-critical services (with stringent quality of service requirements) are protected against failure; and 3) the possibility of restoring a large amount of wavelength paths carrying Internet best-effort services, i. e., low-priority (LP) preemptible traffic with no QoS requirements. The reference network scenario is an overlay model in which the optical network interacts with an MPLS network with a separated control plane; the optical network manages its resources to better serve the traffic coming from the MPLS network. Two path protection schemes, namely, disjoint path (DP) and single-link basis (SLB), and a link protection mechanism, namely, local repair (LP), are investigated. Furthermore, the paper considers both the case of using wavelength conversion in the optical nodes and the case in which wavelength conversion is not used at all. The analysis compares the performance of the different strategies in terms of the percentage of optical paths carrying LP traffic not served by the optical network after a failure and of the dimensions of the optical nodes for all the schemes. The analysis reveals that the proposed approach allows the restoration of a large amount of best-effort traffic with a reasonable increase of network redundancy...|$|R

Na coleta de dados, foram utilizadas três fontes de registros escritos: da professora-pesquisadora, das alunas, individualmente, e do grupo de alunas em trabalhos colaborativos. As práticas em sala de aula centraram-se nas quatro operações aritméticas fundamentais, tendo-se por intenção constituir uma base conceitual sobre essas operações. Para este trabalho, serão trazidas as considerações relacionadas à divisão, na perspectiva de ressignificá-la, bem como os procedimentos utilizados pelas alunas para resolvê-la e para produzir conhecimentos e saberes docentes. As análises apontam que os procedimentos auxiliaram na (re) significação de conceitos matemáticos e na construção de perspectivas pedagógicas para o ensino de Matemática nos anos iniciais. Tais procedimentos auxiliaram na percepção de que há necessidade de desnaturalização de processos de realizar cálculos, permitindo a percepção, pelas alunas, de que os algoritmos tradicionais constituem-se em apenas um dos procedimentos possíveis na elaboração das operações aritméticas fundamentais. Foi possível depreender que as estratégias formativas escolhidas favoreceram a produção de saberes/conhecimentos docentes e possibilitaram compreender os diferentes sentidos da operação da divisão e evidenciar que a realização de um cálculo aritmético não significa necessariamente repetir procedimentos; é preciso compreender a operação que se quer realizar sendo possível utilizar diferentes recursos, muitas vezes diferentes daqueles que a escola tradicionalmente desenvolve. This study aims to {{understand}} how the retrieval of the learning trajectory in early math division, through memory records, combined with the process of rebuilding this concept by reporting exploratory and probing activities, can support the problematization of the training process for future early years teachers. Three sources of written reports were used in data collection: by the researcher professor, by each student in individual work, and by the group of students in collaborative work. Classroom practices were focused on the four fundamental arithmetic operations. The intention was to build a conceptual basis on such operations. For this purpose, considerations on math division were raised for the resignification of it, as well as the paths used by students to solve division and to produce teaching knowledge. The analysis indicates that the paths supported the resignification of math concepts and the construction of pedagogical perspectives for teaching Mathematics in the early years. The need of defamiliarization of common-sense calculation was realized from such paths, which helped students to realize that traditional algorithms are just one of the possible ways to perform fundamental arithmetic operations.
