We're proud of 'Alright' {{and how well}} it did, but we never {{wanted to find a}} formula and stick to it. Our aim was always to progress and keep the music interesting, for us and for the fans. So the people who see us in the street and still shout 'We are young' may not like the new album, but fans who have grown up with us and know to expect change probably will." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Legacy said the album was, [...] " [...] pretty much like the lifestyle {{and the culture of}} the typical California teenager put in music. It’s going to surprise a lot of people, because a lot of <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> just make the jerk songs [...] dance music." [...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was {{quick to point out that}} most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'. Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown, local producers. Legacy said, [...] "We have no big producers on our album. All of our producers are like kids ...|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "I will. In {{the first}} place, we've got {{to act as}} if we had always been waited on and had never been {{satisfied}} with the way it was done; we've got to let <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are a good deal better than they are, and what they think about it doesn't make the least difference; and then again we've got to live in better quarters than these, and whatever they may be <b>we</b> must make <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> don't <b>think</b> they are quite good enough for us. If we do all that, agents may be willing to let us vicarages." ...|$|R

2500|$|The lyrics for {{the song}} {{developed}} out of a conversation between Danger Mouse and CeeLo. According to Danger Mouse, [...] "I somehow got off on this tangent about how people won't take an artist seriously unless they're insane... So we started jokingly discussing {{ways in which we}} could make <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were crazy... CeeLo took that conversation and made it into 'Crazy,' which we recorded in one take." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has {{interacted with}} the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

6000|$|It's treachery to her memory. But {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is when your prison door is opened. [As he speaks he grows more and more excited.] I don't want to die. I want to live, and I want to take life by both hands and enjoy it. I've got such a desire for happiness. Let's open the windows, and let the {{sunlight}} in. [He goes to the window and flings it open.] It's so good just to be alive. How can I help thinking that now I can start fresh? The slate is wiped clean, and I can begin again. I will be happy. God forgive me, I can't help the thought. I'm free. I made a ghastly mistake, and I suffered for it. Heaven knows how I suffered, and how hard I tried {{to make the best of}} it. It wasn't all my fault. In this world we're made to act and think things because other people have thought them good. We never have a chance of going our own way. We're bound down by the prejudices and the morals of everybody else. For God's sake, let us be free. Let us do this and that because we want to and because we must, not because other <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought. [He stops suddenly in front of JOHN.] Why don't you say something? You stare at me as if you thought me raving mad! ...|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this period}} {{of the history of}} South Africa that many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> made our {{crowning}} mistake. We annexed the Transvaal, say they, six months too soon. As things have turned out, it would have been wiser to have left Zulus and Transvaal Boers to try conclusions, and done our best to guard our own frontiers. There is no doubt that such a consummation of affairs would have cleared the political atmosphere wonderfully; the Zulus would have got enough fighting to last them some time, and the remainder of the Boers would have entreated our protection and become contented British subjects; {{there would have been no}} Isandhlwana and no Majuba Hill. But to these I say who could foresee the future, and who, in the then state of kindly feeling towards the Boers, could wish to leave them, and all the English mixed up with them, to undergo, unprepared as they were, the terrible experience of a Zulu invasion? Besides, what guarantee was there that the slaughter would stop in the Transvaal, or that the combat would not have developed into a war of races throughout South Africa? Even looking at the matter in the light of after events, it is difficult to regret that humanity was on this occasion allowed to take precedence of a more cold-blooded policy. If the opponents of the Annexation, or even the members of the Transvaal Independence Committee, knew what a Zulu invasion meant, they would scarcely have been so bitter about that act.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> {{arrived at}} the idea of gods from the {{remarkable}} things that happen in the world.

5000|$|... "Loud Love" [...] {{was written}} by {{frontman}} Chris Cornell. Guitarist Kim Thayil on the song:The intro was a feedback melody. Many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> used an E-bow.

They wonder why some people get better seats in the theatre than others. They wonder why some men get spaces in the parking lot and others don't. I have always felt, and always will feel that the men that contribute most to the organization should, out of respect alone, enjoy some privileges. My first recommendation to the lot of you is this; put your own house in order, you can't accomplish a damn thing by sitting around and waiting to be told everything. If you're not progressing as you should, instead of grumbling and growling, do something about it.|$|E
