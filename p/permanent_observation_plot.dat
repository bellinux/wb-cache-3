40|$|The {{demand for}} wide range and precise {{information}} on forests promotes continuous development of forest inventory methods, {{owing to the}} fact that compilation of reliable data is prerequisite not only for improving forest management schedules but also planning land use and natural environment management. In the reality of contemporary forestry, a requirement to improve forest inventory methods stems from obligation to acquire information on broadly understood issues of forestry as well as the protection of nature and environment. The paper points out to the essential steps, as said by the authors, {{on the way to the}} improvement of now used forest inventory methods and calls attention to remote sensing technologies such as ortophotomaps and aerial lidar data. The revisions proposed concern gathering information on: site conditions, species diversity, forest stock range as well as sample size and work scope on sampling areas. At the same time, in view of surveying the dynamics of forest change, there is recommended the use of <b>permanent</b> <b>observation</b> <b>plots,</b> especially in mountainous forests.

The criteria and sub-criteria to categorize organisms are fully quantitative and require corresponding data. In order to apply these criteria appropriate-ly {{for the establishment of}} the Red List of Switzerland’s epiphytic lichens, an intensive inventory was made from 1995 to 1999. Lichen data were recorded in three different surveys:A representative survey, based on a stratified random sample of 826 <b>permanent</b> <b>observation</b> <b>plots,</b> guaranteed the comparability between the different taxa; the mapping in squares of 400 km 2 gathered as much information as possible on the rarer species; the third survey included all other floristic lichen data. A total of 656 lichen taxa was recorded. Based on the representative data, many inconspicuous species turned out to be common. The conservation categories based on current distribution and frequency have been determined by estimating the extent of occurrence, the area of occupancy and the number of locations according to IUCN criterion B. 38 % of the epiphytic lichens would be given the status of “threatened ” if based on current distribution and frequency alone.

40|$|In 1994, a “Pan-European Programme for Intensive and Continuous Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems” {{started to}} {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} the impact of air pollution, climate change and natural stress factors on forest ecosystems. The programme today counts approximately 760 <b>permanent</b> <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> including near 500 plots with data on both air quality and forest ecosystem impacts. This paper first presents impacts of air pollution and climate on forests ecosystems as reported in the literature on the basis of laboratory and field research. Next, results from monitoring studies, both at a European wide scale and related national studies, are presented in terms of trends and geographic variations in nitrogen and sulphur deposition and ozone concentrations and the impacts of those changes in interaction with weather conditions on (i) water and element budgets and nutrient-acidity status, (ii) forest crown condition, (iii) forest growth and carbon sequestration and (iv) species diversity of the ground vegetation. The empirical, field based forest responses to the various drivers are evaluated in view of available knowledge. Analyses of large scale monitoring data sets show significant effects of atmospheric deposition on nutrient-acidity status in terms of elevated nitrogen and sulphur or sulphate concentrations in forest foliage and soil solution and related soil acidification in terms of elevated aluminium and/or base cation leaching from the forest ecosystem. Relationships of air pollution with crown condition, however, appear to be weak and limited in time and space, while climatic factors appear to be more important drivers. Regarding forest growth, monitoring results indicate a clear fertilization effect of N deposition on European forests but the field evidence for impacts of ambient ozone exposure on tree growth is less clear...|$|R
40|$|Ozone (O 3) {{concentrations}} were monitored using passive (diffusive) samplers at 20 permanent monitoring plots of the National Integrated Programme for Forest Ecosystem Monitoring (CONECOFOR) during late {{spring and summer}} from 1996 to 2000. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) {{concentrations were}} measured at the same sites with passive samplers during the same months in 1999 and 2000. Measurement devices were placed at {{a short distance from}} the forest plots in areas with freely circulating air. The exposure period for O 3 passive samplers was 1 week; NO 2 samplers were exposed for 7 days in 1999 and 14 days in 2000. Mean O 3 con-centrations recorded by the passive samplers for the monitoring periods in individual years vary from 75. 2 to 125. 8 µg m- 3, showing considerable differences between individual years and the geographical locations of the monitoring sites. Generally speaking O 3 concentration levels are higher at the plots located in Central and Southern Italy. The highest mean weekly concentrations were re-corded in Sicily with a maximum of 171 µg m- 3. No correlation can be found between O 3 levels and elevation if all the plots are con-sidered, while a significant increase of O 3 levels with elevation can be observed in the six plots located in the Alpine region. The cor-relation analysis of 5 -year mean concentration data and plot latitude show a moderately close relationship. Mean weekly concentra-tions often exceed 65 µg m- 3 as 24 h mean, one of the short term thresholds proposed for the protection of vegetation. Exceedances are recorded in all monitoring periods.

The production process is examined using the two types of charts under three specific control policies which are: Policy 1 - An assignable cause is sought if a single <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> beyond the control limits, or if two successive <b>observations</b> <b>plot</b> within the control limits but beyond the warning limits. Policy 2 - An assignable cause is sought if a single <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> beyond the control limits, or if two out of three <b>observations</b> <b>plot</b> within the control limits but beyond the warning limits.
