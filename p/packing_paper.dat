25|$|During {{the period}} of post-war austerity, U Hla {{continued}} to publish using any kind of paper {{that he could get}} hold of including coloured matchbox <b>packing</b> <b>paper</b> and used office paper with printing on one side. He would also still manage to send his new books as gifts, about 200 on each occasion, to all his friends in Rangoon at a time when communication lines and road and rail transportation had all but broken down. It was in 1945 that he launched the fortnightly Ludu (The People) Journal with his wife as assistant editor. The following year saw the launch of the Ludu Daily newspaper and subsequently the couple {{came to be known as}} Ludu U Hla and Ludu Daw Amar. Their incisive political commentaries and analyses made a significant contribution to the country's yearning for independence and unified struggle against colonial rule. Their publications had never carried advertisements for alcohol, drugs to enhance sexual performance or gambling, nor racing tips, salacious affairs and gossip. U Hla had to be persuaded to make an exception of film advertisements for the survival of the paper.|$|E
2500|$|The Guernsey Evening Press and The Star, {{subject to}} {{censorship}} from the German authorities, continued to publish, eventually on alternate days given {{the shortage of}} materials and staff available. After the Germans temporarily removed the editor of The Star, Bill Taylor, from his position, following an article which they deemed offensive, it was edited by Frank Falla. Falla was a key member of the Guernsey [...] "Resistance", {{being involved in the}} Guernsey Underground News Sheet (which went by the acronym GUNS). GUNS published BBC news, illegally received, typed on a single news sheet using tomato <b>packing</b> <b>paper.</b> According to his memoirs, through strategic placement of stories handed to him by the German authorities in The Star, he allowed islanders to distinguish easily between German news and stories emanating from Guernsey journalists. Falla was eventually betrayed by an Irish collaborator and, along with his peers who helped to produce GUNS, was deported to Germany. Falla survived, though other members of the organisation did not return from Germany.|$|E

I could not find the matches. I beat my hands on the wall with rage. I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and invisible, but quivering with anger, to watch events. They split a panel, I saw, and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway. It was the landlord and his two step-sons, sturdy young men of three or four and twenty. Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Its arrival was {{therefore}} {{looked forward to}} with great expectancy when the hotel was finished and occupied by the combined Excelsior companies. It was to come from New York via San Francisco, where, however, there was some delay in its transshipment, and still further delay at Sacramento. It finally reached the settlement over the new wagon road, and {{was among the first}} freight carried there by the new express company, and delivered into the new express office. The box--a packing-case, nearly three feet square by five feet long--bore superficial marks of travel and misdirection, inasmuch as the original address was quite obliterated and the outside lid covered with corrected labels. It was carried to a private sitting-room in the hotel, where its beauty was to be first disclosed {{to the president of the}} united companies, three of the committee, and the excited and triumphant purchaser. A less favored crowd of members and workmen gathered curiously outside the room. Then the lid was carefully removed, revealing a quantity of shavings and <b>packing</b> <b>paper</b> which still hid the outlines of the goddess. When this was promptly lifted a stare of blank astonishment fixed the faces of the party! It was succeeded by a quick, hysteric laugh, and then a dead silence.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to obtain a chemical-mechanical pulp (CMP) from poplar wood with {{improved}} properties, {{to be used in}} <b>packing</b> <b>papers</b> in place of more expensive softwood or hardwood pulp. For improving the CMP quality indicators, a preliminary treatment of the pulp has been carried out with a mixture of oxidizing enzymes produced from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, including lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. The two types of fiber materials obtained were double-stage bleached and then ground to 30 oSR. It was found that preliminary enzyme treatment yielded CMP with improved physical, mechanical, and optical properties. The enzyme-pretreated CMP also refined faster, thus reducing the electricity consumption. Bleached CMP from poplar wood, obtained after preliminary enzyme treatment, could be successfully utilized at levels up to 40 % in the composition of various packaging papers...|$|R

Upon returning to the Netherlands Daan van Golden started painting copies of brown <b>packing</b> <b>paper</b> to find peace of mind. This painting {{was the beginning of a}} series of works, created between 1963 and 1975, in which simple objects such as handkerchiefs, tea towels, <b>packing</b> <b>paper,</b> tablecloths and other decorative material were repainted down to the smallest details.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{disposable}} products in hospitals {{continues to increase}} despite limited landfill space and dwindling natural resources. We analyzed the use and disposal patterns {{of disposable}} hospital products to identify means of reducing noninfectious, nonhazardous hospital waste. In a 385 -bed private teaching hospital, the 20 disposable products of which the greatest amounts (by weight) were purchased, were identified, and total hospital waste was tabulated. Samples of trash from three areas were sorted and weighed, and potential waste reductions from recycling and substituting reusable items were calculated. Business paper, trash liners, diapers, custom surgical <b>packs,</b> <b>paper</b> gowns, plastic suction bottles, and egg-crate pads were among the 20 top items and were analyzed individually. Data from sorted trash documented potential waste reductions through recycling and substitution of 78, 41, and 18 tonnes per year (1 tonne = 1, 000 kg = 1. 1 tons) from administration, the operating room, and adult wards, respectively (total hospital waste was 939 tonnes per year). We offer specific measures to substantially reduce nonhazardous hospital waste through substitution, minimization, and recycling of select disposable products...|$|R

50|$|Among all the {{contemporary}} works of Abedin, his famine sketches of the 1940s are his most remarkable works. He created his famine painting set, which, when exhibited in 1944, brought {{him even more}} critical acclaim. The miserable situation of the starving people during the Great Famine of Bengal in 1943 touched his heart. He made his own ink by burning charcoal and used it on cheap, ordinary <b>packing</b> <b>paper.</b> He depicted those starving people who were dying by the road-side. Abedin not only documented the famine, he also revealed the famine's sinister face through the skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, Skurjeni {{commenced}} copying oleographs, making drawings on <b>packing</b> <b>paper</b> and coloring it with wall paint. These oleographs primarily contained religious images. At this time, Skurjeni {{was still}} considered a craftsman {{rather than a}} professional painter. In 1945, Skurjeni joined a Workers’ Cultural Society headed by Vinko Jeđut that hosted evening courses funded by its instructors. The classes, which lasted until 1949, sought to instruct individuals about formal artistic techniques and initiate artists to the socialist realist movement. Skurjeni’s paintings from this time period certainly reflect the movement, including figures with a more regular and proportionate anatomy, such as oval shaped heads. The Cultural-Educational Societies of Zagreb’s art sections considered Skurjeni’s art too primitive, however, and it was never exhibited in their shows in the 1950s.|$|E

Afterwards she teaches drawing at the Industrial School of Marinha Grande, a city known for its glass {{manufacture}} located in a region called Pinhal de Leiria in the centre of the country and where she lived from 1944 to 1945. This School was located within the area of the ancient Fábrica Nacional dos Vidros (National Glass Factory), the largest glass factory of the country and later on named Fábrica-Escola Irmãos Stephens (Stephens Brothers Factory School), founded in 1769 by William Stephens (glassmaker), and where today is the Museu do Vidro (Glass Museum).Besides of her activity as a teacher trying to implement some pedagogical methods by the art, she has direct contacts with the working reality and draws a series of drafts, “Meninos operários” (Child workers), a lot of them on <b>packing</b> <b>paper.</b> In this series she pictures the gestures and tired faces of the children wrinkled by dehydration working in the glass factories.|$|E
50|$|Aspen tree wood {{has many}} {{commercial}} uses {{due to its}} soft yet strong and heat tolerant wood. Some of these uses include matches, building material where low flammability is key, <b>packing</b> <b>paper,</b> plywood, and animal bedding {{due to lack of}} irritant phenols in the wood. Because infected trees lose an average of 70% wood volume to the fungus after being infected, Phellinus tremulae causes a lot of economic damage. For example, plywood should be decay free without any discoloration as this downgrades the product. Phellinus tremulae creates decay and discoloration and therefore results in enormous amounts of waste at the mill. Harvesting aspens with trunk rot is more costly because decay-free trees can be scattered over vast areas in the forest and determining if a tree is infected can be challenging without first cutting down the tree. The high moisture content found in trees infected with Phellinus tremulae increases the shipping costs if dried as it would be with uninfected trees. In order to combat these increased shipping costs, 15% more drying time is required to reduce the moisture content.|$|E
