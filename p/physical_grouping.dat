To address this issue, we analyzed three years of filelevel activities from the NCAR mass storage system, providing valuable insight into a large-scale scientific archive with over 1600 users, tens of millions of files, and petabytes of data. Our examination of system usage showed that, while a subset of users were responsible for most of the activity, this activity was widely distributed at the file level. We also show that the <b>physical</b> <b>grouping</b> of files and directories on media can improve archival storage system performance. Based on our observations, we provide suggestions and guidance for both future scientific archival system designs as well as improved tracing of archival activity. I...|$|E

40|$|As an {{innovative}} manufacturing concept, virtual cellular manufacturing (VCM) has attracted great attention in recent years. In virtual cellular manufacturing systems (VCMSs), {{the parts that}} undergo similar manufacturing operations are grouped {{together to form a}} part family and the work stations that produce those parts are grouped to form a manufacturing cell. In particular, the virtual manufacturing cell is not identified as a fixed <b>physical</b> <b>grouping</b> of the work stations, but as a flexible functional layout of the work stations. To tackle the challenge of generating an effective virtual cell formation and production schedule for the parts, this paper presents a new methodology. The proposed methodology consists of a new mathematical model, which aims to minimize the total manufacturing cost with workforce constraints, and a hybrid algorithm based on the technique of constraint programming (CP) and discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) for solving the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by an extensive computation experiments on a set of randomly generated problems that reflect real life characteristics. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{community}} has greatly influenced the planning ideas of residential areas. Yet, often {{it has brought}} a normative view, regarding a local area {{as some kind of}} entity. This normative view is intensified by the hierarchy concept of urban structure. This study argues that this normative and hierarchical view hardly incorporates the issue of social integration in residential areas. This study suggests a concept of intermediary structure as a way of reflecting the issue of social integration in a physical environment in residential areas. It emphasizes the interrelation between local areas simply through connecting the interactional webs in a local area, especially that of secondary interaction. This study attempts to see the effect of interaction between different social groups on a local physical setting in four cases. Cases are found in Seoul, Korea. They are examined in terms of allocation of social groups, coincidence between social grouping and <b>physical</b> <b>grouping,</b> physical configuration, and selectivity of use of services to see the possibility of applying the intermediary structure. by Jinai Kim.

40|$|Group {{selection}} is easily observed when spatial group structure is imposed on a population. In fact, spatial structure {{is just a}} means of providing assortative interactions such {{that the benefits of}} cooperating are delivered to other cooperators more than to selfish individuals. In principle, assortative interactions could be supported by individually adapted traits without <b>physical</b> <b>grouping.</b> But this possibility seems to be ruled-out because any ‘marker’ that cooperators used for this purpose could be adopted by selfish individuals also. However, here we show that stable assortative marking can evolve when sub-populations at different evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) are brought into contact. Interestingly, if they are brought into contact too quickly, individual selection causes loss of behavioural diversity before assortative markers have a chance to evolve. But if they are brought into contact slowly, moderate initial mixing between sub-populations produces a pressure to evolve traits that facilitate assortative interactions. Once assortative interactions have become stablished, group competition between the two ESSs is facilitated without any spatial group structure. This process thus illustrates conditions where individual selection canalises groups that are initially spatially defined into stable groups that compete without the need for continued spatial separation...|$|E

30|$|As {{stated by}} Mungwattana (2000), four basic types of {{production}} requirement are considered in GT-based cellular layout designs. They are static, dynamic, stochastic and deterministic. Production requirement in any industry {{can be represented}} by using {{one or more of}} these types. Static production requirement assumes a constant product mix and demand for entire planning horizon. There can be either static-deterministic production requirement or static-stochastic production requirement. In first case, the product mix and demand for entire period is exactly known at the cell formation stage. For the second one, possible product mix and demand for the period is known with certain probabilities. Similarly, dynamic cells incorporate the possible production requirements in either stochastic or deterministic nature (Balakrishnan and Hung Cheng 2005; Mungwattana 2000). In both types of product demand, dynamic cells form <b>physical</b> <b>grouping</b> of cells based on GT principles while rearranging the cells when necessary. This allows the dynamic cellular layouts to retain the flexibility through cell reconfiguration on a planned basis and to gain advantages of static cells. Excessive rearrangement of cells may significantly increase cost of machine movement and lost of production time (Kia et al. 2013). Conversely, increasing robustness for multiple demand scenarios deteriorates the cell performance due to increased material handling. Furthermore, using an inappropriate cell layout for a particular period may lead to increased reconfiguration costs in subsequent periods (Niakan 2015). Designing process of DCMS aims to obtain optimal cells by balancing these two conflicting scenarios.|$|E

30|$|There is some {{research}} utilizing an online social network to predict demographics, {{but there is}} little focusing on the social behavior in a <b>physical</b> <b>grouping</b> context, the focus of this paper. Mislove et al. [24] studied how the social relationship in social networks can be used to predict users’ college, year, and major finding a small fraction of training data with social network graph can lead to high accuracy. Dong et al. [25] studied how people’s social strategies can be discovered from their daily mobile communication, and then be further used to predict their demographics. They also found these social information can lead to high prediction accuracy in users’ age and gender. Culotta et al. [26] predicted Twitter users’ demographics based on whom they follow via a distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for a large number of websites. They found this lead to competitive performance with a fully supervised method. Volkova and Bachrach [27] studied the problem from the aspect of neighbors in a social network. They specifically contrasted the emotions of a user’s neighbors in a social network, and found this contrast information was correlated with certain user demographic traits. Moreover, investigating the behaviour of individuals and their relationship in the physical space is also active in sociometric sensors, e.g. the SocioPatterns collaboration. 1 More recently, Sapiezynski [28] proposed a model to infer person-to-person proximity by using WiFi signals. Sekara and Lehmann [29] studied how to deploy the electronic datasets as a valid proxy for real life social interactions, and found that the strength of electronic signals can be used to distinguish between strong and weak friendship ties.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a new urban village in a vulnerable landscape on the Mekong delta in Laos. This design thesis begins with a site, located in the lowland just away from the border between Laos and Thailand along the mighty Mekong River that floods unpredictably in the national capital of Vientiane, also known as Viang Chan. The site is called Don Chan, which sits on the riverbank of Laos overlooking the river and Thailand border (see figure 0. 1). The design thesis sheds light on the vision of creating a sustainable future for the floodplains of Don Chan for the social housing development. It will explore what it means to be at the forefront of urban regeneration and act as the catalyst for new sustainable communities. Furthermore, the thesis will also examine and explore the concept of “Baan” or Lao village. It will investigate the existing village pattern, arrangement, and organization. The research includes not only the studies of the <b>physical</b> <b>grouping</b> but also the social grouping pattern and building types. Moreover, the thesis will explore the current issues of the overall site in terms of the climatic and geological pattern such as flood-prone areas, flow of water, water pattern, seasonal change, relationship to the landscape, relationship to the existing village, and adaptations near the river. In addition, the thesis also analyzes the city of Vientiane, its urban layout, city pattern, and movements. It includes the analysis of the existing village on the Mekong delta and its relationship to the water, site and city. The design strategy and case study of this new urban development plan will accommodate the entire site of Don Chan. The findings then are laid out in the basis of exploration for a new way in tackling the social housing master plan development in the Mekong delta of Vientiane. The objective of this thesis is to define some of the key issues in developing the area of Don Chan, and then to develop a conceptual design to demonstrate an alternative development as an option to accommodate the site. The goal is to contribute in developing new ideas of a healthy development along the Mekong basin in Vientiane within the context of architecture and urban planning that are socially, economically, and environmentally responsive to the Laotian communities. Its guidance will be relevant to all aspects of the built environment that includes building designs, spaces, landscapes and systems. To some, history and tradition are often considered non-contemporary design concepts. Although modernity is very contemporary, iv modernity and tradition are not always contradictory. The two concepts can interact with one another harmoniously and beneficially. The result will be the first sustainable development in Vientiane established through the adaptability of local traditional ways, using modern ideas by way of today’s technology, and new methodologies.

30|$|In general, key {{management}} for secure group communication {{is a challenge}} in ad hoc networks. The group {{key management}} in the proposed schemes is easily to be solved. According to the scenario of group communication, groups of friends traveling together can easily gain identities of all vehicles. For this reason, it is impossible that a new vehicle can join to the group {{during the period of}} traveling. However, a member could leave the traveling group in the real world. In order to reduce the complexity of rebuilding group keys, heads in the V 2 I or V 2 V group cannot distribute the virtual or global group key (VGK or GGK) to their members. If one member leaves from a <b>physical</b> or localized <b>group,</b> then the head should re-build the gk or vgk key. In case that one of head avatars was not available, then the vehicles will need to re-apply for a virtual group to avoid attacks. Alternatively, if one of THs leaves, then the members belonging to the TH must re-organized <b>physical</b> <b>groups,</b> and the GGK will be re-builded. The vehicles in the other <b>physical</b> <b>groups</b> not belonging to the TH still keep the original status.|$|R
30|$|Group {{communication}} is desirable in vehicle networks, while groups of friends drive vehicles to travel together. They can establish {{a group to}} share data such as multimedia and map information, even if their vehicles are moving close or apart from {{each other on the}} same roadway. Their group communication scenarios are implemented through the V 2 V or V 2 I mode in this study. A <b>physical</b> <b>group</b> with the subset of the vehicles moving closely each other in the V 2 V mode must have a mobile head, and the head always moves at a steady velocity up or down a slight degree incline. The head has one-hop neighboring vehicles as its members in the <b>physical</b> <b>group.</b> All of the <b>physical</b> <b>groups</b> only organized by the scattered vehicles form a hierarchical group, denoted as a global group. In Figure 1, Cars 7 - 9 know about each other and could organize a <b>physical</b> <b>group,</b> and Car 8 is the head. The other alternative of group {{communication is}} to establish a virtual group in the V 2 I mode. The vehicles organize multiple localized groups with the RSUs on the roadside of the travel path. One of the RSUs organizes a localized group with the subset of the vehicles; hence, all of the localized groups form a virtual group. The RSUs participating in the virtual group are denoted as head avatars to service for all of the vehicles. Still in the Figure 1, cars 6, 10, and 11 on the same roadway organize a virtual group with RSU 1 and RSU 2. The set of RSUs on the roadside is managed by the trusted server on the Internet; hence, the server must connect the trusted party to maintain the security requirements of the RSUs. If a vehicle tries to apply for a virtual group, then the server will select the appropriate RSUs for it. Consequently, V 2 V-based global and V 2 I-based virtual groups are addressed, with different ways of selecting their heads. A global group is appropriate to the vehicles without connection gaps, and a virtual group is appropriate to them with high-frequency broken connections.|$|R
