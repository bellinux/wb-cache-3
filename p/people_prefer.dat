40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology, 2009 This study {{explored}} Extraversion personality {{differences among}} <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> dogs, <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> cats, <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> both, and <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> neither. Participants were 120 {{students from the}} Psychology Department Participation Pool at Humboldt State University. Personality was evaluated using the NEO-PI-R Extraversion Scale. Also, participants were given a list of personality trait adjectives and asked to assign them to either <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> dogs or <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> cats. Results showed significant differences in Extraversion among the pet preference groups. <b>People</b> who <b>preferred</b> dogs scored higher than <b>people</b> who <b>preferred</b> cats on the overall domain of Extraversion and the facets Excitement-Seeking and Gregariousness. <b>People</b> who <b>preferred</b> dogs also scored higher than <b>people</b> who <b>preferred</b> both on Extraversion and the facets Warmth, Excitement-Seeking, and Gregariousness. Results also showed {{that there are certain}} personality traits that people tend to assign to those who prefer dogs vs. those who prefer cats. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> dogs were Sociable, Friendly, Excitement-Seeking and High-Spirited. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> cats were Quiet, Shy, and Independent. All of the traits predominantly chosen for <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> dogs were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring higher in Extraversion. All of the traits predominantly chosen for <b>people</b> who <b>prefer</b> cats were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring lower in Extraversion...|$|R

25|$|UDDTs can be {{built as}} sitting or as {{squatting}} versions to accommodate the users' preference of defecation posture. Some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> squatting UDDTs in public places (thought to be more hygienic) but sitting UDDTs for households (thought to be more comfortable). It may be preferable to squat instead of sit for colon health, although this is not specific for UDDTs but may refer to any type of squat toilet.|$|E

Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E

Many people find visualization software (such as WYSWIG, VectorWorks, and others) to be helpful when programming while other <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> a hard tactile control.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of legal-tender laws, metal coin money will freely {{exchange}} at somewhat above bullion market value. This may be observed in bullion coins such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, the South African Krugerrand, the American Gold Eagle, or even the silver Maria Theresa thaler (Austria). Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. <b>People</b> <b>prefer</b> trading in coins rather than in anonymous hunks of precious metal, so they attribute more value to the coins of equal weight.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} what type of primary care {{services}} the public in Hong Kong wants. Design: Cross sectional population telephone survey. Subjects: 996 Cantonese speaking Chinese adults aged 21 years or above {{were randomly selected from}} households in Hong Kong. Main outcome measures: People's preference for the type of practices, doctors, access systems, consultations and other services in primary care. Results: Most <b>people</b> <b>preferred</b> to consult the same doctor close to their homes. Many people wanted doctors to be available in the evenings, weekends and public holidays. More <b>people</b> <b>preferred</b> a walk-in than a telephone appointment system. Most thought it was important for their primary care doctors to have higher medical qualifications. More <b>people</b> <b>preferred</b> male to female doctors. The majority (68 %) thought an average consultation should last for more than 5 minutes. Over 90 % thought it was important for the doctor to give detailed explanations on their illnesses and treatments. Many wanted primary care practices to provide preventive care. Thirty-seven percent of subjects would consult specialists without referrals. Thirty percent of people agreed that nurses could be responsible for following up chronic diseases but only 16 % thought they could treat minor illnesses. Conclusion: The study confirmed that the public wanted accessible, available and comprehensive primary care services provided by doctors with postgraduate higher medical qualifications. Contrary to previous beliefs, most <b>people</b> <b>preferred</b> to consult the same doctor all the time and people wanted explanation as much as medications from doctors. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|Indians {{consider}} a healthy breakfast important. They generally prefer to drink tea or coffee with breakfast, though food preferences vary regionally. North Indian <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> roti, parathas, and a vegetable dish, accompanied by achar (pickles) and some curd. Pickles {{have been available}} to the consumers publicly since many centuries. One of the oldest pickle companies in India is Harnarains, which had started off in the 1860s in Old Delhi. People of western India prefer dhokla and milk and South Indians prefer idlis and dosas, generally accompanied by various chutneys.|$|E
25|$|When East Asian {{names are}} transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> to {{convert them to}} the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in capital letters. To avoid confusion, some always write a family name in capital letters, {{especially}} when writing for an international audience. This habit is commonly used in the international language Esperanto. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).|$|E
25|$|With modern strap bindings, {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E

25|$|However, many growers, traders, and {{consumers}} reject such lab test numbers. Some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> a more holistic {{method of sampling}} batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters. However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.|$|E
25|$|While digital voice {{recorders}} are now common, Compact Cassette—or microcassette—recorders may be cheaper and of sufficient quality {{to serve as}} adjuncts or substitutes for note taking in business and educational settings. Audiobooks, church services, and other spoken word material are still frequently sold on cassette, as lower fidelity generally is not a drawback for such content, and some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> the convenience of the tape controls for rewinding to repeat a missed passage. While most publishers sell CD audiobooks, they usually also offered a cassette version at the same price well into the 2000s. In the audiobooks application, where recordings may span several hours, cassettes also {{have the advantage of}} holding up to 150 minutes of material, whereas the average CD holds less than 80.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E
