40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To compare {{surgical}} {{outcomes of}} <b>primary</b> <b>powered</b> endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) with selective or routine silicone stenting in anatomic and functional nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized cohort study with historical control group. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive <b>primary</b> <b>powered</b> endoscopic DCR procedures with selective stenting were performed for anatomic or functional NLDO. No stenting was used unless a tight Rosenmuller valve was appreciated when probing nasolacrimal system during surgery. Nasolacrimal system irrigation, dacryocystography, and lacrimal scintigraphy {{were used for}} preoperative assessment. Success was defined as absence of symptoms and patent nasolacrimal system. Comparisons were made with a historical cohort of 31 consecutive <b>primary</b> <b>powered</b> endoscopic DCR procedures with routine stenting. RESULTS: The overall success rate was 79 % (49 / 62), with 96. 3 % (26 / 27) success for anatomic and 65. 7 % (23 / 35) for functional NLDO. Success rates for anatomic NLDO were 100 % (8 / 8) with selective stenting and 94. 7 % (18 / 19) with routine stenting (P >. 05). Success rates for functional NLDO were 60. 9 % (14 / 23) with selective stenting and 75 % (9 / 12) with routine stenting (P >. 05). In the selective stenting group, 2 / 8 of the anatomic obstructions and 8 / 23 of the functional obstructions required stents. CONCLUSIONS: Our study {{suggests that there is}} no difference in surgical outcomes of <b>primary</b> <b>powered</b> endoscopic DCR with selective or routine stenting in both anatomic and functional NLDO. We advocate a selective stenting approach for primary endoscopic DCR, whereby stents are only inserted when a tight common canaliculus opening is found during surgery. Claudio A. Callejas, Marc A.

25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, {{it is said that}} the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. <b>Primary</b> <b>power</b> transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E
