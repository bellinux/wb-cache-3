Madden {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. Studies have proven that, in general, good racehorses make the best breeding stock. While not all top male runners succeed as stallions, it is much more unusual for a poor racehorse to become a good <b>proven</b> <b>sire.</b> A poorly-raced mare does have a better chance to outbreed her own record on the track, especially when she has a good pedigree and is bred to good stock. On the other hand, statistics have shown that high quality racemares produce an inordinately high percent of high class runners.|$|E
40|$|Since 1949, {{a marked}} {{expansion}} in the commercial operation of artificial breeding {{has taken place in}} New Zealand. This expansion represents an increase from 1, 400 inseminated cows in 1949, to 556, 000 inseminated cows in 1961. (New Zealand Dairy Prod, and Marketing Board Ann, Rept. (1962)). The principle objective of the Artificial Breeding Service is to offer farmers the use of top sires from each of the main dairy breeds in New Zealand. These sires are {{selected on the basis of}} progeny test records. The rating which each <b>proven</b> <b>sire</b> receives is calculated from the butterfat production records of a sire's daughters. The butterfat records of each daughter are corrected for are differences and compared with the age-corrected average production of the herd-mates. Bulls selected for use as A. B. sires are placed at one of the two Artificial Breeding Centres which provide a Dominion-wide coverage. Because of the seasonal nature of daily farming in New Zealand, the bulk of the demand for semen occurs during the spring mating period, and since chilled semen is the principle form of service offered, the bulls experience a peak working period of eight to twelve weeks at this tise of the year. Ths objective in development at the Centres has been to obtain maximum coverage from top sires compatible with satisfactory conception rates. In 1961, the 49 -day non-return rate to first inseminations with chilled semen was 63 / 3 % (New Zealand Dairy Production and Marketing Board Ann. Rept. (1962)) ...|$|E
40|$|The multivariate {{estimation}} of sire additive and residual variances and covariances by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) is addressed. Particular emphasis {{is given to}} its application to dairy cattle data when all traits are explained by the same model and no observations are missing. Special attention {{is given to the}} analysis of new traits being included in a sire evaluation programme, for which a model has to be developed and no previous estimates of the population parameters exist. Results obtained by using either the multivariate Method 3 of Henderson, multivariate REML excluding the Numerator Relationship Matrix (NRM) or by multivariate REML including the NRM were compared. When a large number of traits were fitted simultaneously the variance-covariance matrix estimated by Method 3 was negative-definite (outside the allowable parameter space). REML estimates obtained while ignoring the NRM were biased. The number and sequence of traits fitted in the analysis affected the estimates at convergence. A canonical transformation of the variance-covariance matrix was undertaken to simplify the computation by means of an Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Approaches to choosing initial values for their use in iterative methods were compared via their values at convergence and the number of iterations required to converge. To further simplify the use of multivariate REML, three transformations of the Mixed Model Equations (MME) were integrated: the absorption of <b>proven</b> <b>sire</b> effects taken as fixed, a triangular factorisation of the NRM, and the singular value decomposition of the coefficient matrix in the MME. One statistical algorithm (EM) and one mathematical algorithm (Scoring type) were developed to iteratively solve the REML equations on the transformed scale, such that the transformed coefficient matrix of the MME {{did not need to be}} inverted at each iteration and the required quantities to build the REML equations were obtained through vector operations. Traits other than Production (TOP) from New Zealand Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were analysed (4 management and 13 conformation characteristics), each trait scored using a linear scale from 1 to 9, with extreme values corresponding to extreme phenotypes. Mixed model methodology was used for the analysis of TOP as no significant departure from normality was observed. To model the TOP, the fixed effects of herd, inspector, age, stage of lactation (linear and quadratic) and breed of dam were tested for significance. Only the effects of inspector and herd were significant for all traits, with breed of dam significantly affecting adaptability to milking, shed temperament and stature. Estimates of phenotypic means and standard deviations, and heritabilities for TOP were: adaptability to milking 5. 4 ± 1. 7, 0. 20; shed temperament 5. 5 ± 1. 6, 0. 12; milking speed 5. 7 ± 1. 5, 0. 11; farmer's overall opinion 5. 7 ± 1. 7,. 14; stature 5. 1 ± 1. 0, 0. 14; weight 4. 4 ± 1. 0, 0. 37; capacity 5. 3 ± 1. 0, 0. 40; rump angle 5. 4 ± 0. 7, 0. 16; rump width 5. 2 ± 0. 7, 0. 08; legs 5. 2 ± 0. 6, 0. 34; udder support 5. 3 ± 1. 0, 0. 63; fore udder 4. 9 ± 1. 1, 0. 48; rear udder 4. 9 ± 1. 0, 0. 33; front teat placement 4. 2 ± 0. 7, 0. 22; rear teat placement 5. 2 ± 0. 8, 0. 22; udder overall 4. 8 ± 1. 1, 0. 42; and dairy conformation 5. 3 ± 1. 1, 0. 32. Large positive phenotypic correlations among management traits were obtained, while the correlations of these traits with type were small and positive when significant. Large and positive correlations among udder traits were found. All traits related to size were positively correlated amongst themselves. Most of the traits were positively correlated with dairy conformation. Estimated genetic correlations for stature and weight with other conformation traits were generally negative. With the exception of udder support, all udder traits were positively correlated amongst themselves. Dairy conformation was positively correlated with most traits, except with stature, rump angle, legs, rear udder and udder overall.

40|$|Methods {{to account}} for {{selection}} in estimation of variance components are computationally difficult and require inclusion of records on which selection was based. The last criterion often cannot be met. Within a time records of daughters in the small sample set for a bull should be relatively free of effects of selection. If only such records are used, many herd-year- season subclasses, however, contain only one record, so that those records are eliminated when herd-year-season effects are absorbed. Including records of daughters of few but heavily used and selected bulls would provide more comparisons within herd-year-seasons, but treating effects of such sires as random and unselected would bias estimates of variance components.

40|$|One of t he largest {{problems}} facing the successful dairyman of today is selection of proper sires to mate to his high producing cows. Many breeders and dairymen have the impression that <b>proven</b> <b>sires</b> will give the same increase in production regardless of the dam 2 ̆ 7 s production or the level of environment present. Even though sires come from high producing herds, some as high as 600 pounds of butterfat, the average production of all cows {{in the state of}} Utah remains at a much lower figure. The average for all cows in Utah is about 250 pounds of butterfat and the average in 1958 of cows on Dairy Herd Improvement test was 403 pounds. This difference in level of production may be attributed to either genetic or environmental factors and possibly an interaction of the two. Most workers agree that the heritability estimates for milk production and fat yield are from. 2 to. 3. This means t hat about 25 per cent of the variance in milk yield is due to inheritance, and the other 75 per cent is due to management or environment.

40|$|Summary &mdash; Genetic {{parameters}} for dairy traits in first lactation (milk yield, fat and protein yields, fat and protein contents) were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood in the Alpine and Saanen goat breeds from records including progeny of 473 and 238 unproven bucks respectively, mainly used in natural mating. The differences between breeds {{could also be}} estimated when the flocks used both breeds. The sampling of the data sets, the addition of data from 28 and 22 progenies of Al <b>proven</b> <b>sires,</b> and the relationship matrix between sampling sires contributed to increase the connection level between flocks, which, however, remained rather low. In the same environmental conditions, particularly in the same year-flock, the Saanen breed appeared more high-yielding than the Alpine, but solid content was lower. Within-breed, the genetic standard deviation was 1. 8 - 2 fold larger for fat content than for protein content. The heritability of fat and protein yields was rather high (0. 31 to 0. 39). The genetic correlations between yields were larger than 0. 8. They were generally negative but rather low (- 0. 30 to + 0. 07) between milk yield and contents. They were clearly positive between fat yield and content (0. 45 to 0. 59), and between protein yield and content (0. 14 to 0. 29). They were close to zero and possibly positive between the yield of one component {{and the content of}} the other (- 0. 02 to + 0. 34). Some discrepancies with the average literature data need to be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve mapping power and {{resolution}} for the QTL influencing carcass quality in Hanwoo, which was previously detected on the bovine chromosome (BTA) 6. A sample of 427 steers were chosen, which were the progeny from 45 Korean <b>proven</b> <b>sires</b> in the Hanwoo Improvement Center, Seosan, Korea. The samples were genotyped with the set of 2, 535 SNPs on BTA 6 that were imbedded in the Illumina bovine 50 k chip. A linkage disequilibrium variance component mapping (LDVCM) method, which exploited both linkage between sires and their steers and population-wide linkage disequilibrium, was applied to detect QTL for four carcass quality traits. Fifteen QTL were detected at 0. 1 % comparison-wise level, for which five, three, five, and two QTL were associated with carcass weight (CWT), backfat thickness (BFT), longissimus dorsi muscle area (LMA), and marbling score (Marb), respectively. The number of QTL was greater compared with our previous results, in which twelve QTL for carcass quality were detected on the BTA 6 in the same population by applying other linkage disequilibrium mapping approaches. One QTL for LMA was detected on the distal region (110, 285, 672 to 110, 633, 096 bp) with the most significant evidence for linkage (p< 10 − 5). Another QTL that was detected on the proximal region (33, 596, 515 to 33, 897, 434 bp) was pleiotrophic, i. e. influencing CWT, BFT, and LMA. Our results suggest that the LDVCM is a good alternative method for QTL fine-mapping in detection and characterization of QTL...|$|R

40|$|Methodologies {{have been}} devised to {{genotype}} the $ kappa$-casein ($ kappa$-CN) and $ beta$-lactoglobulin ($ beta$-LG) loci using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) analysis. A fragment of 432 base pair from the $ kappa$-CN gene which contains the nucleotide substitutions diagnostic of the A- and B-alleles of $ kappa$-CN was amplified. DNA amplified from the A-variant contained a unique HinfI restriction site, whereas DNA amplified from the B-variant contained a unique TaqI site. Thus, the genotype of the animal could be determined by restriction enzyme analysis. A region extending from exon IV to V of the $ beta$-LG gene was also amplified using PCR. In this region, the B-allele contains 2 HaeIII restriction sites which are not present in DNA amplified from the A-allele. The digestion of the PCR product with HaeIII thus allowed discrimination between the A- and B-alleles. Analysis of bulls (n = 68) used by artificial insemination (AI) centres after 1980, bulls (n = 27) used before 1960, {{a random sample of}} male calves (n = 102) and cows (n = 123) revealed a frequency of the B allele of $ kappa$-CN as 0. 13, 0. 37, 0. 22 and 0. 19 in these populations, respectively. In the populations of bulls (n = 69) used by AI centres after 1980, bulls (n = 27) used before 1960, a random sample of male calves (n = 99), and cows (n = 129), the B-allele of $ beta$-LG was present at frequencies of 0. 60, 0. 52, 0. 67, and 0. 65, respectively. Statistical analysis of these data shows the frequency of the B-allele of $ kappa$-CN was significantly higher in sires (n = 27) which were used by the AI centre before 1960 compared to more modern <b>proven</b> <b>sires</b> (n = 68) (P $<$ 0. 01) ...|$|R
