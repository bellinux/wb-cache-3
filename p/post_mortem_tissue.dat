It has been traditionally produced from animal skins, such as goat, sheep, cow, camel, etc., after a manufacturing process that {{varies according to}} geographical locations, which mainly includes processing with soaking, liming, unhairing, fleshing and drying [11]. As a result, residual quantities of chemicals, more importantly calcium carbonate (as the result of lime exposure to atmospheric carbon dioxide) are evident. Other inorganic and organic substances may be found such as alum, silicates, oils, tannins, etc., which affect the texture and hardness of the material [12, 13]. Significantly, the material that is produced has already a degree of deterioration related to the initial material in animal skin; this includes partial hydrolysis of peptide chains and gelatinization [14 – 16].|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{unexpected}} {{death in}} the young, SUDY, is devastating for families, their communities and health care professionals. When no cause of death is identified after a thorough autopsy and other ancillary tests, “autopsy-negative” SUDY, it leaves families without answers as to why their loved one died. At least one third of autopsy-negative SUDY cases are attributed to an inherited cardiac disorder. Therefore, surviving relatives {{may be at risk}} of another tragic death if they are not referred for expert clinical assessment. The main focus of this dissertation was to explore the investigation and management of SUDY and SUDY-affected families in Canada with the end goal of developing guidelines for coroners and medical examiners to standardize their investigative practices. To achieve this goal, three studies were conducted. The first study determined the current practices of SUDY investigation by coroners and medical examiners by surveying Canadian death investigation agencies and cardiac electrophysiologists – clinicians with expertise in inherited cardiac disorders that can predispose individuals to SUDY. The findings revealed heterogeneous practices, particularly around <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> retention at autopsy and molecular genetic testing, supporting the need for SUDY investigation protocols, tissue retention, cause/manner of death classification and written recommendations for SUDY-affected relatives to undergo clinical assessment. The second study involved genetic testing of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> retained from autopsy from a child SUD cohort in collaboration with the Manitoba Medical Examiner’s Office. We successfully identified variants that may assist in the diagnosis of 15 % of autopsy-negative child SUD cases. We reported our findings to the medical examiner who informed the families of our cohort and recommended that they be clinically assessed {{to reduce the risk of}} future SUDY. In the final study, the findings from the first two studies, both limitations and successes, were combined with a systematic scoping review of published and grey literature on SUDY investigation guidelines. Seven recommendations were developed for Canadian death investigation agencies to standardize their approaches to SUDY investigation...|$|E

The carcasses were stored at 40 degrees C and samples removed at various times post mortem. The Z discs and I bands degenerate rapidly (less than 4 hours) but the thick filaments of the A band are remarkably resistant to change (greater than 24 hours). The sarcolemma, mitochondria, glycogen content, sarcotubular system and myonuclei also show marked changes in less than 4 hours. Myelin figures and autophagic vacuoles are among other features seen in <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue.</b> There are more degenerate mitochondria and vesicular remnants of the sarcotubular system in the iliotibialis than in the pectoralis muscle, but this reflects a differing concentration of these organelles in vivo.

Previous studies on the role of apoptosis in <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> yielded contradictory results, probably due to the fact that cell death in these illnesses occurs over decades, whereas the suicide program in the single cell is executed within a few hours.

Combined with biophysical models of MR contrast the emerging methods promise in vivo mapping of cyto- and myelo-architectonics, i. e., in vivo histology using MRI (hMRI) in humans. The hMRI methods require histological reference data for model building and validation. This is currently provided by MRI on <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> human brain <b>tissue</b> in combination with classical histology on sections.

Since seven other enzyme activities involving both glycolysis and ketone body oxidation were present in these same tissues, it was reasonable to conclude that the observed absence of CoA-transferase activity was not an artifact of homogenate preparation. It was concluded that the absence of CoA-transferase activity resulted in a loss of intracellular homeostasis leading to ketoacidosis. In addition, the absence of this enzyme appears to be a reasonable explanation for the alteration in glucose metabolism that was previously reported in fibroblasts from this patient...|$|E

40|$|An {{estimation}} of the <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> interval (PMI) is frequently touted as the Holy Grail of forensic pathology. During the first hours after death, PMI estimation {{is dependent on the}} rate of physical observable modifications including algor, rigor and livor mortis. However, these assessment methods are still largely unreliable and inaccurate. Alternatively, RNA has been put forward as a valuable tool in forensic pathology, namely to identify body fluids, estimate the age of biological stains and to study the mechanism of death. Nevertheless, the attempts to find correlation between RNA degradation and PMI have been unsuccessful. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the RNA degradation in different <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissues</b> in order to develop a mathematical model that can be used as coadjuvant method for a more accurate PMI determination. For this purpose, we performed an eleven-hour kinetic analysis of total extracted RNA from murine’s visceral and muscle tissues. The degradation profile of total RNA and the expression levels of several reference genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. A quantitative analysis of normalized transcript levels on the former tissues allowed the identification of four quadriceps muscle genes (Actb, Gapdh, Ppia and Srp 72) that were found to significantly correlate with PMI.

This technology can have immense implications for regenerative medicine, but iPSCs also represent a paradigm shift in the study of complex human phenotypes, including gene regulation and disease 2 - 5. Yet, an unresolved caveat of the iPSC model system {{is the extent to which}} reprogrammed iPSCs retain residual phenotypes from their precursor somatic cells. To directly address this issue, we used an effective study design to compare regulatory phenotypes between iPSCs derived from two types of commonly used somatic precursor cells. We show that the cell type of origin only minimally affects gene expression levels and DNA methylation in iPSCs. Instead, genetic variation is the main driver of regulatory differences between iPSCs of different donors. Research on human subjects is limited by the availability of samples.

40|$|Huntington’s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the huntingtin protein. Although the mutation has been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying Huntington’s disease pathology are not fully understood. Dysfunction of cholesterol homeostasis has been previously associated with Huntington’s disease, however detailed examination of potential changes has not been undertaken. The aim of this project was to identify cholesterol homeostatic alterations in HD that may be relevant to mechanisms that underlie neurodegeneration, or potentially identify associated molecules {{to be used as}} biomarkers of Huntington’s disease. Using a novel triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method, we have conducted 3 separate studies in R 6 / 1 mice. Firstly, comprehensively characterising the physical phenotype and cholesterol homeostatic alterations during disease progression. These were then used for reference when R 6 / 1 mice were subject to environmental enrichment, and anthocyanin dietary supplementation. Human HD <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> was also analysed for cholesterol synthetic precursors, metabolites and oxidation products. A progressive dysfunction of cholesterol synthesis was detected in both striatum and cortex of the R 6 / 1 mouse. At later stages in the disease model, the major brain cholesterol metabolite, 24 (S) -hydroxycholesterol, was also significantly reduced. Novel age-related changes pertaining to brain cholesterol homeostasis were also detected in these mice. Environmental enrichment of R 6 / 1 mice attenuated the progression of motor dysfunction in male mice. Cholesterol oxidation products, markers of oxidative stress, were also reduced in the cortex of both wild type and R 6 / 1 mice receiving enrichment. Dietary supplementation with anthocyanins also delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in female R 6 / 1 mice. These studies have highlighted a potential sex differences in HD. Human HD <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> revealed a specific disturbance to cholesterol synthesis in the putamen, as well as elevated cholesterol oxidation products. Consistent with the R 6 / 1 mouse model, 24 (S) -hydroxycholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the striatum (caudate and putamen). Enzymes involved in brain cholesterol metabolism (cholesterol 24 -hydroxylase) and synthesis (delta(24) -sterol reductase) were also significantly depleted in the putamen. In conclusion we have identified disturbances in cholesterol metabolic and synthetic pathways in both human and R 6 / 1 mouse brain tissue. In addition to being potentially useful biomarkers of disease severity and progression, these alterations may provide further insight into the effects of lipid alterations in HD pathophysiology, and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E

The sensitivity and specificity of sperm-zona binding results indicated the assay to be positively and significantly correlated with in vitro fertilization outcome. Furthermore, highly significant correlations were demonstrated between normal sperm morphology, hyperactivated motility, sperm creatine kinase activity and the zona binding capacity of a given sperm sample.

We enter the next millennium with many questions that remain to be answered by the hand of efficacious screening techniques and a new formidable therapy in intracytoplasmicc sperm injection.

40|$|The {{development}} of new axonal tract tracing and cell labelling methods has revolutionised neurobiology in the last 30 years. The aim of this review is to consider {{some of the key}} methods of neuroanatomical tracing that are currently in use and have proved invaluable in charting the complex interconnections of the central nervous system. The review begins with a short overview of the most frequently used tracers, including enzymes, peptides, biocytin, latex beads, plant lectins and the ever-increasing number of fluorescent dyes. This is followed by a more detailed consideration of both well established and more recently introduced neuroanatomical tracing methods. Technical aspects of the application, uptake mechanisms, intracellular transport of tracers, and the problems of subsequent signal detection, are also discussed. The methods that are presented and discussed in detail include: (1) anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical labelling with fluorescent dyes in vivo, (2) labelling of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissue,</b> (3) developmental studies, (4) transcellular tracing (phagocytosis-dependent staining of glial cells), (5) electrophysiological mapping combined with neuronal tract tracing, and (6) simultaneous detection of more than one axonal tracer. (7) Versatile protocols for three-colour labelling have been developed to study complex patterns of connections. It is envisaged that this review will be used to guide the readers in their selection of the most appropriate techniques to apply to their own particular area of interest...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunohistochemical}} {{reactivity of}} 38 mesotheliomas and 44 adeno-carcinomas or large cell carcinomas of the lung with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) B 72. 3 and Leu M 1 was {{compared with their}} reactivity with the routine histochemic stains periodic acid-Schiff with diastase digestion (PAS-D) and alcian blue +/- hyaluronidase. Both MAbs reacted selectively with carcinomas when a positive test was set at {{greater than or equal}} to 10 % reactive tumor cells. However, MAb B 72. 3 reacted with significantly more of the carcinomas (86 %, chi-square test, P less than 0. 01) and bound to a greater percentage of tumor cells (47 +/- 28 %; mean +/- SD, t-test, P less than 0. 001) than Leu M 1 (57 % and 25 +/- 28 %, respectively). The similar reactivities of surgically resected tumor specimens and <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>tissues</b> with both antibodies confirmed antigen stability and suggested broad clinical utility. PAS-D stained 61 % of the carcinomas. Using the markers for carcinomas (PAS-D, B 72. 3, and Leu M 1), the tumors were classified into the correct group in 80 of 82 (98 %) cases (95 % confidence level: greater than 92 % accuracy). The alcian blue stain was useful to confirm a diagnosis of dimorphic or epithelial mesothelioma (48 % were positive) ...|$|R
5000|$|Strong {{relationships}} between maternal care and subsequent epigenetic modification in offspring, {{similar to that}} found in animal models, has been observed in humans. Severe emotional trauma in the mother, for example, often leads to modified methylation patterns of DNA in subsequent offspring generations. PTSD exposed offspring illustrate epigenetic modifications similar to that seen in PTSD mothers, with an increased NR3C2 methylation in exon 1 and increased CpG methylation in the NR3C2 coding sequence, leading to alterations in mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression. Additionally, investigation of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> hippocampal <b>tissue</b> indicates decreased levels of neuron-specific glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and decreased DNA methylation in promoter regions among suicidal individuals with lifelong stress and/or abuse exposure.|$|R
25|$|Diagnosis of BSE {{continues}} to be a practical problem. It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no symptoms are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> brain <b>tissue</b> using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.|$|R
