5|$|The story depicts how {{suffering}} {{is essential to}} completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Gabriel Anctil, a {{journalist}} of Montreal daily Le Devoir, discovered in Kerouac's personal archives in New York almost 200 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writings entirely in Quebec French, with colloquialisms.

25|$|Very {{little is}} known about Robinson's life, but it is {{possible}} to draw conclusions from the dedicatory <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works.

The Cecil family fostered several artists in these days, amongst others William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons.|$|E

In 1933 he also met with Rabbi Chaim Elazar Shapiro, {{as well as with}} talmudist Rabbi Shimon Shkop. During this time he would keep a diary in which he would carefully document his private conversations with his father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn], as well as his kabalistic correspondence with his father, Levi Yitzchak Schneerson.|$|E
25|$|Emil Isac died in March 1954, in Cluj. Some of {{his final}} works were {{published}} later that year: the Workers' Youth organ Scînteia Tineretului featured three <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> posthumous poetry. The PMR voice, Scînteia, hosted an article signed by communist poet laureate Mihai Beniuc, and similar posthumous homage pieces were published by Ion Brad, Cezar Petrescu, Veronica Porumbacu and, at an Eastern Bloc level, Hungarian author Károly Molter (in both Igaz Szó and Literárni Noviny). In 1957, the same venue published his final text for the stage, Domnul Million ("Mr. Million").|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz also {{continued}} to intertwine {{the walls of}} his galleries with the <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> magazine. Stieglitz’s closest friends (Steichen, Demachy, White, Käsebier and Keiley) were represented in both, while many others were granted one but not the other. Increasingly, a single photographer was given the preponderance of coverage in an issue, and in doing so Stieglitz relied more and more on his small circle of old supporters. This led to increase tensions among Stieglitz and some of his original colleagues, and when Stieglitz began to introduce paintings, drawings and other art forms in his gallery many photographers saw it as the breaking point in their relationship with Stieglitz.|$|E

25|$|Brisbane's {{book was}} well-received and it enjoyed {{immediate}} success, gaining a broad readership among those {{concerned with the}} problems of society and helping to launch the Fourierist movement in the United States. Among those who read Brisbane's book and was thereby converted to the ideas of socialism was a young New York newspaper publisher, Horace Greeley, later elected to the US House of Representatives. Greeley would provide valuable service to the Fourierist movement by advancing its ideas in the <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newspaper of that day, The New Yorker, throughout 1840 and 1841, and offering Brisbane a column in his successor publication, the New York Tribune, from the time of its establishment in March 1842.|$|E
25|$|Criticising the {{objective}} of double monarchy fixed by Griffith, The Republic also questioned Sinn Féinism as defined in the <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newspaper. As {{a result of his}} tireless efforts to republicanise Sinn Féin, it was Hobson rather than Griffith who was chosen by Clan na Gael in 1907 to tour the United States and explain the movement to the Irish-American community. So successful was he in this that when he returned to Ireland he was considered by many Americans the leader of Sinn Féin. He also became the Irish correspondent for John Devoy’s influential newspaper, the Gaelic American, and took full advantage of this position to further undermine Griffith’s authority in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In 1926–27, after {{a missed}} {{campaign}} in Gansu, Teilhard traveled in the Sang-Kan-Ho valley near Kalgan (Zhangjiakou) {{and made a}} tour in Eastern Mongolia. He wrote Le Milieu Divin (The Divine Milieu). Teilhard prepared the first <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> main work Le Phénomène Humain (The Phenomenon of Man). The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for Le Milieu Divin in 1927. He joined the ongoing excavations of the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China following its founding in 1928. Teilhard resided in Manchuria with Emile Licent, then stayed in Western Shansi (Shanxi) and northern Shensi (Shaanxi) with the Chinese paleontologist C. C.

25|$|Hoffman was 52 at {{the time}} of his death on April 12, 1989, which was caused by {{swallowing}} 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. At the time he had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at the age of 90). Some close to Hoffman, including his longtime friend David Denton and fellow Chicago Seven co-defendant Tom Hayden, claimed that as a natural prankster who valued youth, he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the ideas of the 1960s had given way to a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984 he had expressed dismay that the current generation of young people were not as interested in protesting and social activism as youth had been during the 1960s. Hoffman's body was found in his apartment in a converted turkey coop on Sugan Road in Solebury Township, near New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by about 200 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own handwritten notes, many about his own moods.|$|E
