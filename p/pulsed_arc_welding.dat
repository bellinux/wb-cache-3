40|$|Arc plasma {{possesses}} a constriction phenomenon with a pulsed current. The constriction {{is created by}} the Lorentz force, the radial electromagnetic force during arc welding, which determines the energy distribution of the arc plasma. Welding experiments were carried out with ultra-high-frequency <b>pulsed</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (UHFP-AW). Ultra-high-speed camera observations were produced for arc surveillance. Hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) image {{analysis was used to}} distinguish the regions of the arc plasma that represented the heat energy distribution. The measurement of arc regions indicated that, with an ultra-high-frequency pulsed arc, the constriction was not only within the decreased arc geometry, but also within the constricted arc core region. This can be checked by the ratio of the core region to the total area. The arc core region expanded significantly at 40 kHz at 60 A. A current level of 80 A caused a decrease in the total region of the arc. Meanwhile, the ratio of the core region to the total increased. It can be concluded that arc constriction depends on the increased area of the core region with the pulsed current (> 20 kHz) ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} control heat input and reduce spatter {{generation}} and fumes, power sources {{have been developed}} {{with the ability to}} release one drop for a sequence of arc and pulsed time. The arc uses direct current (e.g. pulsed GMAW) or alternative current (e.g. AC-GMAW) with different current waveforms. A pulsed arc can be used in all welding positions and with all base material thicknesses in both manual and automatic welding systems. Out of position welding is also possible due to the lower than average current level. Because of the low heat input, this mode is suitable for filling gaps. It is widely used in the GMAW of aluminium (Kah et al. 2012). The method is suitable for welding all standard and high performance grades of stainless steel when nickel base or stainless steel filler metals are used. High alloy steels can also be welded by pulsed arc. Super austenitic stainless steel exhibits better mechanical and metallurgical properties with optimized parameters in GMA welding compare to conventional spray (Sathiya et al. 2012). <b>Pulsed</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> has applications in the shipbuilding industry, for example, out of position welding of high strength low alloy base materials in ship hull fabrication. The advantages of pulsed arc in shipbuilding are that its electrode efficiency is higher compared to flux-core arc welding (FCAW), and it can deliver lower hydrogen weld deposits (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Knopp and Lorenz 2002; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Ueyama et al. 2005; Lebedev 2010; Torbati et al. 2011; Kah et al. 2013).|$|E

This fact, which is likely related to magnetic interaction between the arcs, motivated previous study concerning {{the influence of the}} welding current on this phenomenon. In order to promote further understanding, this paper investigates the effects of arc length, torch angle, and high-frequency current pulsing on the arc resistance to extinction. To mimic the situation found in tandem GMAW (magnetic field induced by one arc acting on the other arc), external magnetic fields were applied to gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> <b>arcs.</b> It was verified that short arc lengths and torch angles set to push the weld pool increase the arc resistance to extinction, whereas the utilization of high-frequency current pulsing tends to weaken the arc resistance to extinction. According to a model devised from the results, the arc extinction takes place if the heat generated inside and the heat transferred into the arc column become insufficient to counterbalance the total heat loss in this arc region...|$|R

40|$|The {{weld pool}} {{is the core}} of the welding process where complex welding {{phenomena}} originate. Skilled welders acquire their process feedback primarily from the weld pool. Observation and measurement of the three-dimensional weld pool surface thus play a fundamental role in understanding and future control of complex welding processes. To this end, a laser line is projected onto the weld pool surface in <b>pulsed</b> gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW) and an imaging plane is used to intercept its reflection from the weld pool surface. Resultant images of the reflected laser are analyzed and it is found that the weld pool surface in GMAW does specularly reflect the projected laser as in gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GTAW). Hence, the weld pool surface in GMAW is also specular and it is in principle possible that it may be observed and measured by projecting a laser pattern and then intercepting and imaging the reflection from it.

In order to clarify the possible mechanisms involved, this paper tries to mimic the tandem GMAW arc interruptions. External magnetic fields were dynamically applied to GTAW arcs in constant current mode to verify their resistance to extinction as a function of current level and direction of deflection. High-speed filming was carried out as an additional tool to understand the extinction mechanism. The influence of the welding current level on the arc resistance to extinction was established: The higher the welding current, the more the arc resists to the extinction.

40|$|This paper aims at the {{development}} of an advanced control technology for <b>pulsed</b> gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW) of titanium or other materials which require a highly stable metal transfer process. It is known that conventional pulsed GMAW achieves stable and repeatable spray transfer by using correct pulse parameters. Because the optimal pulse parameters depend on welding parameters such as wire feed speed, arc length, contact tube to work distance, etc., technologies are needed to improve the robustness of the transfer process with respective to the variations in welding parameters. To resolve this problem, active control technology has been proposed to ensure a specific type of desirable repeatable metal transfer modes, i. e., one drop per pulse (ODPP) mode.

40|$|Abstract — The weld {{quality is}} highly {{influenced}} by various process parameters {{involved in the}} process. This {{can be achieved by}} meeting quality requirements of bead geometry. Inadequate depth of penetration will contribute to failure of the welded structure. This paper presents the development of genetic algorithm model for the optimization of depth of penetration of weld bead geometry in <b>pulsed</b> gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process. The model is based on experimental data. The thickness of the plate, pulse frequency, wire feed rate, wire feed rate/travel speed ratio, and peak current have been considered as the process parameters to maximize the bead penetration depth. Optimization of process parameters was done using GA. The developed model is then compared with experimental results and it is found that the results obtained from genetic algorithm model are accurate. The optimal process parameters gave a value of 5. 314 for depth of penetration which demonstrates an accuracy of 1. 33 % and thus the effectiveness of the model presented. The obtained results help in selecting quickly the process parameters to achieve the desired quality.

40|$|Aluminum alloy welding {{suffers from}} {{problems}} such as solidification cracking and hydrogen-induced porosity, which are sufficiently severe to limit its potential applications. Because mitigated porosity incidence and solidification cracking are observed in aluminum welds using double <b>pulsed</b> gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (DP-GMAW), {{a comprehensive review of}} the mechanism is necessary, but absent from the literature. The oscillation of arc force and droplet pressure causes a weld pool stir effect. The expansion and shrinkage of the weld pool cause unusual remelting and resolidification of the previously solidified metal. DP-GMAW has an increased solidification growth rate and cooling rate, compared with conventional pulsed welding at same heat input. Both numerical and experimental results reveal the remarkable concept that refined microstructure in the fusion zone is obtained by using DP-GMAW. The mechanism of microstructural refinement is revealed as a weld pool stir effect and increased cooling rate. Hydrogen bubbles easily float out and then release from the weld pool originated from the weld pool stir effect. Reduced solidification cracking is achieved due to the refined solidification structure that originated from the increased cooling rate. The advantages, evolution process, and future trend of DP-GMAW are discussed...|$|R
