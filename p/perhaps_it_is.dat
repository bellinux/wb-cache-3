5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices is identical to the cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother {{has no intention of}} marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E
25|$|Unitarianism is {{also known}} for the {{rejection}} of several other Western Christian doctrines, including the doctrines of original sin, predestination, and the infallibility of the Bible. Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell, but few do today. Mostly excluded, Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism depending on one's stance or viewpoint; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more accurate {{to call it a}} part of Nontrinitarianism, or of both.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because Johnny, {{even at that}} moment, {{hated the}} man; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because at that moment he loved and {{believed}} in Florry, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only that because at that moment he was nearer the greater Truth than his questioner, but he said, in a husky voice, [...] "You lie!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{owing to}} the Scriptural phrasing, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from some unusual {{authority}} of the man's manner, but a look of approving relief and admiration came into McGee's clear eyes.|$|R

"There {{was really}} a palpable {{difference}} between Nong Samet and KID (Khao-I-Dang Holding Center). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> arose from the wilderness atmosphere. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the presence of the}} ancient ruins, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the fact that these people, unlike the KID residents, had little hope of expatriating." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not possible for a given brain state to produce {{anything other than a}} given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.|$|E
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no coincidence that Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
25|$|I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} what it is that compels me to type this letter. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.|$|E

60|$|But science, as yet, has {{withstood}} both terrors and blandishments. In {{old times}} she endured being imprisoned and slain.

25|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of the Irish Labourers Act (1883) to pursue a plan to have all cabins demolished and replaced by a modern housing scheme. In all of these enterprises, Sheehan could count on the support of Lord Castletown of Upper Ossory (Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown), who had married Lord Doneraile's only child, the Honourable Emily Ursula Clare St. Leger. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not completely coincidental that all of these social projects are ruminated on by Sheehan's fictional Parish Priest in, what was perhaps his most successful novel, My New Curate.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E

60|$|This brought Somerset some cheerfulness and a {{good deal}} of gloom. He silently reproached her, who was {{apparently}} so independent, for lacking independence in such a vital matter. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mere sex, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> peculiar to a few, that her independence and courage, like Cleopatra's, failed her occasionally at the last moment.|$|R

500|$|Manley {{writes that}} {{wherever}} Constantine played he brought [...] "style and humour: that aggressiveness that is somehow good-natured {{and which is}} the distinctively West Indian quality in all sport. Constantine's extrovert exuberance was, of course, more particularly Trinidadian than generally West Indian. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> this last characteristic that gave him that special quality of panache which sets him apart from all other West Indian cricketers." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout Tyler's life, he {{suffered}} from poor health. As he aged, {{he suffered}} more frequently from colds during the winter. On January 12, 1862, after complaining of chills and dizziness, he vomited and collapsed. He was treated, but his health did not improve, and he made {{plans to return to}} Sherwood Forest by the 18th. As he lay in bed the night before, he began suffocating, and Julia summoned his doctor. Just after midnight, Tyler took a sip of brandy, and told his doctor, [...] "I am going. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> best." [...] He died shortly thereafter, most likely due to a stroke.|$|E
500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also time for his star to die as well, so why should he continue to try to prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E

5000|$|At {{that moment}} {{came in through}} the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening wood! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a wild beast; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a dream.

500|$|Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two {{minds about}} the book, believing {{on the one}} hand that [...] "the {{background}} is excellent... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan", and on the other that You Only Live Twice [...] "is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being". Maggie Ross, in The Listener was also a little dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, [...] "if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some of the more interesting parts of Japan." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "since not very much in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better to ignore the whole thing".|$|E
500|$|Dalrymple {{advances}} {{that the kind}} of sentimentality that he wishes to draw attention to is [...] "an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason" [...] and which is performed [...] "in full public view". Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into how we should react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
500|$|Primo Levi {{suggested}} Anne Frank {{is frequently}} {{identified as a}} single representative {{of the millions of}} people who suffered and died as she did because [...] "One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we {{would not be able to}} live." [...] In her closing message in Müller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that [...] "Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust", writing: [...] "Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> this, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the fact}} of having {{discussed}} the situation with the two Miss Mohuns, that made Mr. White say to Alexis, 'There are two rooms ready for your sister, as soon as Dagger says she can be moved safely. The person who nurses her had better come with her, and {{you may as well}} come back to your old quarters.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} told you that the boy's story is true," [...] he said, [...] "and now you ask me why I did not shout it from the housetops myself. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for your sake, Grizel; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to save you the {{distress}} of knowing that in a momentary impulse I could so far forget myself as to act {{the part of a}} man." ...|$|R

500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
500|$|Goldfinger {{received}} more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread {{criticism in the}} British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only {{in the direction of}} an atomic, sophisticated Sapper." [...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he {{is becoming more and more}} synthetic and zombie-ish. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just as well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down". Perrott thought that overall [...] "Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe"; he summarised the book by saying that it was [...] "hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try." ...|$|E
500|$|Newspaper {{reaction}} to the result was generally along partisan lines. [...] The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, [...] "And {{this is the man}} against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." [...] The Blade, another Republican paper, agreed, writing, [...] "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Silver Democratic paper, argued, [...] "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy... Their fight was... against the chairman of the national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to a pitiful majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." [...] Hearst's New York Journal noted, [...] "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies them or not. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> best to have him in the open." ...|$|E
