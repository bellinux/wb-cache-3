25|$|On 22 August 1940, in the Gulf of Bomba, the Italian {{submarine}} Iride, being a human torpedo carrier, was sunk by a torpedo {{released by}} a British Fairey Swordfish bomber. The air attack happened during an exercise, in shallow water, when four human torpedo squads were around, including officers Teseo Tesei and Luigi Durand de la <b>Penne.</b> The divers {{were able to}} make an immediate rescue action. Of the 12 Iride crewmen who survived, two died during an unsuccessful attempt to surface, nine were retrieved alive (two of them died soon, due to wounds), and one was too shocked to leave the sunken submarine.

40|$|Abstract A novel {{numerical}} model is developed {{for evaluating the}} temperature distribution on a two-dimensional skin tissue. The method {{is based on a}} combination of Laplace transform and meshless method {{as well as on the}} <b>Pennes</b> bio-heat equation. It is the first time to combine Laplace transform and RBF-MFS to study the performance of heat transfer in skin tissue governed by <b>Pennes</b> equation. First, Laplace transform of <b>Pennes</b> bio-heat equation is applied to handle the derivative of time variable. Then, the particular solution is approximated by a linear combination of radial basis functions, and the homogeneous solution is approximately determined by the method of fundamental solution. The multi-subdomain RBF–MFS technique is implemented for analyzing problems containing different materials and/or multi-connected regions. The last step of the algorithm is the inverse Laplace transforms from Laplace domain to time domain. The efficiency and availability of the proposed method is assessed by several examples including healthy tissue, tissue with tumour and burned tissue...|$|R

The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, <b>Penne</b> and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and waved a white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed back to shore.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a phase imprint into the order parameter describing {{the influence of}} blood flow on the temperature distribution in the tissue described by the one-dimensional <b>Pennes</b> equation and then engineer the imprinted phase suitably to generate a modified <b>Pennes</b> equation with a gradient term (known {{in the theory of}} biological systems as convective term) which is associated with the heat convected by the flowing blood. Using the derived model, we analytically investigate temperature distribution in biological tissues subject to two different spatial heating methods. The applicability of our results is illustrated by one of typical bio-heat transfer problems which is often encountered in therapeutic treatment, cancer hyperthermia, laser surgery, thermal injury evaluation, etc. Analyzing the effect of the convective term on temperature distribution, we found that an optimum heating of a biological system can be obtained through regulating the convective term. ...|$|R
