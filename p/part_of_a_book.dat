25|$|In May 2005, the English {{journalist}} David Rex-Taylor, {{a bridge}} player and publisher, claimed that Reese {{had made a}} confession to him forty years earlier, one that {{was not to be}} revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead. The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> on cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account.

In their book about science fiction films, writers James Robert Parish and Michael R.

During a 2005 interview, Charles Band called the film [...] "hilarious" [...] and stated [...] "it had its charm" [...] like many films from its time.

500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} {{who has written extensively}} about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman {{made a career out of}} making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E

To make {{one of his favorite}} pieces, 3 Standard Stoppages (3 stoppages étalon), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter. The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box.

6000|$|A further {{experiment}} made by Mr Arnold Daly {{with this}} play is worth recording. In 1905 Mr Daly produced Mrs Warren's Profession in New York. The press {{of that city}} instantly raised a cry that such persons as Mrs Warren are [...] "ordure," [...] {{and should not be}} mentioned in the presence of decent people. This hideous repudiation of humanity and social conscience so took possession of the New York journalists that the few among them who kept their feet morally and intellectually could do nothing to check the epidemic of foul language, gross suggestion, and raving obscenity of word and thought that broke out. The writers abandoned all self-restraint under the impression that they were upholding virtue instead of outraging it. They infected each other with their hysteria until they were for all practical purposes indecently mad. They finally forced the police to arrest Mr Daly and his company, and led the magistrate to express his loathing of the duty thus forced upon him of reading an unmentionable and abominable play. Of course the convulsion soon exhausted itself. The magistrate, naturally somewhat impatient when he found that what he had to read was a strenuously ethical play forming <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> which had been in circulation unchallenged for eight years, and had been received without protest by the whole London and New York press, gave the journalists a piece of his mind as to their moral taste in plays. By consent, he passed the case on to a higher court, which declared that the play was not immoral; acquitted Mr Daly; and made an end of the attempt to use the law to declare living women to be [...] "ordure," [...] and thus enforce silence as to the far-reaching fact that you cannot cheapen women in the market for industrial purposes without cheapening them for other purposes as well. I hope Mrs Warren's Profession will be played everywhere, in season and out of season, until Mrs Warren has bitten that fact into the public conscience, and shamed the newspapers which support a tariff to keep up the price of every American commodity except American manhood and womanhood.|$|E
6000|$|The {{friendship}} of Malesherbes for {{the party}} of reason was shown on numerous occasions. As director of the book trade he was really the censor of {{the literature of the}} time.[82] The story of his service to Diderot is well known--how he warned Diderot that the police were about to visit his house and overhaul his papers, and how when Diderot despaired of being able to put them out of sight in his narrow quarters, Malesherbes said, [...] "Then send them all to me," [...] and took care of them until the storm was overpast. The proofs of the New Heloïsa came through his hands, and now he made himself Rousseau's agent in the affairs relative to the printing of Emilius. Rousseau entrusted the whole matter to him and to Madame de Luxembourg, being confident that, in acting through persons of such authority and position, he should be protected against any unwitting illegality. Instead of being sent to Rey, the manuscript was sold to a bookseller in Paris for six thousand francs.[83] A long time elapsed before any proofs reached the author, and he soon perceived that an edition was being printed in France as well as in Holland. Still, as Malesherbes was in some sort the director of the enterprise, the author felt no alarm. Duclos came to visit him one day, and Rousseau read aloud to him the Savoyard Vicar's Profession of Faith. [...] "What, citizen," [...] he cried, [...] "and that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that they are printing at Paris! Be kind enough not to tell any one that you read this to me."[84] Still Rousseau remained secure. Then the printing came to a standstill, and he could not find out the reason, because Malesherbes was away, and the printer did not take the trouble to answer his letters. [...] "My natural tendency," [...] he says, and as {{the rest of his life}} only too abundantly proved, [...] "is to be afraid of darkness; mystery always disturbs me, it is utterly antipathetic to my character, which is open even to the pitch of imprudence. The aspect of the most hideous monster would alarm me little, I verily believe; but if I discern at night a figure in a white sheet, I am sure to be terrified out of my life."[85] So he at once fancied that by some means the Jesuits had got possession of his book, and knowing him to be at death's door, designed to keep the Emilius back until he was actually dead, when they would publish a truncated version of it to suit their own purposes.[86] He wrote letter upon letter to the printer, to Malesherbes, to Madame de Luxembourg, and if answers did not come, or did not come exactly when he expected them, he grew delirious with anxiety. If he dropped his conviction that the Jesuits were plotting the ruin of his book and the defilement of his reputation, he lost no time in fastening a similar design upon the Jansenists, and when the Jansenists were acquitted, then the turn of the philosophers came. We have constantly to remember that all this time the unfortunate man was suffering incessant pain, and passing his nights in sleeplessness and fever. He sometimes threw off the black dreams of unfathomable suspicion, and dreamed in their stead of some sunny spot in pleasant Touraine, where under a mild climate and among a gentle people he should peacefully end his days.[87] At other times he was fond of supposing M. de Luxembourg not a duke, nor a marshal of France, but a good country squire living in some old mansion, and himself not an author, not a maker of books, but with moderate intelligence and slight attainment, finding with the squire and his dame the happiness of his life, and contributing to the happiness of theirs.[88] Alas, in spite of all his precautions, he had unwittingly drifted into the stream of great affairs. He and his book were sacrificed to the exigencies of faction; and a persecution set in, which destroyed his last chance of a composed life, by giving his reason, already disturbed, a final blow from which it never recovered.|$|E
