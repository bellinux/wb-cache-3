25|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas. Early pastoralists used felling and girdling, {{the removal of}} a ring of bark and sapwood, {{as a means of}} clearing land. In the 1950s arboricides suitable for stem injection were developed. War-surplus heavy machinery was made available, and these were used for either <b>pushing</b> <b>timber,</b> or for pulling using a chain and ball strung between two machines. These two new methods of timber control, along with the introduction and widespread adoption of several new pasture grasses and legumes promoted a resurgence in tree clearing. The 1980s also saw the release of soil-applied arboricides, notably tebuthiuron, that could be utilised without cutting and injecting each individual tree.|$|R

60|$|They {{went down}} the hill, and by and by the cloud rolled up the slope, and rocks and peaks were lost in gloom. Then Deering began to get tired, for {{although}} there was no snow {{at the bottom of the}} valley, the ground was rough.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a forest company of the Northern coast of the State of Bahia, Brazil with the objective of analyzing the handling weight of workers debarking operation, and comparing them with the recommended weight limits in the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The debarking was done with a debark system coupled to the force captured by a tractor. The table receptor supply of timber was done by two workers. The third worker <b>pushed</b> the <b>timbers</b> into the debark system and the fourth one received them debarked depositing them into the ground. The data on weight handling were obtained through a load cell. The distances between load and body, angles, displacements, and recurrences were obtained about by direct measurement and a time series analysis. The analysis of recommended weight limits was performed using a model developed by the NIOSH. According to the results, the operations of the timber debark can not be corried out by this mode because of the high frequency of weight handling per minute observed...|$|R
60|$|Margaret said nothing. When Jimmy {{brought her}} horse {{she got up}} and he ran by her stirrup. For a time she went up the valley, and then turning back obliquely through thin <b>timber,</b> <b>pushed</b> up a steep hill. Near the top she stopped and Jimmy got his breath and looked down across the trees. Dusk was falling and all was very quiet. Gloom had invaded the clearing, but he saw a small dark object he knew was the policeman's horse. A thin plume of smoke went up from his house; his fire was burning, and he {{wondered}} when it would burn again. For a few moments he was moved by a strange melancholy, and then his heart beat.|$|R
30|$|In Japan, {{there is}} a <b>push</b> to use <b>timber</b> in {{residential}} and non-residential buildings for consideration of sustainability. In October 2010, new legislation that promotes the use of wood in public buildings was enacted (Forestry Agency 2011). As Japan is located in high seismic zone, rigorous seismic design detailing and quality of construction are important considerations. Inoue et al. (1999) highlighted that, {{with the number of}} skilled carpenters decreasing, while meeting stringent performance requirement, connection detailing should be easy to construct. Various connection types are provided as a viable solution {{to be used in the}} timber industry, e.g., glued in rod (e.g., Tlustochowicz et al. 2011; Sato et al. 2007; Inoue et al. 1999), drift pins (e.g., Shojo et al. 2004, 2005).|$|R
60|$|As the Irishman {{was nothing}} loth, {{all three were}} soon in the court, whence Mike led {{the way through the}} gate, round {{to the point where the}} stockade came near the cliffs, on the eastern side of the buildings. This was the spot where the path that led down to the spring swept along the defences, and was on the very route by which the captain {{contemplated}} retreating, as well as on that by which Maud had entered the Hut, the night of the invasion. At a convenient place, a palisade had been sawed off, so low in the ground that the sods, which had been cut and were moveable, concealed the injury, while the heads of the pins that ought to have bound the timber to the cross-piece, were in their holes, leaving everything apparently secure. On removing the sods, and <b>pushing</b> the <b>timber</b> aside, the captain ascertained that a man might easily pass without the stockade. As this corner was the most retired within the works, there was no longer any doubt that the hole had been used by all the deserters, including the women and children. In what manner it became known to Nick, however, still remained matter of conjecture.|$|R
2500|$|Ellendale {{started as}} a forest and swamp on the divide between the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. The swamp was the hunting grounds of the Nanticoke Indian Tribe until they were driven out by the Lenni Lenape Tribe on the Battle Green near Chestnut Ridge, a hill on Ellendale's north side. The Lenape Trace, a main {{thoroughfare}} of a trail, passed through Ellendale as a Native American trade route from Pocomoke City, Maryland to Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. With the arrival of Europeans, the Ellendale area was a province of fur traders and hunters. Early in the 18th century, farming and <b>timbering</b> <b>pushed</b> back the swamp that once covered the area. The tract of land on which the town would later be built was originally deeded in 1740 as [...] "Bennett's Pleasure".|$|R
60|$|Namgay Doola had {{scrambled}} on the jam and was clawing out {{the butt}} of a log with a rude sort of a boat-hook. It slid forward slowly, as an alligator moves, and three or four others followed it. The green water spouted through the gaps. Then the villagers howled and shouted and leaped among the logs, pulling and <b>pushing</b> the obstinate <b>timber,</b> and the red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from up- stream battered the now weakening dam. It gave way at last in a smother of foam, racing butts, bobbing black heads, and a confusion indescribable, as the river tossed everything before it. I saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks. It rose close to the hank, and blowing like a grampus, Namgay Doola wiped {{the water out of}} his eyes and made obeisance to the king.|$|R

The virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most startling; and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones shone two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an outlander, but yet a Thibetan in language, habit, and attire. He spoke the Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was not so much a lisp as an accent.|$|R
40|$|The complex {{mechanical}} behaviour of timber {{makes it hard}} to predict the failure modes in connections made of timber in Finite Element Models (FEM). The combination of various failure modes (brittle and ductile), anisotropic behaviour, contact of steel elements and large deformations that can occur in a timber joint challenges the use of FEM. To this date no widely used approach is available for the modelling of timber connections. This knowledge gap impedes the use of large timber connections for high rise buildings in seismic regions like New Zealand. For tall seismic resilient structures a profound understanding of the various failure modes of a connection is needed to guarantee a safe design. In this thesis a new model approach with the use of cohesive elements to simulate cracking is investigated for the prediction of the {{mechanical behaviour}} of connections. An embedment test simulation is a logical step towards this connection model. Timber can be characterised by its strong longitudinal fibres and the lignin that forms the bonding between the fibres. This anisotropic structure of the material results in a strong and stiff parallel and a weaker perpendicular behaviour of the material. Timber reacts ductile to compression loading and brittle in tension and shear loading. A typical crushing action of the timber (with micro cracking and densification of the timber) occurs when the maximum compression parallel to the grain stress is reached. The specific manufacturing process of Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) reduces the inhomogeneous character of timber. This improves the strength and the predictability of the material. The cracks that occur in tension and shear can cause four different brittle failure modes in a dowelled connection (row shear, group tear out, failure of the net cross section and tensile splitting). A brittle failure mode can be prevented when minimum end or edge distances and spacing between fasteners are satisfied. In that case a ductile failure is expected with plastic deformation of the dowel and crushing of the timber underneath the dowel. FEM is a powerful tool that is able to solve complex partial differential equation problems. Its basis lies in the linear formulation of small elements that are linked by coinciding nodal degrees of freedom to form a structure. The linear formulation has limited validity and a failure criteria is needed to define the onset of nonlinear behaviour. Multiple nonlinear approaches are available to accurately simulate the complex behaviour of timber in connections. The most promising approach is the use of cohesive elements at the locations where cracks are expected. The anisotropic nature of wood makes the prediction of crack locations in connections possible. The cohesive elements have a damage formulation to simulate strength and stiffness loss after the material strength is reached. This softening model hinders the solution procedure and therefore special solution techniques (e. g. line search, automatic stabilization and viscous regularization) are employed. A first model is made to simulate the embedment behaviour in LVL. In the embedment tests conducted by Franke and Quenneville a steel dowel is <b>pushed</b> in a <b>timber</b> block with a pre-drilled hole. In the translation of this test to an accurate FEM model three nonlinear phenomena are simulated (cracking, crushing in compression and contact). The cracking behaviour in tension and shear is modelled with cohesive elements with a damage formulation. These cracks are inserted at the location of potential crack growth. The remaining timber has a trilinear isotropic plastic hardening formulation to accurately predict the deformations in the LVL under compression loading. The last nonlinear phenomena is contact between the steel and the timber. This is simulated as "hard" contact in normal direction and frictional contact in tangential direction. The implicit solver encountered difficulties in converging due to contact alterations (chatter) and the softening behaviour in the cohesive elements. The automatic time incrementation algorithm reduced the increment size to overcome these difficulties. The analysis resulted in a load displacement curve that had good agreement with the experimental curve. A parameter study proved that the small difference can be related to the natural variation of material properties. The approach of the embedment FEM was implemented in a more complex connection model. The connection tests conducted by Ottenhaus et al. that is simulated consists of 4 dowels that connect two outer LVL blocks with an inner steel plate. The spacing was chosen {{in such a way that}} a ductile failure mode was expected with brittle failure modes at large deformations. In the connection model plasticity in the steel dowels, the size of the specimens and the inclusion of tension parallel cracks increased the complexity of the model. This increased the convergence difficulties and the analysis ceased (at 0. 43 mm) before the maximum load was reached. A study was made to improve the stability of the numerical solution procedure. The impact of changing the formulations of cohesive elements, contact and the solution procedure on the convergence is tested. The viscous regularization and the initial dummy stiffness of the cohesive elements had the most influence on the convergence. With increased viscous regularization the implicit solver becomes more stable and computes more displacement increments (up to 6. 91 mm). However, viscous regularization introduces artificial forces that significantly decreased the damage evolution. This prevented the formation of brittle failure mechanism. By reducing the initial dummy stiffness of the cohesive elements (down to 2 times the timber element stiffness) the convergence improved significantly. With this initial cohesive stiffness the global softening behaviour (up to 10. 08 mm) and failure development that are observed in the experiments could be simulated. The failure development consisted of the formation of plastic hinges in the dowels, tensile splitting and finally row shear failure that completely removed the supporting action of the timber under the dowels. The decrease of cohesive element stiffness has impact on the effective stiffness of the adjacent timber elements and decreases the accuracy of the model. The model needs to be improved to make the predictions of the brittle failure development more accurate. With arc-length control, an explicit solver or the sequential linear analysis method the convergence might be increased, without the accuracy loss that is attributed to cohesive stiffness decrease. Further research is needed to improve this connection model approach...|$|R
