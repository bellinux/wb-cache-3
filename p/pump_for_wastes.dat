40|$|A Vuilleumier (VM) cycle {{heat pump}} is a closed gas cycle driven by heat energy. It {{has the highest}} {{performance}} among all known heat driven technologies. In this paper, two thermodynamic analyses, including energy and exergy analysis, are carried out to evaluate {{the application of a}} VM cycle heat <b>pump</b> <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat utilization. <b>For</b> a prototype VM cycle heat <b>pump,</b> equations <b>for</b> theoretical and actual cycles are established. Under the given conditions, the exergy efficiency for the theoretical cycle is 0. 23 compared to 0. 15 for the actual cycle. This is due to losses taking place in the actual cycle. Reheat losses and flow friction losses account for almost 83 % of the total losses. Investigation of the effect of heat source temperature, cycle pressure and speed on the exergy efficiency indicate that the low temperature waste heat is a suitable heat source for a VM cycle heat pump.

It has been calculated that heat <b>pump</b> implementation <b>for</b> turbo-compressor heat recovery enables {{a reduction of}} compressed air production costs by half.

They can produce 1. 6 – 2. 0 MW of useful heat in the form of hot water at a temperature of 50 °C from a single 1. 5 MW turbo- compressor, thus reducing the fossil fuel consumption in mines considerably. Cogeneration technology implementation <b>for</b> compressor <b>waste</b> heat recovery has shown that maximum power generation (up to 75 kW) can be achieved, depending on the compressed air temperature leaving the recovery sections of the air coolers (intercooling temperature).

40|$|Hydriding alloys are {{intermetallic}} absorbent compounds {{which have}} the remarkable quality of absorbing very large quantities of hydrogen gas per unit volume of metallic powder. The absorption and desorption of hydrogen are exothermic and endothermic reactions respectively, and take place according to a reversible chemical reaction.

These properties enable hydriding metals to be used in chemical heat <b>pumps</b> <b>for</b> upgrading industrial <b>waste</b> energy to supply useful energy in the form of process hot water or steam. With proper selection of the hydriding materials, temperature boosts of about 200 F can be obtained in a single stage cycle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the numerical design {{and analysis of}} a thermally driven thermoacoustic heat pump, which aims to utilise industrial waste heat to provide air-conditioning <b>for</b> buildings where <b>waste</b> heat are abundant but air conditioning is required. The working gas is helium at 3. 0 MPa. The operating frequency is around 100 Hz. A three-stage travelling wave thermoacoustic engine is design to convert waste heat to acoustic power, and a single stage travelling wave thermoacoustic cooler {{is connected to the}} engine to provide cooling at a temperature of - 4 ?C for air conditioning. The ambient temperature is set as 40 ?C. A system with symmetric geometric configuration was initially modelled and validated by published experimental data. The asymmetric impedance distribution was observed, and then an asymmetric system which has different geometric dimensions at each stage was modelled to improve the acoustic conditions within the system. The simulation results show that the overall energy efficiency (defined as the ratio of the cooling power divided by the total heat input) of the tested system for the given temperature range can reach 15 - 17 %, which shows the feasibility and potential for developing thermally driven thermoacoustic heat <b>pump</b> system <b>for</b> utilising <b>waste</b> heat to produce air-conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Low GWP {{refrigerant}} R 1234 ze(Z) {{is promising}} candidate of refrigerant used in industrial high temperature heat pumps. The heat exchangers of such heat <b>pumps</b> designed <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat recovery systems {{is exposed to}} the exhaust containing acid substances. Using titanium as the material can be one solution to prevent oxidation. In this study, pool boiling heat transfer characteristics outside of horizontal titanium tubes were experimentally investigated for R 1234 ze(Z) at relatively higher temperatures. A plain tube and three enhanced tubes having different fin geometry were tested in a pressure vessel and the bubble behavior was observed. The experiment covers saturation temperatures from 10 to 60 Â°C and heat fluxes from 0. 55 to 79. 8 kWm- 2. With the plain tube, {{it was confirmed that}} the measured heat transfer coefficients on the plain tube agree with the calculated heat transfer coefficients by Jung et al. correlation proposed for other HFC refrigerants within Â± 15 %. The notable difference to the typical material copper is thermal resistance over the tube wall. Because the thermal conductivity of titanium is only 19 W m- 1 K- 1 (that of copper is approximately 360 W m- 1 K- 1), the thermal resistance is onsiderable. Comparing to the plain tube, the tested enhanced tube exhibited 2. 8 to 5. 1 times higher heat transfer coefficient, on average, in the test range. This could compensate the disadvantage in thermal conductivity for titanium. The enhancement ratio predominantly depends on the saturation temperature and wall heat flux. At conditions of the higher saturation temperatures and lower heat fluxes, where smaller bubbles were observed, the test tube having smaller fin spaces exhibits higher heat transfer coefficient. The experimental results remark the importance of fin geometry optimization to the operation conditions...|$|R

40|$|The 244 -CR Vault is a two-level, {{multi-cell}} {{structure of}} reinforced concrete constructed below grade. The lower cell contains four individual compartments, each containing a steel process storage tank and {{equipped with a}} concrete sump. The upper cell contains the piping and support equipment, and has two compartments {{for each of the}} tanks. The ''pump pit'' is accessed by the removal of concrete cover blocks, while the smaller ''riser pit'' is accessed by steel cover plates. The facility most recently was used as a double-contained receiver tank (DCRT). A DCRT is a type of waste transfer tank that together with its related equipment constitutes a short-term storage area <b>for</b> liquid <b>waste</b> and has a <b>pump</b> pit <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> transfer operations. This vault most recently was used for short-term storage and <b>waste</b> routing <b>for</b> saltwell liquid <b>pumped</b> from the 241 -C Tank Farm in the 200 East Area. Waste transfer lines are connected inside the pump pit by a jumper installed between connecting nozzles. An active ventilation system is in operation at the 244 -CR vault. Ventilation supply air enters the upper vault section through an inlet header with some leakage through the spaces between the cell cover blocks. The upper and lower vaults are connected by exhauster ports, which allow airflow between the two sections. Normal flow moves air from the upper cell to the lower cell where it is removed and routed into a filter plenum; there the air is treated by a bank of four prefilters and two banks of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (each containing four HEPAs). The air is exhausted to the atmosphere through the 296 -C- 05 Stack. The stack is equipped with a record sampler and continuous air monitor. Two fans (each rated at 4, 200 cubic feet per minute) installed downstream of the filtration system provide the motive force for exhausting the vaults and the tanks. As an active system, it is operated continuously with only one of the two fans required to operate at a time. A continuous beta-gamma air monitor is interlocked to the operating fan.

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} detailed calculations {{that support the}} spray leak accident analysis in the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The consequence analyses in this document {{form the basis for}} the selection of controls to mitigate or prevent spray leaks throughout TWRS. Pressurized spray leaks can occur due to a breach in containment barriers along transfer routes, during waste transfers. Spray leaks are of particular safety concern because, depending on leak dimensions, and waste pressure, they can be relatively efficient generators of dispersible sized aerosols that can transport downwind to onsite and offsite receptors. Waste is transferred between storage tanks and between processing facilities and storage tanks in TWRS through a system of buried transfer lines. <b>Pumps</b> <b>for</b> transferring <b>waste</b> and jumpers and valves <b>for</b> rerouting <b>waste</b> are located inside below grade pits and structures that are normally covered. Pressurized spray leaks can emanate to the atmosphere due to breaches in waste transfer associated equipment inside these structures should the structures be uncovered {{at the time of the}} leak. Pressurized spray leaks can develop through holes or cracks in transfer piping, valve bodies or pump casings caused by such mechanisms as corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, or water hammer. Leaks through degraded valve packing, jumper gaskets, or pump seals can also result in pressurized spray releases. Mechanisms that can degrade seals, packing and gaskets include aging, radiation hardening, thermal stress, etc. An 1782 other common cause for spray leaks inside transfer enclosures are misaligned jumpers caused by human error. A spray leak inside a DST valve pit during a transfer of aging waste was selected as the bounding, representative accident for detailed analysis. Sections 2 through 5 below develop this representative accident using the DOE- STD- 3009 format. Sections 2 describes the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios evaluated to determine the need for safety class SSCs or TSR controls. Section 3 develops the source terms associated with the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios. Section 4 estimates the radiological and toxicological consequences for the unmitigated and mitigated scenarios. Section 5 compares the radiological and toxicological consequences against the TWRS evaluation guidelines. Section 6 extrapolates from the representative accident case to other represented spray leak sites to assess the conservatism in using the representative case to define controls for other postulated spray leak sites throughout TWRS. Section 7 discusses the sensitivities of the consequence analyses to the key parameters and assumptions used in the analyses. Conclusions are drawn in Section 8. The analyses herein pertain to spray leaks initiated due to internal mechanisms (e. g., corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, etc). External initiators of spray leaks (e. g., excavation accidents), and natural phenomena initiators (e. g., seismic events) are to be covered in separate accident analyses...|$|R
