50|$|Over {{the next}} 20 years {{the island was}} {{dramatically}} altered, {{and one of the}} country's finest forts was built. Dedicated in 1847, Fort Warren's defensive design was virtually obsolete upon completion. However, the fort served as a training ground, <b>patrol</b> <b>point,</b> and Civil War prison that gained a favorable reputation for the humane treatment of its Confederate prisoners. After 100 years of military use, the fort was decommissioned in 1947 and acquired by the Metropolitan District Commission for historic preservation and recreation in 1958.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} the design ideas of patrol {{system based on}} real-time image acquisition in patrol points. In this system, the image acquisition terminals are mounted on many patrol points, which are set in a predetermined patrol line. When patrol officers arrived at a <b>patrol</b> <b>point,</b> the image acquisition terminal mounted on the <b>patrol</b> <b>point</b> will capture a live image via a GPRS MMS module,and then the image acquisition terminal sends this image to the central control unit in a form of MMS. The central control unit receives the sent MMS message, and separate out the image information from the received message, and then saves it to a database. According to the actual test results of this patrol system, it can not only meet the design requirements, but also the whole system has a high stability and reliability...|$|E
5000|$|At {{this time}} the Seguin area {{was a part of}} Gonzales County. The Rangers had found this was a good halfway stop between their <b>patrol</b> <b>points.</b> The big oaks and walnut groves along the Walnut Branch ( [...] Nogales means 'nuts' in Spanish), had become a {{familiar}} and pleasant location.

60|$|The Colonel {{had been}} looking about him during the long exhortation of the Moolah, and he had {{observed}} that the Dervishes were cleaning their guns, counting their cartridges, and making all the preparations of men who expected that they might soon {{be called upon to}} fight. The two Emirs were conferring together with grave faces, and the leader of the <b>patrol</b> <b>pointed,</b> as he spoke to them, in the direction of Egypt. It was evident that there was at least a chance of a rescue if they could only keep things going for a few more hours. The camels were not recovered yet from their long march, and the pursuers, if they were indeed close behind, were almost certain to overtake them.|$|R
5000|$|... 230 sqn {{was one of}} two Northern Ireland based squadrons of the Royal Air Force, {{the other}} being 72 Squadron (equipped with Westland Wessex HC2s). 230 Squadron's 18 Puma {{aircraft}} were rotated with No. 33 Squadron's 15 Pumas to even out flight hours amongst the fleet (Northern Ireland based helicopters had a much higher operational tempo). In 230 Sqn service the main role of the fleet was tactical transport of the Security Forces, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Police Service of Northern Ireland and the British Army, either to <b>patrol</b> <b>points</b> or one of the military bases dotted around Northern Ireland. A well travelled route for the Pumas, {{as well as for the}} visiting Chinooks of 7 and 18 Squadrons was to the Royal Irish Regiment camp at Ballykinler, South Down.|$|R

50|$|For {{the next}} 12 days, Witter {{performed}} her anti-submarine screening duties for various {{units of the}} fleet off Okinawa. Though subjected to intermittent air attack and forced to witness several suicide attacks, she escaped unscathed until 6 April. Her primary duty throughout the period remained anti-submarine <b>patrols</b> at various <b>points</b> around the island of Okinawa. During that time, she made several sonar contacts but made no depth charge attacks.|$|R
2500|$|The last <b>patrol</b> of <b>Point</b> Cypress was {{conducted}} on 4 August with Point Marone in a narrow canal flowing into the Cổ Chiên River with 25 Kit Carson Scouts aboard each cutter and a mostly South Vietnamese Navy crew. After both cutters had turned around in the narrow canal, Point Marone was damaged by a command detonated mine causing three deaths among the Vietnamese crew and Scouts and several injuries. Point Cypress provided suppression fire with machine guns and her mortar and the Point Marone managed to clear the ambush scene. [...] Eleven days later, on 15 August 1970 the patched and painted Point Marone and the Point Cypress were {{turned over to the}} Republic of Vietnam Navy with Point Cypress recommissioned as RVNS Hồ Duy (HQ-724).|$|R
50|$|The three {{remaining}} APDs, Little, , and , {{continued to}} support and help supply the Marines. On 4 September, Little and Gregory brought a detachment of marine raiders to Savo Island on an unfounded rumor that enemy forces had occupied it. The troops were returned to Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. That night was unusually dark, so Division Commander Hugh W. Hadley decided to <b>patrol</b> off Lunga <b>Point</b> rather than attempt to negotiate Tulagi Harbor with no visible landmarks.|$|R

50|$|Beaver <b>Patrol</b> is the <b>point</b> where Pop Will Eat Itself's musical style {{drastically}} {{changed with}} the loss of live drums due to Graham converting to lead vocals. Beaver Patrol is far more electronic than anything previously released by the band, with a drum machine replacing the live drumkit and the prominent use of various vocal samples. This new style would persist for the next six years, until the introduction of a new live drummer, Fuzz Townshend.|$|R
50|$|On 13 October, Russell sailed with TF 78 for the Philippines and on 20 October, as {{the troops}} of the Northern Attack Force landed south of Tacloban, <b>patrolled</b> off Alabat <b>Point.</b> On 21 October, she took up fire support duties {{to the north of}} the {{unloading}} area.

50|$|Lacedemonian {{was under}} Wrench's command when the French {{captured}} her on 6 April 1797. She was <b>patrolling</b> near <b>Point</b> Salines, Grenada, when she encountered a sloop. Lacedemonian gave chase {{for much of}} the day, when towards late afternoon another sloop appeared and started to chase Lacedomonian, while firing some random shots from long range. Lacedemonium gave up her chase and turned her attention towards her pursuer. Eventually, the newcomer caught up and Wrench stopped, with his crew at quarters. The newcomer did not display a flag but replied to queries in English. Lacedemonians crew relaxed, so when the newcomer sent over a boat with armed men, and ran into Lacedemonian, they were taken by surprise. Wrench tried to organize resistance but the attackers knocked him down and took over the brig. The subsequent court martial ordered a severe reprimand for Wrench for having allowed himself to be caught unprepared.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not to}} e {{supposed}} that the Indians, seeing the sentinels, would come directly across from the island; but {{might be expected to}} dart swiftly toward one or the other headlands, and therefore it was that Mark divided his small force, sending Luke to <b>patrol</b> the northern <b>point,</b> while he paced to and fro on the southern side of the harbor where it was more reasonable to suppose a landing would be attempted. Susan was to walk {{back and forth on the}} shore between the two lads.|$|R

2500|$|A <b>patrol</b> to <b>Point</b> 630 on 12 October {{was fired}} on by about 45 Ottoman {{soldiers}} with machine guns, before the Australian Mounted Division's machine guns engaged them {{for about half}} an hour, eventually forcing them back. At 13:30 the next day a patrol to El Buqqar was fired on by 30 Ottoman soldiers [...] northeast of that place, while a reconnaissance by the General Staff of Anzac Mounted Division to Esani, was underway. On 14 October, one NCO and two men were captured by Ottoman cavalry at Point 720, when they attempted to capture a Bedouin who had fired on them. Two troops of Ottoman cavalry, armed with lances, swords, and rifles, wearing blue and white tunics and riding Arab ponies, galloped quickly to cut off and capture the three Australian Mounted Division soldiers. A troop sent forward recaptured Point 720, but the Ottoman cavalry were seen in the distance, retiring to the east.|$|R
50|$|It is {{compulsory}} for a bearer to {{hold the}} card at all times (apart from the NIC, a driving license, Sri Lankan passport or temporary identification document can be used) and show the cards to police officers conducting regular screening while on <b>patrol,</b> check <b>points</b> for instance. The police may detain suspicious individuals who fail to show any form of legal identification until relevant identification can be produced in person or by proxy. The NIC is also a required document for some government procedures, for commercial transactions such as {{the opening of a}} bank account, and for entry to high-security government or private premises by surrendering or exchanging for an entry pass. Failure to produce the card may result in denied access to these premises or denial of goods and services. Most notably it is required to apply for a passport (over 16), driving licence (over 18) and to vote (over 18).|$|R
25|$|Her tenth—and {{ultimately}} last—patrol {{began on}} 8 May 1943. U-558 ran into difficulty many times during this <b>patrol.</b> At one <b>point,</b> she manoeuvred {{to attack a}} large eastbound convoy, but a destroyer harried her into retreat. Off Lisbon on 14 July, a British Wellington bomber from No. 179 Squadron RAF dropped depth charges; U-558 was not hit, and damaged the plane with anti-aircraft fire. Three days later off Porto on 17 July, a British Liberator from 224 Squadron dropped 24 35-pound anti-submarine bombs, but U-558 was able to escape by crash-diving; the plane took damage from anti-aircraft fire and its own malfunctioning bombs.|$|R
50|$|On 7 August Mugford was on <b>patrol</b> off Lunga <b>Point,</b> Guadalcanal, {{when a large}} Japanese airstrike came in; three {{near misses}} and one bomb hit couldn’t prevent Mugford from downing two of her attackers, but she {{suffered}} eight killed, 17 wounded, and 10 missing. Next day she shot down another enemy aircraft in a raid in which she suffered no damage, and rescued two enemy aviators from the water. On the 9th, she sped toward {{the action of the}} first Battle of Savo Island, arriving in time to pull 400 survivors of Vincennes (CA-44) and Astoria (CA-34) from the water.|$|R
50|$|On {{the last}} day of November, she {{departed}} Norfolk and shaped a course for the Pacific Ocean and duty with the U.S. 7th Fleet in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Steaming via the Panama Canal, the Galápagos Islands, and Bora Bora in the Society Islands, she arrived at Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea on 3 January 1945. Upon her arrival, the destroyer escort was assigned to convoy duty between New Guinea and the Philippines, primarily on the Hollandia-to-Leyte run. Early in April, however, she dropped her runs to New Guinea and limited her operations to escort missions among major ports in the Philippines such as Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, and Manila Bay. That duty lasted until 25 May when she reported to the Commander, Task Group (TG) 71.5 at Subic Bay for duty escorting submarines to and from their war <b>patrol</b> release <b>points.</b> When not engaged in her primary duty, Woodson participated in post-refit exercises with submarines and conducted antisubmarine patrols. Such activities occupied her through the end of hostilities and until the end of August.|$|R
5000|$|The missile is {{deployed}} in a Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) canister mounted on cross-country 7-axle chassis on a mobile launch vehicle. The chassis incorporates jacks, gas and hydraulic drives and cylinders, {{with a power}} of several hundred tons, for jacking and leveling of the launcher, speeding up (combat) and slowing down (maintaining) elevation of the container with the missile in the vertical position. The TEL {{is accompanied by a}} Mobile command post, carrying support facilities mounted on cross-country 4-axle chassis with unified vans. The complex is equipped with an onboard inertial navigation system which gives the TEL group the capability to conduct the launch independently from its field deployment sites. This topo-geodesic support and navigation subsystem, created by the [...] "Signal" [...] Research Institute, provides a quick and highly precise tie-in of the launcher in a field position and enables its crew to carry out missile launches from any combat <b>patrol</b> route <b>point.</b> The launch can also be carried out at regimental bases from the aforementioned garrison garage.|$|R
500|$|What {{happened}} to the Shangani <b>Patrol</b> after this <b>point</b> is known only from Matabele sources. According to these accounts, the warriors offered the remaining whites their lives if they surrendered, but Wilson's men refused to give up. They used their dead horses for cover, and killed more than ten times their own number (about 500, Mjaan estimated), but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides. The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded, to the astonishment of the Matabele, who thought the whites must be bewitched: [...] "These are not men but magicians," [...] said one Matabele inDuna.|$|R
