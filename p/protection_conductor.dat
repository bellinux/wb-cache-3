25|$|Additional {{precautions}} must {{be taken}} to prevent side-flashes between conductive objects on or in the structure and the lightning protection system. The surge of lightning current through a lightning <b>protection</b> <b>conductor</b> will create a voltage difference between it and any conductive objects that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or explosive materials. The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the lightning protection system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.|$|E
40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems all the wiring exposed to mechanical damages and other insulation stresses, such as flexible cords, can {{be involved in}} overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions. The circuit protective devices can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. Some fire ignitions result from these types of special unprotected faults. To highlight the local incident energy in case of fault, the paper introduces the parameters steady current and transient current densities that assist to analyze these fault events.

40|$|The common {{electrical}} equipment as laptops, printers, refrigerators, table lights, televisions, etc., are supplied by electrical power cables, flexible cords and extension cords, generally of low cross section, constituted by stranded bare conductors. Flexible cords and extension cords {{are exposed to}} mechanical damages and other insulation stresses and so can be involved in overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions and/or electric shock hazard. The circuit protective devices can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. A series of simulating tests have confirmed how some fire ignitions of nearby flammable materials result caused from these types of faults. It appears necessary wiring the cords and extension cords with a grounding <b>protection</b> <b>conductor</b> also supplying Class II equipment. In fact involving the ground in every faults allows in AC systems a fast protection by residual current protective devices (RCDs or GFPDs). At this aim the use of special cables, Ground-Fault-Forced Cables (GFFCs), is recommended, particularly for cords and extension cords...|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding <b>protection</b> <b>conductor,</b> so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure. The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPDs). By adopting the GFFC type of cables internally to Class II equipment, the disconnecting supplying measure could be extended to equipment also...|$|E

The industrial machinery industry has expressed a need to use smaller conductors, similar to those allowed by the International Electrotechincal Commission (IEC).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyze {{earthing}} systems for houses. By practical measurements and theoretical analyzes consequences of possible faults, that can occur within the facility and in the low-voltage distribution network, is illustrated.    The reason for this project is that nowadays one has to arrange with a main equipotential bonding system for buildings. Apart from that, if necessary, bathrooms must be provided with a supplementary equipotential bonding system. The practical measurements verify that potential differences in facilities {{may be due to}} voltage drops in the PEN conductor between the origin of the electrical installation and the power transformer. Based on the theoretical analyzes of possible faults, it is considered that the requirement for  supplementary equipotential bonding systems for bathrooms in most cases can be questioned, when basic insulation, fault protection, residual current devise and main equipotential bonding system already provides an adequate level of <b>protection.</b> A PEN <b>conductor</b> loss may result in a situation where metallic parts attached to the equipotential bonding system starts working as earth electrodes. Equipotential bonding system may also increase the incidence of stray currents. If TN-C-S systems is provided with a local connection to earth a redundant system against PEN conductor loss is obtained. That is not the case for neutral conductor loss in TN-S systems with a local connection to earth. If district heating pipes is supplied with insulated flanges it prevents stray currents and foreign potential to be spread in the district heating network...|$|R
40|$|People using {{electrical}} installations {{have to be}} protected against electrical shock. For purposes of protection a distinction is made between direct and indirect contact. Direct contact is contact with a live <b>conductor.</b> <b>Protection</b> {{is provided by the}} insulation of cables or the screening of live parts. An indirect contact happens when someone touches exposed metal parts which are not intended to carry current but have become live {{as a result of a}} fault. In this case metallic parts raise the metal to a dangerous potential (contact voltage). Here protection is provided by connecting the exposed metal part (i. e. the case of the electrical machine) to the earthing point of the installation. A protective device will disconnect the circuit as soon as a fault current flows to earth. The earth fault value will depend on the impedance of the path taken by the fault current, which is known as the earth fault loop. The resistance of the earth electrode plays an important role in the final impedance of the earth fault loop, especially when the neutral of the transformer is earthed without any impedance. A good earth electrode should have the lowest possible value compared with the rest of the earth loop (voltage divisor). If this can be achieved, the contact voltage will be limited and the current that trips the protections will be of a higher value. The maximum duration of a contact voltage is established according to IEC 60364 - 4 413. 1. 1. 1. An important constraint in obtaining a good resistance value for the earth electrode is the resistivity of the soil...|$|R
