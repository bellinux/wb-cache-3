5000|$|The Hurrians, a small, tailed, {{vegetarian}} primate {{species have}} found on their space travels that large, non-tailed omnivorous intelligent ape species {{always end up}} destroying themselves in a nuclear war. The Hurrians adopted the policy of helping to rebuild the remains of these <b>planetary</b> <b>societies</b> after their nuclear wars, while extracting tribute and genetically modifying the inhabitants into more peaceful races. They are not acting completely selflessly, either: as is discovered in the subsequent conversation with a captured human, each race [...] "helped" [...] in this fashion pays the Hurrians a [...] "modest" [...] contribution, choosing the product that this race is best at. In one case, an otherwise poor race pays in its own members, by forfeiting a set number of individuals into servitude each year.|$|R

25|$|The Viagens {{stories were}} written in two phases; the first, written between 1948 and 1953 and {{published}} between 1949 and 1958, was a burst of activity that produced the first four Krishna novels {{and most of the}} non-Krishna pieces, including all the short stories. The second, produced at a more deliberate pace from 1977–1992, comprised the remaining four Krishna novels and the two novels of the Kukulkan sequence. The early works established the setting of a cosmopolitan future interstellar civilization comprising both Terrans {{and a handful of other}} space-faring races who trade and squabble with each other while attempting to maintain a benign stewardship of the more primitive <b>planetary</b> <b>societies</b> with which they come into contact. The later works assumed but largely ignored this background, concentrating exclusively on the adventures of Terrans on the alien worlds of Krishna and Kukulkan.|$|R

These regular guests provide information and perspective on advances in space science and exploration. The show usually also features interviews and conversations with scientists, engineers, designers, analysts, writers, activists, astronauts and others involved in space exploration, advocacy and education. At {{the end of the}} program, a light-hearted segment called [...] "What's Up" [...] with Bruce Betts usually highlights where and when you can see significant astronomical events that week, a random space fact, announcements of any anniversaries, and a space trivia contest where randomly chosen participants can usually win a T-shirt, poster or calendar.|$|R
40|$|The Georgia Institute of Technology Prox- 1 {{mission is}} an ESPA-class, student-designed, student-built {{satellite}} mission designed to demonstrate automated relative trajectory control {{in conjunction with}} a semi-cooperative target in Low-Earth Orbit. It is scheduled for launch in September of 2016 aboard the Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP- 2) mission as a secondary payload. The primary mission of the spacecraft is to perform flight qualification and performance validation of experimental flight hardware; to deploy The <b>Planetary</b> <b>Society’s</b> LightSail mission, an internally housed 3 U cubesat; and to perform relative trajectory control with respect to that target utilizing passive thermal imaging and automated on-board guidance algorithms. Several subsystems are integrated to accomplish this mission, and a description of the subsystem components is detailed in this paper. An overview of the concept operations is also presented here. For the automated proximity operations phase of the mission, Prox- 1 will demonstrate an advanced Guidance, Navigation, 2 ̆ 6 Control subsystem. This subsystem will combine GN 2 ̆ 6 C algorithms and filters developed in-house and based on reference literature. This paper will provide an overview of the Prox- 1 mission and the advancements it brings to the small satellite community...|$|R

40|$|This Appendix {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. report to the In-Space propulsion research group of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) that was authored by Taylor et al. in 2003. The subject of this report is the technological maturity, readiness, and capability of the photon solar sail to support space-exploration missions. Technological maturity for solar photon sail concepts is extremely high high for rectangular (or square) solar sail configurations due to the historical development of the rectangular design by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). L'Garde Inc., ILC Dover Inc., DLR, and many other corporations and agencies. However, future missions and mission analysis may prove that the rectangular sail design is not the best architecture for achieving mission goals. Due to the historical focus on rectangular solar sail spacecraft designs, the maturity of other architectures such as hoop-supported disks, multiple small disk arrays, parachute sails, heliogyro sails, perforated sails, multiple vane sails (such as the <b>Planetary</b> <b>Society's</b> Cosmos 1), inflated pillow sails, etc., have not reached a high level of technological readiness. (Some sail architectures are shown in Fig. A. 1.) The possibilities of different sail architectures and some possible mission concepts are discussed in this Appendix...|$|R
