5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E

Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E

He spread his beliefs widely; they became known as Marcionism. In the introduction to his book [...] "Early Christian Writings", Henry Wace stated: A modern divine... could not refuse to discuss the question raised by Marcion, whether there is such opposition between different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> regards as the word of God, that all cannot {{come from the same}} author.|$|R

Rabbi Nebenzahl also opposes Jewish tour groups to the Temple Mount. In 2004 he stated before an Israeli court that any Jew guilty <b>of</b> selling <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> termed the Land of Israel falls under the law of Din Rodef, meaning he is subject to being killed legally under religious law. One of his students, Rabbi Joel Landau, assisted him in publishing his work.|$|R
25|$|Although he {{expected}} to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith {{had to pay for}} the care of the Africans from his own pocket. (In the end, Smith was reimbursed for only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had spent, and he had to mortgage his home to cover the rest.) To partially cover his expenses, he hired the Africans out to plantation owners at two dollars per month each. Boys too young for field work were placed as servants in private homes. Several of the men were blind or sick, and could not be put to work. At this point the condition of the Africans rescued from Guerrero was indistinguishable from slavery. The Africans were in a legal limbo. There were laws covering Africans seized while being illegally imported into the United States, but they did not apply to Africans who entered the country accidentally. In April 1828 President John Quincy Adams requested Congress to pass a supplementary law dealing with the Guerrero Africans, but it failed to act. A year later, in March 1829, Congress appropriated funds to reimburse Waters Smith and transport the Guerrero Africans to Liberia.|$|E

5000|$|Svensson {{also served}} as the {{defendant}} to Lars Tingström (known in Sweden by the nickname Bombmannen, [...] "the Bomb-Man"), who was later convicted of three bomb attacks around Stockholm. In 1996 Svensson published <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was a testament authored by Tingström {{shortly before his death}} in 1993. In the purported testament, Tingström wrote that he had given Christer Pettersson the instructions to assassinate Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. The journalist Gunnar Wall wrote an article in Dagens Nyheter where he accused Svensson of manipulating the testament from Tingström. A forensic investigation later proved the testament to be real. Svensson's information led the prosecutors to file an application for a new trial against Pettersson for the assassination of Palme, but this was rejected by the Supreme Court.|$|R
6000|$|The general {{impression}} last night {{appeared to be}} that the friends [...] of Trinity College were relieved; that the liberal party and the [...] nonconformists were well satisfied with the conformity between the [...] proposed measure and the accepted principles of university [...] organisation in England; but that the Roman catholics would think [...] themselves hardly or at least not generously used. All that Mr. [...] Gladstone has heard this morning through private channels, as well [...] as the general tone of the press, tends to corroborate the [...] favourable <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> gathered last night, and to give hope [...] that reasonable and moderate Roman catholics may see that their [...] real grievances will be removed; generally also to support the [...] expectation that the bill is not likely to pass.|$|R

2500|$|Although many sixteenth-century {{references}} to football are disapproving or dwell upon their dangers {{there are two}} notable departures from this view. First, Sir Thomas Elyot (although previously {{a critic of the}} game) advocates [...] "footeball" [...] as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls vehement exercise in his Castell of Helth published in 1534. Secondly English headmaster Richard Mulcaster provides in his 1581 publication the earliest evidence of organised, refereed football for small teams playing in formation.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Barnes's journalism was {{subjective}} and experiential. Writing about {{a conversation with}} James Joyce, she admitted to missing <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said because her attention had wandered, though she revered Joyce's writing. Interviewing the successful playwright Donald Ogden Stewart, she shouted at him for [...] "roll over and find yourself famous" [...] while other writers continued to struggle, then said she wouldn't mind dying; as her biographer Phillip Herring points out, this is [...] "a depressing and perhaps unprecedented note on which to end an interview." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{making of}} Plekzationz first {{three of its}} four tracks, [...] "Chance Meets Causality Uptown," [...] "(No) Escape From '79" [...] and [...] "Inside The Analog Continuum," [...] was more {{intricate}} than his past releases in that, instead of just converting a whole raw analog recording into a digital stereo track, Edwards also digitally fine-tuned small the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had recorded. Edwards compared the album's third part, [...] "Inside The Analog Continuum," [...] to the works of dubstep artist Loefah, an artist whose works were heavily focused on the basslines and drums echo-filtered noises in the background. He described the song as a much more noise-present and less bass-heavy version of Loefah's material. The album's closer, [...] "A Pedant's Progress," [...] is its only unedited track, serving as a [...] "antidote" [...] for the digitally-altered previous three tracks. The recording involved a synthesizer that was fed through two effects channels.|$|R
5000|$|Q Magazine {{called the}} title track of World Turned Upside Down [...] "a crusty anthem", and La Pasionaria [...] "the best Spanish Civil War song since The Clash's Spanish Bombs." [...] Simon Jones wrote of Claws And Wings in fRoots {{magazine}} that Burbridge made the album [...] "for all the right reasons", and that [...] "authenticity is a big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> about." [...] Disorder prompted the assertion that [...] "Burbridge always was a caustic writer", but in his individualistic approach, [...] "in fact he was pointing out the very obvious flaws in our so-called civilised society." [...] When Goodbye To The Madhouse appeared {{in the autumn of}} 2007, fRoots summarised the change in focus, commenting that [...] "Burbridge's vitriol has been toned down", and [...] "thoughts of band and writer seem to be rising above the national into overarching concepts that, like the work of the best, apply at any number of levels". The acoustic album Gathered earned Nick Burbridge the title of Best Songwriter in the 2013 Spiral Earth awards, and in the same year his work appeared on the AQA A Level Communication and Culture syllabus.|$|R
60|$|Supposing that, with my help, {{he found}} Mr. Monkton's body, {{and took it}} back with him to England, was it right in me thus to lend myself to {{promoting}} the marriage which would most likely follow these events--a marriage which {{it might be the}} duty of every one to prevent at all hazards? This set me thinking about the extent of his madness, or to speak more mildly and more correctly, of his delusion. Sane he certainly was on all ordinary subjects; nay, in all the narrative <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had said to me on this very evening he had spoken clearly and connectedly. As for the story of the apparition, other men, with intellects as clear as the intellects of their neighbors had fancied themselves pursued by a phantom, and had even written about it in a high strain of philosophical speculation. It was plain that the real hallucination in the case now before me lay in Monkton's conviction of the truth of the old prophecy, and in his idea that the fancied apparition was a supernatural warning to him to evade its denunciations; and it was equally clear that both delusions had been produced, in the first instance, by the lonely life he had led acting on a naturally excitable temperament, which was rendered further liable to moral disease by an hereditary taint of insanity.|$|R

2500|$|Sarah Kane (3 February 1971 [...] 20 February 1999) was an English playwright. Her plays {{deal with}} themes of redemptive love, sexual desire, pain, torture—both {{physical}} and psychological—and death. They are characterised by a poetic intensity, pared-down language, exploration of theatrical form and, in her earlier work, {{the use of}} extreme and violent stage action. Kane herself, as well as scholars of her work, such as Graham Saunders, identify some of her inspirations as expressionist theatre and Jacobean tragedy. The critic Aleks Sierz has seen her work as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has termed In-Yer-Face theatre, a form of drama which {{broke away from the}} conventions of naturalist theatre. Kane's published work consists of five plays, one short film, Skin, and two newspaper articles for The Guardian.|$|E

They also alerted journalists at the Boston Globe, which published a lengthy article on July 15, 2017, outlining the problems which had existed for several years despite the fact that the center had been upgraded to a four-star rating by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016. Within hours of publication of the Boston Globe article, David Shulkin, the Secretary for Veterans Affairs, announced the removal of two of the center's top administrators as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called a [...] "top-to-bottom" [...] review of the facility's operations. The following month Shulkin announced the establishment of a special task force to review the overall provision of medical care for New Hampshire's veterans and pledged $30 million to upgrade the Manchester VA center. Fallout from the affair led New Hampshire's congressional delegation to renew their efforts in the US Congress to re-establish a full-service veterans hospital in the state.|$|E

That doesn’t make him sound reasonable or even sane, but it also makes him impossible to dismiss. The show has tried to do ambiguous conflicts before, and fumbled them because it’s hard to work up a lot of tension when the “bad” guys are too indistinct to be a clear threat. But there’s tension right now because the Alexandrians’ apparent decency works in perfect contrast with our heroes’ rugged desperation. It’s still entirely possible that all of this will collapse next week, but for once, there’s a fight going on with a risk that feels more pressing than the loss of a location or the sacrifice of a couple of cast members.

2500|$|Luke Goss as Prince Nuada Silverlance: King Balor's {{son and a}} {{martial arts}} expert of {{extraordinary}} proficiency. Goss was previously cast as mutant vampire Jared Nomak in del Toro's 2002 film Blade II, and the director approached the actor to be cast in Hellboy II. The only other actor considered for the part was Charlie Hunnam. Goss trained with action director and former Jackie Chan Stunt Team member, Brad Allan, learning sword and spear skills for six to seven months for his role. He and Anna Walton also learned ancient Gaelic from a dialog coach for their lines. Goss did not perceive Nuada as evil, explaining, [...] "It's issues, his people, he's <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> truly believes.

2500|$|In June 1940 he {{was charged}} with {{compiling}} the Informationsheft G.B., a blueprint for the occupation of Britain after a proposed invasion by Nazi Germany.

He based his work on the interrogations of British agents Best and Stevens, along with his own [...] "preconceptions". <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> prepared was described as [...] "a handbook for German troops and officials as a guide to the British institutions they would encounter." [...] The extent of his direct involvement in compiling the book and its supplement, however, has been disputed.

Both Schellenberg and Heydrich perceived Great Britain as a country run by [...] "Freemasons, Jews, and a small public-school-trained elite." [...] Despite the poor opinion of Britain shared by both men, their full attention was turned there when on 10 May 1941, Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess made his infamous flight to Scotland. Subsequently, SD Chief Schellenberg informed Hitler that Hess had been long {{under the influence of the}} British Secret Service and German collaborators. Upon further investigation, Schellenberg also reported to Hitler that Hess made his flight under the advice of an astrologer, which incited the activity of Heydrich who promptly arrested as many mediums, psychics, and astrologers he could round up in Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhere {{between these}} {{perspectives}} was Cecil Sharp's, whose English Folk-Chanteys (1914) {{was published in}} the same year, and was based on shanties he collected from aged English sailors in Britain. Sharp responds to Bullen's claims of African-American origins by ceding that many shanties were influenced through the singing of Black shantymen—a position that assumes English folk song was the core of the tradition by default. The title of Sharp's work reflects his project of collecting and grouping shanties as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> conceived to be a rather continuous English folk song tradition. Sharp states in the introduction that he deliberately excluded shanties which were obviously (i.e. to him) born of popular songs. This idea is problematic when one considers that the popular songs that were feeding shanties were largely American and based in real or imagined African-American musical traits. However, Sharp believed that by eliminating such shanties based on popular songs, he could concentrate those that were [...] "folk" [...] songs. Of his own admission, Sharp lacked any shantying or sea experience to intuitively judge shanties like someone such as Bullen, however he offers his objectivity, recording precisely what was sung to him, as consolation. While Sharp's manner of documenting shanties was more or less objective, the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study. And whereas Bullen's work was fairly inaccessible, Sharp was influential as the leader of a cohort of scholars who were actively creating the young field of folk song research.|$|E
