40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{cervical}} cancer screening methods available in developing countries, and to discuss alternative effective methods of screening. Cervical cancer is a preventable and curable disease. However, it continues to threaten the lives of women today. Annual world incidence is an estimated 529, 000 and mortality is 275, 000. Eighty- five percent of cases and the majority of deaths due to cervical cancer occur in developing countries. Cytology via Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, the golden standard method of screening over the past decades, is not generally a suitable method of screening in low-resource regions. The implementation and sustainability of Pap smear programs have not yet been possible in those countries. Alternative methods have been developed and tested for low-resource countries, including visual inspection by acetic acid (VIA), HPV-DNA, and careHPV-DNA. These screening methods, along with the preventive vaccine, have a greater potential for decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer in developing countries.

Horses born in Iceland and exported to Culicoides-rich areas are frequently affected with IBH. The {{aims of the}} study were to compare immunization with recombinant allergens using the adjuvant aluminum hydroxide (Alum) alone or combined with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) for development of a <b>preventive</b> <b>immunization</b> against IBH. Twelve healthy Icelandic horses were vaccinated intralymphatically three times with 10 μg each of four recombinant Culicoides nubeculosus allergens in Alum or in Alum/MPLA. Injection with allergens in both Alum and Alum/MPLA resulted in significant increase in specific IgG subclasses and IgA against all r-allergens with {{no significant differences between the}} adjuvant groups. The induced antibodies from both groups could block binding of allergen specific IgE from IBH affected horses to a similar extent. No IgE-mediated reactions were induced. Allergen-stimulated PBMC from Alum/MPLA horses but not from Alum only horses produced significantly more IFNγ and IL- 10 than PBMC from non-vaccinated control horses.

We found high ZP 3 expression in granulosa cell tumors of the transgenic mice, in human surface ovarian cancer and granulosa cell lines, and in human granulosa cell tumors and their metastases. Early <b>preventive</b> <b>immunization</b> (between 2 and 5. 5 mo of age) of transgenic mice with recombinant human (rh) ZP 3 prevented ovarian tumorigenesis, and delayed therapeutic immunization (between 4. 5 and 7 mo) reduced weights of existing tumors by 86 and 75 %, respectively (P< 0. 001), compared to vehicle-treated control mice.

40|$|Summary: The {{complement}} system comprises several fluid-phase and membrane-associated proteins. Under physiological conditions, {{activation of the}} fluid-phase components of complement is maintained under tight control and complement activation occurs primarily on surfaces recognized as “nonself” {{in an attempt to}} minimize damage to bystander host cells. Membrane complement components act to limit complement activation on host cells or to facilitate uptake of antigens or microbes “tagged” with complement fragments. While this review focuses on the role of complement in infectious diseases, work {{over the past couple of}} decades has defined several important functions of complement distinct from that of combating infections. Activation of complement in the fluid phase can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway. Deficiencies of components of the classical pathway lead to the development of autoimmune disorders and predispose individuals to recurrent respiratory infections and infections caused by encapsulated organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. While no individual with complete mannan-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency has been identified, low MBL levels have been linked to predisposition to, or severity of, several diseases. It appears that MBL may play an important role in children, who have a relatively immature adaptive immune response. C 3 is the point at which all complement pathways converge, and complete deficiency of C 3 invariably leads to severe infections, including those caused by meningococci and pneumococci. Deficiencies of the alternative and terminal complement pathways result in an almost exclusive predisposition to invasive meningococcal disease. The spleen plays an important role in antigen processing and the production of antibodies. Splenic macrophages are critical in clearing opsonized encapsulated bacteria (such as pneumococci, meningococci, and Escherichia coli) and intraerythrocytic parasites such as those causing malaria and babesiosis, which explains the fulminant nature of these infections in persons with anatomic or functional asplenia. Paramount to the management of patients with complement deficiencies and asplenia is educating patients about their predisposition to infection and the importance of <b>preventive</b> <b>immunizations</b> and seeking prompt medical attention...|$|R

This study iden-tified HBV genotypes and transmission modes associated with acute infection in British Columbia (BC), Canada, from 2001 to 2005. Seventy cases of acute HBV in BC were identified from laboratory reports using a standardized case definition. Interviews for {{risk factors and}} hepatitis history were conducted for each case. HBV genotypes were deter-mined by BLAST comparison analysis of the surface (S) or preS gene sequence. To illustrate the distribution of geno-types identified amongst acute cases in BC, an annotated map was produced showing the global occurrence of HBV geno-types. The majority of acute HBV cases occurred in Cauca-sian, Canadian-born males, with 30 % of cases reporting injection drug use (IDU) and 21 % reporting incarceration. The most common genotype observed was genotype D (62. 9 %), followed by genotypes A (18. 6 %), C (11. 4 %), B (4. 3 %), and E (1. 4 %). A significant association was observed between Genotype D and IDU (P = 0. 0025) and previous incarceration (P = 0. 0067). Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequence demonstrated identical or high genetic relatedness amongst genotype D viral strains (86 % sub-genotype D 3), thus verifying transmission clustering amongst BC injection drug users.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of a murine model of septic arthrosynovitis and osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which could mimic the natural disease occurring in humans and which could be suitable for testing preventive and therapeutic interventions. This model could be particularly useful since S. aureus-mediated joints and bones infections are relevant in humans, both in terms of frequency and severity. Our attention focused in tracking bacterial infiltration in joints and bones over time using different microbiological and hystopathological tools, which allowed us to have a complete overview of the situation and to evaluate the immunological actions undertaken by the host to contain or eradicate the bacterial infection. Antibodies and cytokines profiles, as well as recruitment of host immune cells at joints of immunized and infected mice were therefore monitored for a time period that allowed us to study both the acute and the chronic phases of the disease in situ. Finally the Novartis vaccine formulation proposed against S. aureus infections was tested for its capacity to protect immunized mice from joints infections, and the <b>preventive</b> <b>immunization</b> was compared to a standard antibiotic prophylaxis. The availability of powerful tools to study specific bacterial-mediated diseases is nowadays an important requirement for the scientific community to shed light on the complex interactions between host and pathogens and to test treatments for preventing or contrasting infections. We believe that our work significantly contributes to the overall knowledge in the field of S. aureus-dependent pathologies, opening the possibility for further investigations in several fields of study. ...|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{tropical}} medicine began {{several hundred years}} ago, when Europeans, primarily, traveled to Africa, Asia, and Latin America in search of land, adventure, and riches.

Eventually, interest expanded from treating those who returned ill from the tropics to studying the etiology and pathogenesis of tropical diseases. Fortunately, investigations into malaria, yellow fever, filariasis, and other diseases of the tropics gradually included the important goal of providing improved health care for those who live in the developing world. Today there are millions of persons who travel annually from the developed world to Asia, Africa, and Latin America for vacations, business, teaching, research, or missionary opportunities.

Improved socioeconomic factors, {{as well as the}} universal vaccination of infants (introduced in 1999) has resulted in a decline in infection rates in Israel. This study examines the benefits of routine testing for anti-HAV IgG in high-risk population. Methods A retrospective examination of the files of teenage and adult patients (aged 16 – 99 years; mean 33. 9) in two primary care clinics found 1, 017 patients who had been tested for anti-HAV IgG antibodies for either general healthcare screening or ongoing follow-up for chronic illness. Seropositive patients were then asked regarding recall of past hepatitis (i. e. jaundice, regardless of viral etiology); post-exposure prophylaxis with immune serum immunoglobulin (ISG); and active immunization with inactivated virus. Seronegative patients were subsequently sent for active immunization. Results Of the 1, 017 patient records studied (503 male, 514 female), a total of 692 were seropositive (354 males, 338 females; P = 0. 113).

In view of the lack of epidemiological and virological data about flu in Côte d'Ivoire, a surveillance network was set up in Abidjan to monitor the spread of flu and characterize isolated viruses. Over the 24 -month period from January 2003 to December 2004, nasal secretions were collected in patients presenting with flu syndrome at various heath care centers in Abidjan. Laboratory identification of viruses was performed by the ELISA technique using anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies (immunocapture) and by isolation on MDCK cells. A fraction of the original samples and isolates was sent for confirmation to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France and to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, South Africa.

40|$|Background : Tetanus {{remains one}} of the major public health hazards of the {{developing}} world. Previous studies in Nigeria indicate that mortality ranged from 26 &#x 0025; to 60 &#x 0025;. Mortality is much lower in the developed world because of the availability of facilities for intensive care of cases, unlike in most developing countries. Aim : To report our experience with the management of adult tetanus at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over the past 10 years (1996 - 2005). Methods : Data of all patients aged 16 years and above managed for tetanus in the medical wards between January 1996 and December 2005 were retrieved from their case records and analyzed. Results : Eighty-six patients were managed for tetanus (50 males and 36 females), constituting about 1 &#x 0025; of all medical admissions over the 10 -year period. Students, civil servants and commercial motorcyclists formed the major groups at risk. The commonest portal of entry was lower limb injuries (54 &#x 0025;). Case fatality rate (CFR) was 42. 9 &#x 0025;, with a statistically significant higher CFR found among patients above 40 years of age (P =. 000), patients with incubation period shorter than 7 days (P =. 04), those with a shorter duration of hospitalization (P =. 000) and those administered higher average daily diazepam doses (P =. 044). Complications such as aspiration pneumonitis, laryngospasm and respiratory failure were major causes of mortality.

Methods Ten non-human primates (NHP) of advanced age (18 – 26 [*]years) and eight 2 -year-old juvenile NHPs were immunized at 0, 2, 6, 10 and 14 [*]weeks with aggregated Aβ 42 admixed with monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvant, and monitored for up to 6 [*]months. Anti-Aβ antibody levels and immune activation markers were assessed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples before and at several time-points after immunization. Microglial activity was determined by [11 C]PK 11195 PET scans acquired before and after immunization, and by post-mortem immunohistochemical and real-time PCR evaluation. Aβ oligomer composition was assessed by immunoblot analysis in the frontal cortex of aged immunized and non-immunized control animals.

40|$|Background: Immunization against beta-amyloid (Aβ) is a {{promising}} approach {{for the treatment}} of Alzheimer's disease, but the optimal timing for the vaccination remains to be determined. <b>Preventive</b> <b>immunization</b> approaches may be more efficacious and associated with fewer side-effects; however, there is only limited information available from primate models about the effects of preclinical vaccination on brain amyloid composition and the neuroinflammatory milieu. Methods: Ten non-human primates (NHP) of advanced age (18 - 26 years) and eight 2 -year-old juvenile NHPs were immunized at 0, 2, 6, 10 and 14 weeks with aggregated Aβ 42 admixed with monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvant, and monitored for up to 6 months. Anti-Aβ antibody levels and immune activation markers were assessed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples before and at several time-points after immunization. Microglial activity was determined by [11 C]PK 11195 PET scans acquired before and after immunization, and by post-mortem immunohistochemical and real-time PCR evaluation. Aβ oligomer composition was assessed by immunoblot analysis in the frontal cortex of aged immunized and non-immunized control animals. Results: All juvenile animals developed a strong and sustained serum anti-Aβ IgG antibody response, whereas only 80 % of aged animals developed detectable antibodies. The immune response in aged monkeys was more delayed and significantly weaker, and was also more variable between animals. Pre- and post-immunization [11 C]PK 11195 PET scans showed no evidence of vaccine-related microglial activation. Post-mortem brain tissue analysis indicated a low overall amyloid burden, but revealed a significant shift in oligomer size with an increase in the dimer:pentamer ratio in aged immunized animals compared with non-immunized controls (P < 0. 01). No differences were seen in microglial density or expression of classical and alternative microglial activation markers between immunized and control animals. Conclusions: Our results indicate that preventive Aβ immunization is a safe therapeutic approach lacking adverse CNS immune system activation or other serious side-effects in both aged and juvenile NHP cohorts. A significant shift in the composition of soluble oligomers towards smaller species might facilitate removal of toxic Aβ species from the brain. © 2012 Kofler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tetanus {{remains one}} of the major public health hazards of the {{developing}} world. Mortality is much lower in the developed world because of the availability of facilities, unlike in most developing countries' Objectives: This study was aimed to determine the outcome of tetanus patients admitted in infectious disease unit of Rangpur Medical College Hospital. Methods: A total of 91 cases of tetanus patients were seen in the 18 month period with a mean of 5 cases per month; they are diagnosed and managed for tetanus in the medical wards from January 2011 to June 2012. The data were retrieved from their case records and analyzed. Results: There were thirty one deaths, accounting for an overall mortality of 34. 16 o. Total fifty six patients were cured among which sixteen (17. 67 %) were cured with complication and four (4. 4 %) patient were absconded. Mortality was high 45. 84 % (11 patients out of 24) ≥ 40 years age, whereas low 29. 85 (20 patient out of 87) in < 40 yea 15 age (45. 84 % vs 29. 85 %). Mortality rate was also higher among female than male patients (34. 66 % vs 33. 85 %). Farmers experienced more death than non-farmer (4 l. l 8 % vs 29 - 82 %, P< 0. 05). Mortality was higher in patients who had not received any medical treatment for their wound than in patients who had received it for their wound (52. 78 % vs 21. 81 %, p< 0. 05). Patients with short incubation period of less than one week had higher mortality in comparison with those who had incubation period more than one week (53. 33 % vs 23. 25 %, P< 0 ' 05). Of the 91 patients, fifty six (64. 34 %) were alive, though four remained in a persistent vegetative state due to tetanus toxin-induced brain damage and another two required a below knee amputation of the left leg. Hence, 40 were discharged well and 16 were discharged with permanent disabilities. Conclusion: The case fatality rate of tetanus has remained consistently high in the medical college. Factors that were significantly associated with high mortality included older age, and incubation period of less than 7 days. It is recommended that <b>preventive</b> <b>immunization</b> against tetanus be given to all Bangladeshis with secondary vaccination at adulthood. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{deleterious}} role of fibrin {{deposition in}} arthritic joints prompted us {{to explore the}} effect of the thrombin inhibition on the course of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in the mouse. CIA was induced in male DBA/ 1 J mice using native chicken type II collagen. The thrombin inhibitor polyethyleneglycol-hirudin (PEG-hirudin) was given for 16 days, starting 20 days after the first <b>immunization</b> (<b>preventive</b> treatment) or at the onset of clinical signs of arthritis (curative treatment). All the mice treated with PEG-hirudin had a significantly prolonged clotting time compared with control mice. PEG-hirudin, administered in a preventive way, led to significantly reduced incidence and severity of CIA during most of the treatment period, as assessed by clinical scoring. Accordingly, histological features showed a significant diminution of synovial hyperplasia in PEG-hirudin-treated mice compared with untreated mice. There was also a significant downmodulation of the synovial proinflammatory IL- 1 beta and IL- 12 p 35 cytokine mRNAs in treated mice. Intra-articular fibrin, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, was significantly reduced in treated mice compared with control mice and correlated with both clinical and histological scorings. Most importantly, once arthritis was established, PEG-hirudin also showed a curative effect. In conclusion, PEG-hirudin can both prevent the onset of CIA in a dose-dependent manner and ameliorate established arthritis, suggesting that thrombin inhibition may offer a new therapeutic approach in arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Despite India’s {{substantial}} {{economic growth}} in the past two decades, girls in India are discriminated against in access to <b>preventive</b> healthcare including <b>immunizations.</b> Surprisingly, no study has assessed the contribution of gender based within-household discrimination to the overall inequality in immunization status of Indian children. This study therefore has two objectives: to estimate the gender based within-household inequality (GWHI) in immunization status of Indian children and to examine the inter-regional and inter-temporal variations in the GWHI. Data and Methods: The present study used households with a pair of male-female siblings (aged 1 – 5 years) from two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS, 1992 – 93 and 2005 – 06). The overall inequality in the immunization status (after controlling for age and birth order) of children was decomposed into within-households and between-households components using Mean log deviation to obtain the GWHI component. The analysis was conducted at the all-India level as well as for six specified geographical regions and at two time points (1992 – 93 and 2005 – 06). Household fixed-effects models for immunization status of children were also estimated. Results and Conclusions: Findings from household fixed effects analysis indicated that the immunization scores of girls were significantly lower than that of boys. The inequality decompositions revealed that, at the all-India level, the absolute level of GWHI in immunization status decreased from 0. 035 in 1992 – 93 to 0. 023 in 2005 – 06. However, as a percentage o...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{causes of}} death in {{children and young adults}} with epilepsy by using data from the U. S. National Child Death Review Case Reporting System (NCDR-CRS), a passive surveillance system composed of comprehensive information related to deaths reviewed by local child death review teams. Information on a total of 48, 697 deaths in children and young adults 28 days to 24 years of age, including 551 deaths with epilepsy and 48, 146 deaths without epilepsy, was collected from 2004 through 2012 in 32 states. In a proportionate mortality analysis by official manner of death, decedents with epilepsy had a significantly higher percentage of natural deaths but significantly lower percentages of deaths due to accidents, homicide, and undetermined causes compared with persons without epilepsy. With respect to underlying {{causes of death}}, decedents with epilepsy had significantly higher percentages of deaths due to drowning and most medical conditions including pneumonia and congenital anomalies but lower percentages of deaths due to asphyxia, weapon use, and unknown causes compared with decedents without epilepsy. The increased percentages of deaths due to pneumonia and drowning in children and young adults with epilepsy suggest <b>preventive</b> interventions including <b>immunization</b> and better instruction and monitoring before or during swimming. State-specific and national population-based mortality studies of children and young adults with epilepsy are recommended.
