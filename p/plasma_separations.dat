40|$|Microscopic {{oriented}} clay bodies {{known as}} <b>plasma</b> <b>separations</b> to soil micromorphologists show {{various degrees of}} symmetry and regularity in their patterns. They could be regarded as sensitive and reliable indicators of stress-strain regime of a soil. Empirical and experimental evidence signifies the importance of stress, specifically that generated by in situ swelling, in the genesis of plasmic fabrics. Hitherto, most work in this field is confined to geometric characterization, with limited attempts to dynamic interpretations of their origin. This paper enlists appropriate concepts in soil mechanics, structural geology and agricultural engineering to interpret the possible stress-strain components that rearrange fabric units into <b>plasma</b> <b>separations.</b> Some pertinent concepts, including physico-chemical behaviour of the clay-water system, shrink-swell phenomenon, stress-strain, deformation and failure of soil, are employed to explain the origin of plasmic fabrics by mechanical principles. A conceptual model is suggested to synthesize the conditions, changes and consequences related {{to the formation of}} plasmic fabrics. Strongly developed <b>plasma</b> <b>separations</b> in natural soils are attributed to the establishment of an anisotropic state of stress generated by in situ swelling, in conjunction with the passive pressure of lateral confinement and vertical overburden. The difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses produces a deviatoric stress that can, at certain stages of a shrink-swell cycle, exceed the shear strength of the soil. The extra stress is relieved plastically by shear deformation which is manifested as the alignment of platy particles in domain configuration by rotation and translation along the shear planes. Soil mainly fails in compressive (plastic) mode along a large number of small shear planes which form the <b>plasma</b> <b>separations.</b> The formation of different types of sepic plasmic fabrics is discussed in relation to the stress-strain regimes of soils. © 1990. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{novelty of}} this study resides in the {{fabrication}} of stoichiometric and stress-reduced Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 triple-layer membrane sieves. The membrane sieves were designed to be very flat and thin, mechanically stress-reduced, and stable in their electrical and chemical properties. All insulating materials are deposited stoichiometrically by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition system. The membranes with a thickness of 0. 4 µm have pores with a diameter of about 1 µm. The device is fabricated on a 6 ” silicon wafer with the semiconductor processes. We utilized the membrane sieves for <b>plasma</b> <b>separations</b> from human whole blood.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines the micromorphological changes resulting from confined swelling and shrinking of aggregated samples. Two factors, namely bulk density (two levels) and sample composition (five levels) were considered. Thin sections were cut and the microfabrics studied in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. A {{broad range of}} significant and systematic microfabric changes were observed. With {{an increase in the}} activity and content of the clay fraction, the void volume (especially those > 30 μm) decreased drastically whereas the shape changed from compound packing voids to occluded planar voids and vughs. Aggregates were flattened at contacts, became more angular and showed evidence of fusion into compound units. Related distribution patterns were altered from dominantly matrigranic to matrigranoidic, fragmoidic and porphyric with scattered vughs. There was a gradual closing of voids and a concomitant coalescence of aggregates. Plasmic fabrics showed mainly an increase in long (> 10 μm) and narrow (< 5 μm) but sharply defined <b>plasma</b> <b>separations.</b> High bulk density resulted in a more vigorous and conspicuous expression of fabric unit deformation and movement. The pedological implications are discussed in relation to the dynamic properties of clay-water interactions, stress-strain regime of swelling soils, and the concept of plastic deformation of soils according to the Mohr-Coulomb theory of failure. © 1986. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Due to the inherent advantages obtained in the transition to microscale, the recent trend in these fields is a rapid shift towards the miniaturization of complex macro processes. <b>Plasma</b> <b>separation</b> in microdevices is one such process which has received extensive attention from researchers globally. Blood <b>plasma</b> <b>separation</b> techniques based on microfluidic platforms can be broadly classified into two categories.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the relationship between}} texture and microfabric under isotropic stresses generated by wetting and drying. This {{can be achieved by}} observing and measuring the reorganization of microfabrics (plasmic fabrics and related distribution pattern, RDP). Microfabrics are produced in the laboratory by mixing montmorillonite with various proportions of sand and silt, and subjecting them to wetting and drying without confinement. Thin sections are cut to study their microfabrics. Results show broad and systematic variations in fabric with changes in texture. Fine matrix (silt plus clay in physical continuity) is developed in samples with low sand:silt ratio, and regardless of this ratio at high clay levels. Coarse porphyric and fine porphyric RDP are formed at low and high clay contents, respectively. Plasmic fabrics are represented mainly by insepic and weakly developed mosepic and masepic fabrics in the matrix in the form of small <b>plasma</b> <b>separations</b> with random orientation, and weak skelsepic plasma as embedded grain argillans. On the other hand, coarse matrix (sand grains in physical continuity) dominates the sandy samples which are associated with relatively thick and strongly birefringent free grain argillans giving well-developed skelsepic fabric. The RDP follows two major paths: beginning with orthogranic (very low clay content) along the iunctic sequence at low clay:silt ratio and along the chlamydic sequence at high ratio. The regularities in fabric development are interpreted {{in the light of the}} dynamic properties and behaviour of the active clay fraction in a clay-water system. The pedogenetic implications of the results are explored, and the term "erdic" fabric defined. © 1984. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{microfluidic}} chips {{have proven}} ideal tools for biochemical analysis, which, however, demands {{a unique and}} compatible <b>plasma</b> <b>separation</b> scheme. Various research groups have established continuous flow separation methods in microfluidic devices; however, they have worked with relatively small dimension microchannels (similar to the blood cell diameter). The present work demonstrates <b>separation</b> of <b>plasma</b> by utilizing the hydrodynamic separation techniques in microchannels with size {{of the order of}} mm. The separation process exploits the phenomenon, which is very similar to that of plasma skimming explained under Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law. The present experiments demonstrates for, the first time, that applicability of the Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law can be extended to dimensions much higher than the suspended particle size. The T-microchannel device (comprising perpendicularly connected blood and plasma channels) were micro-fabricated using conventional PDMS micro-molding techniques. Three variables (feed hematocrit, main channel width, and flow rate distributions) were identified as the important parameters which define the device's efficiency for the blood <b>plasma</b> <b>separation.</b> A <b>plasma</b> <b>separation</b> efficiency of 99. 7 % was achieved at a high flow ratio.

Blood components perform distinct {{functions in the}} human body and thus the ability to efficiently fractionate blood into its individual components (i. e., plasma and cellular components) is of utmost importance for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Although conventional approaches like centrifugation and membrane filtration for blood processing have been successful in generating relatively pure fractions, they are largely limited by factors such as the required blood sample volume, component purity, clogging, processing time and operation efficiency. In this work, we developed a high-throughput inertial microfluidic system for cell focusing and blood <b>plasma</b> <b>separation</b> from small to large volume blood samples (1 – 100 mL).
