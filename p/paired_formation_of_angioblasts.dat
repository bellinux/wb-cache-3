Cryptochromes undergo forward light-induced reactions involving electron transfer to excited state flavin to generate radical intermediates, which correlate with biological activity.

After a general introduction on the influence <b>of</b> <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> on the luminescence properties, <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> in nanocrys-tals is discussed. Due to {{a difference between the}} connectivity for sites in the bulk and at the surface, the fraction of dopant pairs depends on the crystal-lite size. Simulations of the statistical distribution of dopant pair states in a nanocrystal as a function of crystal structure, size and dopant concentration are presented. A closed form approximation for the results of the simula-tions is derived and the validity is tested. The work presented can be used to estimate dopant pair concentrations in the case of random substitution or a lower limit for the pair concentration if preferential <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> occurs. The second part of the chapter discusses the luminescence of a sin-gle nanocrystalline semiconductor particle. The absence of inhomogeneous broadening and other ensemble averaging effects has provided exciting new insight into the luminescence and quenching mechanisms. The linewidth, blue shift and bleaching of the luminescence of single CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals are shown and discussed. Finally, potential applications of na-nocrystals as luminescent labels in biological systems are presented and a few challenges for future research are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields (0 - 6 kG) on the delayed fluorescence and photoenhanced currents in crystalline pyrene at 300 K {{can be explained}} qualitatively using the theories already used for anthracene. It is found that the moving triplet exciton has the same zero-field fine structure as the monomer exciton. In delayed fluorescence, triplet <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> is diffusion limited with no long range interaction (rate constant 2. 7 x 10 - 10 cm 3 s- 1) and pair lifetime is {{of the order of}} one hopping time, or 10 - 10 s, with no evidence of pair stabilization. In the study of photocurrents, two magnetic field effects, of opposite sign, are found. If the current is space-charge limited, triplets alter the ratio of free charge to trapped charge; and the magnetic field acts through modulation of the triplet-trapped charge interaction rate constant. The rate constant for <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> (1. 7 x 10 - 9 cm 3 s- 1) is found to be much larger than diffusion limited for nearest neighbour interaction, and implies a distance for <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> several tens of Å.

A large number of titration and electrokinetic data sets available in the literature have been successfully described, using the MUSIC (MultiSite Complexation) model with a Basic Stern double-layer option and applying the ion <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> concept. The systematic analysis of the data, over {{a large number of}} different monovalent electrolytes and various ionic strength values, allowed the determination of a number of "best estimated" values for the ion <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> constants. The values suggest that the interaction of the cations with the titania surface is stronger than that of the anions. This is in accordance with the observed shift of the IEP of titanium oxide to higher pH values, at high electrolyte concentrations. The binding of the cations follows the sequence Cs NO 3 - > ClO 4 - > I-. Titanium oxide can be divided in two classes of materials, having a low (C = 0. 9 F m- 2) and a high (C = 1. 6 F m- 2) capacitance value, respectively. The low capacitance value corresponds with the low values found for well-crystallized gibbsite and goethite. On the basis of the low capacitance value and the absence of correlation with the dielectric properties of the solids, it is hypothesized that the first layer of physically adsorbed water has a unique relative dielectric constant of about 40 on well-crystallized oxides. The high capacitance may correspond to a situation with a distorted water layer, which has bulk water properties (= 78).
