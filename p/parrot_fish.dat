5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and <b>parrot</b> <b>fish,</b> which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E

25|$|O.glaber is omnivorous, forming long trails on {{tree trunks}} to seek sweet {{substances}} such as honeydew and to hunt insects. The ant is both active {{during the day}} and night. Activity increases during the night or on overcast days, peaking during early mornings and late evening to early night. Nocturnal activity varies but is either minimal or non-existent. O.glaber has once been recorded around the carcases of dead birds, sea turtles and a <b>parrot</b> <b>fish.</b> It prefers fat, grease, plants and seeds, as well as fruit fly pupae and diamondback moth larvae. Galleries of the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) are often invaded by O.glaber, although mortality rates are substantially higher when big-headed ants (Pheidole megacephala) invade termite galleries.|$|E
50|$|The banded {{butterflyfish}} {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs, but {{can occur in}} small shoals of about twenty individuals.

40|$|<b>Parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> are so {{abundant}} in the tropical parts of the Western Indian Ocean as to be of considerable economic significance. The majority are taken in traps and nets, some by spearing, fewer on lines. The flesh of even the largest is delicate and tasty, mostly eaten fresh as it is not easily preserved. It is esteemed by almost all races and classes, excepting only the Portuguese of Mozambique who do not regard these gaudy fishes with favour. In British territories, however, they are eagerly sought by the Whites. It has been stated that in some parts <b>Parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> are toxic, {{but as far as}} could be ascertained no species are ever unwholesome in East Africa or north of Madagascar to Seychelles. It is only in certain specific cases that laymen and even the native fishermen are able to distinguish individual species of <b>Parrot</b> <b>fishes.</b> Most species are more or less lumped together as “Parrots” with prefixes such as “Green” or “Red. ” To the native fishermen they are known as follows: Red Sea to Suez, “Harid”; Somaliland, “Jello” or “Ponno”; Kenya to North Mozambique, “Pono”; Seychelles and vicinity, “KAKATOI”; Mauritius, “KAKATOI” or “GATEAU,” some species characterised more closely by descriptive adjectives. These fishes are commonly subject to {{what appears to be a}} parasitic infection of the nostrils, resulting in considerable swelling of the snout.

5000|$|Coral sand is a {{collection}} of sand of particles originating in tropical and sub-tropical marine environments from bioerosion of limestone skeletal material of marine organisms.

However, the term [...] "coral" [...] in coral sand is used loosely in this sense to mean limestone of recent biological origin; corals are not the dominant contributors of sand particles to most such deposits. Rather, remnant skeletal fragments of foraminifera, calcareous algae, molluscs, and crustaceans can predominate. Because it is composed of limestone, coral sand is acid-soluble.|$|R

40|$|Fish flight {{initiation}} distance (FID) {{is emerging}} as a useful metric of the response of fishes to fishing, with significant differences in FID demonstrated between fished and no-take marine reserves.

Three observers estimated FID of <b>parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> in both a fished area and a no-take marine reserve, via both SCUBA and free-diving, and with and without a simulated spear gun (8 treatments). We found that FID was significantly influenced by protection status, increasing by 141 cm on average in the fished area compared to the no-take marine reserve, but not by dive type or spear gun presence. While there were some differences between observers' mean estimate of FID, {{there was no evidence of}} observer bias, nor were there any significant differences in the precision of FID estimates between observers.

40|$|Extract] In his {{preface to}} a special issue (and {{dedicated}} workshop) on the biology of butterflyfishes, Motta (1989) suggested that butterflyfishes have received disproportionate scientific attention compared to other common and conspicuous families of coral reef fishes. In support of this assertion, the number of scientific publications that consider butterflyfishes (151 Web of Knowledge; 382 publications since 1927) is far greater than for many other families of nominal reef fishes (e. g., angelfishes, surgeonfishes, and rabbitfishes); the only families that have been more intensively studied are the Pomacentridae (damselfishes), Serranidae (groupers) and Labridae (<b>parrot</b> <b>fishes</b> and wrasses), which probably reflects their high diversity, commercial and functional importance, respectively. In this respect, research on butterflyfishes has contributed greatly to genera l understanding of the biology and ecology of coral reef fishes (e. g., Almany et al., 2007; Lawton et al., 2011). The fields of research in which butterflyfishes have played essential roles also extends well beyond the notion that butterflyfishes are "indicators" of overall reef health, which is the usual justification for studying this relatively unique group of reef fishes (e. g., Ohman et al., 1998; Bozec et al., 2005; Shokri et al., 2005) ...|$|R

500|$|Pet Shop (set number 10218), {{released}} in May 2011, is the sixth {{set in the}} Modular Buildings series. [...] The set contains 2032 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. It is the first set in the series that is actually made out of 2 buildings that separate using the same Technic pins that link the rest of the modulars together. They can be reversed or separated and wrapped around another building. The brown building is a town house and the sand blue building is the Pet Shop. The brown building is the only building, with the exception of Market Street, that has a basement. There is a special feature on the Pet Shop on the ground floor, where the staircase can be folded away for more access room for playing (this was an issue with Market Street). There are 4 minifigures, 2 <b>parrots</b> and a <b>fish</b> tank with goldfish. The set also includes 3 dog bones, a ball, a frog toy, a birdhouse, a bucket and a brush. This is also the smallest set by height and stands at just over 25cm. The next tallest modular is Market Street at 33cm. The set includes a full interior including a toilet, bed, kitchen and fireplace.|$|R
