50|$|Despite the {{scoreless}} tie, {{the game}} was still considered an accomplishment due to the tickets selling out weeks in advance and the attendance of the game, which was around 38,000 despite the weather.

The final two plays proved the cold did not stop the teams from having a flair for the dramatic, as Razorback Clyde Scott (a future College Football Hall of Famer) tackled LSU receiver Jeff Odom at the Razorback one, preserving the tie. The Tigers then attempted the go-ahead field goal, but a bad snap ended the game on the final play. This game marked the second (and last) time the two teams tied.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a model for}} integrating transportation and inventory decisions in a three-level logistics network consisting of plants, warehouses, and retailers (or customers). Our model includes production and throughout capacity constraints, and minimizes <b>production,</b> <b>holding,</b> and tansportation costs in a dynamic environment. We show that the problem can be reformulated as {{a certain type of}} assignment problem with convex objective function. Based on this observation, we propose a greedy heuristic for the problem, and illustrate its behaviour on a class of randomly generated problem instances. These experiments suggest that the heuristic may be asymptotically feasible and optimal with probability one in the number of customers. dynamic demand pattern;dynamic models;heuristic solution approaches;inventory costs;transportation costs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a single item capacitated dynamic lot sizing problem. We consider backlogging models {{as well as}} out-sourcing models to minimize the total cost. The <b>production,</b> <b>holding</b> and backlogging or out-sourcing cost functions considered in this paper are arbitrary and time-varying. Due to various capacity constraints, {{it is possible that}} no feasible solution exists. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for there to be a feasible solution and show that this condition can be checked in polynomial time. When feasible solutions exist, we show that an optimal solution can be obtained in pseudo-polynomial time with dynamic programming algorithms. We then address polynomially solvable special cases of stockout and conservation models. © 2004 IEEE. IEE...|$|E
30|$|We {{present a}} new model {{formulation}} for a multi-product lot-sizing problem with product returns and remanufacturing subject to a capacity constraint. The given external demand of the products has to be satisfied by remanufactured or newly produced goods. The objective is to determine a feasible production plan, which minimizes <b>production,</b> <b>holding,</b> and setup costs. As the LP relaxation of a model formulation based on the well-known CLSP leads to very poor lower bounds, we propose a column-generation approach to determine tighter bounds. The lower bound obtained by column generation can be easily transferred into a feasible solution by a truncated branch-and-bound approach using CPLEX. The results of an extensive numerical study show the high solution quality of the proposed solution approach.|$|E
