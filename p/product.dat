5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and <b>product.</b> Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished <b>product.</b> About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover <b>product,</b> including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha <b>product</b> and 5.4 percent of Beta <b>product</b> was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of <b>product</b> advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the <b>product</b> back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on <b>product</b> tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the <b>product</b> across different demographic groups. Even though the <b>product</b> has been a prominent part of the menu {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the <b>product</b> – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major <b>product</b> line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the <b>product.</b>|$|E

5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their <b>product</b> portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful <b>product</b> introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the <b>product</b> was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the <b>product</b> with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the <b>product</b> into the BK Baguette <b>product</b> line that focused on a more health-oriented <b>product.</b> This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier <b>product</b> that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E
