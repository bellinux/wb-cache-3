40|$|BACKGROUND: Grass pollen-related {{seasonal}} allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SARg) is clinically heterogeneous in severity, comorbidities {{and response}} to treatment. The component-resolved diagnostics disclosed also a high heterogeneity at molecular level. Our study aimed at analyzing {{the characteristics of the}} IgE sensitization to <b>Phleum</b> <b>pratense</b> molecules and investigating the diagnostic relevance of such molecules in childhood. METHODS: We examined 1120 children (age 4 - 18 y) with SARg. Standardized questionnaires on atopy were acquired through informatics platform (AllergyCARD(™)). Skin prick tests were performed with pollen extracts. Serum IgE to airborne allergens and eight <b>Phleum</b> <b>pratense</b> molecules (rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, rPhl p 4, rPhl p 5 b, rPhl p 6, rPhl p 7, rPhl p 11, rPhl p 12) were tested by ImmunoCAP FEIA. RESULTS: The analysis of IgE responses against eight <b>Phleum</b> <b>pratense</b> molecules showed 87 profiles. According to the number of molecules recognized by IgE, the more complex profiles were characterized by higher serum total IgE, higher grass-specific serum IgE and higher number and degree of sensitization to pollens. The most frequent IgE sensitization profile was the monomolecular Phl p 1. Sensitization to Phl p 7 was a reliable biomarker of asthma, whereas Phl p 12 of oral allergy syndrome. Sensitization to Phl p 7 was associated with a higher severity of SAR, and complex profiles were associated with longer disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: In a large pediatric population, the complexity of IgE sensitization profiles against <b>Phleum</b> <b>pratense</b> molecules is related to high atopic features although useless for predicting the clinical severity. The detection of serum IgE to Phl p 1, Phl p 7 and Phl p 12 can be used as clinical biomarkers of SARg and comorbidities. Further studies in different areas are required to test the impact of different IgE molecular profiles on AIT response...|$|R

The buried parts of the regenerated stems were thinner and had sclerenchyma cylinder separated from the epidermis by a layer of parenchyma cells, whereas in the aerial parts sclerenchyma cylinder with islands of parenchyma was contiguous to epidermis.
