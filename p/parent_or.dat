5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> grandparent {{of a child with}} the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E

5|$|A {{revised version}} of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the {{revised version of}} the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating.|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no {{substantial}} evidence which suggests <b>parenting</b> <b>or</b> early childhood experiences {{play a role in}} sexual orientation, [...] some studies have linked <b>parenting</b> <b>or</b> familial environment to non-heterosexual identities, as well as childhood gender nonconformity and homosexuality.|$|R
30|$|Focus {{groups with}} 29 <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> guardians were {{conducted}} to identify themes that informed development of survey items.

Once consent was obtained, <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> caregivers were given a booklet with the questionnaires and demographic information to be completed.|$|R
5|$|When two {{distinct}} types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, {{the other has}} white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her <b>parent</b> (<b>or</b> other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews began {{immediately}} after the seizure of power and following a month-long series of attacks {{by members of the}} SA on Jewish businesses, synagogues and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April and forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> grandparent was considered non-Aryan. As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> parents, could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E

Most children go through a normal stage of not wanting to leave their <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> their home. However, some children continually worry unrealistically that some harm will come to their <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> that some terrible event will separate them from their caregivers. They will often refuse to go to school or sleep by themselves.

5|$|The shraddha is {{performed}} on the specific lunar day during the Pitru Paksha, when the ancestorusually a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> paternal grandparentdied. There are exceptions to the lunar day rule; special days are allotted for people {{who died in a}} particular manner or had a certain status in life. Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved for those people killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Duties of {{citizens}} {{were added to}} the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. However, many of these are non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties.|$|E
25|$|If {{under age}} 18, written consent from the underage partner's <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> legal {{guardian}} and {{a court order}} must be obtained.

25|$|In tennis, {{a junior}} is a player under 18 {{who is still}} legally {{protected}} by a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian.

25|$|If {{the victim}} is a minor, consent must come from a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> {{guardian}}. However, if the legal <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder {{is not required to}} withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) from a minor if the <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian will not consent. The <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).|$|E
25|$|Adoption is {{a process}} whereby a person assumes the {{parenting}} of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> parents.
