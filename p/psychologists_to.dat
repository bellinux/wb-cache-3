5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E

25|$|Ruzek, who interviewed {{founders of}} Transpersonal {{psychology}}, {{as well as}} historians of American psychology, found that the field had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in America.

25|$|Psychologists may use a {{definition}} from the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV, defining nocturnal enuresis as repeated urination into bed or clothes, occurring twice per {{week or more}} {{for at least three}} consecutive months in a child of at least 5 years of age and not due to either a drug side effect or a medical condition. Even if the case does not meet these criteria, the DSM-IV definition allows <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> diagnose nocturnal enuresis if the wetting causes the patient clinically significant distress.|$|E

25|$|Computational {{modeling}} {{is a tool}} used in mathematical {{psychology and}} cognitive psychology to simulate behavior. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Connectionism uses neural networks to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.|$|E
25|$|Boring taught {{psychology}} at Harvard University for 27 years. He {{had a profound}} impact, training many students who {{would go on to}} become influential in the field of psychology such as Stanley Smith Stevens. He pushed <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> adapt better writing habits which ultimately benefited the audiences that would later read these works. Instead of focusing on gaining success through his student’s work, Boring led a professional life full of integrity, and was willing to sacrifice his own needs for those of his students.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-experimental design refers {{especially}} to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use {{common sense to}} consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validity. For example, in research on {{the best way to}} affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.|$|E

25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|At the {{cognitive}} level, cognitive neuroscience addresses {{the questions of}} how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, PET, SPECT), electrophysiology, and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows {{that there is an}} interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology. Moreover, the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make South African courts more just in their convictions, the concept of extenuating {{circumstances}} came into being. However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social <b>psychologists</b> <b>to</b> define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the justice system. Examples include: deindividuation, bystander apathy, and conformity. In the case of S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989) eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology. Social anthropologist Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that bystander apathy, deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.|$|E

A comprehensive international list of psychologists on stamps (compiled by psychology historian Ludy T.
