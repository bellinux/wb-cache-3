[...] All problems that can be solved using mass <b>point</b> <b>geometry</b> can also be solved using either similar triangles, vectors, or area ratios, but mass <b>point</b> <b>geometry</b> is far quicker than those methods and thus is used more often on math competitions in which time is an important factor. Though modern mass <b>point</b> <b>geometry</b> was developed in the 1960s by New York high school students, the concept has been found to have been used as early as 1827 by August Ferdinand Möbius in his theory of homogeneous coordinates.|$|E

The results show that BB 1 K can give excellent saddle <b>point</b> <b>geometries</b> and barrier heights, and its performance for calculating atomization energies is 40 % better than MPW 1 K. Using a mean mean unsigned error criterion that equally weights the errors in barrier heights and in bond energies, the new BB 1 K method outperforms all other DFT and hybrid DFT methods by a large margin, and we therefore conclude that it is the best density functional-type method for thermochemical kinetics. 1...|$|R

In addition, {{based on the}} new X functional of Xin and Goddard, again combined with B 95 correlation functional, {{we developed}} two other new HMDFT methods, X 1 B 95 and XB 1 K. MPW 1 B 95 and X 1 B 95 were optimized against a representative database of six atomization energies (AE 6). MPWB 1 K and XB 1 K were optimized against a kinetics database of three forward barrier heights, three reverse barrier heights, and three energies of reaction for the reactions in the BH 6 representative barrier height database. We compared the newly developed methods to other HMDFT and hybrid DFT methods for atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, barrier heights, saddle <b>point</b> <b>geometries,</b> hydrogen bonding, and weak van der Waals weak interactions. In addition, we optimized scaling factors for calculating zero-point energies from vibrational frequencies.

5000|$|In {{the rapid}} {{foundational}} {{changes of the}} 1950s Weil's approach became obsolete. In scheme theory, though, from 1957, generic points returned: this time à la Zariski. For example for R a discrete valuation ring, Spec(R) consists of two points, a generic point (coming from the prime ideal {0}) and a closed point or special point coming from the unique maximal ideal. For morphisms to Spec(R), the fiber above the special point is the special fiber, an important concept for example in reduction modulo p, monodromy theory and other theories about degeneration. The generic fiber, equally, is the fiber above the generic <b>point.</b> <b>Geometry</b> of degeneration is largely then about the passage from generic to special fibers, or in other words how specialization of parameters affects matters. (For a discrete valuation ring the topological space in question is the Sierpinski space of topologists. Other local rings have unique generic and special points, but a more complicated spectrum, since they represent general dimensions. The discrete valuation case is much like the complex unit disk, for these purposes.) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{photometer}} {{was developed}} and successfully operated to obtain photometric measurements on several flat, particulate surfaces of basalt for coplanar scattering geometries. The test materials were two size ranges each of two different basalts with significantly different albedos. The measurements include a range of phase angles from 30 to 80 degrees and were obtained by varying the angles of incidence and emission such that the phase angle remained constant. The data were used elsewhere in the verification of the Meador-Weaver photometric function and are presented here {{in the form of}} Minnaert plots. In this form the data offered the first support for the accuracy of the Meador-Weaver photometric function because of a deviation of the data from a straight line trend at larger departures from the mirror <b>point</b> <b>geometry.</b> This trend is predicted by the Meador-Weaver function but not by the Minnaert function.

40|$|Hardware {{accelerated}} point-based rendering (PBR) algorithms {{have suffered}} in the past from multiple rendering passes; possibly a performance limiting factor. Two passes over the <b>point</b> <b>geometry</b> have been necessary because a first visibility-splatting pass has been necessary for conservative e-z-buffer visibility culling in the following point-interpolation rendering pass. This separation into visibility-splatting and point-blending, hence processing the <b>point</b> <b>geometry</b> twice, is a fundamental drawback of current GPU-based PBR algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new framework for GPU accelerated PBR algorithm whose basic idea is deferred blending. In contrast to prior algorithms, we formulate the smooth point interpolation problem as an image compositing post-processing task. This is achieved by separating the input point data in a pre-process into not self-overlapping minimal independent groups of points. As an extension of this concept, we can {{for the first time}} render transparent point surfaces as well on the GPU. For simple transparency effects, our novel algorithm only needs a single geometry rendering pass. For high-quality transparent image synthesis an extra rendering pass is sufficient. Furthermore, per-fragment reflective and refractive multilayer effects are supported in our algorithm...|$|E

The pointing vector is necessary to find the intersection with the used earth model and finally to determine the satellite slant range geometry.
