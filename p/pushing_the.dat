5|$|As a {{consequence}} of <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> German and Ottoman forces eastwards away from the canal, during October, Lieutenant General Charles Dobell was appointed to command the newly created Eastern Force. With his headquarters at Kantara, Dobell became responsible {{for the security of}} the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with Operation Star the Red Army also launched Operation Gallop south of Star, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht {{away from the}} Donets, taking Voroshilovgrad and Izium, worsening the German situation further. By this time Stavka believed it could decide {{the war in the}} southwest Russian SFSR and eastern Ukrainian SSR, expecting total victory.|$|E
5|$|Until 17 July, the VRS {{continued}} its attacks aimed at retaking territory lost in Operation Tiger, gradually <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> HV back towards Dubrovnik. On 23 July, the HV 1st Guards Brigade counter-attacked north of Zaton, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> VRS {{north and east}} towards Popovo field. The attack, codenamed Operation Liberated Land (Croatian: Operacija Oslobođena zemlja), failed to cut off a battalion of the VRS 472nd Motorized Brigade deployed to Bobani, and the 4th Guards Brigade had to be deployed to mop up the area. Although substantial parts of the territory gained during the attack were surrendered to the VRS, the operation strengthened the HV defences in the area by 8 August.|$|E

50|$|In its {{day it was}} {{referred}} to as <b>The</b> <b>Push,</b> a title which has since come to be more widely used for the 1940s left-wing movement <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Push.</b> <b>The</b> gang was engaged in running warfare with other larrikin gangs of the time such as <b>the</b> Straw Hat <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Glebe <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Argyle Cut <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Forty Thieves from Surry Hills and the Gibb Street Mob. Italian crime gangs have been active in Melbourne and Sydney, and even some youth gangs like the Sharpies in the 1960s have been large enough to cause disturbances, though lacking criminal organisation.|$|R
5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously.

5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> ball with their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although {{it is the}} dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>push</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> palm {{backward}} {{through the}} water underneath the body {{at the beginning and}} {{at the side of the}} body at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push.</b> <b>The</b> swimmer only <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> arms 1/3 of the way to the hips, making it easier to enter into the recovery and making the recovery shorter and making the breathing window shorter. The movement increases speed throughout the pull-push phase until the hand is the fastest at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push.</b> This step is called the release and is crucial for the recovery. The speed at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push</b> is used to help with the recovery.|$|R
5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119million contract. While {{this would}} have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was {{rejected}} by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking a ten-year, $200million contract. Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20million options for 2009 and 2010, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> total value of the contract to $200million for 10years.|$|E
5|$|Polacanthids {{are known}} from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The {{timing of the}} {{appearance}} of nodosaurids on both continents indicates {{the origins of the}} clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae {{by the end of the}} Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other with rising sealevel.|$|E

5|$|Protests {{continued}} in Alexandria and Mansoura, where Al Jazeera suggested up {{to a million}} people marched. In Cairo, Egyptian army tanks cleared a highway overpass from which pro-Mubarak protesters had been hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails onto the anti-Mubarak protesters. On the streets below, hundreds of armed soldiers lined up between the two factions, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> pro-Mubarak protesters back and blocking the main hotspots {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum and at other entrances to the square. Violence was reported to have been perpetrated by police.|$|E
5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> action genre and their first such title as far as they could. To this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane Packs, free of charge. Itagaki said that since the packs were born out of his team's interest, they did not care to charge players for their efforts. The two packs were available over Xbox Live {{in the third quarter of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|The French Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube, {{now both}} {{under the command}} of André Masséna, sought to prevent this merger. Masséna sent Michel Ney and a small mixed cavalry and {{infantry}} force from Zürich to stop Hotze's force at Winterthur. Despite a sharp contest, the Austrians succeeded in <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> French out of the Winterthur highlands, although both sides took high casualties. Once the union of the Habsburg armies took place in early June, Archduke Charles attacked French positions at Zürich and forced the French to withdraw beyond the Limmat.|$|E

5|$|The Greencards {{gained more}} fans and became known by name quickly {{after the release}} of Movin' On. The band was {{credited}} with performing the most energetic sets {{during the course of the}} 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to bring a global sound to bluegrass, and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles—were <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> genre's boundaries.

5|$|The North Koreans {{eventually}} {{were able}} to overwhelm the US forces with sheer numbers, capturing Hwanggan and <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> American units further south. However, the action solidified the 27th Infantry's position as a valuable reserve unit for the US Eighth Army during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. The 27th ditinguished itself in several critical battles, including the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten miles to the east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighboring}} Osages {{were not}} so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois.
