WD was initially thought {{to result from}} the <b>passive</b> <b>wasting</b> away of the distal axonal fragment, presumably because it lacked a nutrient supply from the cell body. The discovery of the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) mutant mouse, in which distal severed axons survive intact for weeks rather than only one to two days, radically changed our thoughts on the autonomy of axon survival. Wld(s) taught us that under some conditions the axonal compartment can survive for weeks after axotomy without a cell body.

40|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine (ICE) does not efficiently convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. A majority of this energy is dissipated as heat in the exhaust and coolant. Rather than directly improving {{the efficiency of the}} engine, efforts are being made to improve the efficiency of the engine indirectly by using a waste heat recovery system. Two promising technologies that were found to be useful for this purpose were thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and heat pipes. Both TEGs and heat pipes are solid state, passive, silent, scalable and durable. The use of heat pipes can potentially reduce the thermal resistance and pressure losses in the system as well as temperature regulation of the TEGs and increased design flexibility. TEGs do have limitations such as low temperature limits and relatively low efficiency. Heat pipes do have limitations such as maximum rates of heat transfer and temperature limits. When used in conjunction, these technologies have the potential to create a completely solid state and <b>passive</b> <b>waste</b> heat recovery system...|$|R

A precise {{understanding of the}} contaminant generation process, is a prerequisite to any successful remediation strategy, whether active or passive, but is often marginal at best. The effectiveness of wetlands which bio-mineralize nutrients and organ-ics, reduce metal acidity and improve pH has been widely demonstrated but the message doesn't {{seem to be getting}} out. Weathering {{on the surface of the}} minerals is initially a geochemical process but is then accelerated by bacteria, a biogeochemical process; this sets in motion the secondary precipitation, dissolution and hydrolysis of the weathering products, a chemical process which again is accelerated by bacterial ac-tivity, entering again the realm of bio-geochemistry and bio-mineralization. The resulting contaminant stream is generated by hydrological as well as hydro-geological processes as atmospheric precipitation transports the weathering products to ground and surface water. Once the contaminants are in the wa-ter particulate formation and surface science are dominant disciplines which need to be evoked to op-timize the treatment.

The water level varied widely among the gas vents and depended mainly on the original ground level {{and the depth of}} the vent. Leachate velocity also showed a wide variation. The leachate velocity was high in the upper layers of the saturated zone in a gas vent. However, this is only the superficial velocity caused by an inflow from unsaturated layers.

So {{the first step was}} to know the degree of water pollution and quantity to determine the wetland process variables.

The Manning formula was applied to evaluate the free flow and Darcy’s equation for the surface flow by wetlands. A micro-scale prototype was design and built based on buckets.

40|$|The semi-aerobic {{landfill}} is {{a widely}} accepted landfill concept in Japan because it promotes stabilization of leachates and <b>waste</b> via <b>passive</b> aeration without using any type of mechanical equipment. Ambient air {{is thought to be}} supplied to the landfill through a perforated pipe network made of leachate collection pipe laid along the bottom and a vertically erected gas vent. However, its underlying air flow path and driving forces are unclear because empirical data from real-world landfills is inadequate. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish scientific evidence about the aeration mechanisms and air flow path by an on-site survey of a full-scale, semi-aerobic landfill. First, all passive vents located in the landfill were monitored with respect to temperature level and gas velocity in different seasons. We found a linear correlation between the outflow rate and gas temperature, suggesting that air flow is driven by a buoyancy force caused by the temperature difference between waste in the landfill and the ambient temperature. Some vents located near the landfill bottom acted as air inflow vents. Second, we conducted a tracer test to determine the air flow path between two vents, by injecting tracer gas from an air sucking vent. The resulting slowly increasing gas concentration at the neighboring vent suggested that fresh air flow passes through the waste layer toward the gas vents from leachate collection pipes, as well as directly flowing through the pipe network. Third, we monitored the temperature of gas flowing out of a vent at night. Since the temperature drop of the gas was much smaller than that of the environment, the air collected at the gas vents was estimated to flow mostly through the waste layer, i. e., the semi-aerobic landfill has considerable aeration ability under the appropriate conditions...|$|R

Within this context, this work aims to propose a system for managing chemical waste generated at the Laboratory of Environmental Sanitation, Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, Federal University of CearÃ, with a focus on preventive actions to minimize waste, followed by their treatment. For this, the methodology consisted initially of completing the inventory of chemical waste liabilities followed by characterization of unidentified reagents, which are amenable to reuse. Based on a questionnaire, it was possible to know the main active chemical analyzes generating waste and the situation of how these waste materials were processed in the laboratory. These residues were analyzed for the presence of heavy metals and submitted the metal copper in waste from the analysis of NTK and silver, mercury and hexavalent chromium in the waste analysis of COD. Thus, treatments have been proposed for each metal, which were quantitated using the techniques of X-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption spectroscopy, flame. It was possible to characterize 85. 71 % of unidentified reagents and thus reuse of 58, 125 % of the Labosan <b>passive</b> chemical <b>waste.</b> Through the technique of atomic absorption spectroscopy, flame (FAAS), the residue of NKT analysis showed 100 % removal of this cover, while the COD analysis of the residue showed removal of 99. 984 % 99. 975 % silver and chrome. Thus, it was observed that the final supernatants of chrome and copper treatments showed results within the limits established by CONAMA Resolution No. 430 / 2011. Through the technique of fluorescence (XRF) X-rays, it was found that solid precipitates of heavy metals showed high purities, such as silver which had purity of 99. 223 % and the mercury that had purity of 93. 540 %. Thus, the study supports the need to investigate further all waste generated in Labosan, as also with the implementation of a program of Chemical Waste Management in the UFC.

40|$|A {{case study}} of an {{holistic}} approach to leachate and storm-water management developed at a municipal landfill site I. Madon Komunalno-stanovanjska družba Ajdovščina, Slovenia One of the basic conceptual approaches to water management at landfill sites is to hydrologically limit the generation of leachate during all stages of facility development in favor of producing larger amounts of non-polluted surface water run-off. However, there are some negative aspects to such an approach: 1) regulatory monitoring requirements are customarily not focused on the detection of potentially large amounts of contaminants which can be repeatedly released into the environment by means of storm water run-off; 2) subsequent to the required 30 -year, post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities, common dry- or even wet-type landfills will in principle still {{pose a threat to}} the surrounding water environment; 3) a landfill is usually designed to function as an independent technological unit from the inception of the facility to the post- closure stage of its development.

To avoid a business-as-usual dependence on coal, oil, and gas over the coming decades, society must map out a future energy mix that incorporates alternative sources. This exercise can lead to radically different opinions on what a sustainable energy portfolio might entail, so an objective assessment of the relative costs and benefits of different energy sources is required. We evaluated the land use, emissions, climate, and cost implications of 3 published but divergent storylines for future energy production, none of which was optimal for all environmental and economic indicators. Using multicriteria decision-making analysis, we ranked 7 major electricity-generation sources (coal, gas, nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind, and solar) based on costs and benefits and tested the sensitivity of the rankings to biases stemming from contrasting philosophical ideals. Irrespective of weightings, nuclear and wind energy had the highest benefit-to-cost ratio. Although the environmental movement has historically rejected the nuclear energy option, new-generation reactor technologies that fully recycle <b>waste</b> and incorporate <b>passive</b> safety systems might resolve their concerns and ought to be more widely understood.

40|$|The use of {{morphing}} components on {{aerospace structures}} can greatly increase the versatility of an aircraft. This paper presents the design, manufacturing {{and testing of}} a new kind of adaptive airfoil with actuation through Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). The developed adaptive flap system makes use of a novel actuator that employs SMA wires in an antagonistic arrangement with a Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) mechanism. SMA actuators are usually used in an antagonistic arrangement or are arranged to move structural components with linearly varying resistance levels similar to springs. Unfortunately, most of this strain energy is spent doing work on the passive structure rather than performing the task at hand, like moving a flight control surface or resisting air loads. A solution is the use of Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) actuators that are arranged so that the active elements do not <b>waste</b> energy fighting <b>passive</b> structural stiffnesses. One major problem with PBP actuators is that the low tensile strength of the piezoelectric elements can often result in tensile failure of the actuator on the convex face. A solution to this problem is the use of SMA as actuator material due to their tolerance of tensile stresses. The power consumption to hold deflections is reduced by approximately 20 % with the Post-Buckled Precompressed mechanism. Conventional SMAs are essentially non-starters for many classes of aircraft due to the requirement of holding the flight control surfaces in a given position for extremely long times to trim the vehicle. For the reason that PBP actuators balance out air and structural loads, the steady-state load on the SMAs is essentially negligible, when properly designed. Simulations and experiments showed that the SMAPBP actuator shows tip rotations on the order of 45 °, which is nearly triple the levels achieved by piezoelectric PBP actuators. The developed SMAPBP actuator was integrated in a NACA 0012 airfoil with a flexible skin to carry out wind tunnel tests...|$|R

No single technology can provide all of the mitigation potential in any sector, but many technologies have been acknowledged {{in being able to}} contribute to such potential. Among the technologies that can contribute in such potential, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is not included explicitly, but implicitly as part of technologies such as energy supply, buildings, and industry. To enable a more detailed assessment of the CO 2 mitigation potential of TES across many sectors, the group Annex 25 “Surplus heat management using advanced TES for CO 2 mitigation” of the Energy Conservation through Energy Storage Implementing Agreement (ECES IA) of the International Energy Agency (AEI) present in this article the CO 2 mitigation potential of different case studies with integrated TES. This potential is shown using operational and embodied CO 2 parameters. Results are difficult to compare since TES is always designed in relation to its application, and each technology impacts the energy system as a whole to different extents. The applications analyzed for operational CO 2 are refrigeration, solar power plants, mobile heat storage in industrial <b>waste</b> heat recovery, <b>passive</b> systems in buildings, ATES for a supermarket, greenhouse applications, and dishwasher with zeolite in Germany. The paper shows that the reason for mitigation is different in each application, from energy savings to larger solar share or lowering energy consumption from appliances. The mitigation potential dues to integrated TES is quantified in kg/MW h energy produced or heat delivered. Embodied CO 2 in two TES case studies is presented, buildings and solar power plants.

Both houses are projected by the building company Nordbohus AS, and are to be constructed in Stord, {{on the west coast}} of Norway. The usable floor area, BRA, is 187 m 2 for both houses, and a lifetime of 50 years is assumed. The houses are constructed with a wooden framework, insulated with mineral wool in the walls and roof, and have a ground lever floor of reinforced concrete on a layer of expanded polystyrene. The passive house has, compared to the TEK 07 house a different foundation, 15 cm more mineral wool in the outer walls, 5 cm more in the roof, and better insulated windows and doors. In addition, the thermal conductivity for the outer wall insulation is reduced for the passive house. The house life cycle is divided into several phases. Construction of the house, waste treatment of materials connected to the construction, surface finish and maintenance of the house during the lifetime, water and electrical energy consumption during the house operation and finally demolition and waste treatment of the materials {{after the end of the}} house lifetime. Transportation of workers and materials to the construction site, as well as to waste treatment plant, are included. Generic data from Ecoinvent 2. 0 database is used, but some processes are modified to satisfy Norwegian production information. The Nordel electricity mix is used for Norwegian production and house electricity consumption. SimaPro 7. 1. 8 is used to process the data, and the ReCiPe method, hierarchist midpoint version 1. 03 is used for the impact assessment. It is assumed that both houses have the same heating system, and cover 100 % of the energy needs from electrical energy. For the 50 year life cycle, the passive house has 20 % less impacts to climate change than the TEK 07 house. For the other categories assessed, the passive house has between 10 - 20 % lower impacts than the TEK 07 house. The only exception is impacts to freshwater ecotoxicity, where the passive house impacts are increased with 7 % from the TEK 07 house. The TEK 07 house has impacts to climate change with 1, 6 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor, while the passive house 1, 3 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor. Cumulative energy demand is 55 GJ/m 2 and 42 GJ/m 2 respectively. The construction phase is responsible for 13 %, waste treatment of materials connected to construction 1 %, surface finish and maintenance 6 % and end of life waste treatment 4 % of overall climate change impacts for the TEK 07 house. Water and electricity consumption during the operation are thus responsible of 76 % of the TEK 07 life cycle climate change impacts. For the passive house, this is 19 %, 1 %, 7 %, 6 % and 67 % respectively. Main activities contributing to the overall impacts are transportation of materials, workers and waste to and from the construction site, diesel combusted in building machines, production and incineration of EPS/XPS and paint, waste treatment of wood ash, and production of cement and ceramic tiles. A sensitivity analysis of energy consumed by the construction dryer, frequency of house maintenance, a change of house consumption electricity mix to the Norwegian and UCTE electricity mix, and a change to different heating systems for both houses is carried out. The overall conclusion is that it is environmentally beneficial to build, operate and <b>waste</b> treat a <b>passive</b> house compared to a house following the TEK 07 building standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} sector {{accounted for}} around {{a fourth of}} the total energy usage in Sweden in year 2010 (Energimyndigheten, 2012). Therefore it has become very interesting to achieve a lower energy usage in residential buildings. One way to achieve that is to build so called passive houses. By being very well insulated and have low leakage through the walls, they can reduce the energy usage for heating with a substantial amount. The first passive house was built during the 90 ’s in Germany; and in Sweden the first passive house was built in Gothenburg 2001. Both Sweden and EU have goals to reduce the overall energy usage and greenhouse emission by 2020 and 2050. The concept of the passive house {{is one way to}} achieve the goals. In short, the concept of the passive house in Sweden is: The air tightness for the walls should be tighter than 0, 3 l/m 2,s at 50 Pa overpressure The heat loss factor must not exceed 15 W/m 2 Atemp for climate zone III The delivered energy must not exceed 50 kWh/m 2 Atemp,year for purely non electrically heated systems in climate zone III The average u-value for windows should be as highest 0, 8 W/m 2,K. The term primary energy is a term that is frequently used in the EU when talking about energy usage. Apart from the above mentioned criteria, passive houses in Germany must also use less than 120 kWh/m 2 Atemp,year in primary energy. Primary energy usage for the passive houses is calculated by multiplying the energy usage with the respective primary energy factor. The primary energy factors were set to be the following: Electricity mix – 2, 7 District heating mix – 0, 79 District heating from waste – 0, 04 Electricity from wind power – 0, 05 The results show that the passive houses in Trettondagen and Oxtorget were the only ones that passed the German limit of 120 kWh/m 2 Atemp,year. The low energy usage in Trettondagen could be {{explained by the fact that}} the input values for calculating primary energy usage were simulated and not measured. Moreover, the passive house in Trettondagen was connected to the district heating from waste, which has a very low primary energy factor. The passive houses in Oxtorget were not connected to district heating and relied only on solar panels and heat recovery in the ventilation unit. An electric heater was installed in both the ventilation unit and the storage tank to provide extra heating. What set the passive house in Oxtorget apart from the others was that the electricity used in the houses only came from wind power. The low primary energy factor for wind power contributed to the extremely low primary energy of Oxtorget. The domestic electricity was relatively high in most of the passive houses, a reason to why they had problem with passing the German limit. One house had low enough domestic electricity usage to possibly pass the limit if the source of energy for heating was changed. It was the passive house in Falkenberg which was connected to district heating from biofuels (1, 035). By switching to district heating from <b>waste</b> instead, the <b>passive</b> house in Falkenberg will then pass the limit. Primary energy usage for the passive houses in Oxtorget was also calculated with one half from electricity mix and the other half from electricity from wind power. Despite a large increase in primary energy, the passive houses still passed the limit. The passive house in Trettondagen was also calculated with switching district heating from waste to district heating mix. The primary energy increased a little bit but remained under the limit. The conclusion form this thesis showed that certain passive houses in Sweden were able to fall beneath the German limit for primary energy. One obstacle could be the high domestic electricity that has to decrease, perhaps by informing and involving the residents. Another problem is the absence of proper framework for calculating primary energy. There are some calculations mentioned in FEBY that resembles calculations for primary energy. The definitions though are too unclear and thus difficult to compare with the German standard. ...|$|R
