5|$|The Western Chalukya era {{was one of}} {{substantial}} literary activity in the native Kannada, and Sanskrit. In a golden age of Kannada literature, Jain scholars wrote {{about the life of}} Tirthankaras and Virashaiva poets expressed their closeness to God through <b>pithy</b> poems called Vachanas. Nearly three hundred contemporary Vachanakaras (Vachana poets) including thirty women poets have been recorded. Early works by Brahmin writers were on the epics, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata, Puranas and Vedas. In the field of secular literature, subjects such as romance, erotics, medicine, lexicon, mathematics, astrology, encyclopedia etc. were written for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Prose {{works in}} Sanskrit was {{prolific}} during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, {{a native of}} Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote {{in the court of}} Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of Yasastilaka champu, Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthashastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and <b>pithy</b> manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka. He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.|$|E

The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely [...] "to encourage the others" [...] (Fr. [...] "pour encourager les autres").

The reason was that after killing 108 shikabane, Hibiki became a destroyer shikabane and eventually died by the hands of Akasha. Afterwards, he went into exile for five years. No news about him was heard till series of recent events resurrection of many Shikabane cases. He allies with the Seven Stars in order to bring down the Kōgon Sect, eventually becoming the Contract Priest for Hokuto.

[...] The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence, and, particularly, violence against women. Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, [...] "red lights", and self-destructiveness.

5000|$|Battlezone II was {{not very}} popular, likely due to Pandemic Studio's {{attempts}} to blend two genres together; both styles of player had trouble adapting to an unfamiliar genre. Programmer Ken Miller said, [...] "BZ2 was meant {{to do that to}} both genres at first, but headed in the opposite direction. The problem is that mixed-genre games only attract players that like both genres (the intersection) as opposed to either genre (the union). It mainly comes down to learning curve. Action/shooter gamers can pick up just about any action/shooter game on the market and play it in short order, as almost all of them use the same control scheme and feature similar gameplay conventions. Similarly, strategy gamers can pick up just about any strategy game on the market and play it, although strategy games tend to differ from each other more than action games. Confronting an action/shooter gamer with strategy or a strategy player with action tends to force them outside their genre [...] "comfort zone" [...] and requires a steeper learning curve.
