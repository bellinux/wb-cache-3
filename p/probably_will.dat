25|$|Ethiopians, due {{to result}} of drought, malnutrition, limited healthcare, and other {{infectious}} diseases, have generally poor health. In the HIV-seropositive group, this has caused HIV to progress rapidly to AIDS. Looking ahead, we expect 7 to 10 million Ethiopians <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> be infected by 2010 {{because of the}} high current rate of adult prevalence, widespread poverty, low educational levels, and the government’s limited capacity to respond more actively.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the most}} formal contexts, BP never uses the {{contracted}} combinations of direct and indirect object pronouns which are sometimes used in EP, such as me + o = mo, lhe + as = lhas. Instead, the indirect clitic is replaced by preposition + strong pronoun: thus BP writes ela o deu para mim ("she gave it to me") instead of EP ela deu-mo; the latter most <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> not be understood by Brazilians, being obsolete in BP.|$|E

25|$|The true {{provenance}} of MCC's colours is (and <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> remain) unknown, but {{its players}} often turned out sporting Sky Blue (incidentally the colours of both Eton College and Cambridge University) (whereas the colours of Harrow School, Winchester College and Oxford University are similar), {{until well into}} the 19th century. The club eventually settled on the now well-recognised colours of scarlet and gold, One theory is that MCC adopted these colours from J Nicholson & Co's gin after the company's chairman, MCC benefactor William Nicholson (1825–1909), secured the club's position at Lord's with a loan. Another theory, which chimes with the club's origins, is that MCC borrowed its colours from the livery colours (racing) of a founding patron, Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, of Goodwood fame.|$|E

500|$|Columbia Law School {{professor}} Tim Wu did {{not think}} Disney would have any defensible intellectual property claim. [...] "Though the filmmakers may have committed trespass when they broke Disney World's rules and if it violated the terms of entry on their tickets, the film itself is a different matter," [...] he wrote on The New Yorkers blog. [...] "As commentary on the social ideals of Disney World, it seems to clearly fall within a well-recognized category of fair use, and therefore <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> not be stopped by a court using copyright or trademark laws." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill C-22 (previously Bill C-56), titled [...] "An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Democratic representation)" [...] was a bill which would add 22 seats to the House of Commons.

Under the proposed plan, Ontario would gain ten seats, British Columbia would get another seven seats, and Alberta would receive another five seats. The bill did not pass {{by the end of}} the 1st session of parliament, and was reintroduced in the 2nd session. The bill was delayed by an amendment by the Bloc and did not become law {{by the end of the}} session.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Top Hat {{were mainly}} positive. The Los Angeles Evening Herald Express praised the film, exclaiming [...] "Top Hat is the tops! With Fred Astaire dancing and singing Irving Berlin tunes! Well, one (in his right mind) couldn't ask {{for much more}} — unless, of course, {{it could be a}} couple of encores." [...] The New York Times praised the film's musical numbers, but criticized the story line, {{describing}} it as [...] "a little on the thin side," [...] but also stating that [...] "it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances."Top Hat" [...] is worth standing in line for.

500|$|On {{the day of}} Waller's funeral, {{businesses}} in Bloomsburg closed from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., a unique honor in the town's history. He {{was buried in the}} Old Rosemont Cemetery. During his lifetime, Waller made 25 purchases and 130 sales of land. By 1887 the area that he owned between 4th and 9th Streets in Bloomsburg were home to more than 200 houses. The community of Waller, Pennsylvania is named after him. In his two-column obituary in Bloomsburg's newspaper, it was stated that [...] "No other man has left or <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> leave a greater impression on this community that he [...] did". There is a stained glass window that features Waller on a church in Bloomsburg. Approximately 20 of his sermons still survive. He was also the creator of the Waller Trust, which existed until the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother of her people) strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more than she could stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria. Alice complained to Louis that the letter [...] "made me cry with anger...I wish I were dead and it <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> not be too long before I give Mama that pleasure." [...] However, no mention is made of what provoked this angry outburst.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{said that}} the live CD proved that Madonna is a better singer. A {{reviewer}} from The Buffalo News {{was impressed with the}} release, saying that [...] "This is exactly what you'd expect it to be– a live document of Madonna's most recent tour, which means, essentially, a tour through the dance-based pop music of the past 20 years." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website explained that [...] "though parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret frustrate, it remains a reasonably entertaining program. It <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> be most interesting for Madonna's most serious fans, though. Those in search of the broader titillation of Truth or Dare will leave disappointed." [...] He added that most of the shots in the DVD seemed accurate, time-and-again a softness crept up in the wide angle shots. Jacobson found the performance s shots to be compelling and gave the sound of the DVD a rating of B+. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 49th ceremony in the category Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene {{were then}} called by Nosanchuk. George Darby {{told the court}} that in his conversations with Lamb the {{defendant}} had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate everybody on the street. I <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E
