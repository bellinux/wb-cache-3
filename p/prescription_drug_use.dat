This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone.

This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.|$|E

The results suggest low average price responsiveness with corresponding price elasticities ranging from - 0. 08 to - 0. 25, implying that demand is inelastic.

Also, essential drugs that prevent deterioration in health and prolong life have lower associated average price sensitivity. <b>Prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> price, reimbursement schemes, regression kink design...|$|R
50|$|No {{definitive}} {{cause of}} tic disorders has been declared, {{but for the}} most part, the Cause lies within biological, chemical, or environmental factors. Studies have shown that abnormal neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are active in chemical messages in the brain, can serve as a cause of tic disorders. Researchers have also found abnormal changes in certain parts of the brain that cause strain on the blood flow within the brain, which is likely a contributor of tic disorders. 75% of tic disorders have a genetic component. It appears that tic disorders can be caused or worsened by recreational or <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Tics can form simply if a person repeats sounds or words they hear {{over the course of a}} normal day.|$|E

The combined effect of these factors, with adjustment for multimorbidity, is highly relevant to study to ensure equality in <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Objectives: 1. To examine <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> related to age, gender, income and education after adjustment for multimorbidity, in an entire adult population and in a population where <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> were issued only by general practitioners. 2. To analyse if gender-related morbidity explains the differences in <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> 3. To examine {{to what extent the}} elderly may lack indication for treatment. Methods: Register-based methods were applied in all papers, using data from Östergötland County. To estimate multimorbidity the ACG-Case Mix was used in all papers. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> depending on age, gender, income- and educational level, after adjustment for multimorbidity, was analysed in the entire adult population in Paper I, and in the primary healthcare population in Paper III.
