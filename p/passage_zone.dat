Such singers can evolve, either naturally or through training, into high baritones, suitable for operatic roles such as Pelléas in Pelléas et Mélisande. Alternatively, they may evolve into spieltenors, suitable for character roles such as Pedrillo in The Abduction from the Seraglio or into heldentenors who sing leading roles such as Siegmund in Die Walküre or Florestan in Fidelio. In both these types of tenor roles the highest notes of the tenor range are rarely required, and the voice usually has a baritonal weight in the lower notes. Several famous tenors who have sung the dramatic tenor and heldentenor repertory originally began their careers as baritones, including Jean de Reszke, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Lauritz Melchior, Erik Schmedes, and Plácido Domingo, Towards the end of his career, Domingo returned to the baritone repertoire when he sang the title role in Simon Boccanegra. Self-described as [...] "a bastard bari-tenor", Walter Slezak (the son of operatic tenor Leo Slezak), was primarily a stage and film actor, but he also sang tenor roles in musicals and operettas and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959 as Zsupán in The Gypsy Baron.|$|E

40|$|Volatile {{concentrations}} in basaltic tuyas, edifices that form during a subglacial eruption and remain once the ice sheet has retreated, {{have been used}} to calculate the thickness of the overlying ice sheet {{at the onset of the}} eruption (Tuffen, 2010). However, subglacial eruptions are complex events and this technique does not always provide a clear answer (Schopka et al., 2006; Edwards et al., 2009). The purpose of this research is to evaluate this technique and investigate constraints on the quality of data collected by attempting to calculate the minimum ice thickness under which Hlöðufell, a tuya in south-central Iceland, erupted. Hlöðufell is a Holocene tuya located in the Western Rift Zone of Iceland, 9 km south from the modern edge of Langjökull ice cap. Dissolved H 2 O concentrations were measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and quenching pressures were calculated using the VolatileCalc pressure-solubility model (Newman and Lowenstern, 2002). Overlying ice thickness was calculated by relating quenching pressures, the density of ice, and the elevation of the sample. Water concentrations range from 0. 068 –to 0. 478 wt. % H 2 O, representing pressures ranging from 0. 66 to 24. 72 bars. These pressures represent ice thicknesses between 0 and 268 m thick. The minimum ice thickness level is represented in the lithofacies of the tuya by the <b>passage</b> <b>zone,</b> the transition between subaerial and subaqueous flows. The minimum ice thickness for Hlöðufell is ~ 500 m, much thicker than this study calculated using water concentrations. This indicates that the volatile {{concentrations in}} the basaltic glasses at Hlöðufell do not record the accurate quenching pressure. We interpret the overall low water concentrations to mean that our samples must have degassed at or close to atmospheric pressures at higher elevations, and flowed downslope into areas of thicker ice or deeper melt-water before quenching. These results show that subglacial eruptions and degassing processes are complex and variable and require further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 2013 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 10 - 11, 2013, Athens, Georgia. We {{integrated}} several existing {{data sources}} (migration timing/behavioral, hydrological, variable power station operations, and a 3 -D time-varying hydrothermal model) {{to quantify the}} migration of American shad, Alosa sapidissima, in Conowingo Pond, a 9, 000 acre impoundment on the lower Susquehanna River relative to the potential individual and synergistic effects of thermal discharge from Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS) and Muddy Run Pumped Storage Station (MRPSS) operations. The two power stations are approximately 5 mi apart with PBAPS on the west western shore and MRPSS on the eastern shore. Our approach isolated factors contributing {{to the failure of}} a large proportion of American shad to reach upstream spawning areas. American shad has been targeted for restoration to the Susquehanna River. The PBAPS thermal plume shifts downstream, narrows in width upstream of discharge structure during MRPSS generation and moves upstream when MRPSS has been pumping for at least 12 hours (7 hours typical) primarily in summer at river flows = 12, 500 cfs. Modeled maximum surface velocity of the upstream shifting plume is 5 ft. Most of the Pond remains within the temperature and velocity tolerance range of migrating American shad allowing a wide <b>passage</b> <b>zone.</b> The maximum recorded MRPSS discharge velocity was < 6 ft/s and restricted to a small area leaving substantial area of low velocity (< 2. 0 ft/s) for migration passage. Almost the entire population (80 - 91 %) of radio-tagged pre-spawned American shad successfully migrated past the two stations with minimal delay; the release location distance from MRPSS also did not influence travel speed. Estimated travel speed (4. 0 to 6. 7 mi/d) was similar to that reported by others. High natural river flows (= 55, 000 cfs) with their attendant turbulence and turbidity and inefficiency of fishways pose significantly greater impedance to American shad upstream migration than the operation of either power station individually or synergistically.

40|$|North Atlantic {{islands in}} the Cape Verde Archipelago {{off the coast of}} West Africa {{commonly}} feature an elongated N–S shape in which reduced northern coasts and longer eastern shores absorb the brunt of wave activity and long-shore currents generated by prevailing North East Trade Winds. Located in the middle windward islands, São Nicolau is unusual in profile with an elongated E–W configuration that offers a broad target against high-energy, wind-driven waves. Conversely, the south shore of São Nicolau provides relatively wide shelter in a leeward setting. Reconstruction of the proto-island prior to the onset of the Main Eruptive stage during the Late Miocene at ~ 5. 1 Ma reveals a moderately smaller island with essentially the same E–W orientation. This study combines previous data with results from a detailed stratigraphic log based on Upper Miocene limestone deposits on the island's south flank for comparison with stratigraphic profiles of Upper Miocene limestone from the island's northeast quarter. Logs from a Pliocene sandy limestone outcropping on the south-central coast of São Nicolau give added context to the diversity of marine invertebrates, including branching coral colonies and delicate ramose bryozoans that found shelter in a leeward setting. Whole rhodoliths contribute the main fabric of carbonates deposited against rocky shores on the northern, exposed side of the Miocene island, whereas only traces of worn rhodoliths and rhodolith sand occur as in finer Miocene grainstone on the island's southern, protected side. Miocene and Pliocene carbonate deposits were terminated by submarine flows on an actively growing volcanic island. The <b>passage</b> <b>zone</b> from submarine to subaerial flows on the island's flanks makes a useful meter-stick to gauge absolute water depth at the moment of local extinction by volcanic activity.

We termed this culture exogenous growth factor independent neural stem cells (GiNSCs). GiNSCs expressed stemness markers, displayed a high constitutive NF-kappaB activity and an increased, aberrant, polyploid DNA content. GiNSCs showed a tumorigenic phenotype and formed colonies in a soft agar assay. Microarray analysis showed the up-regulation of the NF-kappaB target gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, proneuronal genes were down-regulated. Under neuronal differentiation conditions GiNSCs adopted a glioma-like phenotype, with nuclear p 53, preserving high amounts of Nestin positive cells and prolonged proliferation. Neutralization of VEGF strongly inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation. In a gain of function approach, the transfection of NSCs with constitutively active upstream kinase IKK- 2 led to constitutively activated NF-kappaB, proliferation in absence of growth factors and augmented VEGF secretion. In a rescue experiment a reduction of NF-kappaB activity by overexpression of IkappaB-AA 1 was able to shift the morphology toward an elongated cell form, increased cell death, and decreased proliferation. Thus GiNSCs may provide a potent tool in cancer research, as their exogenous cytokine independent proliferation and their constitutively high NF-kappaB expression presumes cancerous properties observed in gliomas.

During this time, my focus shifted from figure to background, from the archaeological fragments to the territorial and urban contexts encountered along their <b>passage.</b> This <b>zone</b> offers a unique cross sectional experience of the city, spanning for approximately seven kilometers - from the Aqueduct Park (Parco degli Acquedotti) at the outer edges of the city to the Aurelian Walls at Porta Maggiore – exposing a variety of conditions ranging from the openness of Roman Campagna to the dense agglomeration of Rome’s urban periphery. This is a place of contrasts, of industrial and archaeological, in a state of abandonment and {{in a constant state of}} flux. It is as difficult to grasp conceptually as it is to traverse physically, lacking territorial continuity, legibility and ease of access. It is physically fragmented and separated from the rest of the city by infrastructural arteries and property boundaries. This thesis proposes reversing the marginal aspect of this area by re-establishing its relationship with its urban context. It suggests a reading of this landscape as ‘interstitial tissue’ a connective element rather than an inert zone of separation. Using the biological connotation of the interstitial (“the fine connective tissue lying between the cells of other tissue”) - the thesis focuses on the relational potential of this in-between zone, its ability to connect rather than separate places and neighbourhoods along it. It proposes identifying spatial continuities as well as establishing temporal connections between the past, present, and future of this area. The thesis further proposes a design intervention along a site situated between the aqueducts and via del Mandrione, a historical road running in parallel to the railway lines. Although this site is currently enclosed and separated from its context by property boundaries, the thesis proposes reconfiguring this site as a threshold, a point of intensity between the city and its margins...|$|R
