5|$|The Western <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> line, {{part of the}} Feather River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway with rock and gravel at a great cost. Along the route across the Great Salt Lake Desert, the railroad served the communities of Arinosa, Barro, and Salduro, which were also served by the new road. The Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> merged with the Missouri <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> and the Western Pacific in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis. In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad,</b> and by the fledgling St. Paul and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad.</b> Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} to build a modern trade route through the area is {{credited}} to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D). Palmer started a project in 1880 to make {{what had been a}} local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> and Central <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Northern <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> built a {{train station}} in Livingston, Montana, {{connecting}} to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. Visitors in these early years faced poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via stagecoach. By 1908 visitation increased enough to attract a Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by World War II and ceased around the 1960s. Much of the railroad line was converted to nature trails, among them the Yellowstone Branch Line Trail.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{northern}} and southern segments of the US395 corridor were used by railroads built in the 1880s branching from the First Transcontinental Railroad in Nevada.

5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp behind it.

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of eastâ€“west rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad,</b> which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E

5|$|The Commission {{spent much}} of 1907 {{investigating}} the railroads and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that the Southern <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad,</b> one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{singled out}} the Broadway Limited for special {{treatment}} and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, {{most of which}} was ex-Penn Central, although former Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> sleeping cars were also used.

The Broadway Limited began receiving rebuilt Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 cars were rebuilt at a total cost of $9.8 million.|$|E
5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials reached their conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} Southern <b>Pacific</b> <b>Railroad</b> (which had acquired the O in 1887).
