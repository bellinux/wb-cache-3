40|$|Abstract — Standardization of <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design {{procedures}} enables {{designers to}} develop their own <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> automation modules for entire <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design applications. Since main effort and time for implementation of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures are generally spent for interpretation and explanation of the available <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design standards, a computer-automated access by using parametric modeling to the available standards may improve speed, reliability and quality of the design procedures. Starting from the fact that components of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> are generally composed of similar mechanical and electrical sub-components independent of the crane type, a general component tree of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is developed for automation purpose. Design Modules of cranes are defined from the developed component tree of the cranes based on the available design procedures. Independent Design Procedures are defined as atomic design modules of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures by considering computational approaches and rules in the "F. E. M. Rules " for each <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> component. The "F. E. M. rules " is selected for this purpose because of its widespread use and established popularity among the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> manufacturers. Access to the "F. E. M. Rules " from any design procedure is fully automated by using a systematic approach of parametric modeling. The parametric model can be used for various <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design cases as well as further for optimization. “Ref. [6]...|$|R

The existing 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> (to be replaced) has a 174 boom (I-beam). The crane {{is attached to the}} wall through two brackets (about 8 1 / 2 -ft apart). The boom is attached to the lower bracket, and a supporting rod is attached to the upper bracket. The supporting rod is attached to the boom at about 8 -ft from the free end. After preliminary studies and discussions, it was decided to construct the new <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> from two perpendicular I-beams (L-shape) without a supporting rod. The crane is to be supported on the wall through the two lower existing brackets (about 5 -ft apart). The boom is to be 20 -ft long cantilever (the horizontal I-beam). The vertical I-beam is to be attached to the lower two existing brackets to support the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> to the wall. This construction is to be similar to another existing 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> (L-shape) in the lab. The purpose of this document is to perform a design analysis for the proposed 2, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> to determine suitable sizes of members and configuration of the new <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> assembly.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Jib</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are widely}} used to {{transport}} objects in many factories and work places. Crane motions induce undesirable vibrations of the payload. Therefore, a <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> designer should seek a satisfactory control method to suppress load vibrations during transportation. The aim of this work is to derive a nonlinear model of a <b>jib</b> <b>crane,</b> which {{takes into account the}} simultaneous rotational motions of the boom and the post. These motions induce not only load sway in the plane of motion, but also oscillations of the plane determined by the ropes and the vertical axis through the suspension point. An active vibration control, based on a stability study, has been developed to transport an object along a specified route {{in such a way that}} the aforementioned sway and oscillations of the object are suppressed quickly. The crane nonlinear model and the developed feedback control scheme are simulated using the data of an actual <b>jib</b> <b>crane.</b> The simulation results show the usefulness of the derived model and the proposed control scheme, in suppressing the payload vibration.

40|$|In the paper, {{a method}} of final {{positioning}} of a load in slewing motion for <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} so called ”map of basic functions”. The map stores drive functions of jib slewing motion for particular slew angles chosen so that they form a kind of base. The basic functions are determined for certain operational parameters (angle of jib slew, time of slewing, crane radius, mass of the load, length of the rope, etc.) using optimisation methods. Drive functions for different parameters, particularly for different slew angles, are calculated by a crane control system directly before slewing. Linear interpolation is used for this task.

The main failure mode of lattice <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is a failure in stability, not a failure in strength based on a comparison of the failure probabilities of both stability failures and strength failures.
