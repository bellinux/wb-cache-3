5|$|This {{synthesis}} cemented {{natural selection}} {{as the foundation}} of evolutionary theory, where it remains today.

Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E
5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment {{testing for}} grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991.

These were optional <b>programs</b> <b>which</b> {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, as required by a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left the office on January 4, 1999, after two terms.

5|$|In February 1950, Hooper's {{competitor}} A. C. Nielsen {{bought out}} the Hooperatings system. DuMont did not fare {{well with the}} change: none of its shows appeared on Nielsen's annual top 20 lists {{of the most popular}} series. One of the DuMont Network's biggest hits of the 1950s, Life is Worth Living, received Nielsen ratings of up to 11.1, attracting more than 10 million viewers. Sheen's one-man program – in which he discussed philosophy, psychology and other fields of thought from a Christian perspective – was the most widely viewed religious series in the history of television. 169 local television stations aired Life, and for three years the program competed successfully against NBC's popular The Milton Berle Show.

5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control <b>programs,</b> <b>which</b> generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E

5|$|The {{program was}} headed by major Félix Verdeja Bardales {{and led to}} the {{development}} of four prototype vehicles, including a self-propelled howitzer armed with a 75millimeter (3in) gun. It was designed as an advanced light tank and was one of the first development <b>programs</b> <b>which</b> took into account survivability of the crew as opposed to the protection of the tank itself. The tank was influenced by several of the light tanks which it was intended to replace, including the Panzer I and T-26, both of which were originally used during the Spanish Civil War. The Verdeja was considered a superior tank to the T-26 after a lengthy testing period, yet was never put into mass production.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI <b>programs,</b> <b>which</b> have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
