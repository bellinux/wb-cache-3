For many years, any non-Maya who entered the jungles {{of what is now}} the Mexican state of Quintana Roo was at risk of being killed outright. The combination of new economic factors, such as the entry of the Wrigley Company's chicle hunters into the region, and the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> resulting from the Mexican Revolution, eventually reduced the hatred and hostility. In one form or another, war and armed struggle had continued for more than 50 years, and an estimated 40,000–50,000 people died in the hostilities.|$|E

25|$|The Cuban Nueva trova {{dates from}} the 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, and the {{consequent}} <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes.</b> It differed from the traditional trova, not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined, not only by its connection with Castro's revolution, but also by its lyrics. The lyrics attempt to escape the banalities of life (e.g. love) by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar 'serious' issues. Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.|$|E
25|$|Migration from Mongolia to the United Kingdom is {{a fairly}} recent {{phenomenon}} that is directly connected to the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> {{that have taken place}} in Mongolia in the late 20th/ early 21st century. During the mid-1900s the only significant Mongolian diaspora existed in the former Soviet Union due to strong ties with each respective nation. However, after 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed and began to form a democratic nation, migration trends from Mongolia began to change and the movement of Mongolians {{to other parts of the}} world (including the UK) became much more evident. Following these major changes to the political composition of Mongolia, many citizens of the nation found that they struggled in the new economy, many subsequently left the country in search of new lives in the United States and Western Europe. Migration to the UK specifically began in the 1990s and has continued ever since, the majority of Mongolians who moved to the UK in the 1990s were economic migrants who intended to earn money to support themselves and their family back home, in contrast to most migrants who moved to the UK prior to the year 2000 who were largely students seeking better standards of higher education. Evidence of a more established community has come to light in the increasing number of Mongolian-run bars, cafés, shops and organisations in the UK.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to Buenos Aires in 1808, {{and got the}} curacy of San Benito de Palermo. This {{was supposed to be}} a new jurisdiction split from the one of San Nicolás de Bari, but such change was never enforced, so he was actually in charge of both. He became involved with politics as well, joining the groups of Miguel de Azcuénaga and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña. Those groups sought to generate great <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes,</b> and would lead to the May Revolution. He was selected to take part in the open cabildo celebrated on 22 May to decide the fate of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, as well as other twenty-seven ecclesiastics. He was among the nineteen that voted for the removal of the viceroy, supporting the proposal of Cornelio Saavedra. He also supported Juan Nepomuceno Solá and Ramón Vieytes, who proposed the calling of deputies from the other cities of the viceroyalty.|$|E
500|$|As Anne Frank's stature as both {{a writer}} and humanist has grown, she has been {{discussed}} specifically {{as a symbol of}} the Holocaust and more broadly as a representative of persecution. Hillary Clinton, in her acceptance speech for an Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award in 1994, read from Anne Frank's diary and spoke of her [...] "awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young," [...] which Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda. After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, Nelson Mandela addressed a crowd in Johannesburg, saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and [...] "derived much encouragement from it." [...] He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against apartheid, drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: [...] "Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail." [...] Also in 1994, Václav Havel said [...] "Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully" [...] in relation to the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.|$|E

MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan, where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left nearby Corregidor Island in PT boats and escaped to Australia, where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area. Upon his arrival in Australia, MacArthur gave a speech in which he famously promised [...] "I shall return" [...] to the Philippines. [...] After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled that promise. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945, aboard [...] anchored in Tokyo Bay, and oversaw the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951.

6000|$|I confess I soon lose my {{way when}} I {{try to follow}} those who walk delicately among [...] "types" [...] and allegories. A certain passion for {{clearness}} forces me to ask, bluntly, whether the writer means to say that Jesus {{did not believe the}} stories in question, or that he did? When Jesus spoke, as of a matter of fact, that [...] "the Flood came and destroyed them all," [...] did he believe that the Deluge really took place, or not? It seems to me that, as the narrative mentions Noah's wife, and his sons' wives, there is good scriptural warranty for the statement that the antediluvians married and were given in marriage; and I should have thought that their eating and drinking might be assumed by the firmest believer in the literal truth of the story. Moreover, I venture to ask what sort of value, as an illustration of God's methods of dealing with sin, has an account of an event that never happened? If no Flood swept the careless people away, how is the warning of more worth than the cry of [...] "Wolf" [...] when there is no wolf? If Jonah's three days' residence in the whale is not an [...] "admitted reality," [...] how could it [...] "warrant belief" [...] in the [...] "coming resurrection?" [...] If Lot's wife was not turned into a pillar of salt, the bidding those who turn back from the narrow path to [...] "remember" [...] it is, morally, about on a level with telling a naughty child that a bogy is {530} coming to fetch it away. Suppose that a Conservative orator warns his hearers to beware of great <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>changes,</b> lest they end, as in France, in the domination of a Robespierre; what becomes, not only of his argument, but of his veracity, if he, personally, does not believe that Robespierre existed and did the deeds attributed to him? ...|$|E
