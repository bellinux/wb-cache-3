30|$|In conclusion, {{given that}} <b>PreCount</b> {{achieves}} high fidelity correction of CCrt, <b>PreCount</b> can facilitate {{a number of}} pervasive and real-time applications that spans several domains such as disaster prevention and management, building energy management, and queue management in retail stores.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>PreCount</b> - a {{predictive}} model for correcting real-time occupant count data. We highlighted the non-adaptability of methods for correcting erroneous occupant counts {{in the past}} to correct occupant counts in real-time. We reviewed the accuracy of the methods for correcting occupant counts in the past and how <b>PreCount</b> leverages the accuracy of the probabilistic approach to accurately produce a real-time correction. Secondly, we present PreCount’s elements, and we deployed two correction methods namely RFR and ADR in <b>PreCount.</b> Also, we present a “Feature analysis” section that highlights the features that can represent the factors influencing erroneous occupant counts in our real-time correction model. These factors were used for formulating a real-time count correction problem. Thirdly, we evaluate the performance PreCount’s correction methods using three evaluation cases and with datasets from four building cases. The first two evaluation cases benchmark the overall performance of both correction methods with CCp dataset from the first three building and ground truth data from the last building respectively. The third evaluation case evaluates the performance of <b>PreCount</b> with varying sizes of training data. Lastly, we present the results from all the evaluation cases. The results from the first evaluation case indicate that RFR outperforms ADR in all building cases. In the second evaluation case, both correction methods achieved a maximum error reduction of 68 % compared to CCrt and the naive approach and, a slight improvement over CCp. And in the third evaluation case, <b>PreCount</b> achieved an increasing accuracy as the training dataset increases and with just 30 days of training data, <b>PreCount</b> achieved an error reduction of over 30 % when compared to raw counts. From the foregoing, <b>PreCount</b> can reliably produce high fidelity correction of occupant counts in real-time. Also, <b>PreCount</b> can achieve significant error reduction when limited training data are available for training.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} <b>PreCount</b> with different sizes of training datasets. For this evaluation, we varied the sizes of training datasets from 30 to 120 days. This evaluation is especially crucial in-order to investigate how the <b>PreCount</b> algorithm will perform during periods of early deployment where limited training datasets are available.|$|E
30|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of <b>PreCount’s</b> correction methods in the OFFICE building case for the 1 -day ground truth data. In this evaluation case, we benchmark all the methods for correction with the ground truth data, and we compare {{the performance of}} <b>PreCount’s</b> correction methods with the count estimates from the naive approach, CCp, and CCrt.|$|R
30|$|For each {{presented}} building {{cases and}} their datasets, we have utilized the entire training data to benchmark {{the performance of}} the presented correction methods. Additionally, we utilized the 1 -day ground truth data from OFFICE to validate <b>PreCount’s</b> correction methods. We also present an investigation into correction cases where few datasets are available for training and we highlight how the correction results vary given these variations in the size of training datasets.|$|R
40|$|The floating-point unit of a S/ 390 CMOS {{microprocessor}} is described. It {{contains a}} 116 bit fraction dataflow for addition and subtraction and a 64 bit-wide multiplier. Besides the register array, {{there are no}} other dataflow macros used; it is fully designed with standard cell books and is placed flat with a timing driven placement algorithm. This design method allows more 'irregular' structures than usually found in custom designs. An overview of the floating-point unit is given and some interesting design items are shown: a 120 bit-wide true-complement adder with <b>precounting</b> of leading zero digits, a signed multiplier with bit-optimized Wallace tree, intensive forwarding in source equal target cases and the checking method...|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} results {{presented in}} the four evaluation cases documents the merit of <b>PreCount</b> for performing count correction in real-time. From the overall performance in “Overall performance” section, <b>PreCount</b> achieved a 60 %, 58 % and 36 % error reduction in the UNIVERSITY, MALL and LIBRARY building respectively. The ground truth result in “Ground truth result” section shows a 68 % count error reduction in an OFFICE building. With the results obtained from the varying training sizes of the dataset in the “Training dataset size” section, <b>PreCount</b> could achieve as high as 30 % error reduction with just 30 days of the training dataset. While the accuracies obtained from <b>PreCount</b> are significant, these accuracies are achieved {{within the range of}} some of the highlighted feature sets in the “Feature analysis” section. Some of these feature sets were motivated from previous literature and are known contributors to erroneous counts, especially in camera technology. However, no previous literature enabled real-time count correction as enabled by <b>PreCount.</b> In this section, we discuss some of the limitations in this work, and we highlight some improvement opportunities to achieve better error detection and correction accuracy.|$|E
30|$|Present an {{extensive}} evaluation result that highlights the overall performance of <b>PreCount</b> in four building cases. Datasets {{from the first}} three building cases were used to concretize and evaluate our design assumptions. The dataset from the last building case {{was used to test}} and validate these design assumptions. Also, we evaluate <b>PreCount</b> for different sizes of training data.|$|E
30|$|Sensing {{the number}} of people occupying a {{building}} in real-time facilitates a number of pervasive applications within the area of building energy optimization and adaptive control. To ascertain occupant counts, the adoption of camera-based sensors i.e. 3 D stereo-vision and thermal cameras have grown significantly. However, camera-based sensors can only produce occupant counts with accumulating errors. Existing methods for correcting such errors can only correct erroneous count data {{at the end of the}} day and not in real-time. However, many applications depend on real-time corrected counts. In this paper, we present an algorithm named <b>PreCount</b> for accurately correcting raw counts in real-time. The core idea of <b>PreCount</b> is to learn error estimates from the past. We evaluated the accuracy of the <b>PreCount</b> algorithm using datasets from four buildings. Also, the Normalized Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate the performance of <b>PreCount.</b> Our evaluation results show that in real-time <b>PreCount</b> achieved a significantly lower Normalized Root Mean Squared Error compared to raw counts and other correction approach with a maximum error reduction of 68 % when benchmarked with ground truth data. By presenting a more accurate algorithm for estimating occupant counts in real-time, we hope to enable buildings to better serve the actual number of people to improve both occupant comfort and energy efficiency.|$|E
30|$|The {{results in}} the {{previous}} section have used the entire training dataset in the training phase of <b>PreCount.</b> However, there are instances where there are limited training data such as cases where counting devices have recently been deployed. For these cases, we investigate the accuracy of PreCounts, and we hypothesize that increasing the size of the training dataset should increase the accuracy of <b>PreCount.</b>|$|E
30|$|Present the <b>PreCount</b> algorithm, how it trains several {{correction}} {{models and}} utilizes the best correction model to estimate count error in time.|$|E
30|$|<b>PreCount</b> and its {{elements}} are implemented in Python using some Python data processing (Jones et al. 2001) and machine learning libraries (Pedregosa et al. 2011 c).|$|E
30|$|Firstly, <b>PreCount</b> {{assumes that}} there are {{available}} datasets for formulating the feature sets described in the “Feature analysis” section. However, in some locations, such datasets are not readily available. To address this concern, it could be relevant to perform a feature ranking analysis alongside the feature correlation for all presented feature sets. This {{can be done in}} the training phase of <b>PreCount</b> with methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) or single value decomposition (SVD) to determine what correction accuracy is expected with the inclusion or exclusion of each feature group.|$|E
30|$|We {{compare the}} overall {{performance}} of PreCount’s correction methods for each building case and present {{the most accurate}} correction method as <b>PreCount.</b> In this evaluation case, we benchmark all methods with CCp and we compare the correction methods with both the CCrt and the naive approach.|$|E
30|$|The {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows. In the “Related work” section, we present the state-of-art that highlights the methods for correcting erroneous occupant counts in the past. In the “PreCount” section, we introduce the <b>PreCount</b> algorithm and its elements. This “Evaluation” section includes {{a detailed description}} of the feature preparation stage and the correction methods used for correcting erroneous occupant counts in real-time. In the same section, we present the building cases and datasets used in this paper, the error patterns in our datasets and we justify the relevant features for identifying count errors in real-time. In the “Evaluation” section, we evaluate the performance of <b>PreCount</b> with three evaluation cases and with the datasets from the four building cases. In the “Discussion” section, we discuss the limitations of this study and propose relevant improvement opportunities. Finally, we conclude in the “Conclusions” section.|$|E
30|$|We have {{obtained}} 1 -year worth of dataset {{from the first}} three building cases and 6 -month worth of dataset from the OFFICE building. The evaluation of <b>PreCount</b> is done with this 1 -year datasets. The evaluation uses the past correction data from the probabilistic approach as ground truth data. This {{is because of the}} cumbersome process involved in manually collecting ground truth data, especially in large commercial buildings. More so, the potency of obtaining high fidelity count estimates through the probabilistic approach provides a viable alternative for benchmarking subsequent methods such as a method for correcting erroneous count estimates in real-time (Sangoboye and Kjærgaard 2016). However, {{it should be noted that}} these datasets are only used for analysis, training and evaluation purposes and not for testing and validation. Additional, we {{have obtained}} 1 -day of manually collected ground truth data from the OFFICE building. The 6 -month past count data from this building and the manually collected ground truth data are used to validate and test <b>PreCount.</b> In the following, we provide a detailed description of the four building cases.|$|E
30|$|Also in Fig.  10, we {{presented}} that increasing {{the size of}} the training dataset increases correction accuracy. However, {{it should be noted that}} as the size of training datasets increases, the time complexity for generating <b>PreCount</b> correction models also increases linearly. Therefore, a trade-off that maximizes both the accuracy for estimating count errors and estimation speed should be investigated to ensure that the latency for correcting real-time counts are minimal for each domain application.|$|E
30|$|In the {{following}} subsections, we present {{the details of}} the individual elements in the proposed algorithm. Here, we proceed with a particular focus on the feature preparation stage and the description of the regression algorithms deployed in <b>PreCount.</b> In subsequent subsections, we firstly introduce the datasets used in this work. Secondly, we provide the justification for employing a machine learning approach to correct count errors in real-time. Lastly, we highlight the rationale for including both the calendar and weather features to formulate a feature matrix.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} the <b>PreCount</b> {{algorithm}} for accurately correcting raw counts in real-time. One approach to achieving real-time error correction from raw counts is to continuously learn the patterns and trends of count errors using machine learning approaches. We introduce the following definitions and notations {{to distinguish the}} types of datasets used in this work: Transitions (ΔC) represents {{the difference between the}} entries and exits for each time-step in a dataset. Occupant Count (CC) is the cumulative sum of ΔC from the first time-step of a given day to the last time-step of that day.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} stem cell collection with Large Volume Procedures. (LVP), and analysed {{the importance of the}} CD 34 + cell <b>precount</b> in promoting the collection of a sufficient number of CD 34 + cells for transplantation, using the Univariate Logistic Regression analysis. Eighty-nine leukapheresis were performed in 49 patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors, mobilized with chemotherapy plus Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). For each procedure 15. 8 liters of blood were processed. The median value of Nucleated Cells (NC) and CD 34 + cells <b>precount</b> was respectively 8. 29 x 10 (9) /ml (range 1. 13 / 45. 4) and 43. 08 x 103 /ml (range 1. 06 / 795. 2). Results show the capability of LVP to collect large quantities of hemopoietic progenitors with a median CD 34 + cell total yield of 215. 02 x 10 (6) (range 5. 03 / 2210). The yields per patients' body weight were: CD 34 + cells 3. 23 x 10 (6) /kg (range 0. 081 / 41. 58). The regression analysis between blood cell precounts and collection yields gave the following correlations: the CD 34 + cell <b>precount</b> correlates with CD 34 + yield (r = 0. 78 p or = 2. 5 x 10 (6) /kg we performed a Univariate Logistic Regression analysis that showed in our patients a probability of collecting > or = 2. 5 x 10 (6) CD 34 +/kg that rose from 0. 6 to 0. 95 for CD 34 + precounts that oscillated from 30 to 40 x 10 (3) CD 34 + cells/ml, respectively. The Univariate Logistic Regression gave a probability of collecting > or = 2. 5 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells/kg that oscillated between 0. 64 / 0. 98 for values of CD 34 + cells processed from 6 x 10 (6) /kg to 8 x 10 (6) /kg, p or = 2. 5 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells/kg. Furthermore, the Logistic Model suggests that the best strategy to plan a successful CD 34 + cell collection procedure is to identify for each patient the amount of CD 34 + cells/kg to be processed rather than the fixed processing of 3 / 5 blood volumes in all patients...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we have {{obtained}} datasets from four commercial building cases. We utilize the datasets from {{three of the}} building cases to concretize PreCount’s design assumptions, training, and evaluation. The dataset from the last building case is used to test and validate <b>PreCount.</b> The four building cases are a university teaching building (UNIVERSITY), a public library (LIBRARY), a shopping mall (MALL) and a research building (OFFICE). The datasets obtained from these buildings cover different ways commercial buildings are occupied and used by people. Each dataset contains both ΔC and CC of both the raw counts and their corresponding past corrections respectively. The raw count correction data in the past are obtained through the probabilistic method in Sangoboye and Kjærgaard (2016).|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates {{stem cell}} {{collection}} procedures {{performed with the}} Dideco Excel blood cell separator, with particular attention given to yields and separator collection efficiencies. Patients' blood precounts and yield parameters related to the harvest capacity of the collection system were investigated. Fifty-five collection procedures were analyzed in 32 patients suffering from hematological malignancies and solid tumors and mobilized with chemotherapy plus G-CSF. The median blood volume processed in each procedure was 15. 8 liters (12 - 19. 750), with a blood flow rate of 70 ml/min. Patients had the following median blood <b>precount</b> value: NC 7. 81 x 10 (9) /L, CD 34 + cells 49. 08 x 10 (3) /ml. Leukapheresis procedures gave the following yields: NC 14. 95 x 10 (9), MNC 10. 83 x 10 (9), CD 34 + cells 4. 37 x 10 (6); yields/kg, NC 0. 21 x 10 (9) kg, MNC 0. 15 x 10 (9) /kg CD 34 + cells 4. 26 x 10 (6) /kg. Procedures show the following collection efficiencies: NC 10. 79 %, MNC 29. 06 %, CD 34 + 42. 33 %, PLT 26. 5 %. The RBC (red blood cell) contamination of the product was (median value) 20. 9 ml for each procedure, and for platelets 1. 76 x 10 (11) per procedure. The CD 34 + cell precounts strongly correlated with the CD 34 + yields/kg (r= 0. 82. p= 0. 000). Furthermore the NC and MNC precounts correlated with the CD 34 + yields/kg but only the MNC <b>precount</b> correlation is notable (r= 0. 57, p= 0. 000). The logistic regression analysis shows that CD 34 + (p= 0. 008) but not NC (po= 0. 14), MNC (p= 0. 09), or PLT (p= 0. 53) precounts significantly influenced the collection of a sufficient dose of CD 34 + cells for transplantation (> or = 2. 5 x 10 (6) /kg). Eleven of the thirty-two patients have been transplanted till now, and all had a prompt and lasting trilineage engraftment NC > 1 x 10 (9) /L on day 12 (10 - 17). Our data show that the collection system analyzed in this report is able to collect large amounts of progenitor cells, harvesting > 2. 5 x 10 (6) /kg CD 34 + cells with a single procedure in 68. 8 % of patients and assuring complete recovery after stem cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutologous {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} remains {{a mainstay of}} therapy for diseases such as multiple myeloma and relapsed lymphoma. The use of plerixafor {{has been shown to}} augment the ability to collect adequate stem cells, but the optimal use of this agent when used with chemotherapy is not yet clear. We utilized an algorithm-based approach with the addition of plerixafor to 54 patients undergoing chemomobilization with reduced-dose etoposide who had a less than optimal preapheresis CD 34 + cell count. We used a CD 34 + <b>precount</b> of 20  cells/μL as a threshold to initiate stem cell apheresis. Ninety-four percent of patients were successfully collected and proceeded to transplantation. Fourteen of 51 (28 %) patients who successfully collected required plerixafor to augment stem cell yield. Of the patients who successfully collected, 94 % (89 % of the entire population) were able to collect in 2 or fewer days. Compared with previous data from our institution, the rate of patients collecting > 4  ×  106 CD 34 + cells/kg in a single collection was increased from 39 % to 69 %. The safety profile of this approach was acceptable. The use of this algorithm-based method to determine when and whether to add plerixafor to chemomobilization was shown to be a successful and cost-effective approach to stem cell collection...|$|E
40|$|Reconstitution of {{hematopoiesis}} {{by means}} of peripheral blood stem cells is a valid alternative to autologous bone marrow transplantation. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to increase the efficiency of collection of circulating blood progenitor cells and to obtain a purer product for transplant. We carried out leukapheresis procedures with the Fresenius AS 104 blood cell separator, using two different protocols, the previously used PBSC-LYM and a new mononuclear cell collection program. Both programs were highly effective in collecting mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD 34 + cells. Some differences were found, especially regarding MNC yield and efficiencies. There are remarkable differences in the efficiency of collection of CD 34 + cells (62. 38 % with the new program as opposed to 31. 69 % with the older one). Linear regression analysis showed a negative correlation between blood volume processed and MNC efficiency only for the PBSC-LYM program. Differences were also observed in the degree of inverse correlation existing in both programs between patients' white blood cell <b>precount</b> and MNC collection efficiency. The inverse correlation was stronger for the PBSC-LYM program. Seven patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies received high dose chemotherapy and were subsequently transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells collected using the new protocol. All patients obtained a complete and stable engraftment with the reinfusion product collected with one or two leukapheresis procedures. High efficiencies and yields were observed in the new protocol for MNC and CD 34 + cells. These were able to effect rapid and complete bone marrow recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{performance}} of the new Continuous Mononuclear Cell Collection (CMNC) protocol on the Spectra Optia Apheresis System for collecting autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) in adult patients with respect to collection variables, CD 34 + cells harvest prediction and engraftment data. In this retrospective study, 39 CMNC procedures on 23 mobilized patients with multiple myeloma and lymphoma were analyzed. CD 34 + cells and blood cells yields, collection efficiencies (CE 1 and CE 2), cell losses were calculated. Engraftment data of 17 autologous transplantations were collected. Apheresis duration was 239 min for a product volume of 220 mL. Cell product haematocrit, MNC and platelets counts were acceptable (respectively 2. 4 %, 65 %, 834 x 109 /L). Median platelet loss was 27. 3 %. Median CD 34 + CE 1 and CE 2 were 64. 6 % and 48. 5 % respectively. We harvested 2. 92 × 10 (6) CD 34 + cells/kg, with a CD 34 dose[*]≥[*] 2 × 10 (6) /kg for 67 % of the procedures. Linear correlation between preapheresis CD 34 count and the CP CD 34 dose/kg allowed a prediction model with a decrease trend for high WBC <b>precount.</b> Procedures were well tolerated. For 17 autologous transplantations, median time to neutrophils and platelets reconstitutions were 12 and 13 days respectively. Spectra Optia CMNC protocol successfully collected CD 34 + cells with yields permitting the harvest of sufficient enriched grafts for autologous transplantation. The CD 34 + cell yield prediction was excellent. PBSC collection with CMNC protocol had advantages of high processing rate, low product volume, and acceptable contamination by platelets...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives Stem cell {{collection}} {{is a standard}} procedure for the procurement of autologous grafts to rescue myelosuppression induced by high-dose treatments. Accurate prediction of collection yields may contribute to optimize planning and quality control of collection. Materials and Methods Data of 313 autologous haematopoietic stem cell (AHSC) evaluable collections performed in 208 patients with haematologic and non-haematologic neoplasms from seven centres were prospectively analysed to test the accuracy of yield predictions generated by a formula that required the input of peripheral blood (PB) CD 34 + cell <b>precount</b> and desired PB volume to be processed. Data were matched in a standard linear regression, in a zero-point regression analysis and tested for prediction accuracy. Further 165 AHSC collections were analysed on a single-centre basis, using yield predictions as reference standards. Results Analysis showed high levels of correlation between measured collection yields (my) and predictions (py) (R = 0. 85; P = 0. 000000) as well as high degree of prediction accuracy (my vs. py at paired t-test: P = 0. 114781; median my/py ratio = 1. 23). Analysis of additional 165 AHSC collections on a single-centre basis showed that the analysed centres had 70 % or more measured yields comprising the 0. 6 - 1. 8 interval of the my/py ratio. The observance of the 'efficiency' my/py interval assured collection quality control in these centres confirming {{the reliability of the}} method. Conclusions This prediction method generates accurate and immediate yield predictions allowing collection planning and rapid efficiency control. As a consequence of our study, four centres out of seven use the described method to plan both leukapheresis number and single-procedure blood processing volume while the remaining three centres plan leukapheresis number on the basis of our predictions, maintaining a fixed single-procedure 200 ml/kg blood volume processing, according to their centre AHSC collection policy...|$|E
