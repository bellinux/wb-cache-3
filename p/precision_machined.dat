2500|$|The gun used metal {{stamping}} and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, {{reducing the number}} of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the barrel, bolt and firing mechanism were <b>precision</b> <b>machined.</b> The receiver consisted of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end was a knurled metal cap which was used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, rifled barrel had 4 right-hand grooves. [...] M3 and M3A1 submachine guns could be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II. [...] A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. [...] It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. [...] In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of thermal errors in <b>precision</b> <b>machines</b> has increased in recent years. The requirements on <b>precision</b> <b>machines</b> such as higher precision and higher productivity become more stringent over product generations. Improved <b>precision</b> of <b>precision</b> <b>machines</b> has increased the importance of thermal errors in <b>precision</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase the productivity of <b>precision</b> <b>machines,</b> more energy needs to be consumed in general, resulting in increased heat generation and thermal errors, and poorer precision performance. To further improve the <b>precision</b> of <b>precision</b> <b>machines</b> while achieving increased productivity at the same time, thermal errors in <b>precision</b> <b>machines</b> need to be studied and reduced further.
