40|$|In C. elegans, a Wnt/WG-like {{signaling}} pathway down-regulates the TCF/LEF-related protein, POP- 1, to specify posterior cell fates. Effectors of this {{signaling pathway}} include a beta-catenin homolog, WRM- 1, and a conserved protein kinase, LIT- 1. WRM- 1 and LIT- 1 form a kinase complex that can directly phosphorylate POP- 1, but how signaling activates WRM- 1 /LIT- 1 kinase {{is not yet}} known. Here we show that mom- 4, a genetically defined effector of <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling,</b> encodes a MAP kinase kinase kinase-related protein that stimulates the WRM- 1 /LIT- 1 -dependent phosphorylation of POP- 1. LIT- 1 kinase activity requires a conserved residue analogous to an activating phosphorylation site in other kinases, including MAP kinases.

Here {{we report that}} in human cells and during Xenopus embryogenesis, Wnt/Fz signaling activates the small GTPase Rho, a key regulator of cytoskeleton architecture. Wnt/Fz activation of Rho requires the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl) and a novel Formin homology protein Daam 1. Daam 1 binds to both Dvl and Rho, and mediates Wnt-induced Dvl-Rho complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of Daam 1 prevents Wnt/Fz activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but not of β-catenin signaling.

40|$|Monoaminergic neurons [serotonergic (5 -HT) and dopaminergic (mdDA) ] in the {{brainstem}} project axons {{along the}} anterior-posterior axis. Despite their important physiological functions and implication in disease, the molecular mechanisms that dictate {{the formation of}} these projections along the anterior-posterior axis remain unknown. Here we reveal a novel requirement for Wnt/planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> in the anterior-posterior organization of the monoaminergic system. We find that 5 -HT and mdDA axons express the core planar cell polarity components Frizzled 3, Celsr 3, and Vangl 2. In addition, monoaminergic projections show anterior-posterior guidance defects in Frizzled 3, Celsr 3, and Vangl 2 mutant mice. The only known ligands for planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> are Wnt proteins. In culture, Wnt 5 a attracts 5 -HT but repels mdDA axons, and Wnt 7 b attracts mdDA axons. However, mdDA axons from Frizzled 3 mutant mice are unresponsive to Wnt 5 a and Wnt 7 b. Both Wnts are expressed in gradients along the anterior-posterior axis, consistent with their role as directional cues. Finally, Wnt 5 a mutants show transient anterior-posterior guidance defects in mdDA projections. Furthermore, we observe during development that the cell bodies of migrating descending 5 -HT neurons eventually reorient along the direction of their axons. In Frizzled 3 mutants, many 5 -HT and mdDA neuron cell bodies are oriented abnormally along the direction of their aberrant axon projections. Overall, our data suggest that Wnt/planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> may be a global anterior-posterior guidance mechanism that controls axonal and cellular organization beyond the spinal cord...|$|E

Using two three-dimensional culture models of mammary epithelial cells and an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we reveal that Par 6 signaling, which is regulated directly by TGFβ, {{plays a role}} in breast cancer metastasis. Interference with Par 6 signaling blocked TGFβ-dependent loss of polarity in acini-like structures formed by non-transformed mammary cells grown in three-dimensional structures and suppressed the protrusive morphology of mesenchymal-like invasive mammary tumor cells without rescuing E-cadherin expression. Moreover, blockade of Par 6 signaling in an in vivo orthotopic model of metastatic breast cancer induced the formation of ZO- 1 -positive epithelium-like structures in the primary tumor and suppressed metastasis to the lungs. Analysis of the pathway in tissue microarrays of human breast tumors further revealed that Par 6 activation correlated with markers of the basal carcinoma subtype in BRCA 1 -associated tumors.

To learn more about how Dsh can discriminate between these functions, we performed genetic screens to isolate additional dsh alleles and we examined the potential role of protein phosphorylation by site-directed mutagenesis. We identified two alleles with point mutations in the Dsh DEP domain that specifically disrupt planar <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling.</b> When positioned {{in the structure of the}} DEP domain, these mutations are located close to each other and to a previously identified planar polarity mutation. In addition to the requirement for the DEP domain, we found that a cluster of potential phosphorylation sites in a binding domain for the protein kinase PAR- 1 is also essential for planar <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling.</b> To identify regions of dsh that are necessary for Wg signaling, we screened for mutations that modified a GMR-GAL 4;UAS-dsh overexpression phenotype in the eye.

In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, posterior polarity is induced by an unknown centrosome-dependent signal.

G. White. 2000. Dev. Biol. 222 : 55 – 70; Wallenfang, M. R., and G. Seydoux. 2000. Nature. 408 : 89 – 92; Hamill, D. R., A. F. Severson, J. C. Carter, and B. Bowerman. 2002. Dev.

While deficiency of the polarity proteins Crumbs and aPKC result in impaired podocyte foot process architecture, {{the function of}} basolateral polarity proteins for podocyte differentiation and maintenance remained unclear. Here we report, that Scribble is expressed in developing podocytes, where it translocates from the lateral aspects of immature podocytes to the basal cell membrane and foot processes of mature podocytes. Immunogold electron microscopy reveals membrane associated localisation of Scribble predominantly at the basolateral site of foot processes. To further study the role of Scribble for podocyte differentiation Scribble(flox/flox) mice were generated by introducing loxP-sites into the Scribble introns 1 and 8 and these mice were crossed to NPHS 2. Cre mice and Cre deleter mice. Podocyte-specific Scribble knockout mice develop normally and display no histological, ultrastructural or clinical abnormalities up to 12 months of age. In addition, no increased susceptibility to glomerular stress could be detected in these mice. In contrast, constitutive Scribble knockout animals die during embryonic development indicating the fundamental importance of Scribble for embryogenesis. Like in podocyte-specific Scribble knockout mice, the development of podocyte foot processes and the slit diaphragm was unaffected in kidney cultures from constitutive Scribble knockout animals. In summary {{these results indicate that}} basolateral <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> via Scribble is dispensable for podocyte function, highlighting the unique feature of podocyte development with its significant apical membrane expansions being dominated by apical polarity complexes rather than by basolateral <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{studied a}} novel {{illusion}} of tilt inside checkerboards {{due to the}} role of contrast polarity in contour integration. The preference for binding of oriented contours having same contrast polarity, over binding of opposite polarity ones (CP rule), has been used to explain several visual illusions. In three experiments we investigated how the binding effect is influenced by luminance contrast value, relatability of contour elements, and distance among them. Experi- ment 1 showed that the effect was indeed present only when the CP rule was satisfied, and found it to be stronger when the luminance contrast values of the elements are more similar. In experi- ment 2 the illusion was reported only with relatable edges, and its strength was modulated by the degree of relatability. The CP-rule effectiveness, thus, seems to depend on good continuation. The intensity of contrast <b>polarity</b> <b>signals</b> propagating from an oriented contour might be the less intense, the more its direction deviates from linearity. In experiment 3 we estimated the distance threshold and found it to be smaller than the one found for other illusions, arising with collinear fragments.

We describe a Prickle-dependent intercellular feedback loop that generates asymmetric Frizzled and Dishevelled localization. In the absence of Prickle, Frizzled and Dishevelled remain symmetrically distributed. Prickle localizes to the proximal side of pupal wing cells and binds the Dishevelled DEP domain, inhibiting Dishevelled membrane localization and antagonizing Frizzled accumulation. This activity is linked to Frizzled activity on the adjacent cell surface. Prickle therefore functions in a feedback loop that amplifies differences between Frizzled levels on adjacent cell surfaces...|$|E

We further find that proper polarity in the late embryo also involves the asymmetric distribution and phosphorylation of Armadillo (Arm or b-catenin) at the membrane and that interference with this Arm phosphorylation leads to polarity defects.
