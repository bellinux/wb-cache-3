Several wild species of this genus are resistant to some pests and diseases and many are considered as medicinal. The aim of this research was to induce callus from in vitro Passiflora gibertii leaf explants for quantification of vitamin C and total phenols. Once the appropriate auxin/cytokine balance promotes callus formation and may optimize the production of secondary compounds and vitamins, calli were induced using a half-strength MS medium with a combination of the auxin Picloran (PIC) and the cytokine Kinetin (KIN). The vitamin C and total phenols were quantified by colorimetric methods from calli after different culture periods. The calli induction was strongly dependent of the combination PIC/KIN. It was observed high vitamin C content (94. 8 mg 100 g- 1) during the calli induction period in MS+ 4. 14 µM PIC+ 0. 207 µM KIN.

When phenol is removed from the fermentation broth by pertraction, a lower maximum aqueous phenol concentration of 2. 6 mM is achieved, while the total <b>phenol</b> <b>production</b> increases to 132 %, as compared to the fermentation without pertraction. There are indications that the volumetric productivity (mmolL - 1 h - 1) increases slightly in the fermentations with in situ pertraction compared to the reference experiments.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} genetic and transcriptional changes {{observed in a}} phenol producing mutant of the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida S 12 were assessed with metabolic flux analysis. The upregulation of a malate/lactate dehydrogenase encoding gene could be connected to a flux increase from malate to oxaloacetate. A mutation in the pykA gene decreased in vitro pyruvate kinase activity, {{which is consistent with}} a lower flux from phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Changes in the oprB- 1, gntP and gnuK genes, encoding a glucose-selective porin, gluconokinase and a gluconate transporter respectively, altered the substrate uptake profile. Metabolic flux analysis furthermore revealed cellular events not predicted by the transcriptome analysis. Gluconeogenic formation of glucose- 6 -phosphate from triose- 3 -phosphate was abolished, in favour of increased phosphoenolpyruvate production. An increased pentose phosphate pathway flux resulted in higher erythrose- 4 -phosphate production. Thus, the availability of these two central phenol precursors was improved. Furthermore, metabolic fluxes were redistributed such that the overall TCA cycle flux was unaffected and energy production increased.

40|$|Hydroxycinnamic acids {{are natural}} {{constituents}} of grape juice and wine, and are precursors of volatile phenols produced by yeasts and {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). The organoleptic defects due {{to the presence of}} this volatile phenols are usually associated with “animal”, “horsey”, “leather”, “phenolic” or “spicy” aromatic notes. The most common pathway for the degradation of hydroxycinnamic acids involves two enzymes. In first place, it occurs a decarboxylation by the phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD), and secondly a reduction of the intermediate metabolite carried out by the vinylphenol reductase (VPR). Some LAB strains {{seem to be able to}} metabolise hydroxycinnamic acids through an alternative route, involving a reduction step by a phenolic acid reductase (PAR) followed by a decarboxylation reaction. In order to characterize PAR and PAD/VPR activities, six different LAB strains were tested for the <b>production</b> of volatile <b>phenols</b> and non-volatile metabolites.

This research was aimed to achieve methods of in vitro propagation of grapevine in order to apply biotechnologies for correction, growth, and optimization of products and compounds of the cultivated plant in relation to phenol ratio. Methods: In this interventional study, the effects of cultivar and size of the inflorescence explant and the gibberellin hormone in two levels, benzylaminopurine, and auxin hormones in three levels with three replicates per treatment were evaluated in relation to phenol ratio, in order to evaluate the effect of plant growth regulators, the type and size of the grape inflorescence explant on the <b>phenol</b> <b>production.</b> Results: The type of plant growth regulators affected phenolic substances production. The production of phenolic substances decreased in a medium with the highest concentration of growth regulators, 4 and 2. 5 μM concentration of benzylaminopurine, and 4. 9 μM of auxin.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of several drugs on different B. bruxellensis strains were scored on solid nutrient media. This revealed variations in resistance among the B. bruxellensis strains. Their capacity to develop in different wine and must environments: pH, ethanol, and SO 2 concentrations, were evaluated by measuring the direct incubation survival rate. The results, compared with those obtained for other wine yeast species, confirmed the remarkable resistance of B. bruxellensis strains to various conditions which inhibit the growth of other species. Nevertheless some differences were observed among the B. bruxellensis strains, thus confirming their physiological diversity. A comparison of their volatile <b>phenol</b> <b>production</b> revealed intraspecific heterogeneity among B. bruxellensis strains. B. bruxellensis is one of the microbial species most resistant to environmental constraints in wine.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis is {{the most}} {{important}} wines spoilage yeast encountered during winemaking as it can survive in wine for long periods, requires minimal nutrients for growth, and can be difficult to control. Brettanomyces produces two major spoilage products, the volatile phenols 4 -ethylphenol (Band-Aid, medicinal smell) and 4 -ethylguaiacol (smoke, clove smell) by decarboxylation and subsequent reductions of the hydroxycinnamic acids p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid. Hydroxycinnamic acids are naturally present in grapes and wine and are also often present in the form of tartaric acid- hydroxycinnamic acid esters which B. bruxellensis cannot utilize. The first objective of this study was therefore to investigate the ability of other wine microorganisms to hydrolyze tartaric acid bound hydroxycinnamic acids and the impact this may have on volatile <b>phenol</b> <b>production</b> by Brettanomyces. Of the thirty five strains of wine microorganisms tested only one, the commercial strain O. oeni VFO, hydrolyzed tartaric acid bound hydroxycinnamic acids in wine and increased the concentrations of the free hydroxycinnamic acids p- coumaric acid and ferulic acid. Because of this, B. bruxellensis produced significantly higher concentrations of 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguiaciol when growing in wine where VFO had ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ conducted the malolactic fermentation.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{determine}} whether there is a correlation between the susceptibility to volatile <b>phenol</b> <b>production</b> of wines and grape variety. Therefore, 11 single varietal red wines from Portugal were heat sterilized, contaminated with Dekkera bruxellensis PYCC 4801 and incubated for at least 10 days at 30 °C. Since yeasts did not grow in pure wines due to inhibition by ethanol, the experiments were conducted in diluted samples with similar initial pH and ethanol levels. Yeast growth was monitored and produced levels of 4 -ethylguaiacol, 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -vinylphenol were measured using gas chromatography in order to compare values between varieties. This approach led to the production of 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol in all samples; 4 -vinylphenol however, could not be detected in any sample. All values reached or exceeded perception threshold levels established in literature. This suggests that all examined wines are at risk of developing phenolic off-flavour once contaminated with Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts, especially considering that samples were diluted and thus contained lower amounts of precursors than are potentially present in pure wines. 4 -ethylguaiacol values were generally lower and varied less between samples and varieties compared to 4 -ethylphenol. Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca showed the highest potential in regard to volatile <b>phenol</b> <b>production</b> from the natural precursors available in the wines while Sousão wines appeared to be the least prone and Touriga Nacional wines exhibited intermediate volatile phenol values. Furthermore, 4 -ethylphenol: 4 -ethylguaiacol ratios were calculated and show differences between and similarities within varieties. An attempt was made to estimate the precursor quantities originally present in the wines by comparing the results of spiked and unspiked wines but the obtained results were inconclusive.

Phenols showed 5. 05 % pupation (delayed) while no pupation in tannic acid treatment. Methanolic extract of Ravi showed more effect on bollworm larvae than susceptible variety S- 12...|$|E
40|$|Echinacea purpurea {{has been}} {{introduced}} in to Taiwan and grown successfully. However, information regarding {{the effects of the}} growing climate on its active constituents (e. g. caffeoyl derivatives) and biomass production is very limited. In this study the biomass of field-grown E. purpurea plants harvested during three different crop seasons was compared. The content of caffeoyl <b>phenols</b> and the <b>production</b> of aerial plant parts were also assayed. The results indicated that both morphological and agronomic traits were affected by crop season, with spring-grown plants producing more stems and flowers but fewer leaves than autumn-grown plants. Autumn-grown plants produced more caffeoyl phenols, particularly cichoric acid and caftaric acid, in leaf and flower tissues than spring grown plants. Thus, transplanting E. purpurea seedlings in the autumn and harvesting the aerial parts at the beginning of winter first, and then harvesting the rhizome-regenerated plants again in the following summer are technically feasible. This farming system would give commercial cultivation of E. purpurea in Taiwan a great competitive advantage over other growing regions, provided that. sin environmentally suitable population is selected and established in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext Condensed tannins {{have been}} {{successfully}} used as substitutes for <b>phenol</b> in the <b>production</b> of resins for wood products. However, the enhancement of the properties of tannin-based resins with nontoxic and cost effective additives is of great interest. • Methods In the present work, the performance enhancement of tannin-based particleboards with cellulose nanofibers was investigated. • Results In presence of 2  % of cellulose nanofibers, the viscosity of tannin-based adhesives and the internal bonding strength (IB) of the corresponding particleboards were increased from 350 to 5, 462  mPa·s and from 0. 85 to 0. 98  MPa respectively. The modulus of elastic (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of the resins were also notably increased while thickness swelling (TS) of the panels was not affected. • Conclusion The addition of cellulose nanofibers to tannin adhesives is an effective method {{for the production of}} high performance particleboards. Tannin-based adhesive containing 2  % of cellulose nanofibers exhibits the best mechanical strength. Key messageThe addition of cellulose nanofibers into tannin-based adhesives notably enhanced the mechanical properties of the wood particleboards produced. The formulation containing 2  % (w/w) of cellulose nanofibers exhibited the best mechanical strength...|$|R
40|$|In Morocco, {{the olive}} {{industry}} produces great amounts of olive mill wastewater (OMW) yearly {{in a short}} period (250 000 m(3) of liquid wastes in four months, November-February). Phenolic compounds are largely responsible for the phytotoxicity and antimicrobial effects of OMW. Several studies have been carried out on biological and enzymatic treatments of OMW. However, the use of OMW to produce value-added products, e. g. mushroom cultivation, are less explored. This research aimed to select shiitake mushroom strains capable of growing on OMW, involving decolorization, removal of total <b>phenol,</b> and high <b>production</b> of mycelial biomass. Sixteen strains of Lentinula edodes were evaluated for their tolerance to OMW, apical growth rate, and biomass production on agar media. The highest biomass yields were recorded in four strains (Le 118, Le 119, Le 121, Le 122) grown in the presence of 20 % (v/v) OMW. The ability of these pre-selected strains to decolorize and to remove total phenol from OMW was then assessed in liquid culture, without nutritional supplements. The strain Le 119 of L edodes showed 65 % decolorization, and 75 % elimination of total phenol according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Laccase production was the main lignolytic activity observed, and one of its isoforms stained on native PAGE with p-phenylenediamine as substrate at pH 5. 0...|$|R
