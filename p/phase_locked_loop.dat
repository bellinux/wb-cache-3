25|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to}} the difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{one would}} likely insert other {{operations}} into the feedback of this phase-locked loop. [...] For example, if the <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> were {{to implement a}} frequency multiplier, the oscillator signal could be divided in frequency before it is compared to the reference signal.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the {{reference}} clock enters the chip and drives a <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> (PLL), which then drives the system's clock distribution. The clock distribution is usually balanced {{so that the}} clock arrives at every endpoint simultaneously. One of those endpoints is the PLL's feedback input. [...] The function of the PLL is to compare the distributed clock to the incoming reference clock, and vary the phase and frequency of its output until {{the reference}} and feedback clocks are phase and frequency matched.|$|E

40|$|Digital <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loops</b> are {{critical}} components of many communication, signal processing and control systems. This exciting new book covers {{various types of}} digital <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loops.</b> It presents a comprehensive coverage of {{a new class of}} digital <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loops</b> called the time delay tanlock loop (TDTL). It also details a number of architectures that improve the performance of the TDTL through adaptive techniques that overcome the conflicting requirements of the locking rage and speed of acquisition. These requirements are of paramount importance in many applications including wireless communications, consumer electronics and others. Digital <b>Phase</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>Loops</b> then illustrates the process of converting the TDTL class of digital <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loops</b> for implementation on an FPGA-based reconfigurable system. These devices are being utilized in software-defined radio, DSP-based designs and many other communication and electronic systems to implement complex high-speed algorithms. Their flexibility and reconfigurability facilitate rapid prototyping, on-the-fly upgradeability, and code reuse with minimum effort and complexity. The practical real-time results, of the various TDTL architectures, obtained from the reconfigurable implementations are compared with those obtained through simulations with MATLAB/Simulink. The material in this book will be valuable to researchers, graduate students, and practicing engineers...|$|R
2500|$|Analog {{phase locked}} loops are {{generally}} built with an analog phase detector, {{low pass filter}} and VCO placed in a negative feedback configuration. A digital <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> uses a digital phase detector; it may also have a divider in the feedback path or in the reference path, or both, {{in order to make}} the PLL's output signal frequency a rational multiple of the reference frequency. [...] A non-integer multiple of the reference frequency can also be created by replacing the simple divide-by-N counter in the feedback path with a programmable pulse swallowing counter. [...] This technique is usually referred to as a fractional-N synthesizer or fractional-N PLL.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{phase locked}} loops can be {{implemented}} in hardware, using integrated circuits such as a CMOS 4046. [...] However, with microcontrollers becoming faster, it may make sense to implement a <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> in software for applications {{that do not require}} locking onto signals in the MHz range or faster, such as precisely controlling motor speeds. [...] Software implementation has several advantages including easy customization of the feedback loop including changing the multiplication or division ratio between the signal being tracked and the output oscillator. [...] Furthermore, a software implementation is useful to understand and experiment with. [...] As an example of a phase-locked loop implemented using a phase frequency detector is presented in MATLAB, as this type of phase detector is robust and easy to implement. [...] This example uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point, as such an example is likely more useful in practice.|$|E

40|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> is a {{closed-loop}} system that causes one system to track with another. More precisely, a PLL can {{be perceived as}} a circuit synchronizing an output signal with a reference or input signal in frequency as well as <b>phase.</b> High-performance <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loops</b> are widely used within a digital system for clock generation, timing recovery, and to efficiently sequence operations and synchronize between function units and ICs As the digital system grows the role of <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> increases. Achieving low jitter and phase noise in <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> with less area and power consumption is challenging. The present research relates to characterization and redesign of individual blocks of <b>Phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> (PLL) to improve its characteristics. More specifically redesigning of individual blocks like: Phase Frequency Detector to reduce area and static phase error, Voltage to Current converter to linearly increase the current input to the current controlled oscillator, Current Controlled Oscillator to reduce phase noise, amplitude distortion, area and power consumption. We also introduce an additional feedback loop to increase the gain of the charge pump in a manner that linearizes the overall loop gain over wide bandwidth.

50|$|Doppler VOR beacons are {{inherently}} {{more accurate than}} Conventional VORs because they are less affected by reflections from hills and buildings. The variable signal in a DVOR is the 30 Hz FM signal; in a CVOR it is the 30 Hz AM signal. If the AM signal from a CVOR beacon bounces off a building or hill, the aircraft will see a phase {{that appears to be}} at the phase centre of the main signal and the reflected signal, and this phase centre will move as the beam rotates. In a DVOR beacon, the variable signal, if reflected, will seem to be two FM signals of unequal strengths and different phases. Twice per 30 Hz cycle, the instantaneous deviation of the two signals will be the same, and the <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> will get (briefly) confused. As the two instantaneous deviations drift apart again, the <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> will follow the signal with the greatest strength, which will be the line-of-sight signal. If the phase separation of the two deviations is small, however, the <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> will become less likely to lock on to the true signal for a larger percentage of the 30 Hz cycle (this will depend on the bandwidth of the output of the phase comparator in the aircraft). In general, some reflections can cause minor problems, but these are usually about an order of magnitude less than in a CVOR beacon.|$|E
