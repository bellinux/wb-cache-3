5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery {{has dropped to}} a <b>predetermined</b> <b>threshold</b> from full charge, a small {{naturally}} aspirated 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E
500|$|The Volt {{operates}} as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a <b>predetermined</b> <b>threshold</b> from full charge. From there its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a planetary gear set, and hence the output drive axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's regenerative braking also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 model year Volt all-electric range is , with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of [...] equivalent (MPG-equivalent).|$|E

We observed a naturally occurring metric (for {{the quality of the}} set of rejected hypothesis), which has an upper bound.

Once the set of rejected hypotheses is determined a related significance level and FDR should be reported.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust method {{based on the}} mod-i¿ed p-spectrum to detect heart beats in ECG signals, which is also {{referred}} as QRS detection in the literature. QRS de-tection is an old problem that has been studied for several decades. In the literature, there are many methods based on various forms of transformations and <b>thresholding,</b> which re-quire <b>predetermined</b> or ¿ne-tuned <b>thresholds.</b> Another class of existing methods are based on machine learning, which re-quire carefully labeled training data. In our study, we propose the modi¿ed p-spectrum for QRS detection, which does not require either <b>predetermined</b> <b>thresholds</b> or training data, and can operate in real-time. The proposed method is evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Index Terms — ECG, QRS detection 1...|$|R

Inspiratory and expiratory timings were fully automatically detected on ventilator pressure and Edi signals based on <b>predetermined</b> <b>thresholds</b> (0.5  μV for Edi amplitude). Asynchrony was quantified using the NeuroSync index, a global index considering both inspiratory and cycling-off errors. A higher NeuroSync index reflects worse asynchrony, and synchrony {{can be considered as}} poor when NeuroSync index exceeds 20 % [20, 21].|$|R

We found that a binary support vector machine classifier could be used to distinguish different types of lower-arm movements from stationary arms with 90 % accuracy overall. <b>Predetermined</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the accelerometer readings suffice to determine whether the tablet, and therefore the arm that rested on it, remained supported. Together, these two methods can allow mHealth applications to guide untrained patients (or health workers) in measuring blood pressure correctly. I...|$|R

Weighted {{two thirds of}} the mean of food expenditure and average DDS of the households in the upper quartile are used as <b>predetermined</b> <b>thresholds</b> to stratify households into different levels of food security. Thus, this study harmonizes the two indicators in order to classify households into four mutually exclusive levels of food security states. The levels include (1) households that are completely food insecure, (2) transitory food insecure based on FOODexp, although food secure based on DDS, (3) transitory food insecure based on DDS, although food secure based on FOODexp, and (4) completely food secure state as evident from both indicators.|$|R

However, currently available neural stimulation systems for standing employ patterns of constant activation and are unreactive to changing postural demands. Methods: In this work, we developed a closed-loop controller for detecting forward-directed body disturbances and initiating a stabilizing step in a person with spinal cord injury. Forward-directed pulls at the waist were detected with three body-mounted triaxial accelerometers. A finite state machine was designed and tested to trigger a postural response and apply stimulation to appropriate muscles so as to produce a protective step when the simplified jerk signal exceeded <b>predetermined</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Results: The controller effectively initiated steps for all perturbations with magnitude between 10 and 17. 5 s body weight, and initiated a postural response with occasional steps at 5...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel CAC {{algorithm}} {{that takes into}} account the mobility of users inside the cell with a focus on the downlink of third generation mobile systems. We first study the system capacity in a multiple cell setting and obtain effective bandwidth expressions for different calls as a function of both their positions in the cell as well as their classes of traffic (voice versus data). We then use this formulation to derive a mobility-based admission control algorithm which we analyze by Markov chains. We hence obtain several performance measures, namely the blocking probability, the dropping probability, both intra and inter-cell, as well as the overall cell throughput. We eventually investigate the performance of our CAC and show how to extend the Erlang capacity bounds, i. e., the set of arrival rates such that the corresponding blocking/dropping probabilities are kept below <b>predetermined</b> <b>thresholds.</b> ...|$|R
