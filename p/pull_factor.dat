5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a <b>pull</b> <b>factor</b> for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study aims at closing an inherent {{gap in the}} literature on research on private parks. Specifically, the aim of this study is threefold: (a) to identify the push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> that influence decisions to visit private parks; (b) to examine the differences in these push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> for different sociodemographic groups; and (c) to investigate the interrelationships among these push and pull fac-tors. Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (push factors) and evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (<b>pull</b> <b>factors).</b> The results of a factor analysis revealed three push <b>factors</b> and three <b>pull</b> <b>factors.</b> Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors.</b> This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

2500|$|Political Model: There are {{two main}} {{components}} to the Political Model. In the first case, there is the external [...] "Pull" [...] factor. The <b>Pull</b> <b>factor</b> suggests that the weak political bodies of Britain and Western Europe made for an attractive target for Viking raiders. The reasons for these weaknesses vary, but generally can be simplified into decentralized polities, or religious sites. As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. In the second case, there is the internal [...] "Push" [...] factor. The Push factor coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization {{of power in the}} modern day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.|$|E

40|$|In travel research, it is {{generally}} accepted that push factors are the motivations that prompt an individual to travel, and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> are those by which the individual is enticed by the attractiveness of the destination, once the decision to travel has been made. Having this been said, this research examined the motivations of international trophy hunters and why they chose to hunt in South Africa. The empirical data were collected {{by means of a}} postal survey. Two thousand self-administered questionnaires were distributed to overseas hunters who had previously visited South Africa to participate in a hunting safari. One hundred and ninety one questionnaires were suitable for the data analysis. Results of the principal component factor analysis yielded six push motivational dimensions that influenced an individual to participate in trophy hunting, and three pull motivational dimensions that encouraged hunters to hunt in South Africa. Multivariate analyses (MANOVA) were conducted to examine differences between the push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> across various socio-demographic characteristics. Where differences in the MANOVA were found, additional analyses were conducted to examine differences between push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> on the socio-demographic subgroups. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of interrelationships among push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> for socio-demographic factors. To address the objectives of the current study, five postulations were formulated. The first postulation revealed that personal, psychological needs and values, such as status, family, social interaction, exercise and challenge, were the main factors that push individuals to participate in trophy hunting. Postulation 2 indicated that a number of <b>factors</b> <b>pull</b> overseas hunters to hunt in South Africa namely, nature/scenery, fantasy and information sources - particularly recommendations by other hunters. The third postulation was confirmed namely that country of residence, age, gender, occupation and income have an influence on push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> of motivation. Postulation 4 partly confirmed that a positive relationship exists between a number of push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> of motivation. Lastly, postulation 5 verified that socio-demographics do have an influence on the relationship between push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> of motivation. Results of the study thus provide destination/tourism/marketing managers and/or professionals within the hunting industry with a better understanding of hunters' travel motivation and behavior...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on school}} dropout extends from early 20 th-century pioneers until now, marking trends of causes and prevention. However, {{specific}} dropout causes reported by students from several nationally representative studies {{have never been}} examined together, which, if done, {{could lead to a}} better understanding of the dropout problem. Push, pull, and falling out factors provide a framework for understanding dropouts.

Finally, falling out factors refer to disengagement in students not caused by school or outside <b>pulling</b> <b>factors.</b> Since 1966, most nationally representative studies depicted <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> as ranking the highest. Also, administrators in one study corroborated <b>pull</b> out <b>factors</b> for younger dropouts, not older ones, while most recent research cites push factors as highest overall.

It set up offices in towns in Ireland and Scotland, and agents went up and down the land pasting up attractive posters, giving lectures, handing out pamphlets and trying one-on-one to persuade farmers and laborers of the virtues of life in Canada. Although many people agreed to emigrate, the agents faced competition from the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, and opponents of emigration warned of hardship in Canada. The agents did not create 'emigration fever,' but they did tap into a sense of restlessness that, if nurtured, could result in a decision to emigrate.|$|E

James Quirk argues that under a TV sharing arrangement similar to the National Football League, or even under a split with visiting teams, the TV lure would be much less of an incentive for moves.|$|E
40|$|South Africa's {{national}} parks are one of South Africa's major attractions. Since visitors {{are among the most}} important role players in the sustainability of these parks, and in-depth research is needed to understand them, this article analyses the push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> that bring them to the parks. The study used a structured questionnaire to collect data on these factors and the socio-demographic profile of the visitors. Surveys conducted at nine National Parks produced 1300 questionnaires. The factor analysis identified two push and three <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> underlying visitors' motives for visiting the parks. Differences in the push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> for different socio-demographic subgroups were examined. It was clear that visitors are pushed to parks to relax, and pulled by nature as a product.

40|$|In recent years, {{self-employment}} {{has risen}} in several Western countries including Switzerland. The controversial {{discussion of this}} rise is attributable to shortcomings of empirical research, namely, {{to the lack of}} systematically considering, both at the macro- and the micro-level, the push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> that may account for entry into self-employment. Little is known about how macroeconomic forces together with individual-level push and <b>pull</b> <b>factors</b> shape transitions into self-employment. Even less is known about how these factors play out in occupationally segmented labour markets. This paper thus examines how the overall climate for setting up a business, individual job opportunities, and structural characteristics of labour-market positions affect transitions to self-employment in the occupationally segmented Swiss labour market. Based on two data sets, we run event history models. The Swiss Life History Study provides information on transitions into self-employment. With the Swiss Job Monitor, we construct indicators of the time-variant aggregate- and individual-level opportunities and incentives for setting up a business.
