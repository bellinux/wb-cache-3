There are individuals who cannot see red at all, {{and there are}} individuals who hear colors and taste words. What determines the differences and similarities between individuals' <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory? Can we characterize the neural and genetic bases {{as well as the}} environmental causes of variation in <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory? This thesis aimed to explore the range of variation in <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory, the neural basis of this variation and whether training can alter <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory, focusing on visual <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory. The overall conclusion from the research presented in this thesis is that individual differences in both visual <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory ability are reflected in brain function and structure in related networks to a certain degree. In addition, the results suggested that perceptual training paradigms have behavioral benefits and genes can influence the effect of perceptual training on brain function. To what extent differences in <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory abilities can be reliably predicted from brain function and structure at the individual level remains an open question for future research...|$|R

25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> behaviors directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{traditional}} view of <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> action {{makes two}} assumptions: that the causal flow between <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> action is primarily linear or one-way, {{and that they}} are merely instrumentally related to each other, so that each is a means to the other. Either or both of these assumptions can be rejected. Behaviorism rejects the instrumental but not the one-way aspect of the traditional view, thus leaving itself open to charges of verificationism. Ecological views reject the one-way aspect but not the instrumental aspect of the traditional view, so that <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> action are seen as instrumentally interdepend-ent. It is argued here that a better alternative is to reject both assumptions, resulting in a two-level interdependence view in which <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> action co-depend on dynamically circular subpersonal relations and as a result may be more than merely instrumentally interdependent. This is illustrated by reference to motor theories of <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> control theories of action. 1.

40|$|Abstract: Many neurophysiological {{studies in}} monkeys have {{indicated}} that visual motion information for the guidance of <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> smooth pursuit eye movements is-at an early stage-processed in the same visual pathway in the brain, crucially involving the middle temporal area (MT). However, these studies left some questions unanswered: Are <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> pursuit driven by the same or independent neuronal signals within this pathway? Are the perceptual interpretation of visual motion information and the motor response to visual signals limited by the same source of neuronal noise? Here, we review psychophysical studies that were motivated by these questions <b>and</b> compared <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> pursuit behaviorally in healthy human observers. We further review studies {{that focused on the}} interaction between <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> pursuit. The majority of results point to similarities between <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> pursuit, but dissociations were also reported. We discuss recent developments in this research area and conclude with suggestions for common and separate principles for the guidance of perceptual and motor responses to visual motion information.

25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies.

The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak of <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
