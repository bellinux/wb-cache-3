50|$|The {{hermetically}} sealed reed switch {{is a very}} common type of two <b>piece</b> <b>sensor</b> that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or normally closed when {{under the influence of}} a magnetic field {{as in the case of}} proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the design is normally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.|$|E

The only acceptable techniques at present are indirect methods based on measurement of correlated physical properties, particularly wood dielectric parameters.

40|$|Precise {{positioning}} of the laser beam on the work piece is crucial for high quality laser welds; e. g. for butt welding {{the focal point of}} the laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained within an accuracy better than 20 m - 150 m, depending on the focused beam radius. These stringent accuracy requirements call for high precision robots, a repeatable work piece profile and precise clamping. To compensate for insufficient repeatability of work piece or clamping, seam-tracking devices are used. A sensor measures the joint position and computes a correction vector to follow the actual joint trajectory. The deviation is compensated either by robot trajectory adjustment or by an additional tracking axis. Disadvantages of this approach are complex installation of the devices due to interfacing with the robot control, the need of teaching and calibrating the sensor and principle based accuracy restriction that limit the usability in more complex 2 d contours and with l ow accuracy robots. We recently introduced a more flexible and precise approach that utilizes an advanced camera-based sensor that is capable of measuring seam position, relative displacement between work <b>piece</b> and <b>sensor</b> and melt pool of the process with one single device.

40|$|Copyright © 2010 ISASTThis article {{presents}} findings from experiments into piano performance live electronics {{undertaken by the}} author since early 2007. The use of improvisation has infused {{every step of the}} process [...] -both as a methodology to obtain meaningful results using interactive technology and as a way to generate and characterize a collaborative musical space with composers. The technology used has included pre-built MIDI interfaces such as the PianoBar, actuators such as miniature DC motors and sensor interfaces including iCube and the Wii controller. Collaborators have included researchers at the Centre for Digital Music (QMUL), Richard Barrett, Pierre Alexandre Tremblay and Atau Tanaka. In seeking to create responsive “performance environments” at the piano, I explore live, performative control of electronics to create better connections for both performer (providing the same level of interpretive freedom as with a “pure” instrumental performance) and audience (communicating clearly to them). I have been lucky to witness first-hand many live interactive performances and to work with various empathetic composers/performers in flexible working environments. Collaborating with experienced technologists and musicians, I have witnessed time and again what, for me, is a fundamental truth in interactive instrumental performance: As a living, spontaneous form it must be nurtured and informed by the performer’s physicality and imagination as much as by the creativity or knowledge of the composer and/or technologist. Specifically in the case of sensors, their dependence on the detail of each person’s body and reactions is so refined as to necessitate, I would argue, an entirely collaborative approach and therefore one that involves at least directed improvisation and, more likely, fairly extensive improvised exploration. The fundamentally personal and intimate nature of sensor readings [...] -the amount of tension created by each performer, the shape of the ancillary gestures or the level of emotional involvement (especially relevant when using galvanic skin response or EEG) [...] -makes creating <b>pieces</b> with <b>sensors</b> extremely difficult for a composer to do in isolation. Improvisation therefore provides a way for performer and composer to generate a common musical and gestural language.

40|$|Currently, {{due to the}} {{widespread}} use of computers and the internet, students are trading libraries for the World Wide Web and laboratories with simulation programs. In most courses, simulators are made available to students and can be used to proof theoretical results or to test a developing hardware/product. Although this is an interesting solution: low cost, easy and fast way to perform some courses work, it has indeed major disadvantages. As everything is currently being done with/in a computer, the students are loosing the “feel” of the real values of the magnitudes. For instance in engineering studies, and mainly in the first years, students need to learn electronics, algorithmic, mathematics and physics. All of these areas can use numerical analysis software, simulation software or spreadsheets and in the majority of the cases data used is either simulated or random numbers, but real data could be used instead. For example, if a course uses numerical analysis software and needs a dataset, the students can learn to manipulate arrays. Also, when using the spreadsheets to build graphics, instead of using a random table, students could use a real dataset based, for instance, in the room temperature and its variation across the day. In this work we present a framework which uses a simple interface allowing it to be used by different courses where the computers are the teaching/learning process in order to give a more realistic feeling to students by using real data. A framework is proposed based on a set of low cost sensors for different physical magnitudes, e. g. temperature, light, wind speed, which are connected to a central server, that the students have access with an Ethernet protocol or are connected directly to the student computer/laptop. These sensors use the communication ports available such as: serial ports, parallel ports, Ethernet or Universal Serial Bus (USB). Since a central server is used, the students are encouraged to use sensor values results in their different courses and consequently in different types of software such as: numerical analysis tools, spreadsheets or simply inside any programming language when a dataset is needed. In order to do this, small pieces of hardware were developed containing at least one sensor using different types of computer communication. As long as the sensors are attached in a server connected to the internet, these tools can also be shared between different schools. This allows sensors that aren't available in a determined school to be used by getting the values from other places that are sharing them. Another remark is that students in the more advanced years and (theoretically) more know how, can use the courses that have some affinities with electronic development to build new <b>sensor</b> <b>pieces</b> and expand the framework further. The final solution provided is very interesting, low cost, simple to develop, allowing flexibility of resources by using the same materials in several courses bringing real world data into the students computer works...|$|R
