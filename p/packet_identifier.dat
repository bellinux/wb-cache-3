QoS Measurements provide a suitable way to proof {{the fulfillment of}} the given guarantees. During service usage the traffic of interest is already present in the network. This traffic can be utilized for passive (non-intrusive) measurement methods avoiding the disadvantages of sending test traffic for active (intrusive) measurements. Some applications (e. g. interactive applications like IP telephony) rely on guarantees for one-way metrics like one-way delay. One-way metrics usually cannot be derived from round trip measurements. Therefore specific methods are required to measure one-way metrics. In this paper we evaluate the necessary building blocks for passive one-way-delay measurement. In p articular we discuss different functions for the generation of <b>packet</b> <b>identifiers</b> needed to correlate packet arrivals at the ingress and egress measurement point. We have implemented a flexible and modular meter, which allows us to use and compare different functions for the packet ID generation.

50|$|DigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at {{the same}} time. The primary {{difference}} between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only <b>packet</b> <b>identifier</b> 8187 for its master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream {{with the concept of}} a virtual channel number, whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate program numbers from those used in other transport streams. There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual channel remapping using logical channel numbers. Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times.|$|E
50|$|This {{optional}} table may group {{transport stream}} identifiers into a network, providing access parameters and other details. ITU-T Rec. H.222 and ISO/IEC 13818-1 do not define the NIT structure. The European Broadcasting Union DVB specification ETSI EN 300 468 (DVB-SI) does. The purpose of mentioning but not defining this table in H.222 {{is that it}} has reserved program number 0 (zero) in the PAT. The Table ID extension is used to identify the local network together with a directory listing of transport streams. Descriptors are used to list the modulation, source of those streams and programs. The original network identifier is meant to allow transport streams and programs on foreign networks {{to be included in the}} local network which allows no remapping of transport and program IDs that may be duplicated between networks. The DVB specification defines the transport <b>packet</b> <b>identifier</b> as 16 and the table identifier of the local network of transports as 64. A table identifier of 65 is for a foreign network of transports. The network identifiers are maintained via DVB Services who have separated the identifiers into two unique, yet unnecessary groupings of Network_ID and Original_Network_ID. The two groupings have a large number of overlapping entries.|$|E
40|$|A broad {{spectrum}} of network measurement applications demand for multipoint, measurements; e. g. one-way delay measurements or packets path tracing. A passive multipoint measurement, technique is realized by generating a timestamp and a <b>packet</b> <b>identifier</b> (1 D) for each packet traversing an observation point and sending this information to a collector. The packet 1 D can be provided by using parts of the packet, or generating a digest, of the packet, content. Multipoint, measurements demand for high resource measurement infrastructure. Random packet, selection techniques can reduce the resource consumption while still maintaining sufficient information about most metrics. Nevertheless random packet, selection cannot, be used for multipoint measurements, because the packets selection decisions on its path can differ. Hash-based selection is a deterministic passive multipoint measurement technique that emulates random selection and enables the correlation of a selected subset of packets at, different, measurement, points. The selection decision {{is based on a}} hash value over invariant parts of the packet. When hash-based selection is applied two hash values are generated - one on which the selection decision is based and a second one that, is used m the packet 1 D. In a previous paper we already evaluated hash functions for hash-based selection. In this paper we analyze hi hash functions for packet 1 D generation. Other authors recommend the use of two different hash values for both operations - we show that in certain scenarios it is more efficient to use only one hash value...|$|E

40|$|VOEvent {{defines the}} content and meaning of a {{standard}} information packet for representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of interest. The objective is to motivate the observation of targets-of-opportunity, to drive robotic telescopes, to trigger archive searches, and to alert the community. VOEvent {{is focused on the}} reporting of photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported. Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero or more of the "who, what, where, when & how" of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a "why") regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups. VOEvent <b>packets</b> gain persistent <b>identifiers</b> and are typically stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed quickly.

Using the synthesis method presented in [1], we synthesize an alternating bit protocol that is nonmasking faulttolerant; i. e., when faults occur the program guarantees recovery to its invariant. However, during recovery, the nonmasking fault-tolerant protocol may temporarily violate it safety specification. The alternating bit protocol (ABP). The fault-intolerant program consists of two processes: a sender and a receiver. The sender reads from an infinite input stream of data packets and sends the newly read packet to the receiver. The receiver copies each received packet into an infinite output stream. When the sender sends a data packet, it waits for an acknowledgement from the receiver before it sends the next packet. Also, when the receiver receives a new data packet, it sends an acknowledgment bit back to the sender. A one-bit message header suffices to identify the data packet currently being sent since at every moment there exists at most one unacknowledged data <b>packet.</b> Using this <b>identifier</b> bit, the sender (respectively, the receiver) does not need count {{the total number of}} packets sent (respectively, received). Both processes have read/write access to a send channel and a receive channel. The send channel is represented by an integer variable cs and the variable cr models the receive channel.

The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet?
