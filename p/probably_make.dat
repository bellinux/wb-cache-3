FIFA had insisted at the time of the incident that, since selection of referees for the World Cup referee was based on long-term assessments, Hansson would <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> it to the finals. UEFA president Michel Platini called it a good decision, defending Hansson as having not been responsible for the incident as he had not seen the handball.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} built by the {{contractor}} Philipp Holzmann with construction starting in 1883. The Central-Bahnhof Frankfurt was finally opened on 18 August 1888. Right {{on the evening of}} the opening day, a train ran over the buffer stop and the locomotive was damaged. Over {{the course of the next}} few years, the area to the east of the new station, the Bahnhofsviertel, was built; it was completed around 1900. Until the completion of Leipzig Hauptbahnhof in 1915, Frankfurt station was the largest in Europe. As of today (2014), the 24 platforms with 26 tracks on one level <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> it the world's largest one-level railway hall.|$|E

500|$|Hutton's {{assessment}} {{was shared by}} historian Owen Davies; {{in his study of}} English cunning-folk, he described Liddell's stories as [...] "seductive but entirely unsubstantiated". Instead, he maintained that Pickingill was [...] "a simple rural cunning-man whose small world of village affairs never crossed with that of middle-class occultists. He received a Christian burial and the idea that he was a pagan priest would <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> him turn in his grave." [...] While agreeing with Maple's assessment that Pickingill was [...] "one of the last practising cunning-folk in the country", Maple noted that—unlike Murrell, James Tuckett, John Wrightson, and William Brewer—Pickingill was not a [...] "major regional figure" [...] in the profession.|$|E

500|$|The game's audio {{was created}} by Martin Stig Andersen, a {{graduate}} from the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus. Andersen's specialisation was in acousmatic music, non-traditional music created from generated sounds that have no apparent visual source. He was drawn to work with Jensen on the game after seeing the initial trailer, having been drawn in by the expressions of the boy character; Andersen compared the early visuals to his acousmatic music: [...] "you have something recognizable and realistic, {{but at the same}} time it's abstract". Andersen sought to create acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game's environments. Two examples he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon [...] "HOTEL" [...] sign, and silencing the wind sound as the spider approached the boy in the forest. Andersen avoided the use of easily recognizable sounds, distorting them when needed as to allow players to interpret the sounds' meanings for themselves. Andersen constructed most of the game's sounds through a number of [...] "grains" [...] instead of longer sound loops, allowing him to adjust the playback to give better feedback to the player without sounding repetitious; one example he cites was the use of separate sounds for the boy's toe and heel when they make contact with the ground, giving a more realistic sound for movement. Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in Limbo, but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions; the acousmatic music was intended to leave room for interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game's art and story. Andersen noted that this helps with immersion within the game by making no attempt to control the emotional tone; [...] "if [...] scared it will <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> them more scared when there's no music to take them by the hand and tell them how to feel". Due to fans' requests, Playdead released the game's soundtrack on iTunes Store on 11 July 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{biographies of}} the saints called the Acta Sanctorum which were {{preserved}} at the Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy {{it is said that}} he was born about 681, either in Devon or Cornwall, or more probably at Chidham, near Bosham, about 25 miles from Steyning. [...] A birth in Chidham at that date would place him in the right time and area to be preached to by Saint Wilfrid, the Apostle of Sussex (680–685), and would <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> Wilfrid the man who converted and baptised Cuthmann and his parents.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reviews for}} the album in the US ranged from {{negative}} to tentatively positive. Billboards reviewer {{called it an}} [...] "exciting, well-produced LP" [...] with [...] "two superb instrumental cuts", and highlighted the [...] "strong single potential" [...] of [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice". By contrast, the reception from music journalists in the UK was highly favourable. Penny Valentine of Disc and Music Echo admired it as [...] "Thirteen tracks of Brian Wilson genius... The whole LP is far more romantic than the usual Beach Boys jollity: sad little wistful songs about lost love and found love and all-around love." [...] Writing in Record Mirror, Norman Jopling reported that the LP had been [...] "widely praised", yet he predicted: [...] "It will <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> their present fans like them even more, but it's doubtful whether it will make them any new ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a 1984 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment {{expresses a}} far more skeptical and {{cautious}} approach, stating that as the hypothesis is not scientifically convincing. The report predicted that Soviet nuclear policy would be to maintain their strategic nuclear posture, such as their fielding of the high throw-weight SS-18 missile and they would merely attempt to exploit the hypothesis for propaganda purposes, such as directing scrutiny on the US portion of the nuclear arms race. Moreover, {{it goes on to}} express the belief that if Soviet officials did begin to take nuclear winter seriously, it would <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> them demand exceptionally high standards of scientific proof for the hypothesis, as the implications of it would undermine their military doctrine—a level of scientific proof which perhaps could not be met without field experimentation. The un-redacted portion of the document ends with the suggestion that substantial increases in Soviet Civil defense food stockpiles might be an early indicator that Nuclear Winter was beginning to influence Soviet upper [...] thinking.|$|E
2500|$|Webcomics {{have been}} seen by some artists as a {{potential}} new path towards syndication in newspapers, but attempts have rarely proven lucrative. According to Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content), [...] "there's no real money" [...] in syndication for webcomic artists. For instance Jeffrey Rowland uploaded his webcomics to the internet {{in order to gain}} constructive criticism after being rejected from various syndicates in 1999, but eventually found that he didn't need to get his work syndicated when he started selling merchandise of his webcomic Wigu. To The Boston Globe, Rowland said that [...] "if a syndicate came to me and offered me a hundred newspapers, I would probably say no... I'd <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> less money, with more work." [...] When Diesel Sweeties found syndication by United Media in 2007, its creator Richard Stevens still made 80% of his income through his website. Other webcomic creators, such as R. K. Milholland (Something Positive) and Michael Terracciano (Dominic Deegan), wouldn't be able to syndicate their work in newspaper because they fill up a specific niche and wouldn't be accepted by a broader audience. Some webcartoonists have proven more successful with newspaper syndication since: in 2015, Dana Simpson syndicated her webcomic Phoebe and Her Unicorn through Universal Uclick to over 100 newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|David Zucker, {{who was a}} fan of Cannibal!, {{contacted}} the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for Seagram to show at a party for their acquisition of Universal Studios. Due to a misunderstanding, Parker and Stone improvised much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of 1950s instructional videos. The result, Your Studio and You, features numerous celebrities, including Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, and Steven Spielberg. [...] "You could <b>probably</b> <b>make</b> a feature film out {{of the experience of}} making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg", Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the two. During the time between shooting the pilots for Time Warped, Parker penned the script for a film titled Orgazmo, which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western media. Independent distributor October Films purchased the rights to the film for one million dollars after its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which resulted in the poor box office performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes. The duo later theorized that the organization cared less because it was an independent distributor which would bring it significantly less money.|$|E
