5000|$|Other {{geographic}} {{features are}} used, {{such as a}} small pond to represent a lake, rocks for boulders, or tunnels through [...] "mountains" [...] or under <b>stairways.</b> <b>Tunnels</b> can be a particular challenge, because everything from cats to raccoons and more like to hide in them, particularly {{to get out of}} the rain or heat, sometimes even to sleep, nest, or hibernate. A derailment inside a tunnel can also be permanent if careful planning is not done to ensure that it can be reached by access panels (trapdoors) or at arm's length from either end.|$|R

Their services include the handling of mail and passenger baggage, transportation of cargo, aerobridge operations and the operation of <b>passenger</b> <b>stairways.</b> The airport has an advanced baggage handling system (BHS), the main section of which {{is located in the}} basement level of the passenger terminal, and a separate remote transfer facility at the western end of the main concourse for the handling of tight connection transfer bags.|$|R
50|$|Guimerà {{is noted}} for its well-preserved mediaeval layout and {{limestone}} buildings, which are densely clustered together on the hillside, linked by narrow streets, <b>stairways,</b> and <b>tunnels.</b> Much of the town wall and several of its gates still remain.|$|R
50|$|On 24 September 2010, Greenwich Council {{closed the}} Woolwich foot tunnel to all users, due to {{structural}} weaknesses {{discovered in the}} <b>stairways</b> and <b>tunnel</b> itself. The tunnel was originally expected to re-open in August 2011, but this target was missed.|$|R
50|$|The 0.7 acre {{listed area}} was defined {{to include the}} two {{stations}} and their immediate surroundings, but to exclude a <b>passenger</b> cross-over and <b>stairway,</b> and to exclude associated parking areas.|$|R
50|$|Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz, and Al Capone—who was a {{frequent}} guest of the Sellback—stayed at the hotel, often for clandestine poker games. One story from the 1920s involves Al Capone sneaking out {{through a series of}} secret <b>stairways</b> and <b>tunnels</b> when Louisville Police broke up one of these games. Hotel staff are frequently eager to show the Al Capone room (if it is unoccupied) and give its history.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{designed}} by Adalbert Niklewicz, {{is a normal}} side platform station, built in tunnel. A large volume serves as the transept, with {{three of the four}} platform <b>stairways</b> in enclosed <b>tunnels.</b> The mezzanine serves two entrances, one {{on each side of the}} Autoroute Métropolitaine, and both integrated into buildings; the northern access has doors both in front of and behind the building.|$|R
50|$|Structures {{currently}} still surviving at Rosherville Gardens are, The Grade 2 Listed Bear Pit, The Grade 2 Listed Clifftop Entrance and <b>tunnelled</b> <b>stairway</b> {{through the}} cliff, the unique Hermit Cave forming a nice chalk grotto, the Italian Garden central feature which also formed {{part of the}} Broadwalk and the Grade 2 Listed Enigmatic Cavern, Drawdock and Quay which was the river entrance to the gardens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Passengers</b> {{must use}} <b>stairways</b> {{connecting}} an overhead open walkway {{to access the}} different platforms of the station, making it inaccessible to passengers with mobility impairments. The Council's 'Regeneration Strategy for Wolverton' aimed {{to build a new}} station in the original position. In reality, work began on the new station in the present car park in Summer 2011 and was completed in Summer 2013.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously I {{crept up}} the <b>stairway</b> to the <b>tunnel's</b> end, and peering out saw the broad plain of Phutra before me. The {{numerous}} lofty, granite towers which mark the several entrances to the subterranean city {{were all in}} front of me--behind, the plain stretched level and unbroken to the nearby foothills. I {{had come to the}} surface, then, beyond the city, and my chances for escape seemed much enhanced.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the landing at Thanet of Major Henry Percy of the 14th Dragoon Guards, on 21 June 1815 with the captured French eagle standard taken at Waterloo, a <b>tunnel</b> <b>stairway</b> from the beach to the fields on the cliff tops above was excavated, and christened [...] "Waterloo Stairs" [...] to commemorate the event. Broadstairs was supposedly the first town in England to learn of this historic victory, although there is no written evidence of this.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} October 2013 and reuses an old vault under the {{railroad}} bridges as the lobby area. The vault {{was built in}} the 1920s as a potential commuter rail station by the Van Sweringen brothers and was composed of <b>passenger</b> <b>tunnels</b> and <b>stairways.</b> As part of the construction, a new headhouse, entrance plaza, and platform were built, an elevator installed, and two transit track bridges were rehabilitated. In addition, multiple pieces of public art were installed in the station and new concrete sidewalks, landscaping, and lighting were added as well as repairs made to the bridge abutment.|$|R
5000|$|Dark Star Park was {{commissioned}} by Arlington County, Virginia in 1979, in conjunction with an urban-renewal project. [...] Construction of the work began in 1984. Holt worked with an architect, landscape architect, engineers and real estate developers on the project. [...] The artwork is at once a park and a sculpture. Built on two-thirds of an acre of land where a run-down, old gas station and warehouse once stood, Holt transformed the space. [...] The park consists of five spheres, two pools, four steel poles, a <b>stairway,</b> a large <b>tunnel</b> for passage, a smaller tunnel for viewing only and plantings of crown vetch, winter creeper, willow oak, and earth and grass.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was built}} under the Byzantine Empire, {{and in the}} 11th century became the western outpost of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (1080-1375). It had the {{function}} to safeguard the caravans from holdup robberies that were stopping over at the last caravanserai Alarahan on the Silk Road to the sea, situated 300 - 400 m in the south. The castle incorporates a citadel inside the outer walls. The castle's inside is reached by some 180-step <b>stairway,</b> which is <b>tunneled</b> in the rock. Around {{the middle of the}} stairway, a deepening opens to a cistern. In the citadel, a palace, accommodation facilities for the garrison, a mosque and a bath are among the ruins.|$|R
50|$|When the Cleveland Transit System Rapid Transit was {{constructed}} in the early 1950s, it used the original right-of-way laid out for the Van Sweringen brothers' rapid transit system in 1928. The original right-of-way included <b>passenger</b> <b>tunnels</b> and <b>stairways</b> at Mayfield Road (U.S. Route 322), but CTS decided not to place a station there because the buses running on Mayfield Road were those of Redifer Bus Co., not CTS, and CTS {{did not want to}} provide an interconnection for a competing bus line.Therefore, the Mayfield station was eliminated in favor of the Euclid-East 120th station. The station opened {{with the opening of the}} CTS Rapid Transit on the east side on March 15, 1955.|$|R
50|$|The fort {{was greatly}} {{expanded}} in the 17th century. The fort {{played a part}} in preventing French Protestants from leaving France following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The fort was burned in 1815 by Austrian forces and reconstructed in following years. The upper fort was built, linked to the lower fort by a <b>tunneled</b> <b>stairway</b> with 1165 steps. By 1860 Savoy became a permanent part of France and the fort was no longer of importance in controlling the frontier. During World War I the fort served as a military training center. In the 1930s the fort was incorporated into French frontier fortifications as a contingency against a German incursion through Switzerland. However, the Germans ultimately arrived from the west, rather than the east.|$|R
