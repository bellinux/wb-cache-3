5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the <b>provincial</b> <b>constitution.</b> Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would lose in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner ran for {{governor}} of Santa Cruz in 1991. Although he received only 30 percent of the vote, below the 36 percent of the UCR, he was elected due to the Ley de Lemas that added the votes for the Peronist faction of Puricelli to his own. When Kirchner took office, Santa Cruz was experiencing an economic crisis, with high unemployment and a budget deficit equal to 1.2 billion pesos, which amounted to {{an equal number of}} U.S. dollars because of the Convertibility plan. He expanded the number of provincial Supreme Court justices from three members to five and appointed three judges loyal to him; this gave him control of the provincial judiciary. Kirchner was criticized for preventing the investigation of corruption cases. Santa Cruz received 535 million pesos in oil royalties in 1993, which Kirchner deposited in a foreign bank. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution proposed by the Peronist president Carlos Menem. Kirchner voted against the amendment that would allow the reelection of the president, which was approved. Locally, he proposed an amendment to the <b>provincial</b> <b>constitution</b> authorizing indefinite reelection of the governor. Menem and Kirchner were reelected to their respective offices in 1995. Kirchner established a faction in the PJ opposing Menem's neoliberal economic policies, but Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the populous Buenos Aires province, ignored him and rallied a stronger opposition to Menem within the PJ.|$|E

500|$|Duhalde {{intended}} {{to run for}} the presidency in 1995, after Menem's term in office. Menem promoted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution, which allowed him to run for a second presidential term. Unable to defeat Menem in the primary elections, Duhalde promoted an amendment of the <b>provincial</b> <b>constitution,</b> to allow reelection as well. The PJ could not secure the majority of the constituent chamber, and the three opposing parties (the UCR, the Broad Front and the MODIN) joined forces in a [...] "triple alliance" [...] to prevent the sanction of the re-election. Eventually, the MODIN changed sides and supported the re-election, on the condition that a provincial referendum approved it. The referendum allowed the re-election of Duhalde, who won the main elections as well. Menem was also re-elected in the 1995 general elections. Duhalde increased his criticism of Menem, stating that he should leave the neoliberal policies and head a government closer to the Peronist doctrines.|$|E

5000|$|The Convocation of York was a {{relatively}} {{small part of the}} Church in England and Wales with only five member dioceses in Henry VIII's reign. In 1462 it decided that all the <b>provincial</b> <b>constitutions</b> [...] of Canterbury which were not repugnant or prejudicial to its own should be allowed in the Northern Province and by 1530 the Archbishop of York rarely attended sessions and the custom that York waited to see what Canterbury had decided and either accepted or rejected it was well established. The Convocation of York was, in practice, taking second place to that of Canterbury so much so that in 1852 the Archbishop of York Thomas Musgrave stated that since the time of Henry VIII the archbishop had only attended personally two sessions (in 1689 and 1708).|$|R
5000|$|The Constitutional Court {{rejected}} {{a number of}} clauses, but the main objection was a provision that provided {{for members of the}} provincial parliament to be elected from multiple-member geographical constituencies, as opposed to the party-list proportional representation prescribed by the national constitution. The national <b>constitution</b> allows <b>provincial</b> <b>constitutions</b> to contain different [...] "legislative or executive structures and procedures", but the court ruled that an electoral system was not a [...] "legislative structure" [...] and that the province did not have the power to vary the electoral system. The court also objected to provisions which placed the responsibility for administering provincial oaths of office on the Judge President of the Western Cape High Court rather than the President of the Constitutional Court; as judges are national officials, the provincial legislature did not have the power to alter their responsibilities.|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of mechanisms of direct democracy in Latin America {{took place in}} a context of a serious crisis of political legitimacy which was especially acute during the last decades of the 20 th and the first one of the 21 st century. In Argentina mechanisms of direct democracy on the national level were introduced during the constitutional reforms of 1994 - although in a very limited way, addressing parliament. On the sub-national level where the provinces and municipalities have more leeway the picture looks somewhat different. In the present working paper we identify the main characteristics of Argentina's instruments of direct democracy on the sub-national level (provinces and municipalities), analyse their main institutional designs and make a beginning for an exploratory analysis on how these mechanisms are put into practice in the provinces. The analysis makes use of data elaborated from all <b>provincial</b> <b>constitutions</b> and 135 municipal charters...|$|R

50|$|Stratford's Canterbury {{register}} has not survived, but a {{large number}} of his acta can be gleaned from other sources. He was a notable legislator, drawing up detailed ordinances for the conduct of the court of Canterbury in 1342, while three sets of <b>provincial</b> <b>constitutions,</b> issued between 1341 and 1343, are attributed to him. The first set was clearly a draft, the second is particularly concerned with ecclesiastical administration and discipline, while the third was designed to preserve church liberties and deals with areas of friction between laymen and ecclesiastics. He was a notable benefactor to the hospital of St Thomas the Martyr at Canterbury, known as Eastbridge Hospital, but his efforts were principally directed towards his native Stratford, where he founded a chantry college with the same dedication. The initial foundation (1331) was for a warden, sub-warden, and three priests, but in 1336 an augmentation allowed for a further eight priests, though whether the full complement was ever achieved is uncertain. He secured the appropriation of the parish church to the foundation and a papal bull of confirmation was issued in 1345.|$|R

40|$|El presente trabajo analiza la evolución en la normativa provincial respecto al funcionamiento de las Cortes Supremas provinciales de Argentina (como por ejemplo la duración del mandato, el tamaño de las cortes, las garantías constitucionales de los jueces y los mecanismos de designación y remoción). El {{principal}} objetivo es determinar de qué forma el diseño institucional condiciona la relación entre los poderes del Estado. El estudio se basa en un relevamiento exhaustivo de todas las constituciones provinciales vigentes desde 1983 hasta 2009, así como también de la normativa provincial de esos años. Los principales resultados de la investigación revelan que los cambios en el diseño institucional relacionados con el funcionamiento de las Cortes Supremas generalmente han incrementado el grado de vulnerabilidad del accionar de dichas instituciones frente a los otros poderes del Estado. This research {{presents the}} historical {{analysis of the}} rules and norms that regulate {{the functioning of the}} argentine provincial Supreme Courts (such as the tenure system, size of the courts, justice's constitutional rights, and the appointment and removal system).

40|$|The {{broader context}} of this study {{constitutes}} the continuous pressure and strain the dominant society often put on the culture, livelihood and self-determination of indigenous peoples, {{but also on the}} increased international recognition and formalisation of indigenous rights emerging the last few decades. The Mapuce reality is no exception. This thesis focuses on the Mapuce right-claimers as possible change makers in a context of many constraints through exploring different processes of claiming spaces of resistance in a quest for realising indigenous citizenship rights. More specifically, this thesis aims to explore the challenges, strategies of resistance and possibilities for change {{in the course of a}} diverse and complex struggle for rights. The research is based on a two and a half month qualitative fieldwork in Neuquén, Argentina from June to August 2010. During this period, I established a close relationship with many of the research participants conducting in-depth interviews, innumerable informal conversations and participant observation. Based on the information acquired, I found that one of the most profound challenges facing the Mapuce is the discriminative social structure on which the Argentine state has been established. A lack of will prevents real implementation of the rights concerning indigenous peoples recognised in federal and <b>provincial</b> <b>constitutions.</b> The study furthermore shows that despite of these obstacles, the Mapuce right-claimers have found ways to wiggle around them. In the absence of effective participation in invited spaces, they practise a variety of strategies in order to claim their own spaces of resistance. Recuperation of land and large demonstration constitute parts of this political engagement, but more longterm strategies such as organisation, collaboration and capacity building is the crucial foundation on which their struggle depends. By combining individual and generational knowledgeabilities, in addition to drawing on those of others, I suggest that the Mapuce position themselves better in terms of their possibilities for acquiring change.  </p...|$|R
