5000|$|Outcasts {{graphics}} engine is mainly {{a combination of}} a ray casting (heightmap) engine, used to render the landscape, and a texture mapping <b>polygon</b> <b>engine</b> used to render objects. The [...] "Engine Programming" [...] section of the credits in the manual has several subsections related to graphics, among them: [...] "Landscape Engine", [...] "Polygon Engine", [...] "Water & Shadows Engine" [...] and [...] "Special effects Engine". Although Outcast is often cited as a forerunner of voxel technology, this is somewhat misleading. The game does not actually model three-dimensional volumes of voxels. Instead, it models the ground as a surface, which may be seen as being made up of voxels. The ground is decorated with objects that are modeled using texture-mapped polygons. When Outcast was developed, the term [...] "voxel engine", when applied to computer games, commonly referred to a ray casting engine (for example the Voxel Space engine). On the engine technology page of the games website, the landscape engine is also referred to as the [...] "Voxels engine". The engine is purely software-based; it does not rely on hardware-acceleration via a 3D graphics card.|$|E

50|$|In a {{computer}} graphics, draw distance (render distance or view distance) is the maximum distance {{of objects in}} a three-dimensional scene that are drawn by the rendering <b>engine.</b> <b>Polygons</b> that lie beyond the draw distance will not be drawn to the screen.|$|R
5000|$|We had {{to invent}} a new {{technology}} for the characters. We went back to voxel technology and {{used it as a}} launching pad. What we are using is not voxels, but sort of 'voxels plus.' We use voxels to do the three-dimensional rotations, transformations, and projections that create the character, but we actually use a very fast <b>polygon</b> rendering <b>engine</b> to render the polygons to the screen. By not having to have a voxel model that is so dense that every pixel is a voxel, we were able to achieve much higher frame rates with much more polygons on the screen and have lots of characters.|$|R
5000|$|GFA Basic {{was widely}} used to quickly create editors by game developers. For example, Éric Chahi wrote a game editor in GFA basic {{to create his}} game Another World, {{including}} scene design and game scripting; only the game <b>engine</b> (<b>polygon</b> rendering and music) was done in assembler. This editor was used to make all ports of the game, including for consoles and the Collector Edition for Windows released in 2006. Similarly, Karsten Köper of Thalion software wrote all the basic game editing software for the [...] "Amberstar" [...] series using GFA Basic.|$|R

Like his namesake Calamus, iCalamus {{supports}} real virtual copies of frames, {{where there is no}} mother-child relation; all virtual frames change at the same time. All layout elements can be adjusted infinitely transparent. For creating masks and textflow <b>polygons,</b> a Tracer <b>engine</b> is integrated. iCalamus supports all PDF blend modes. The print output does not convert or touch ICC profiles of imported images. iCalamus is the first DTP application to support the LinkBack protocol which allows to plug external applications like plug-ins or modules into the GUI of the software.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) are optimization techniques which {{imitate the}} way that nature selects the best individuals (the best adaptation to the environment) to create descendants which are more highly adapted. The {{first step is to}} generate a random initial population, where each individual is represented by a character chain like a chromosome and with the greatest diversity, so that this population has the widest range of characteristics. Each individual represents a solution for the targeted problem. Then, each individual is evaluated using a fitness function, which indicates the quality of each individual. Finally, the best-adapted individuals are selected to generate a new population, whose average will be nearer to the desired solution. This new population is created making use of three operators: selection, crossover and mutation. One of the major aspects of GA is their ability to be parallelised. Indeed, because natural evolution deals with an entire population and not only with particular individuals, it is a remarkably highly parallel process. Nowadays computer systems incorporate powerful graphic cards that are commonly idle during a normal execution process of most of the optimization algorithms. Modern graphic cards use a pipelined streaming architecture to perform {{a significant part of the}} rendering process. Two stages in the pipelined process are programmable in current graphics hardware. The vertex engine is used to perform transformations on the vertex attributes (normal, position, color, texture, [...] .). On the other hand, the fragment engine is used to transform the fragments that form the different <b>polygons.</b> Both <b>engines</b> are extremely parallel, processing several elements in parallel and making extensive use of SIMD units. In this work we have presented a parallel implementation of a GA using a GPU. We have implemented not only three well know benchmarks problems with excellent Speed-up results, but also a novel implementation of an algorithm for solving defectives problems proposed in the literature. ...|$|R
5000|$|Each cube-shaped node in the octree {{represents}} a renderable volume, or {{a type of}} Marching cube, which {{are referred to as}} a cube, where each edge of this cube can be lengthened or shortened to deform the cube into a variety of other shapes. Corners of cubes can also be [...] "pushed" [...] or [...] "pulled" [...] to create crude curves. The {{what you see is what}} you get realtime editing has enabled level designers to add a lot of detail to maps, while reducing the time spent on actual creation. This is in contrast to traditional modern <b>polygon</b> soup 3D <b>engines</b> which take a model generated as an essentially random batch of triangles from an external modelling program and attempt to spatially subdivide the models triangles after the fact by splitting them to fit into tree structures, such as a BSP tree or even an octree, that require costly pre-processing to build. Cube 2s novelty thus lies in that the world representation is the octree, or Marching cubes, structure itself, from which efficient triangle batches are generated for the graphics processing unit to render, without need for expensive and time-consuming pre-processing.|$|R
