40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was the synthesis and study of the configuration of various 4 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidones and 3 -methyl pyrrolidines. Then, by using the steric energies and coupling constants to figure out the Karplus-equation constant of 5 -member ring heterocyclic compounds. ^ Initially, attempts were made to prepare a number of methyl- 4 -alkylamino- 3 -methyl- 2 -butenoates, stable as the hydrochloride, by the reaction of methyl- 4 -bromo- 3 -methyl- 2 -butenoate with a series of amines. The unsaturated amino ester was readily reduced to the corresponding methyl- 4 -alkylamino- 3 -methyl-butyrate hydrochloride. Methyl- 4 -t-butylamino- 3 -methyl-butyrate was hydrolyzed to 4 -t-butylamino- 3 -methyl-butyric acid. When the hydrolyzation procedure was applied to methyl- 4 -cyclohexyl- 3 -methyl-butyrate, the desirable amino-acid, along with 2 -pyrrolidone, was collected in a 1 : 2 ratio. When methyl- 4 -benzylamino- 3 -methylbutyrate was hydrolyzed, the only product was 1 -benzyl- 4 -methyl-pyrrolidone. ^ 1 -Alkyl- 4 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidones were obtained by vacuum distillation of the corresponding methyl- 4 -alkylamino- 3 -methylbutyrates which were initially refluxed under different conditions. The 3 -methyl pyrrolidines were obtained by reducing the corresponding <b>pyrrolidones</b> in the presence of lithium aluminium hydride. ^ The coupling constants were checked by a computer simulation program named 2 ̆ 2 NMR-SIM 22 ̆ 2. The steric energies were done by a computer program-QCPE No 395. An equation dealing with the relationship among the dihedral angle, coupling constant, steric energy and Karplus constant was derived. By setting 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 = 0 and 2 ̆ 2 C 2 ̆ 2 = 1. 4, the Karplus constant parameter 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 was figured out by putting each data set into that equation. 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 is equal 8. 9 in this study. ^ The (2 ̆ 713) C and (2 ̆ 715) N chemical shifts of <b>pyrrolidones</b> and pyrrolidines were determined.

Permeation study through the rat skin was performed at 37 °C using phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7. 4) as a receptor medium.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} for improving transdermal drug delivery {{involves the use}} of penetration enhancers (sorption promoters or accelerants) which penetrate into skin to reversibly reduce the barrier resistance. The potential mechanisms of action of penetration enhancers include disruption of intercellular lipid and/or keratin domains and tight junctions. This results in enhanced drug partitioning into tissue, altered thermodynamic activity/solubility of drug etc. Synthetic chemicals (solvents, azones, <b>pyrrolidones,</b> surfactants etc.) generally used for this purpose are rapidly losing their value in transdermal patches due to reports of their absorption into the systemic circulation and subsequent possible toxic effect upon long term application. Terpenes are included in the list of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substances and have low irritancy potential. Their mechanism of percutaneous permeation enhancement involves increasing the solubility of drugs in skin lipids, disruption of lipid/protein organization and/or extraction of skin micro constituents that are responsible for maintenance of barrier status. Hence, they appear to offer great promise for use in transdermal formulations. This article is aimed at reviewing the mechanisms responsible for percutaneous permeation enhancement activity of terpenes, which shall foster their rational use in transdermal formulations...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{systemic}} adverse effects that might occur after oral administration, transdermal delivery of ambroxol was studied {{as a method}} for maintaining proper blood levels for an extended period. Release of ambroxol according to concentration and temperature was determined, and permeation of drug through rat skin was studied using two chamber-diffusion cells. The solubility according to PEG 400 volume fraction was highest at 40 % PEG 400. The rate of drug release from the EVA matrix increased with increased temperature and drug loading doses. A linear relationship existed between the release rate and the square root of loading rate. The activation energy (Ea) was measured from {{the slope of the}} plot of log P versus 1000 /T and was found to be 10. 71, 10. 39, 10. 33 and 9. 87 kcal/mol for 2, 3, 4 and 5 % loading dose from the EVA matrix, respectively. To increase the permeation rate of ambroxol across rat skin from the EVA matrix, various penetration enhancers such as fatty acids (saturated, unsaturated), propylene glycols, glycerides, <b>pyrrolidones,</b> and non-ionic surfactants were used. The enhancing effects of the incorporated enhancers on the skin permeation of ambroxol were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells fitted with intact excised rat skin at 37 ° using 40 % PEG 400 solution as a receptor medium.

5000|$|Particles {{formed by}} {{reduction}} must have their surfaces stabilized to prevent undesirable particle agglomeration (when multiple particles bond together), growth, or coarsening.

50|$|Water {{mixed into}} the powders can form bonds between powder {{particles}} that {{are strong enough}} to lock them together. However, once the water dries, the powders may fall apart.

Povidone, which is a polyvinyl <b>pyrrolidone</b> (PVP), {{is one of the most}} commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP is dissolved in water or solvent and added to the process. When PVP and a solvent/water are mixed with powders, PVP forms a bond with the powders during the process, and the solvent/water evaporates (dries). Once the solvent/water has been dried and the powders have formed a more densely held mass, then the granulation is milled. This process results in the formation of granules.|$|E
