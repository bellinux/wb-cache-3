50|$|Examples of {{contemporary}} decolonial <b>programmatics</b> and analytics exist throughout the Americas. Decolonial <b>programmatics</b> include the already-mentioned Zapatista caracol (LINK) governments of Southern Mexico, Indigenous movements for autonomy throughout South America, including CONFENIAE in Ecuador, ONIC in Colombia, the TIPNIS movement in Bolivia, and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra) in Brazil. Recent transnational organizing by {{a coalition of}} Indigenous peoples {{in the form of the}} Idle No More movement is yet another example of decolonial <b>programmatics.</b> These movements embody action oriented towards the goals expressed in above statement by Quijano, succinctly, to seek ever-increasing freedoms by challenging the reasoning behind modernity, since modernity is in fact a facet of the colonial matrix of power.|$|E

Expanding recognition of the articulation between scholarship and activism in fact begins to dissolve the arguably artificial boundary between decolonial analytics and <b>programmatics,</b> between decolonial thought and action by recognizing that {{the way in which}} scholars view “the causes, forms, and consequences of social movements has significant implications for how they understand their potential, the stakes involved and the meaning of the political decolonial itself.” Scholars—those usually concerned primarily with analytics—who fail to recognize the connection between politics or decoloniality and the production of knowledge—between <b>programmatics</b> and analytics—are those most likely to reflect “an underlying acceptance of capitalist modernity, liberal democracy, and individualism” (Juris & Khasnabish 2013: 6) values which decoloniality seeks to challenge.|$|E

I use two measures for <b>programmatic</b> diversity in order to capture the <b>programmatic</b> supply by existing parties. It can be shown that the explanatory contribution of <b>programmatic</b> factors is as high as or even higher than that of the factors usually cited in the literature on new political parties, e. g. electoral institutions. Moreover, the results underline the necessity of differentiating between genuinely new parties and splits from existing parties as subtypes of new political parties...|$|R

40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation {{investigates the}} formation and success of new political parties in developed democracies {{from the perspective of}} the <b>programmatic</b> competition between parties (see. introduction in chapter 1). It starts by arguing that the current state of the <b>programmatic</b> supply by existing parties is a central determinant for the likelihood of new party formation (chapter 2). A low <b>programmatic</b> diversity of existing parties creates scope for <b>programmatic</b> innovations by new parties. The dissertation establishes a connection between the literature on new parties and niche parties by analyzing the latter as typical cases of innovating new parties (chapter 3). For this purpose, the author combines two concepts with corresponding measures in order to capture the <b>programmatic</b> profiles of parties. Nicheness refers to differences in the emphasis of topics between a given party and its counterparts while <b>programmatic</b> concentration shows the narrowness of a given policy profile. Chapter 4 investigates how the variation in the <b>programmatic</b> profiles of niche parties affect their long-term electoral performance. Previous studies on niche parties have not fully taken into account the evolutionary aspect of the <b>programmatic</b> profiles of these parties. Acknowledging the variation in <b>programmatic</b> profiles between niche parties and over time, the article argues that the electoral effects of nicheness and <b>programmatic</b> concentration as <b>programmatic</b> features of niche parties vary over their lifecycle. The literature on new parties assumes that they can benefit from the poor representation of parts of the electorate by existing parties. This strand of research provides plausible results, but it operates on the macro level, which is problematic for theoretical and methodological reasons. The study in chapter 5 overcomes these problems through a multilevel analysis of the vote choice between new parties, existing parties and abstention...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the electoral {{performance}} of niche parties have not fully taken into account the evolutionary aspect of the <b>programmatic</b> profiles of these parties, {{although the majority of}} these parties were analysed from when they first came into existence, as new parties. Acknowledging the variation in <b>programmatic</b> profiles between niche parties and over time, the article argues that the electoral effects of nicheness and <b>programmatic</b> concentration as <b>programmatic</b> features of niche parties vary over their lifecycle. When entering the electoral arena, niche parties benefit from high levels of nicheness and <b>programmatic</b> concentration. However, these positive effects decrease as parties grow older and face different challenges to those of their early days. The empirical analysis of green and extreme right parties in this article supports the corresponding hypotheses.

40|$|<b>Programmatic</b> {{research}} is a planned and purposeful {{strategy in the}} development of a nursing discipline. We discuss the case made for <b>programmatic</b> research by international scholars as a determinant of scholarship and professional advancement, as well as issues about whether it should be knowledge or methods driven. As an example, the development of a clinical program involving the establishment of ‘nursing beds’ in the United Kingdom is described, together with a published critique of the program. While the literature portrays an overwhelmingly positive outlook for <b>programmatic</b> research, there are some cautionary tales to be told. We address these by way of the literature and personal experience-especially relating to tensions created by fixed research agendas, inability of researchers to follow their own research interests and funding difficulties. Potential disadvantages of <b>programmatic</b> research are also included. We conclude with suggestions as to how research students, early career researchers, and experienced researchers might become involved with <b>programmatic</b> research in positive ways.

Specifically, the <b>programmatics</b> of DoD's 5000 series are evaluated to see if they support the concurrent processes afforded by M&S. The research indicates that the Army should focus on enhancing its requirements generation process by adequately supporting its Battle Labs. The degree to which M&S will impact the Army acquisition process is dependent on how well M&S and Battle Labs are represented in the Future Years Defense Plan. Recommendations in the areas of acquisition <b>programmatics</b> and Army organizational infrastructure are provided in an attempt to enhance the application of M&S in the Army's acquisition process.

40|$|Most of Janá�ek’s mature {{instrumental}} music has {{some form of}} <b>programmatic</b> input. In this article the author examines Janá�ek’s approach to programme music by considering his analyses of four of Dvo�ák’s symphonic poems. It is suggested that Dvo�ák’s symphonic poems, partly composed by ‘setting’ the Erben ballad texts which serve as their programme, {{had an impact on}} Janá�ek’s own development as a composer coming {{at a time when he}} had temporarily abandoned his opera JenŮfa and coinciding with his discovery of speech melodies. All of Janá�ek’s <b>programmatic</b> output is explored (chamber and solo-{{instrumental music}} as well as narrative symphonic poems) under a number of headings, such as works with <b>programmatic</b> titles, works with titles and short <b>programmatic</b> descriptions, post-composition programmes, suppressed programmes, secret programmes and narrative programmes. The strange discrepancy between Janá�ek’s narrative programmes, the actual music and Janá�ek’s later commentaries is noted and discussed as is Janá�ek’s tendency to pile on layers of <b>programmatic</b> significance to the extent, in one case, of making a work impossible to complete. As a whole it is suggested that while <b>programmatic</b> inspiration was important to Janá�ek in his instrumental works, this was merely a starting point and in most cases the crutch was then discarded with the music taking its own independent course...|$|R
