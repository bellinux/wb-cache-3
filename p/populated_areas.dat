5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less <b>populated</b> <b>areas,</b> women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more <b>populated</b> <b>areas,</b> men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E

5|$|Citing the Palmyrenes' combat {{skills in}} large, sparsely <b>populated</b> <b>areas,</b> the Romans formed a Palmyrene auxilia {{to serve in}} the Imperial Roman army.

Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire, serving in Dacia late in Hadrian's reign, and at El Kantara in Numidia and Moesia under Antoninus Pius. During the late second century Rome formed the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, which was stationed in Dura-Europos.|$|E

5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> northwest of Denver.|$|E

Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route164 (NY164) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located entirely {{in the town of}} Patterson in northeastern Putnam County, New York, in the United States. It is a short, two-lane back road that does not pass through any major <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> and serves {{primarily}} as a connector between NY311 and NY22. NY164 also allows for faster passage from Interstate84 (I-84) to the Putnam Lake area via NY311. The route was originally designated as NY312 during the 1930s and later became part of NY216. NY164 was established on January1, 1970, following the truncation of NY216 to its current eastern terminus.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> The {{reason was that}} in the 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E
