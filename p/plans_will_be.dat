25|$|On September 2, 2014, Marshall and Finance Minister Charlene Johnson held a {{news conference}} with {{multiple}} union leaders to announce that they had negotiated a deal to reform pension plans for the majority of public sector employees. The government had spoken of the need to reform pension plans for years. As of March 31, 2014, the pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefits made up 74 percent of Newfoundland and Labrador's $9.8 billion net debt. Reforms to the plan included increased contributions by employers and government beginning January 1, 2015, over five years the retirement age will increase to 58 and employees will need to 10 years of service to qualify for a pension rather than five years. The unions and government will jointly manage the fund with {{the creation of a new}} corporation and it is expected the <b>plans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fully funded within 30 years.|$|E
25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving <b>plans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars}} in taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you want to change the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

25|$|Serbia {{inherited}} about a {{third of}} the diplomatic facilities that belonged to the former Yugoslavia. After 2001 embassies in Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Lebanon, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe were closed due to financial or reciprocal reasons. In June 2008 the Government of Serbia made a decision to close consulates in Bari, Graz and Malmö, and later that year Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić announced a plan to open a consulate-general in Knin (Croatia) during the autumn and an embassy in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Foreign Minister also announced that some diplomatic missions might be closed but also announced a plan for opening missions in Kazakhstan, Los Angeles, Pakistan, UAE and Venezuela. Construction of the new embassy in Washington and reconstruction of the existing buildings in Paris, Nairobi and Brussels is also planned. In late 2008 it was announced that due to the economic crisis expansion <b>plans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> reviewed. In January 2009, the Government of Serbia announced opening of diplomatic trade offices. Many of them will be opened in different cities to the ones where embassies are located as they will be opened in largest economic centres. These offices will be opened in Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, United Kingdom, Greece, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, China, USA, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Switzerland, Turkey, India and South Korea. Government also announced the opening of police liaison offices for a better cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies. In April 2009, Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that consulate from Rijeka wil be moved to Knin in Croatia. In May 2009 it was announced that the embassy in Peru will be temporarily closed and that the consulate-general in Lyon will be closed while the embassy in Kenya was reopened. Due to the legal succession of the Yugoslav properties abroad, Serbia will have to hand over embassy buildings in Vienna, The Hague and Lisbon (to Croatia), Canberra (to the Republic of Macedonia), Ankara, Madrid, Oslo and Ottawa (to Bosnia and Herzegovina) as well as consulate buildings in Klagenfurt, Milan (to Slovenia), Toronto (to Croatia), Zurich and Athens (to the Republic of Macedonia). Serbia will hand over the embassy building in Rome to Slovenia in 2011. In November 2010, the Government of Serbia made a decision to open embassies in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Qatar and reopen embassies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana in 2011 and announced a plan to open embassies in Oman, Chile, Venezuela and Pakistan in the future. In March 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Azerbaijan and Consulate-General in Herceg Novi. In June 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Kazakhstan.|$|E

2500|$|Examples {{of the use}} of {{personalized}} medicine include oncogenomics and pharmacogenomics. Oncogenomics is a field of study focused on the characterization of cancer–related genes. With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. [...] Pharmacogenomics is the study of how a person's genome affects their response to drugs. This field is relatively new but growing fast due in part to an increase in funding for the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network. Since 2001, there has been an almost 550% {{increase in the number of}} research papers in PubMed related to the search terms pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics. This field allows researchers to better understand how genetic differences will influence the body's response to a drug and inform which medicine is most appropriate for the patient. These treatment <b>plans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to prevent or at least minimize the adverse drug reactions which are a, [...] "significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States." [...] Overall, researchers believe pharmacogenomics will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient. As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with pharmacogenetics information in its labeling. These labels may describe genotype-specific dosing instructions and risk for adverse events amongst other information.|$|E
