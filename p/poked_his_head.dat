2500|$|Greenwich and Barry {{began dating}} after his {{marriage}} was annulled, but musically they continued separate careers. Still in college, in 1962, Greenwich {{got her first}} break in the business when she traveled to the Brill Building to meet John Gluck, Jr., one of the composers of the Lesley Gore hit [...] "It's My Party". Needing to keep another appointment, Gluck installed Greenwich in an office {{and asked her to}} wait. The office turned out to be that of songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Hearing piano music from the cubicle, Leiber <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in and, expecting Carole King, was startled to see Greenwich, who introduced herself and explained her reasons for being there. Recognizing her potential as a songwriter, Leiber and Stoller agreed to allow her to use their facilities as she wished in exchange for first refusal on songs she wrote. They eventually signed Greenwich to their publishing company, Trio Music, as a staff songwriter.|$|E

6000|$|Presently, however, {{somebody}} <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{through the}} door, which he opened just {{wide enough to}} admit it, and bawling out-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, in there!" [...] cried Whopper, <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{into the}} small doorway. He could not see, for the cabin inside was dark.|$|R
50|$|In {{one scene}} before {{the ending of}} Dough for the Do-Do, Porky crashes into a wall of bricks. He <b>pokes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of the pile, and the Do-Do drops an extra brick from the clouds. Porky covers <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> panicked, until a {{parachute}} appears on the brick. Porky laughs in relief, until the brick releases a double, landing on Porkys head with a clang. In Porky in Wackyland, when Porky <b>pokes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of the pile of bricks a brick drops on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> then he cries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really do}} not see why you should not have gone without me," [...] the Marquis said, <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of <b>his</b> dressing-room.|$|R
6000|$|Reddy Fox <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out and--looked {{straight}} into the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy and the muzzle of that dreadful gun! ...|$|E
60|$|John Thomas {{came on the}} {{car after}} Annie, at about a quarter to ten. He <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> easily into the girls' waiting-room.|$|E
60|$|Along {{the passage}} he swept, nearly {{filling it with}} his immense body, and now he <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the jeweled cavern of Ruggedo.|$|E
60|$|But only a curse {{answered}} him, and a peremptory command not to {{lose sight}} of the prisoners by <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of the window.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] William Conybeare drew this cartoon of Buckland <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into a prehistoric hyaena den in 1822 to {{celebrate}} Buckland's ground breaking {{analysis of the}} fossils found in Kirkdale Cave.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{like being}} on the side, I like kind of being the friend who <b>pokes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in and says, [...] "How ya doin'? OK," [...] and then goes home". â€”Leonard in an {{interview}} with BuddyTV.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly, cautiously, Whitefoot <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{out from}} beneath the old log {{and looked up at}} Chatterer. [...] "What kind of a message?" [...] he demanded suspiciously.|$|E
60|$|Ascobaruch crept to {{the wall}} and {{cautiously}} <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over it. The sight he saw drove the blood from his face and left him white and haggard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Bab, {{how could}} you do it? Ma was frightened dreadfully," [...] said Betty, gently tugging at the striped leg, as Sancho <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in for another shoe.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was awakened}} by the sliding open of the door. Day was just dawning, cold and gray, and the freight had not yet started. A [...] "con" [...] (conductor) was <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> inside the door.|$|R
50|$|After {{being left}} by himself {{to act as}} a {{listening}} post, Joe discovers the all-important trench periscope has been damaged, meaning he has to <b>poke</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> above the parapet to determine enemy movements after he can overhear them close by.|$|R
60|$|The mousing man, {{who bore}} {{the name of}} Marks, {{instantly}} stopped <b>his</b> sipping, and, <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forward, looked shrewdly on the new acquaintance, as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf, or some other possible object of pursuit.|$|R
6000|$|The {{students}} laughed, and {{the doctor}} gave them a circular glance of enjoyment in his joke. Then he touched the bell and, when the porter <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's some {{brushwood}} {{behind the}} garage!" [...] announced Dave, as he <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{out of a}} window to look. [...] "It's that big heap the gardener put there yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forward, {{groping for}} {{the ear of}} his commander. His lips touched it--big, fleshy, very wet. He cried in an {{agitated}} tone, [...] "Our boats are going now, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|M. Plume, or Captain Plume, as he {{preferred}} being called, now opened the door, and <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out, welcomed Chapeau, and {{assured him that}} if he would step round to the wine shop he would be with him in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|An air of haste and {{excitement}} pervades the party, {{and as the}} tall hat (surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger) alights, Mr. Smallweed the elder <b>pokes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy, [...] "How de do, sir! How de do!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Hurricane Neddy", {{he can be}} seen <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of {{the door}} to his padded cell inside the Calmwood Mental Hospital, and then quickly closing it. Later in the episode a sign reading [...] "Free John Swartzwelder" [...] can be seen briefly (behind Barney Gumble) during the fanfare of Ned Flanders' release from the same hospital.|$|R
6000|$|Unc' <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} farther out {{and put his hand}} behind his ear {{as if he were a}} little hard of hearing. [...] "What's that, Bre'r Rabbit? Am I a what?" [...] he demanded.|$|E
60|$|As he <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{through the}} narrow {{aperture}} that connects the two caves a heavy long-sword was awaiting him upon either hand, and before he {{had an opportunity to}} emit even a single growl his severed head rolled at our feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Stubbs's {{brother has}} got loose, an' he's tearin' 'round on the tent!" [...] shouted Joe, as he <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{in through a}} hole in the flag, and at the same time {{struggled}} to keep back a small but bold boy with his foot.|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} glittered a long green-house, {{and on the}} other stood a barn, with a sleek cow ruminating in the yard, and an inquiring horse <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of <b>his</b> stall to view the world. Many {{comfortable}} gray hens were clucking and scratching about the hay-strewn floor, and a flock of doves sat cooing on the roof.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon {{takes place}} in a kitchen at midnight. Jerry <b>pokes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of the {{refrigerator}} door and steals some cheese, unaware that Tom is watching him. Tom weighs the mouse down enough such that he can no longer see in front of him. After Jerry falls off from a rolling pin, Tom emerges from his hiding place with a smug face.|$|R
50|$|The {{cops are}} all still there; lying around, smoking, waiting for {{something}} to happen. Pandemonium breaks out when the pickpocket enters the house, and amid the chaos, Colonel Nutt's explosive device is detonated, blowing all of the cops skyward. In the aftermath, the pickpocket is buried in a heap of rubble and Charlie is seen <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of the kitchen stove.|$|R
60|$|The cab {{stopped at}} last before {{a block of}} offices in a by-street of the city. Rowan reluctantly alighted, and {{crossing}} the pavement entered the building. He passed through a swing door to a desk. A small boy <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of an inquiry office.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{his turn}} indeed to be utterly bewildered. He searched--none too gently--the squalid little lodge through and through, turned the paltry sticks of {{furniture}} over, hauled little Amelie, Grosjean's granddaughter, out of bed, searched under the mattresses, and even <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up the chimney.|$|E
60|$|Martell stood {{leaning against}} {{the corner of the}} building, smoking his {{cigarette}} and gazing idly at the workmen. Then he chanced to glance around and caught sight of the Rovers. He at once <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back into the building and said something to someone inside.|$|E
5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer <b>poking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|R
60|$|Martin Cunningham, first, <b>poked</b> <b>his</b> silkhatted <b>head</b> {{into the}} {{creaking}} carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.|$|R
50|$|Elmer <b>pokes</b> out <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and Bugs {{attempts}} to shoot him. But Elmer plugs the shotgun {{with his finger}} and causes it to backfire.|$|R
