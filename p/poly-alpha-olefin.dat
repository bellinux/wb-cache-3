It is {{a specific type of}} olefin (organic) that is used as a base stock in the production of some synthetic lubricants.

5000|$|Practically all polyolefins {{that are}} of any {{practical}} or commercial importance are <b>poly-alpha-olefin</b> (or poly-α-olefin or polyalphaolefin, sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. An alpha-olefin (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha-olefins such as 1-hexene {{may be used as}} co-monomers to give a alkyl branched polymer (see chemical structure below), although 1-decene is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. [...] Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules. Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. [...] Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range.|$|E

This work particularly focuses {{on the role of}} water in altering the evolution of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) –derived reaction layers. A series of tribological tests were carried out using a rolling four-ball machine. Different initial water amounts were added to 2 [*]wt% ZDDP in <b>poly-alpha-olefin</b> (PAO). The reaction layer evolution and its chemical properties were studied using XPS and SEM. SEM analyses show that water seems to inhibit the growth of the ZDDP-derived reaction layer. XPS analyses reveal that the reaction layer undergoes a depolymerisation of the polyphosphate chain when water is present in lubricated contacts. Surface distress was observed in 2 [*]wt% ZDDP in <b>poly-alpha-olefin,</b> whereas when water was mixed with pure base oil, the surface distress increased. Different mechanisms of the influence of water on the ZDDP-derived reaction layer evolution are discussed...|$|E

The Lubricants are prepared by blending the basestocks with typical additives such as a zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, a dispersant, a detergent and a dispersant-inhibitor package. Frictional and wear-preventing properties are investigated using an oscillating-type wear-testing machine.

40|$|In this study, the {{equilibrium}} solubility, C*, and the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, were measured for 4 different gases (He, CO, N 2 and H 2) {{in two different}} liquids (<b>Poly-Alpha-Olefins,</b> PAO- 8 and C 70 Sasol Wax) in a 1 -liter agitated reactor operating in a Gas Inducing mode under the typical conditions of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The effect of operating variables, including pressure (0. 7 - 3. 5 MPa), temperature (423 - 523 K), mixing speed (13. 3 - 20 Hz), and alumina powder (used as a support for cobalt catalyst) concentration (0 - 50 wt. %) on kLa and C* values were statistically investigated using the Central Composite Statistical design and analysis technique. The data were measured within wide ranges of operating condition covering the industrial range of this Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The transient physical gas absorption technique {{was used to determine}} kLa under the operating conditions used. The C* values for the four gases in the two liquids used appeared to increase linearly with increasing pressure at constant temperature, i. e., obey Henry's Law over the pressure ranges studied. The C* values were found to decrease and then increase with increasing temperature and the effect of temperature on C* was described by an Arrhenius-type equation, where the apparent activation energy of absorption was a function of temperature. The solubility values for the four gases in the two liquids used followed the trend: C*CO>C*N 2 >C*H 2 >C*He and the values in Sasol wax were slightly higher than obtained those in PAO- 8. The kLa values for the four gases in the two liquids were found to increase with increasing pressure, temperature and mixing speed. The kLa values, however, slightly decreased (20 %) at solid concentrations less than 30 wt% and then dramatically decreased (80 %) with increasing solid concentrations from 30 to 50 wt%. Under similar operating conditions, kLa values for the four gases were found to be higher in Sasol wax than in PAO- 8. This behavior was related to the greater gas-liquid interfacial area created in the Sasol wax due to its lower surface tension and foamability when compared with those of the PAO- 8. Statistical correlations were developed to predict the kLa values for the four gases in the two liquids with a regression coefficient (R 2) greater than 97 %. Also, an empirical correlation using dimensionless numbers was proposed to predict kLa values in gas induction slurry agitated reactors with a regression coefficient (R 2) greater than 94 %...|$|R

40|$|Research on nanofluids {{has been}} {{undertaken}} {{for several years}} because of the reported enhancements of thermal properties such as thermal conductivity and enhanced heat transfer performance in laminar flow. Nanofluid is the fluid where nanoparticles are dispersed in a base fluid. Thermal conductivity and viscosity {{are considered to be}} the most prominent factors in the efficient use of nanofluids. A change in thermal conductivity and viscosity also changes the convective heat transfer coefficient. Nanoparticles can be metallic or non-metallic and also can have different shapes. In this study, <b>Poly-Alpha-Olefin</b> (PAO) {{has been used as a}} base fluid with Alumina (Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles. <b>Poly-Alpha-Olefin</b> is commonly used for engine lubrication in military applications and cooling in electronic and industrial devices. Several nanofluid samples were made by METSS Corp. in Ohio, USA using different dispersants, different base fluids and different morphology of alumina nanoparticles. The mass fraction of nanoparticles is from 2. 5 to 20 percent. The thermal properties of each sample such as thermal conductivity and viscosity have been measured. Thermal conductivity of nanofluids and pure base fluids were both measured and the thermal conductivity enhancement has been calculated. Also, the heat transfer coefficient has been determined for laminar flow under constant heat flux conditions. Results indicate that all the tested nanofluids and base fluid samples show a Newtonian behavior. Among the nanofluid samples, NF- 048, which contains non-spherical Alumina nanoparticles exhibits the greatest thermal conductivity enhancement when compared to pure PAO. Heat transfer tests were conducted with pure PAO and NF- 048, and an enhancement in convective heat transfer coefficient was observed. The thermal conductivity of NF- 048 increases with temperature, which is consistent with heat transfer results. Furthermore, the percentage enhancement in convective heat transfer coefficient was shown to increase non-linearly with the axial distance in the heat transfer section. NF- 048 exhibits a lower Re (Reynolds number) *Ra (Rayleigh number) than pure PAO under laminar flow constant heat flux conditions indicating that nanoparticle morphology and composition are the two main factors responsible for convective heat transfer enhancement at low Reynolds number...|$|E

For comparison, steel/steel contacts were also investigated. The scuffing resistance has been measured as the limiting pressure of seizure (poz) using the four-ball apparatus.

40|$|We present {{studies of}} triborheological {{properties}} and orientational dynamics of three imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) [C 14 mim][BF 4], [C 14 mim][PF 6] and [C 14 mim][Tf 2 N], by utilizing {{a variety of}} physical methods including DSC, SAXS/WAXS, rheology, flow dichroism and tribology. Results revealed that two ILs ([C 14 mim][BF 4] and [C 14 mim][PF 6]), which possess a liquid crystalline (LC) phase show ultralow friction and lower wear as <b>poly-alpha-olefin</b> (PAO) standard lubricant oil in the isotropic phase at 120 °C. Moreover, the [C 14 mim][BF 4] IL exhibits also ultralow coefficient of friction (COF) in its LC phase. Such unique tribological behavior originates from bilayered domain structure, which is maintained by the specific molecular interactions and orientation in the shear flow. SAXS data revealed that cation tails in LC domains are interdigitated in a bilayer smectic phase. In strong shear flows LC domains tend to be oriented along the flow direction which is confirmed by sigmoidal growth of flow dichroism values. The dichroism signal does not relax even when the flow is stopped due to long-range orientational order in LC domains. The negative sign of the dichroism indicates orientation of anisotropic mobile cation tails perpendicular to the flow directions. This specific bilayered domain structure is well pronounced in LC phase and the "precursors" of these domains exist also in the isotropic phase, giving rise to ultralow friction regime in sliding contacts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the freevolume viscosity model in a Newtonian elastohydrodynamic line and point contact simulation using a more effective multigrid approach. According to recent experimental studies using high pressure viscometers, the free volume-based pressure–viscosity relationship closely re{{presents the}} realistic piezo-viscous behavior for the high pressure typically encountered in elastohydrodynamic applications [1]. The effects of different pressure–viscosity relationships, including the exponential model, the Roelands model, and the free-volume model are investigated through an example with <b>poly-alpha-olefin</b> lubricant. It is found that the real pressure–viscosity behavior predicted by the free-volume model yields a higher viscosity at the low-pressure area, which results in a larger central film thickness. The fact that film thickness is formed mainly by the entraining action at the inlet area significantly weighs the importance of viscosity variation from different models in this area. The inlet area is a low-pressure area, and accordingly, the real viscosity of the lubricant predicted by Doolittle model undergoes a rapid increase in a convex function, being apparently larger than the Roelands one. Furthermore, the Doolittle model leads to higher pressure spike amplitude than that observed using the Roelands model. To solve the problem, a full multigrid approach has been used upon the assumptions of isothermal condition. Multigrid is more effective because it uses coarser grid levels to remove errors of different frequencies, which could be more quickly smoothed away than those on simply the fine grid alone. The developed coarse grid correction cycle proves to be an efficient tool to solve the EHL problem {{for a wide range of}} load conditions...|$|E

The damping performance of this device can be continuously changed and is controllable by altering magnetic filed applied on the MR fluid {{at the bottom of}} a U-tube container. Numerical simulations have been conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness in both open-loop and closed-loop control modes, and MR-TLCD prototypes using different solvents in magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) have been manufactured in laboratory.

With the growing heat loads in engineering systems that exceed the current technological limits, nanofluids are considered as an attractive option for more efficient heat removal for thermal management applications. Recent results {{reported in the}} literature show that the thermo-physical properties of coolants are enhanced considerably when seeded with very minute concentrations of nanoparticles. Hence, nanofluids research has provoked interest in thermal management applications. The convective heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids are reported in this study. Exfoliated graphite nanoparticles were dispersed in <b>poly-alpha-olefin</b> (PAO) at concentrations of 0. 3 % and 0. 6 % (by weight). The heat flux into a convective cooling apparatus was monitored and the results for nanofluid and the base fluid are presented.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In an ammonia/water hybrid heat pump system which is a vapor compression cycle with a solution circuit, lubricating oil is commonly used for the compressor. Since <b>Poly-Alpha-Olefin</b> (PAO) oil which is commonly used for ammonia is immiscible with the ammonia/water solution, a proper oil recovery method is required for a smooth operation of the compressor. Although the oil separator installed at the outlet of the compressor removes most of the oil from the refrigerant vapor, some oil droplets are carried over and accumulated in the solution reservoir. Unlike the pure ammonia vapor compression system, the density of PAO oil is smaller than that of ammonia/water mixture which has the ammonia concentration of 30 - 40 %, and the oil tends to rise and gather near the liquid/vapor interface. In this study, a method for oil recovery from the solution reservoir is suggested. In the present method, the mixture of the oil and the solution is drained into an oil separator having a narrow cylinder at the top, if the oil in the reservoir is greater than a certain amount. The oil droplets in the solution rise by buoyancy and gather at this upper narrow cylinder. The gathered oil is extracted {{and returned to the}} compressor by an oil recovery pump. Since the solution has to be returned to the reservoir as soon as the separation process is finished, the process time for the separation should be as short as possible. To predict the time for the separation, experiments and simulations have been carried out. The model using the multiphase segregated flow (MSF) showed that a proper choice of droplet diameter is necessary to predict a correct separation time. Also, a simulation model which is able to consider the effect of surface tension and droplet merging is needed to be developed. dc 201...|$|E
