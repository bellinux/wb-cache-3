25|$|A {{double bass}} drum pedal {{operates}} {{much the same}} way only with a second footplate controlling a second beater on the same drum. Most commonly this is attached by a shaft to a remote beater mechanism alongside the primary <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanism.</b> One notable exception to this pattern is the symmetrical Sleishman twin bass drum pedal.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} few years of {{production}} the original Leedy Vibraphone did not include a mechanism for damping, or stopping, the sustaining tones. [...] In 1928 the J.C. Deagan company introduced a <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanism</b> that has not changed substantially since. A rigid bar beneath the center of the instrument is pressed upward by an adjustable spring, and engages a long felt pad against the sharps and the naturals. [...] A foot pedal lowers the bar and allows notes to ring freely; releasing the pedal engages the damper and stops any vibrating notes.|$|E

2500|$|Since most {{domestic}} appliances {{are used}} in relatively static environments, and control of tool-velocity is often important, [...] <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can deliver both muscle power and fine speed control to the where it is needed, while also providing comfortable seating for the user and, additionally, leaving both hands free to manipulate the work-piece or appliance.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was a flat sided {{tubular steel}} structure, deep {{at the rear}} but sloping down to the nose from about mid-chord. [...] Since the pilot's open cockpit was well forward, it was {{lower than that of}} the gunner in the rear cockpit making forward fire safer. [...] The gunner's seat, twin Lewis machine gun and ammunition were contained within a novel turret, a vertical axis cylinder which could be power rotated in any direction under lever control. [...] The power was provided by a flywheel which the gunner spun up through a <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanism.</b> [...] It was claimed that once up to full speed the wheel stored enough energy to power the turret over one or two minute of engagement. [...] One of these turrets had already been fitted to the F.K.35 but there was not enough time to remount it in the new fuselage for the Paris Show.|$|E

25|$|Most school {{bands and}} orchestras below a {{university}} level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls.

Many professionals also use these drums for outdoor performances due to their durability and lighter weight. The pedal is in the center of the drum itself.|$|R

5000|$|When {{describing}} a harpsichord it is customary to specify its choirs of strings, often called its disposition. Strings at eight foot pitch sound at the normal expected pitch, strings at four foot pitch sound an octave higher. Harpsichords occasionally include a sixteen-foot choir (one octave lower than eight-foot) or a two-foot choir (two octaves higher; quite rare). When {{there are multiple}} choirs of strings, the player is often able to control which choirs sound. This is usually done by having a set of jacks for each choir, and a mechanism for [...] "turning off" [...] each set, often by moving the upper register (through which the jacks slide) sideways a short distance, so that their plectra miss the strings. In simpler instruments this is done by manually moving the registers, but as the harpsichord evolved, builders invented levers, knee levers and <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{to make it easier}} to change registration.|$|R
5000|$|Expression pedals are {{typically}} {{used to control}} a range of synthesizer functions and effects parameters in real time.

Dolge describes Mendelssohn's pedal mechanism:"The keyboard for pedaling was placed under the keyboard for manual playing, had 29 notes and was connected with an action placed {{at the back of the}} piano where a special soundboard, covered with 29 strings, was built into the case".|$|E

50|$|Pedal harps are {{essentially}} diatonic instruments which are fitted with the double-action <b>pedal</b> <b>mechanism</b> to allow chromatic alterations and key changes. No {{matter how the}} pedals are set, the pedal harp still has only seven strings per octave. Smaller harps, often called folk, lever or Celtic harps, are equally diatonic instruments (also with seven strings per octave) and use a mechanical lever on each string which must be moved manually to obtain chromatic alterations. The only completely chromatic harps are the double (arpa doppia) and triple (Welsh) harps and the cross-strung harp.|$|E
