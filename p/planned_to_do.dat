5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine {{military}} failures forced another {{change of}} government in Constantinople: the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919, forcing her back into a convent. Romanos betrothed his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine and advanced {{to the rank of}} co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming the government of the empire, which was largely what Simeon had <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E
5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, he had <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> surgical research, but Sheffield had no space {{for him in}} its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given {{a place in the}} pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

Perhaps Blacky wouldn't have felt so sure could he have {{understood}} what Farmer Brown's boy had said about doing a little shooting himself.|$|R

5|$|Prince Edward {{tried to}} have Burnell elected to the Archbishopric of Canterbury in 1270, but was {{frustrated}} by the Canterbury cathedral chapter's members, who instead elected their prior, William Chillenden. Eventually Pope Gregory X set Chillenden aside and installed his own choice in the see, Robert Kilwardby. Burnell did not accompany the prince on crusade in late 1270, although he had originally <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Instead, he was appointed {{one of the four}} lieutenants who looked after Edward's interests while the prince was away. Thus he was still in England when Henry III died in November 1272. Burnell acted as one of the regents of the kingdom until August 1274, when the prince, now king, returned from Palestine. During the regency Burnell supervised a parliament, dealt with raids on the Welsh Marches and resolved a trade conflict with Flanders. After the king's return to England Burnell was made chancellor. The historian Richard Huscroft considers that Burnell gained valuable experience governing England during Edward's absence, ensuring Burnell's dominance in the English government after Edward's return.|$|E

The Marathas, who had {{suffered}} immensely in the war between them and the Sultanate of Mysore, <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no such thing as they were certain of British military aid helping them. However, when the British were unable to provide the aid to the Marathas, the Marathas under Nana decided to sue for peace.|$|E
25|$|Cameron had {{initially}} next <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{a film of}} the comic-book character Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's treatment into a screenplay, and Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though later drafts were heavily rewritten by Koepp himself, Scott Rosenberg, and Alvin Sargent. Columbia preferred to credit David Koepp solely, {{and none of the}} scripts before or after his were ever examined by the Writers Guild of America, East to determine proper credit attribution. Cameron and other writers objected, but Columbia and the WGA prevailed. In its release in 2002, Spider-Man had its screenplay credited solely to Koepp.|$|E

By 1998, Oedekerk left the project to pursue a remake of the 1964 film The Incredible Mr. Limpet with Jim Carrey. By 2004, the film rights were acquired by Columbia Pictures, who did not move the project beyond development.|$|E

For this to work, they had to control the entire output of diamonds in the world, which they <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by acquiring interests in all of the diamond mines. In 1925, British Guiana began producing enough diamonds {{to attract the attention of}} the syndicate, and in November 1925 a Mr Oppenheimer, representing the syndicate, entered into a contract with Mr Perez, the operator of the Guiana mines, to have [...] worth of diamonds provided to the syndicate over a twelve-month period.|$|E
