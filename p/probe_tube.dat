50|$|First, the {{clinician}} {{will examine the}} ear canal {{with the use of}} an otoscope to ensure no wax or other debris will interfere with the positioning of the <b>probe</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> is placed with the tip approximately 6 mm (1/4 inch) from the tympanic membrane. Next the hearing aid is put in place. The REM system will typically produce a test stimulus from a loudspeaker situated 12 - 15 in from the patient's head and simultaneously measure the output in the ear canal to determine how much amplification the hearing aid is providing.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} real ear measurement {{is known as}} insertion gain, which {{is the difference between}} the sound pressure level measured near the ear drum with a hearing aid in place, and the sound pressure level measured in the unaided ear. First a measurement is made with the <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> in the open ear (Real Ear Unaided Response, or REUR), then a second one is made using the same test signal with the hearing aid in place and turned on (Real Ear Aided Response, or REAR). The difference between these two results is the insertion gain. This gain can be matched to targets produced by various prescriptive formula based on the patient's audiogram or individual hearing loss.|$|E
5000|$|Real ear {{measurement}} (REM, {{also known}} as insitu- or probe microphone measurement) is the measurement of sound pressure level in a patient's ear canal developed when a hearing aid is worn. It is measured {{with the use of}} a silicone <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> inserted in the canal connected to a microphone outside the ear and is done to verify that the hearing aid is providing suitable amplification for a patient's hearing loss. [...] The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and American Academy of Audiology (AAA) recommend real ear measures as the preferred method of verifying the performance of hearing aids.Used by audiologists and other hearing healthcare practitioners in the process of hearing aid fitting, real ear measures are the most reliable and efficient method for assessing the benefit provided by the amplification. [...] Measurement of the sound level in the ear canal allows the clinician to make informed judgements on audibility of sound in the ear and the effectiveness of hearing aid treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the acoustic impedance and the absorption factor measured by the standing wave method was calculated theoretically, and the {{accuracy of}} the measuring apparatus Type 4002 made by Brüel & Kjaer was examined. The measuring frequecy range of the apparatus was from 250 cps to 4500 cps. Since an acoustic impedance accuracy of 2 % in error was required theoretically, the measuring apparatus was examined for an accuracy of 2 % in error. Some defects were found to be improved. 1) It was desirable to separate the impedance measuring tube from the speaker box. 2) It was desirable that the diameter of the <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> was smaller than about 3 mm. 3) The type of the <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> orifice should desirably be changed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: While the {{necessary}} time for beacons search {{had been the}} major focus of beacons manufacturers and {{has been reduced to}} almost a minimum, the time needed for direct recovering (shovelling and excavating) can’t be affected significantly. It simply depends on factors like burial depth, consistency of the snow, the adequacy of the used shovel, the right shovelling technique and finally by the physical constitution of the rescuer. In the past, one factor of the overall time, the PROBING, hasn’t been paid much attention for. While manufacturers did improve avalanche probes in general with the major focus on lightness and quality of the <b>probe</b> <b>tubes</b> and locking systems, the principle together with the educated technique of probing hasn’t been touched systematically. A newly introduced probe using additional electronic technologies claims to have a significant impact to the overall rescue time for avalanche victims.

25|$|The {{measurement}} and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an airspeed indicator ("ASI") {{connected to a}} pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more pitot <b>probes</b> (or <b>tubes)</b> facing the on-coming air flow to measure pitot pressure (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} air {{pressure}} change on bone conduction (BC) hearing thresholds in the occluded ear was investigated. The pump manometer system of an impedance bridge {{was used to}} change the air pressure in the ear canal of twenty-two normally hearing subjects. BC thresholds were measured with: (1) open ear; (2) the ear canal occluded with a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and application of 0 daPa air pressure; and (3) the ear canal occluded with a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and application of - 350 daPa air pressure. Thresholds were lower in condition 2 than in condition 1, the difference decreasing from 27 dB at 2500 Hz to 4. 5 dB at 2000 Hz. Thresholds were higher in condition 3 than in condition 2.

30|$|SAGD {{horizontal}} wells {{are used}} to enhance oil recovery from heavy oil reservoirs. This technology requires precise separation between the production well and the injection well to ensure the efficient drainage of the reservoir. By studying {{the attitude of the}} downhole <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and the production well trajectory, an algorithm is proposed for eliminating ferromagnetic interference while drilling injection wells. A high accuracy filter circuit has been designed to correct the detected magnetic signals, which are ultra-weak, frequency-instable, and narrow-band. The directional drilling magnetic guidance system (DD-MGS) has been developed by integrating these advanced techniques. It contains a sub-system for the ranging calculation software, a magnetic source, a downhole <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and a sub-system for collecting & processing the detected signals. The DD-MGS has succeeded in oilfield applications. It can guide the directional drilling trajectory not only in the horizontal section but also in the build section of horizontal injection wells. This new technology has broad potential applications.|$|E

40|$|The neutron probe {{is a tool}} {{employed}} for the measurement of water content in a soil mass. The presence of {{a gap between the}} soil and the neutron <b>probe</b> access <b>tube,</b> filled with either air or water, inevitably introduces a systematic error in neutron probe readings. In this study, experimental investigations and numerical analyses were carried out to evaluate the effects of this gap on neutron probe calibration. The numerical model was developed based on the multigroup neutron diffusion equations and the finite element method. The experiments were conducted in a heavy clay soil. The results show that an air gap of 2. 5 - 30 mm between the soil and a 50 -mm-diameter aluminium tube could lead to an underestimation of soil water content by 5 - 45 %, but significant underestimation was apparent for air gaps < 10 mm. It is also found that the neutron count is significantly overestimated if the gap around the access tube is filled with water rather than air, but this effect is most significant for larger gaps. The results of this research clearly indicate that a gap between the neutron <b>probe</b> access <b>tube</b> and the soil profile should be avoided during field installation, and that if a gap between the access tube and soil develops during service, a systematic error will be introduced into measurements...|$|R

Agreement between measured and calculated phase difference was excellent to within the measurement resolution...|$|E
40|$|A study {{realised}} among 60 {{children by}} means of a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> microphone allowed us to determine the mean ear canal resonance by the newborn and the young children. This is noticeably less than the adult one. The ear canal reaches its adult physiology after one year, so it implies a somewhat different auditory sensibility by the newborns than by the adults, particularly in the 2000 - 4000 Hz range. We suggest that the A. B. R. wave I latency and thresholds modifications during children's first year of life are (at least partially and in the majority of cases) an ear canal physiological variation effect and that different calibrations should be used for newborns screening test and for adults purposes.
