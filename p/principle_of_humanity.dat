2500|$|Hakkō Ichiu {{meant the}} {{bringing}} together {{of the corners}} of the world under one ruler, or the making of the world one family. This was the alleged ideal of the foundation of the Empire; and in its traditional context meant no more than a universal <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity,</b> which was destined ultimately to pervade the whole universe. The way to the realisation of Hakkō Ichiu was through the benign rule of the Emperor; and therefore the [...] "way of the Emperor"—the [...] "Imperial" [...] or the [...] "Kingly way"—was a concept of virtue, and a maxim of conduct. Hakkō Ichiu was the moral goal; and loyalty to the Emperor was the road which led to it. [...] Throughout the years that followed measures of military aggression were advocated in the names of Hakkō ichiu eventually became symbols for world domination through military force.|$|E

For as I told you before, I tell you now again, that the gospel-principles are the Holy Ghost and faith, which help that soul in whom they dwell to count believing in Jesus Christ the great and essential part of our Christianity, and our reckoning ourselves pardoned for the sake of him: 'And thus being set free from sin, we become the servants of God, and have our fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life' (Rom 6:22).|$|E

50|$|Honderich {{argues that}} the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Humanity</b> is that what is right always {{consists}} in what, according to the best available knowledge and judgement, are actually rational steps, effective and not self-defeating ones rather than pretences, {{to the end of}} getting and keeping people out of bad lives. Bad lives are defined as those deprived of six fundamental human goods: a decent length of life, bodily well-being, freedom and power in various settings, respect and self-respect, the goods of relationship, and the goods of culture. It is a consequentialist principle, but not the principle of utility, nor of course the claim that the ends justify the means. Honderich {{argues that the}} principle is fundamental to but not the whole of a morality of humanity. This, he claims, includes certain policies of equality and inequality and certain practices, one being a better democracy than we have. Honderich concludes that the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Humanity</b> is better supported than any other sort of moral principle, on the basis of both consistency and certain facts. He takes it that non-consequentialist reasons are not really reasons at all, nor, he says, does the Principle grant any distinction between acts and omissions.|$|E
