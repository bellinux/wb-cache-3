Adapted from methods of spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy, it exploits the high <b>positional</b> <b>accuracy</b> of single-particle tracking. While conventional tracking methods break down if multiple particle trajectories intersect, this method works in principle for arbitrarily large molecule densities and dynamical parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficients, velocities) as long as individual molecules can be identified. It is computationally cheap and robust and allows one to identify and quantify motions (e.g. diffusion, active transport, confined diffusion) within an ensemble of particles, without any a priori knowledge about the dynamics.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tree {{inventory}} is {{a necessary}} tool to validate the accuracy of acquired LiDAR point cloud against the gathered field data when extracting information on forest resources. This research study focuses on establishing a protocol for field inventory survey and comparison of <b>positional</b> <b>accuracies</b> of surveyed points from different methods. A 2 -ha permanent forest plot in Molawin-Dampalit, Mount Makiling, Laguna, established by the Makiling Center for Mountain Ecosystems (MCME) using a hand-held GPS and bearing method, {{was used as the}} comparative study site for this research. Diameter at breast height of trees with diameters greater than 10 cm, 1 - 10 cm and less than 1 cm were measured using a diameter tape at 20 mx 20 m, 10 mx 10 m and 5 mx 5 m grids,respectively. Canopy closure and gap fraction was measured using digital hemispherical photography and fisheye lens. Regression methods were used to establish relationships and to know if the parameters directly measured from LiDAR specifically canopy height, point density, point spacing and canopy cover would derive the diameter at breast height of the trees in the study site. Based on the field inventory, tree height in the study site ranges from 0. 01 to 33 m, DBH ranges from 0. 01 to 150 cm, and canopy cover ranges from 53. 5 % to 98. 3 %. Total Station survey further showed higher <b>positional</b> <b>accuracies</b> of the surveyed trees.
