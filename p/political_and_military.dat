5|$|Although up to 200,000 {{people were}} {{executed}} during the Spanish Civil War and its immediate aftermath, 48 people were executed {{in the period}} from 1948 {{to the time of}} the 1975 executions. Of those, 17 were executed by firing squad and 31 by garrotting. Historically, the garrote had been the preferred execution method in Spain, with firing squads used for <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> {{leaders of the}} U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E

While Titus received a court {{education in the}} company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> career.

5|$|In April 1949, Truman {{appointed}} Radford to {{the position}} of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A staunch anticommunist, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, KCB (8 April 1859 – 14 December 1927) was {{a senior}} British Army officer who served in several campaigns {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. During the First World War he was placed in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the first half of the war but made enemies amongst the Canadian <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> elite and {{suffered}} disastrous casualties during operations in 1915/16 which forced his sidelining and eventual retirement from service.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E

5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th {{century was}} a {{federation}} of thirteen largely independent cantons. The federation comprised rural cantons {{as well as}} city states that had expanded their territories into the countryside by <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> means {{at the cost of}} the previously ruling liege lords. The cities just took over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; they held the judicial rights and also appointed the district sheriffs (Landvögte).|$|E
5|$|The {{demands of}} the SA for more <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> power caused anxiety among military, {{industrial}} and political leaders.

Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who—along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher)—were rounded up, arrested and shot.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children. In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> authorities alike), the desire to do (and be seen to do) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E
5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, <b>political,</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> questions.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> machinations {{conducted}} by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
