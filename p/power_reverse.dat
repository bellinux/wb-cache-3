2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure the locomotive's ability to {{reliably}} keep to the timetable, a number of notable design changes were made. These included {{the replacement of the}} original single blastpipe with dual Lempor ejectors, conversion to oil firing, fitting of <b>power</b> <b>reverse,</b> and the addition of a diesel control stand to allow for multiple unit operation with diesel electric locomotives where required. R711 entered service on regular trains on 21 November 1998, and design refinements based on its performance in service were made to the subsequent conversion of R766. For a number of years, the modified R class locomotives could be seen in regular operation between Melbourne and Warrnambool, keeping a fast 3 hour 13 minute schedule which included six stops along the [...] route. In 2001, locomotive R766 suffered a mechanical failure of its connecting rod assembly while running at [...] The connecting rod became detached at one end and dug into the trackbed, although the locomotive was not derailed.|$|E
5000|$|The Ragonnet <b>power</b> <b>reverse,</b> {{patented}} in 1909, {{was a true}} feedback controlled servomechanism. The <b>power</b> <b>reverse</b> amplified small {{motions of}} reversing lever in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction. [...] It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered. [...] The term servomotor was explicitly used by the developers of some later <b>power</b> <b>reverse</b> mechanisms. [...] The use of feedback control in these later <b>power</b> <b>reverse</b> mechanisms eliminated {{the need for a}} second cylinder for a hydraulic locking mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position.|$|E

50|$|The motor {{was mounted}} behind {{the driver and}} was coupled to a snowmobile-style CVT belt drive transmission. Final drive to the rear wheel was by chain.

50|$|If {{the driver}} has exited the vehicle {{with the engine}} running (to for example {{retrieve}} an item, open a gate or close a garage door, etc.), a vehicle in false park can shift into <b>powered</b> <b>reverse</b> from {{a few seconds to}} several minutes or longer, after the driver has exited, and then run over the driver or a bystander.|$|R
2500|$|The Tri Glide {{is powered}} by a [...] {{overhead}} valve V-twin engine that produces a claimed 101 ft lbs of torque and 70 rear wheel horsepower, and is equipped with a six speed transmission.

50|$|In 1907 the {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} new domed boilers, replacing the domeless versions originally fitted. This increased their weight by 3 tons which improved their adhesion factor. <b>Power</b> <b>reversing</b> gear was fitted in 1922, making them {{the first class}} in New South Wales to be so fitted.

25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated <b>power</b> <b>reverser</b> and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free-running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The Bonapartes {{were back}} in Ajaccio in 1797 under the {{protection}} of General Napoleon. Soon after Napoleon became First Consul and then emperor, using his office to spread revolution throughout Europe. In 1811 he made Ajaccio the capital of the new Department of Corsica. Despite his subsequent defeat by the Prussians, Russians, and British, his exile and his death, no victorious <b>power</b> <b>reversed</b> that decision or tried to remove Corsica from France. Among the natives, though Corsican nationalism is strong, and feeling often runs high in favour of a union with Italy; loyalty to France, however, as evidenced by elections, remains stronger.|$|R
50|$|The telemotor {{was invented}} around 1872 by Andrew Betts Brown, {{allowing}} elaborate mechanisms between {{the control room}} and the engine to be greatly simplified. Steam steering engines had {{the characteristics of a}} modern servomechanism: an input, an output, an error signal, and a means for amplifying the error signal used for negative feedback to drive the error towards zero. The Ragonnet <b>power</b> <b>reverse</b> mechanism was a general purpose air or steam-powered servo amplifier for linear motion patented in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Both K5 {{locomotives}} {{were given}} a 130-P-75 tender carrying 12,475 gal of water and 22 ST of coal. Surprisingly for such large locomotives built at such a late date, both were equipped for hand firing. Both were fitted with Worthington-pattern feedwater heaters, <b>power</b> <b>reverse,</b> unflanged main drivers, and both used nickel steel boiler shells. As built, both carried their bell on the smokebox front, hung below the headlight; this arrangement was common on other roads {{but at the time}} unique on the PRR.|$|E
50|$|The E6 was {{designed}} by the Pennsy's General Superintendent of Motive Power, Lines East, Alfred W. Gibbs, and his team. They produced an Atlantic of modern design, featuring a large and free-steaming boiler, outside Walschaert valve gear, piston valves on the cylinders, and a cast steel KW pattern trailing truck designed by the PRR's Chief Mechanical Engineer, William F. Kiesel, Jr. Modern features never present on the E6 design, and never retrofitted, included the mechanical stoker, <b>power</b> <b>reverse</b> and feedwater heater.|$|E
