25|$|A {{contract}} {{arises when}} {{the parties agree}} {{that there is an}} agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.|$|E
25|$|Note that Promissory Estoppel {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E
25|$|Unilateral mistake {{occurs when}} only one <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is mistaken {{as to the}} terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless {{it was determined that}} the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried {{to take advantage of the}} mistake. HCA 5] It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in Lewis v. Avery where Lord Denning MR held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> {{may seek}} <b>to</b> prevent forum {{shopping}} by inserting a forum selection clause or {{a choice of}} law clause in their contract. Such clauses are now generally enforced by the courts.|$|R
25|$|A {{legally binding}} {{contract}} occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance {{from the other}} party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration {{is concerned with the}} bargain of the contract, each <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, {{in the sense of the}} law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of Third-party standing: A {{party may}} only assert {{his or her}} own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; {{exceptions}} exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the 1st Amendment rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the next friend doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract.</b> One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the qui tam provision of the Civil False Claims Act.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} 1999 Act {{preserves}} the promisee's right {{to enforce the}} contract as it stood at common law, an outstanding issue is to what extent a promisee can claim damages for a benefit {{on behalf of a}} third party, if he has suffered no personal loss. In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, Lord Denning MR held that a father could claim damages for disappointment (beyond the financial cost) of a terrible holiday experience on behalf of his family. However, a majority of the House of Lords in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd disapproved any broad ability of a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> to claim damages on behalf of a third party, except perhaps in a limited set of consumer contracts. There is disagreement about whether this will remain the case. Difficulties also remain in cases involving houses built with defects, which are sold to a buyer, who subsequently sells to a third party. It appears that neither the initial buyer can claim on behalf of the third party, and nor will the third party be able to claim under the 1999 Act, as they will typically not be identified by the original contract (or known) in advance. Apart from this instance relating to tort, in practice the doctrine of privity is entirely ignored in numerous situations, throughout the law of trusts and agency.|$|E
50|$|In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court {{not only}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> could expand the limited scope of judicial review, but stated that even the courts cannot expand it, even for extraordinary circumstances.|$|R
50|$|One or both <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> may {{demand the}} other {{nominate}} a domicilium citandi et executandi, typically {{in order to}} expedite later legal procedures relating <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> by {{making it impossible for}} <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> claim that <b>a</b> legal notice was not received.|$|R
25|$|A {{mistake is}} an {{incorrect}} understanding {{by one or}} more <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> and may be used as grounds to invalidate the agreement. Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.|$|R
500|$|Over {{the next}} 200 years, {{judicial}} decisions differed {{as to whether}} or not a third party could enforce a contract that benefited them. The issue was settled in 1861 by [...] Tweddle v Atkinson [...] 121 ER 762, that confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him. This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd [...] AC 847 in 1915, where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> could sue on it. This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> can sue on it".|$|E

50|$|In private civil matters, the {{limitations}} period may generally be shortened or lengthened by {{agreement of the}} parties. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> for sale of goods may reduce {{the limitations}} period to one year but not extend it.|$|R
50|$|Article 3 {{states the}} general rule that the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> have freedom of choice over the {{applicable}} law. To exercise this choice either express words may be used or the intention should be demonstrated with reasonable certainty {{by the terms of}} the contract or the circumstances of the case.|$|R
2500|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of {{privity of contract}} provides that only those who are <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> may sue or be sued on it. The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [...] immediately showed that the doctrine {{had the effect of}} defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [...] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite	 [...] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading.|$|E
2500|$|Spyware which attacks {{affiliate}} networks {{places the}} spyware operator's affiliate tag on the user's activity – replacing any other tag, {{if there is}} one. The spyware operator is the only party that gains from this. The user has their choices thwarted, a legitimate affiliate loses revenue, networks' reputations are injured, and vendors are harmed by having to pay out affiliate revenues to an [...] "affiliate" [...] who is not <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract.</b> Affiliate fraud {{is a violation of}} the terms of service of most affiliate marketing networks. As a result, spyware operators such as 180 Solutions have been terminated from affiliate networks including LinkShare and ShareSale. Mobile devices can also be vulnerable to chargeware, which manipulates users into illegitimate mobile charges.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of case law concerning the proper treatment of a scrivener's error. For example, where the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> make <b>an</b> oral agreement that, when reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> writing, is mis-transcribed, the aggrieved <b>party</b> is entitled <b>to</b> reformation so that the writing corresponds to the oral agreement.|$|R
50|$|Exclusive rights can be {{established}} by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon {{the extent to which}} others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> will be affected by the exclusivity.|$|R

6000|$|Again, if the United States be not a {{government}} proper, but {{an association of}} States {{in the nature of}} contract merely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?

6000|$|It is, I believe, a {{principle}} in law {{that when one}} <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object {{for which it is}} made, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain't good law. [Voices: [...] "Yes!"] Well, now if that be right, I go for rescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into a free State; and I should like to know the difference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between our making a free State of Missouri and their making a slave State of Kansas. [Great applause.] There ain't one bit of difference, except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity. But I have never said--and the Whig party has never said--and those who oppose the Nebraska bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave States. Our platform says just the contrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave States--not because slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union. We grant a fugitive slave law because it is so [...] "nominated in the bond;" [...] because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to carry out this agreement. But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by their example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did not consider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as they did about it [Voices: [...] "Good!"], {{and that is what we}} propose--not to interfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it), and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A voice: [...] "No!"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I'm for living up to it; but I go no further; I'm not bound to do more, and I won't agree any further. [Great applause.] ...|$|E
