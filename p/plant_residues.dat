25|$|Laterite soils {{have a high}} clay content, which {{mean they}} have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and <b>plant</b> <b>residues,</b> and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|E

The goal {{of this study was to}} explore the influence of soil structure, that is, soil pore spatial arrangements, with and without presence of <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> on (i) decomposition of added <b>plant</b> <b>residue,</b> (ii) CO 2 emission from soil, and (iii) structure of soil bacterial communities. The study consisted of several soil incubation experiments with samples of contrasting pore characteristics with/without <b>plant</b> <b>residue,</b> accompanied by X-ray micro-tomographic analyses of soil pores and by microbial community analysis of amplified 16 S- 18 S rRNA genes via pyrosequencing. We observed that in the samples with substantial presence of air-filled well-connected large (> 30 µm) pores, 75 - 80 % of the added <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> was decomposed, cumulative CO 2 emission constituted 1, 200 µm C g(- 1) soil, and movement of C from decomposing <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> into adjacent soil was insignificant. In the samples with greater abundance of water-filled small pores, 60 % of the added <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> was decomposed, cumulative CO 2 emission constituted 2, 000 µm C g(- 1) soil, and the movement of residue C into adjacent soil was substantial. In the absence of <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> the influence of pore characteristics on CO 2 emission, that is on decomposition of the native soil organic C, was negligible. The microbial communities on the <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> in the samples with large pores had more microbial groups known to be cellulose decomposers, that is, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, while a number of oligotrophic Acidobacteria groups were more abundant on the <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> from the samples with small pores.

40|$|Introduction Various {{factors like}} climatic conditions, vegetation, soil properties, topography, time, <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> quality and crop {{management}} strategies affect the decomposition rate of organic carbon (OC) and its residence time in soil. <b>Plant</b> <b>residue</b> management concerns nutrients recycling, carbon recycling in ecosystems {{and the increasing}} CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. <b>Plant</b> <b>residue</b> decomposition is a fundamental process in recycling of organic matter and elements in most ecosystems. Soil management, particularly <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> management, changes soil organic matter both qualitatively and quantitatively. Soil respiration and carbon loss are affected by soil temperature, soil moisture, air temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. In natural agro-ecosystems, residue contains different concentrations of nitrogen. It {{is important to understand}} the rate and processes involved in <b>plant</b> <b>residue</b> decomposition, as these residues continue {{to be added to the}} soil under different weather conditions, especially in arid and semi-arid climates. Material and methods Organic carbon mineralization of alfalfa residue with different nitrogen concentrations was assessed in different climatic conditions using split-plot experiments over time and the effects of climate was determined using composite analysis. The climatic conditions were classified as warm-arid (Jiroft), temperate arid (Narab) and cold semi-arid (Sardouiyeh) using cluster analysis and the nitrogen (N) concentrations of alfalfa residue were low, medium and high. The alfalfa residue incubated for four different time periods (2, 4, 6 and 8 months). The dynamics of organic carbon in different regions measured using litter bags (20 × 10 cm) containing 20 g alfalfa residue of 2 - 10 mm length which were placed on the soil surface. Results and discussion The results of this study showed that in a warm-arid (Jiroft), carbon loss and the carbon decomposition rate constant were low in a cold semi-arid (Sardouiyeh). The most suitable temperatures occurred from April to October in arid and semiarid climates and soil moisture is probably the key contributor to the rate of decomposition. The highest carbon loss in alfalfa in the cold, semiarid climate for a period of 8 months was 32. 64...|$|R

A field experiment was conducted to measure the soil microbial response to adding grain sorghum residue in both tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) agricultural ecosystems. The residue mineralized similarly in both systems, but the NT microbial population was stimulated significantly greater than CT. The fungal PLFA in NT 0 - 5 cm was higher than NT 5 - 15 cm, CT 0 - 5 cm, or CT 5 - 15 cm.
