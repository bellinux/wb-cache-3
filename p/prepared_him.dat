5|$|In mid-1944, Raw was {{transferred}} to Egypt and undertook an operational conversion course that <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> to fly Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in combat. In July that year he was posted to No. 178 Squadron RAF, a British B-24 Liberator unit based near Foggia in southern Italy. While serving with this squadron, Raw took part in operations in the eastern Mediterranean region as well as Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. During August 1944 the long-range bomber units controlled by No. 205 Group RAF, including No. 178 Squadron, undertook several risky operations {{as part of the}} Warsaw airlift to supply the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising. Raw participated in three of these flights. His bomber was the only aircraft to deliver its cargo to Warsaw during a mission on 16August; Raw subsequently received the Polish Cross of Valour in February 1945 for this achievement. One of his other flights to Warsaw was conducted on 1September, but due to bad weather Raw was unable to see the city at the time he dropped the load of supplies.|$|E
5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning {{at the age of}} 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.|$|E

5|$|Violence again {{broke out}} after the assassination; Isabeau had troops patrol Paris and, to protect the Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne, she again left the city for Melun. In August she staged an entry to Paris for the Dauphin, and early {{in the new year}} Charles signed an {{ordinance}} giving the 13-year-old the power to rule in the Queen's absence. During these years Isabeau's greatest concern was the Dauphin's safety as she <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> to take up the duties of the King; she formed alliances to further those aims. At this point the Queen and her influence were still crucial to the power struggle. Physical control of Isabeau and her children became important to both parties and she was frequently forced to change sides, for which she was criticized and called unstable. She joined the Burgundians from 1409 to 1413, and switched sides to form an alliance with the Orléanists from 1413 to 1415.|$|E
5|$|When he was {{fourteen}} {{he was sent}} to Winchester College, which was known as both the most academic of the main public schools and also for its discomfort. Schuster's time at St George's had <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for discomfort, however, and he was noted as being very proud of attending the school. While at Winchester Schuster played Winchester College football and was occasionally involved in debates; he was not, however, noted as a particularly exceptional pupil. He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1892; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student, which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying. Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949, an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford. After graduation, he applied to become a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford but was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{spent the}} summer after college in the San Juan {{volcanic}} field of Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman {{in his study of}} two extinct calderas. This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Motivated by {{his love}} of adventure, Burton got the {{approval}} of the Royal Geographical Society for an exploration of the area, and he gained permission from {{the board of directors of}} the British East India Company to take leave from the army. His seven years in India gave Burton a familiarity with the customs and behaviour of Muslims and <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> to attempt a Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca and, in this case, Medina). It was this journey, undertaken in 1853, which first made Burton famous. He had planned it whilst traveling disguised among the Muslims of Sindh, and had laboriously prepared for the adventure by study and practice (including undergoing the Muslim tradition of circumcision to further lower the risk of being discovered).|$|E
25|$|French {{had already}} created (1909–1912) a major {{memorial}} statue of Lincoln—this one standing—for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His {{previous studies of}} Lincoln—which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860—had <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for the challenging task of the larger statue. For the national memorial, he and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, each time making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed the President not in an ordinary 19th-century seat, but in a classical chair including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.|$|E
25|$|Frindall {{was also}} known for {{producing}} scoring charts for many of his tours with England. He modified the linear scoring system invented by John Atkinson Pendlington and developed by Australian scorer Bill Ferguson into a version that {{is known as the}} Frindall system. Frindall met Ferguson in 1953, when he was 14 years old. The concentration needed to maintain such consistently high-quality work was immense, and Frindall believed it was his time in the RAF that <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for the task. Writing honed by his training to be an architect meant that each page was beautifully laid out and easy to read. Every scorecard, like the wagon-wheels he produced to show where a batsman scored his runs after playing a significant innings, was a work of art. Frindall's work was so meticulously accurate that the commentators would habitually trust his figures if they differed from the official scoreboard.|$|E

25|$|Cadoc {{was born}} in Monmouthshire around the year 497. An angel {{announced}} his birth and summoned the hermit Meuthi to baptise and teach him. A holy well sprang up for his baptism and afterwards flowed with wine and milk. It is {{thought that he was}} baptised as Cathmail (Cadfael). After the birth of his son, Gwynllyw went on a wild celebratory raid with a new band of fearless warriors. Among other livestock, he stole the cow of an Irish monk, St. Tathyw of Caerwent. This is probably Tathan, a reputed early abbot of nearby Caerwent whose dedications appear around Llantwit Major. Tathyw was not afraid of Gwynllyw and boldly went to confront him, demanding the return of the cow. On a sudden impulse, or perhaps guided by divine inspiration, Gwynllyw decided Cadoc would go to live under the monk's care, and he was sent away to be educated at Tathyw's monastery in Caerwent. Cadoc picked up a basic knowledge of Latin and received a rudimentary education that <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for further studies in Ireland and Wales. Most important, Cadoc learned to appreciate the life of a monk and a priest.|$|E

500|$|Zong was {{the first}} command of Luke Collingwood, {{formerly}} the surgeon on the William. While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command, ship's surgeons were typically involved in selecting slaves for purchase in Africa, so their medical expertise supported the determination of [...] "commodity value" [...] for a captive. If the surgeon rejected a captive, that individual suffered [...] "commercial death", being of no value, and was liable to be killed by African handlers. Sometimes these killings happened {{in the presence of}} the surgeon. It is likely that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass-killing of slaves. As the historian Jeremy Krikler commented, this may have <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> psychologically to condone the massacre that took place on the Zong. Zong first mate was James Kelsall, who had also served on the William.|$|E

500|$|Not much {{is known}} about Cranmer's {{thoughts}} and experiences during his three decades at Cambridge. Traditionally, he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for the adoption of Lutheran ideas, which were spreading during the 1520s. However, a study of his marginalia reveals an early antipathy to Martin Luther and an admiration for Erasmus. When Cardinal Wolsey, the king's Lord Chancellor, selected several Cambridge scholars, including Edward Lee, Stephen Gardiner and Richard Sampson, to be diplomats throughout Europe, Cranmer was chosen to take a minor role in the English embassy in Spain. Two recently discovered letters written by Cranmer describe an early encounter with the king, Henry VIII of England: [...] upon Cranmer's return from Spain, in June 1527, the king personally interviewed Cranmer for half an hour. [...] Cranmer described the king as [...] "the kindest of princes".|$|E
500|$|Bouck sent James, Slape and Creger {{to set up}} an {{observation}} post in a house on {{the eastern side of the}} village that had been abandoned by Task Force X. Accompanying them, he spotted in the dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 German troops headed toward them from the east. Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were Fallschirmjäger, among the best soldiers Germany could field. None of his training or experience <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> for this situation, outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1. Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit. The platoon's telephone land line to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out, but their SCR-300 radio still worked. Bouck reached Regimental headquarters at Hünningen on the radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action.

500|$|Returning to Louisville, Blackburn was fêted at the Galt House hotel. For weeks, receptions {{were held}} in his honor, gifts of {{appreciation}} poured in from across the state and region, and he was hailed as the [...] "Hero of Hickman". It was against this backdrop that he resumed his gubernatorial campaign in November 1878. Two other men also sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination: Lieutenant Governor John C. Underwood and former Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones. Before the yellow fever outbreak, Underwood had been the favorite, but public sentiment had turned in Blackburn's favor after his service {{to the people of}} Hickman. Underwood questioned whether Blackburn's medical background had adequately <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> to be the state's chief executive; he also mounted a failed legal challenge that claimed Blackburn had not met the constitutional state residency requirement of seven years. In late March 1879, however, Underwood determined {{that he would not be}} able to overcome the [...] "avalanche" [...] of support for Blackburn and withdrew his candidacy. At the May 1 Democratic nominating convention, Blackburn was nominated by an overwhelming majority—935 delegates to the convention voted for him compared to just 22 for Jones.|$|E
