We provide several results on <b>paintability</b> of graphs in the model introduced by Schauz [13] and Zhu [20]. We prove that the on-line version of Ohba's conjecture is true {{in the class of}} planar graphs. We also consider several alternate on-line list colouring models...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} list {{coloring}} number of k-uniform k-partite hypergraphs. Answering {{a question of}} Ramamurthi and West, we present a new upper bound which generalizes Alon and Tarsi’s bound for bipartite graphs, the case k = 2. Our results hold even for <b>paintability</b> (on-line list colorability). To prove this additional strengthening, we provide a new subject-specific version of the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe extend results about {{critically}} k-colorable graphs to choosability and <b>paintability</b> (list colorability and on-line list colorability). Using {{a strong}} version of Brooks’ Theorem, we generalize Gallai’s Theorem {{about the structure}} of the low-degree subgraph of critically k-colorable graphs, and introduce a more adequate lowest-degree subgraph. We prove lower bounds for the edge density of critical graphs, and generalize Heawood’s Map-Coloring Theorem about graphs on higher surfaces to <b>paintability.</b> We also show that on a fixed given surface, there are only finitely many critically k-paintable/k-choosable/k-colorable graphs, if k≥ 6. In this situation, we can determine in polynomial time k-paintability, k-choosability and k-colorability, by giving a polynomial time coloring strategy for “Mrs.  Correct”. Our generalizations of k-choosability theorems also concern the treatment of non-constant list sizes (non-constant k). Finally, we use a Ramsey-type lemma to deduce all 2 -paintable, 2 -choosable, critically 3 -paintable and critically 3 -choosable graphs, with respect to vertex deletion and to edge deletion...|$|E

Moreover, {{atomic force microscopy}} and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses were performed on the specimens to {{explore the influence of}} helium plasma jet on the physical and chemical properties of the glazes, microscopically. AFM analysis reveals surface etching resulted from the bombardment of the solid surfaces by the APPJ using helium fed gas. The process aims to enhance adhesive properties of glaze surfaces.|$|E
30|$|Whilst the {{addition}} of a fire retardant to wood may improve its flammability properties, it may {{come at the expense of}} intrinsic properties such as strength or increased smoke production. Fire retardants must, therefore, be formulated for best overall performance, including consideration of the hydrophilicity, glueability, <b>paintability</b> and corrosion effects of the chemical to be used in conjunction with wood. The fire retardancy of wood remains a very complex scientific problem for which close collaboration between different disciplines is required.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a coloring game on graphs, {{in which each}} vertex v of a graph G owns a stack of ℓv− 1 erasers. In each round of this game the first player Mr. Paint takes an unused color, and colors some of the uncolored vertices. He might color adjacent vertices with this color – something which is considered “incorrect”. However, Mrs. Correct is positioned next to him, and corrects his incorrect coloring, i. e., she uses {{up some of the}} erasers – while stocks (stacks) last – to partially undo his assignment of the new color. If she has a winning strategy, i. e., she is able to enforce a correct and complete final graph coloring, then we say that G is ℓ-paintable. Our game provides an adequate game-theoretic approach to list coloring problems. The new concept is actually more general than the common setting with lists of available colors. It could have applications in time scheduling, when the available time slots are not known in advance. We give an example that shows that the two notions are not equivalent; ℓ-paintability is stronger than ℓ-list colorability. Nevertheless, many deep theorems about list colorability remain true in the context of <b>paintability.</b> We demonstrate this fact by proving strengthened versions of classical list coloring theorems. Among the obtained extensions are <b>paintability</b> versions of Thomassen’s, Galvin’s and Shannon’s Theorems...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the environmental credentials of a timber treatment, its ancillary properties, and the effect it has on that of timber, must be assessed. The hydrophilic character of wood is one of which. It {{gives rise to a}} variable equilibrium moisture content, which can result in poor dimensional stability and low resistance to microbiological decay. Fire retardants can be hygroscopic and thus attract water into the wood structure. Other properties include the corrosion, glueability and <b>paintability</b> of the fire retardant treated timber, all of which should be considered carefully depending on the end use of the product.|$|E

An alloy of this composition exhibited superior corrosion resistance, high hardness, and a smooth, uniform, fine-grained deposit, with improved cathodic current efficiency.

The paint number of a graph G is the least k such {{that there is an}} algorithm to produce a successful coloring with no vertex being shown more than k times; it is at least the choice number.

40|$|Abstract. Galvannealed steels are {{produced}} by reheating of Zinc-coated steels, in which the iron and the zinc are interdiffused to form Zn-Fe intermatallic compound. In recent years, application of galvannealed steel has increased due to its excellent corrosion resistance, good weldability and <b>paintability.</b> Galvannealed production requires strict control of processing conditions to obtain an optimal alloying degree in the coatings. The analysis of the alloying degree is very important since they {{are closely related to}} the corrosion and mechanical properties. This study is measurement of alloying degree of the galvannealed steel by using the XRD. Partial least squares (PLS) model is a powerful multivariate tool that has been successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of data in XRD. The alloying degree was determined by using PLS regression to a concentration accuracy of 0. 2 %. The XRD analysis and proposed PLS model can be successfully used to determine the alloying degree of industrially produced galvannealed steel...|$|E
40|$|Surface texture {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} factors and important functionality indicators in the performance of high precision and nanoscale devices and components. The functions that have been identified in various studies include wear, friction, lubrication, corrosion, fatigue, coating, <b>paintability,</b> etc. [1 - 3]. It is also reported that the wear rates of surfaces in operational service is determined by roughness, waviness and the multi-scalar topographic features of a surface, such as random peaks/pits and ridges/valleys. These functional topographical features will impact directly on wear mechanics and physical properties of a whole system, such as hip joint replacement system in bioengineering [4 - 9]. For example, during functional operation of interacting surfaces, peaks and ridges will act as sites of high contact stresses and abrasion; consequently wear particles and debris will be generated by such surface topographical features, whereas the pits and valleys will affect the lubrication and fluid retention properties. In this situation, a vitally important consideration for functional characterisation must be the appropriate separation of the different components of surfaces, which is not only to extract roughness, waviness and form error, but should also be extended to all multi-scalar topographical events over surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Propylene was {{polymerized}} with homogeneous and heterogeneous metallocene catalysts. In {{addition to}} homopolymerizations, copolymerizations {{were conducted with}} α-olefins, dienes and functional comonomers. Propylene/ 1, 9 -decadiene copolymers were polymerized with racemic dimethylsilanylbis(2 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1 -indenyl) zirconium dichloride supported on methylaluminoxane-modified silica. Rheological tests showed long-chain branching in the copolymers, even with comonomer incorporations of less than 1  mol %. Hydroxyl functional propylene/ 10 -undecen- 1 -ol copolymers were polymerized with homogeneous racemic dimethylsilanylbis(2 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1 -indenyl) zirconium dichloride. Addition of triisobutylaluminum eliminated the drop in molecular weight with increasing comonomer content, and the interactions between the active center and the hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the comonomer chain were more efficiently blocked. Catalyst activity was improved by increase in the proportion of methylaluminoxane in the cocatalyst mixture. Functionality contents up to 2  mol % were obtained by lowering pressure. The functional polypropylene exhibited significantly enhanced peel strength and <b>paintability</b> relative to a reference homopolypropylene. Adhesion properties were improved not only in the copolymer but also in a blend consisting of propylene homopolymer and functional polypropylene, even when functionality content was only 0. 17  wt %. The functional polypropylene slightly increased the adhesion between polypropylene and polyamide phase or silica filler, although the effect on impact strength was not as good as desired. In copolymerization with metallocene catalysts, the comonomer distribution is uniform along the polypropylene backbone and the stereospecificity is maintained. The properties of the polypropylene are dramatically affected even with comonomer incorporations less than 1  mol %, regardless of whether the comonomer is a non-conjugated diene to induce long-chain branching or contains a functional group to improve adhesion properties. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Electroplated {{zinc alloys}} can provide {{increased}} corrosion protection for automotive body panels compared with zinc coatings of similar thickness. As a result, their use is becoming widespread. In particular, outstanding {{results have been}} reported in the literature for the corrosion resistance of zinc-manganese, and the alloys are said to offer good <b>paintability,</b> weldability and formability. However, the production of zinc-manganese coatings is restricted by the instability of the sulphate-citrate bath from which the alloy is usually deposited. The solution deteriorates rapidly and precipitates appear in the bath. The aim of this research was to investigate both the process of alloy deposition from the sulphate-citrate bath and the solution instability. The electrodeposition of zinc-manganese was assessed in terms of the polarisation behaviour of the system, in order to determine the role of the bath components and the operating parameters in the deposition process. The coatings were analysed using scanning electron microscopy, and the efficiency of metal deposition was established. The sodium citrate complexant was not found to significantly move the deposition potentials of zinc and manganese together. Instead, its action as a buffer can be used to explain metal deposition and the polarisation behaviour of the system. The sodium citrate suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, such that manganese can be deposited from the electrolyte. The bath deterioration with time and the resulting precipitate were examined using a variety of chemical techniques including spectroscopic methods, namely ultraviolet and visible, atomic absorption and infrared. Bath discolouration and precipitation were found to be two separate phenomena. The precipitate was determined to be a citrate of known composition with a ratio of Mn 2 + ions to Zn 2 + ions of 2 : 1. The formation took several days, and it was precipitated once the solubility limit in the bath was exceeded. Solution discolouration resulted from reactions occurring after the oxidation of Mn 2 + ions and could be delayed by the use of antioxidants...|$|E
3000|$|Noh et al. [2] {{employed}} O 2 APPJ as {{a second}} step of treatment of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) after chemical treatment. PTFE is extensively utilized in synthetic vascular surgery and medical devices because of its chemical and mechanical stability, but it is limited {{due to lack of}} haemocompatibility. APPJ is a suitable choice as it could improve cellular interaction property and tailor the biological response to the implant. Sorrentino and Carrino demonstrated that an oxygen cold plasma treatment could improve wettability and adhesion of Al 2024 surface which is an important alloy at aeronautical application. It should be painted to prevent corrosion which is caused by aeronautical critical environmental condition. They also investigated the influence of different parameters of plasma on the durability of paint on its surface [4]. The plasma processing results in physical and chemical modification in scale of several nanometres (first few molecular layers) while maintaining the properties of the bulk unchanged [3]. There are many investigations, in which plasma was utilized to improve surface properties of materials such as polymers, textiles and etc. Their physical and chemical properties after plasma treatment were examined in detail as well. But there are a few studies investigated the effect of plasma on the properties of non-carbonic base surfaces and needs more investigations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The aim {{of this paper is to}} utilize atmospheric pressure helium plasma jet on Raw and Frit glaze surfaces to improve their <b>paintability</b> and explore the effect of the plasma on their surface properties which seems not fully understood so far. Helium, in comparison with other gases, could be considered the most convenient gas working at atmospheric pressure, as it allows stabilizing homogeneous glow discharges at lower sustaining voltages and inter-electrode gaps. It is also very suitable for surface treatment because of low degradation effect and high properties of cross linking and functionalizing on to the surface [8, 10]. We used helium plasma as it is capable of maintaining simultaneous stability and reactivity, while in other inert gases chemical reactivity is obtained by adding a small amount of reactive gases at the expense of stability and increasing the temperature which may cause non-uniform processing.|$|E
40|$|Structured {{surfaces}} are increasingly popular in manufacturing {{due to their}} ability to affect the function of a component, for example <b>paintability</b> and adhesiveness. Structured surfaces usually have complex geometrical structures on the micrometre to nanometre scale. These complex surface structures are challenging in terms of their measurement. For example, one widely recognised challenge comes from the increasingly high requirement of both measuring efficiency and measuring accuracy. Intelligent sampling is regarded as part of the solution to this challenge. In this research, statistical sampling and signal sampling are investigated for the measurement of structured surfaces. Firstly, the widely used technique of uniform sampling is reviewed. Determination criteria for the sampling conditions of uniform sampling, i. e. the sampling intervals and lengths, are discussed. Four types of efficient (intelligent) sampling techniques, which were initially developed for the fields of statistics, computer graphics and coordinate metrology, are investigated. The intelligent techniques include: jittered uniform sampling, low-discrepancy sampling, model-based sampling and adaptive sampling. However, there are issues when applying these techniques to practical instruments; for example, they do not consider the measuring principles, such as the sensing mode or scanning method. Considering the measurement of surface topography, a sequential profiling adaptive sampling technique is proposed for raster scan-based stylus profilometers. Numerical evidence shows that the adaptive technique is promising for the measurement of linear patterns and tessellated structured surfaces. To examine the performance of these intelligent sampling techniques, reconstruction techniques and error evaluation approaches are studied. A boundary segmentation algorithm has been developed to characterise the feature boundaries of surface features. With a sampling test toolbox, developed as part of the project, a sampling performance test is carried out in which the performance of seven selected sampling techniques is analysed. The experimental results show that adaptive sampling and model-based sampling methods have significant advantages over other methods. The proposed sequential profiling adaptive sampling has good performance in the measurement of linear patterned surfaces. However, there are difficulties in fully enabling intelligence sampling for practical measurements. For example, the relationship between sampling and reconstruction has not been clearly understood. If the difficulties can be successfully addressed, intelligent sampling can be of promise in the next generation of measurement techniques...|$|E
