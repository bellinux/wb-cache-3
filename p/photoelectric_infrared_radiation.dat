40|$|Far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation,</b> a {{subdivision}} {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum, is beneficial for long-term tissue healing, anti-inflammatory effects, growth promotion, sleep modulation, acceleration of microcirculation, and pain relief. We investigated if far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> is beneficial for renal proximal tubule cell cultivation and renal tissue engineering. We observed the effects of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> on renal proximal tubules cells, including its effects on cell proliferation, gene and protein expression, and viability. We also examined the protective effects of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> against cisplatin, a nephrotoxic agent, using the human proximal tubule cell line HK- 2. We found that daily exposure to far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> for 30 min significantly increased rabbit renal proximal tubule cell proliferation in vitro, as assessed by MTT assay. Far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> was not only beneficial to renal proximal tubule cell proliferation, it also increased the expression of ATPase Na+/K+ subunit alpha 1 and glucose transporter 1, as determined by western blotting. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> enhanced CDK 5 R 1, GNAS, NPPB, and TEK expression. In the proximal tubule cell line HK- 2, far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> protected against cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity by reducing apoptosis. Renal proximal tubule cell cultivation with far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure resulted in better cell proliferation, significantly higher ATPase Na+/K+ subunit alpha 1 and glucose transporter 1 expression, and significantly enhanced expression of CDK 5 R 1, GNAS, NPPB, and TEK. These results suggest that far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> improves cell proliferation and differentiation. In HK- 2 cells, far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> mediated protective effects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing apoptosis, as indicated by flow cytometry and caspase- 3 assay...|$|R

Aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> offers effective stimulation of the vestibular organ, whether it is well tolerated by the patients and especially whether it is a viable alternative to warm air stimulation in patients with defects of the tympanic membrane and radical mastoid cavities. Patients with perforations of the tympanic membrane (n = 15) and with radical mastoid cavities (n = 13) were tested both with near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> and warm dry air. A caloric-induced nystagmus could be seen equally effectively and rapidly in all patients. Contrary to stimulation with warm dry air, no paradoxical nystagmus was observed following caloric irrigation with a warm stimulus (near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation).</b> Results of a questionnaire showed excellent patient acceptance of near infrared stimulation with no arousal effects or unpleasant feeling. In conclusion, near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> proved to be an alternative method of caloric irrigation to warm dry air in patients with tympanic membrane defects and radical mastoid cavities. Near <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> is pleasant, quick, contact free, sterile and quiet. With this method an effective caloric warm stimulus is available.

30|$|Traditional <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> {{measurement}} mainly {{includes two}} kinds, one is direct measurement based on temperature and wavelength, {{the other is}} indirect measurement based on image. The results of direct measurement are relatively accurate, but {{it is impossible to}} realize the rapid measurement of remote targets, and the equipment required for direct measurement is relatively complex [1]. Therefore, the research in the field of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement mainly focuses on indirect measurement. The accuracy of indirect <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement is affected by many factors. Accurate calibration of measuring equipment is required to obtain accurate measurement values. This calibration requires an accurate calculation model, and the establishment of the model is closely related to the idea of the model, the environmental condition of the measurement area and the time of measurement [2 – 11]. Material motion is the source of <b>infrared</b> thermal <b>radiation.</b> The size of <b>infrared</b> thermal <b>radiation</b> is mainly affected by the temperature of the object {{and the nature of the}} material itself. Describing thermal radiation requires some commonly used basic quantities. Thermal radiation has both the general law of electromagnetic waves and the particularity of its radiation. Therefore, in order to better describe the measurement technology of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> characteristics, we should first master the basic metrics describing <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation.</b> The <b>radiation</b> calibration of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement system based on image is the basis of the measurement of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> characteristics. The purpose of radiation calibration is to obtain its own response parameters including the response rate and its own bias response, so as to establish a quantitative relationship between the radiation output of the radiation source and the digital output gray value of the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement system. At present, in the field of measurement, the common radiation calibration methods of image-based <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> measurement system mainly include close-range standard extended source image calibration method and high-temperature cavity type black body parallel optical tube calibration method.|$|R

In the present study, we investigated the effects of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> on collagen and elastin production in dermal fibroblasts, {{as well as the}} clinical and histopathologic effects of <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> on photo-aged facial skin lesions. In order {{to determine the effects of}} <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> on collagen and elastin production, dermal fibroblasts were exposed to <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> for varying lengths of time and collagen and elastin contents were subsequently determined. Additionally, 20 patients with mild to moderate facial wrinkles and hyperpigmented lesions received daily treatments of far <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> (900 to 1000 µm) for six-months. During the treatment, patients and a medical observer conducted independent photographic and clinical evaluations every 4 weeks, and skin biopsies were obtained for histological analysis at baseline and one month post-treatment. We found that the content of collagen and elastin produced by the fibroblasts increased after <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation,</b> and that this increase was proportional to the duration of irradiation exposure. Following 6 months of treatment, all patients reported good (51 - 75 %) improvements in skin texture and roughness. Additionally, patients noted fair (25 - 50 %) improvement in color tone of the skin; however, improvements in hyperpigmented lesions were not observed. Objective medical evaluation of the patients indicated that roughness and laxity were fairly improved, but there was no significant improvement in hyperpigmented lesions. Histological examination failed to reveal any differences as well. These results suggest that <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> may have beneficial effects on skin texture and wrinkles by increasing collagen and elastin contents from the stimulated fibroblasts. Therefore, skin treatment with <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> may be an effective and safe non-ablative remodeling method, and may also be useful in the treatment of photo-aged skin...|$|R

30|$|The {{infrared}} image {{characterizes the}} thermal properties (radiance) {{of the point}} in the scene with the brightness (grayscale) of each pixel. The wavelength of the infrared band is in the range of 0.75 to 1000 [*]μm, and its short-wavelength boundary is connected to visible light [1]. In theory, the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> of an object depends on the surface temperature, apparent area, and emissivity ε of the object, but in fact, the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> of the surrounding environment (the sky, the ocean, other objects) must be measured, and the environmental factors have complex modulation effects on the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> of the target. The <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> from the target will be selectively absorbed by some gases in the atmosphere before reaching the infrared sensor, and the airborne particles will also scatter the infrared rays, thereby causing the radiation flux to decay. When the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> from the target passes through the temperature change region, it will slightly deviate from the original direction. Since this area of heated air is unstable, the radiation deviation is irregular. This effect, called atmospheric flicker, causes the apparent direction and radiant flux of distant targets to change simultaneously.|$|R
