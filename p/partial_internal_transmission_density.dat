40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to analyse the surface {{morphology}} and optical properties of polyoxadiazoles thin films. Design/methodology/approach: A few different conducting polymers were dissolved in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolid(in) one. Then the solutions were deposited on a glass substrate by spin coating method with a different spin rate. Changes in surface topography and optical properties were observed. A confocal laser scanning microscope CLSM Zeiss LSM 5 Exciter has been used. Photos have been taken from area of 120 x 120 microns. Findings: The analysis of images and spectra has confirmed that the quality of thin films depends upon the used polymers. It was also observed that the parameters of the spin coating method have significant effect on the morphology and the optical properties. The spin rate has got a strong impact on them. Research limitations/implications: The morphology and optical properties of polyoxadiazoles thin films has been described. This paper include description how the spin rate influence on the polymer thin films. In order to use a polymer thin film in photovoltaics or optoelectronics it must have a high <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>density.</b> Further research of polymer thin films are recommended. Practical implications: The spin coating method allows to deposit a uniform thin films. It is important to know how the spin rate influence on the thin films properties. It is also important to find a new use for this group of material engineering in photovoltaic or optoelectronics devices. Originality/value: The good properties of thin films make them suitable for various applications. The value of this paper is defining the optimal parameters of spin-coating technology for polyoxadiazoles thin films. The results allow the choosing optimal parameters of the deposition process. Spin coating is a very good method to obtain thin films which are obligated to have the same thickness over the whole surface...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Balassa-Samuelson effect in 9 CEECs. Using panel cointegration techniques, we find strong {{empirical}} evidence {{in favour of}} what we call the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism since productivity growth in the open sector is found to bring about non-tradable inflation. However, we also shed new light {{on the fact that the}} impact of the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism on overall inflation is considerably attenuated by the low share of non-tradables in the consumer price index. Furthermore, we argue that because of this and the high share of food items and regulated prices, the CPI may be misleading when analysing the Balassa-Samuelson effect. The paper also shows that the appreciation of the transition economies' real exchange rate, which has become something of a stylised fact over the last decade is only partly caused not the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Instead, we argue that a trend increase in tradable prices is behind this phenomenon. Balassa-Samuelson effect, Panel cointegration, Transition economies, EMU...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSince the {{influenza}} A (H 1 N 1) {{virus has}} made headlines of newspapers in 2009, {{awareness of the}} importance of pandemic risk has risen, especially among insurers. In fact, the occurrence of a severe pandemic could cause a significant increase in mortality, and consequently might cause the bankruptcy of insurance companies. Thus, it is essential for insurers to better understand pandemic risk. This is entirely consistent with the requirements of the new European Directive Solvency 2, which encourages insurers to control all the risks they face and to hold sufficient capital for these risks. This capital can be calculated by a standard formula, an internal model or a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> model. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a way of integrating the risk of pandemic influenza in a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> model for the death guarantee and protection business. To do so, mortality risk is split into a trend and a pandemic shock event. The model takes into account the nature of available data and of the level of segmentation chosen by the insurance company (individual or aggregate data) ...|$|R

The optimal sensing thresholds for both the transmitter and receiver are obtained both in non-fading and fading networks, and an understanding is provided for how these optimal thresholds balance between the hidden and exposed node problems of CSMA.

The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the utility, test the accuracy and examine the convergence of the proposed approach for the vibration analysis of rectangular plates with <b>internal</b> supports. Both <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> line supports and complex internal supports are considered for 21 square plates of various combinations of edge support conditions. The eects of dierent size, shape and topology of the internal supports and dierent boundary conditions on the vibration response of plates are investigated. The <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> line supports may vary from a central point support to a full range of cross or diagonal line supports. Several closed-loop supports, such as ring, square and rhombus, and their combinations are studied for complex internal supports. Convergence and comparison studies are carried out to establish the correctness and accuracy of the DSC algorithm. The DSC results are compared with those in the available literature obtained by using other methods. Numerical results indicate that the DSC algorithm exhibits controllable accuracy for plate analysis and shows excellent exibility in handling complex geometries, boundary conditions and support conditions.

40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulations}} of mechanical loadings on pyrotechnic structures require {{the determination of}} the friction coefficient between steel and explosives. Our study focuses on contact pressures of around 100 [*]MPa and sliding velocities of around 10 [*]m/s. Explosives are brittle materials which fracture when submitted to such pressures in uniaxial compression. They have therefore to be confined to avoid any fracture during the tests. A new Hopkinson bar device which simultaneously enables to confine a sample and rub it on steel has therefore been designed. This device is composed of two coaxial transmission bars. It consists in a cylindrical sample confined in a steel tube, the cylindrical sample being inserted between the incident bar and the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> bar, and the confinement tube being leant against the external transmission bar. The high impedance of the external transmission bar keeps the confinement tube quasi-motionless whereas the impedance of the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> bar is calculated to reach the desired pressure and the desired velocity at the tube–sample interface. Tests have been carried out with an inert material mechanically representative of explosives. The friction coefficient and the stresses at the tube–sample interface are deduced from strain measurements on the Hopkinson bars and on the external face of the confinement tube, and from an analytical model...|$|R
