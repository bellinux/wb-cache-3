50|$|The Colegrove {{case was}} decided by a 4-3 <b>plurality.</b> <b>Plurality</b> <b>opinions</b> result when {{five or more}} Justices agree on the result in a {{particular}} case but no single rationale or opinion garners five votes. The case was voted on by seven rather than nine justices because Chief Justice Stone had just died, and Justice Robert Jackson had taken a leave to serve as chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Trials.|$|R
50|$|A {{plurality}} of the Court (Justices Douglas, White, Marshall and Brennan, {{who wrote the}} <b>plurality's</b> <b>opinion)</b> found the military's benefit policy unconstitutional, {{because there was no}} reason why military wives needed benefits any more than similarly situated military husbands. The Air Force argued that the policy was intended to save administrative costs by not forcing the military bureaucracy to determine that every wife was in fact a dependent. Justice Brennan dismissed this argument, saying that, although as an empirical matter more wives than husbands are dependent for support on their spouses, still, by automatically granting benefits to wives who might not truly be dependents, the Air Force might actually be losing money because of this policy - and the Air Force had not presented evidence to the contrary.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, {{he joined}} O'Connor's <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed in {{principle}} (though without many details) the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing {{the right to}} abortion under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion,</b> signed jointly by three justices appointed by Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, ignited a firestorm of criticism from conservatives. Kennedy had stated at least as early as 1989 that, in order to uphold precedent, he might not vote to overturn Roe. According to court insiders, Kennedy had reportedly considered overturning Roe, {{but in the end}} decided to uphold restrictions while affirming the Roe precedent.|$|E
25|$|Although only a <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion,</b> De Veau v. Braisted was {{embraced by}} a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Hotel and Restaurant Employees, 468 U.S. 491 (1984). De Veau is sometimes cited as a key case in which the Supreme Court relied heavily on congressional debate and authorizing legislation to determine congressional intent.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} concurrence, Antonin Scalia wrote for himself, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy that adverse personnel actions for speech by public employees violate the First Amendment only when their purpose is clearly retaliatory, as {{he believed it}} had been in Pickering. He attacked the <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> as creating a poorly defined procedural requirement that might well prove unworkable in practice.|$|E

25|$|A. C. Forrest, {{the editor}} of the United Church Observer in the 1960s and 1970s (and by {{extension}} the United Church itself) came under strong attack from the Canadian Jewish community for frequent editorial espousal of Palestinian rights in Israel, on the West Bank and in Gaza; many within the United Church were also uncomfortable with Forrest's position, though ultimately the church adjudged a <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinion</b> on this (and other matters) as consistent with United Church open-mindedness.|$|R
50|$|Although {{attempts}} were made to portray a totalitarian nature of an Islamic fundamentalist ideology, the events and the moderate discourse of their leaders attracted support from all human rights organizations (such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Article 19, UN Human Rights Sub-Commission, etc.) as well as from members of parliament in the UK, France, USA and the EU. The final aim of the uprising was the reinstatement of the 1973 constitution and respect of human rights in Bahrain, while preserving <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> in society.|$|R
25|$|Except for {{the three}} opening {{sections}} of the O'Connor-Kennedy-Souter opinion, Casey was a divided judgment, as no other sections of any opinion were joined {{by a majority of}} justices. However, the <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> jointly written by Justices Souter, O'Connor, and Kennedy is recognized as the lead opinion with precedential weight because each of its parts was concurred in by at least two other Justices, albeit different ones for each part.|$|E
25|$|White parted {{company with}} Rehnquist in {{strongly}} supporting the Supreme Court decisions striking down laws that discriminated {{on the basis}} of sex, agreeing with Justice William J. Brennan in 1973's Frontiero v. Richardson that laws discriminating {{on the basis of}} sex should be subject to strict scrutiny. However, only three justices joined Brennan's <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> in Frontiero; in later cases gender discrimination cases would be subjected to intermediate scrutiny (see Craig v. Boren).|$|E
25|$|Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} racial gerrymandering, where {{racial minority}} majority-electoral districts were created during Texas' 1990 redistricting to increase minority Congressional representation. The Supreme Court, in a <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion,</b> held that race was the predominant {{factor in the}} creation of the districts and that under a strict scrutiny standard the three districts were not narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.|$|E
50|$|Parliamentary systems {{originated}} in constitutional monarchies, {{in which the}} government was dually accountable to the parliament and the king: the <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> of elected assemblies was then balanced by the direction of the monarch. Over time, the power of hereditary monarchs became to be understood as untenable in a democracy, leading many constitutional monarchies to evolve into parliamentary republics, while in the remaining ones the monarch became an increasingly ceremonial figure: regardless of the presence of an elected or unelected head of state, the parliament was thus established as the dominating institution.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} representation of the Czechoslovak February 1948 coup in Rudé právo and Svobodné noviny. Its aim is to find out the difference between the periodicals and the possible change of Svobodné noviny after the replacement of the editor-in-chief during the coup. Using Krippendorff's quantitative content analysis, I find out that before the editor- in-chief's exchange, the newspaper differed. While Svobodné noviny were objective, Rudé právo contained engaged journalism. After the exchange, the differences faded away. The <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> was no longer present in Svobodné noviny, and the opposition was displayed negatively, as was the case of Rudé právo...|$|R
25|$|In Hutchins v. District of Columbia (1999) (en banc), Garland {{agreed with}} four other D.C. Circuit judges that D.C.'s Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 implicated at least some {{significant}} right of minors. He joined parts of a <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge. Garland also joined the part of Judge Judith W. Rogers's opinion (concurring in part and dissenting in part) holding that a fundamental right to intrastate travel exists.|$|E
25|$|At {{the conference}} of the Justices two days after oral argument, Justice Souter defied expectations, joining Justices O'Connor, Stevens, and Blackmun, who had {{likewise}} refused to do so three years earlier in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. This resulted in a precarious five Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions. However, Justice Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter to write a <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> that would reaffirm Roe.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{announced}} its decision May 31, 1994. Seven justices {{had agreed to}} vacate the Seventh Circuit and remand the case to district court for a determination of what exactly Churchill was fired for. Three justices joined Sandra Day O'Connor in a <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion.</b> David Souter, {{a member of that}} plurality, added a concurrence of his own. Antonin Scalia wrote a separate concurrence, joined by two other justices. John Paul Stevens wrote for himself and Harry Blackmun that the First Amendment was important enough that Churchill was entitled to the trial she sought to determine what she said.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the twenty-first century}} Justices’ citations of law review scholarship—how often they cite articles, the professional identities of authors of the cited articles, and the rankings of the law reviews in which the cited articles appear—provides an excellent prism through which to assess today’s law reviews. In addition to having had varied and rich legal careers as practitioners, policy-makers, and lower court judges, the majority of the current Justices were, at earlier points in their careers, full-time law professors. Presumably, the Justices are able to separate the wheat from the chaff in the law reviews. The present study examined whether something meaningful can be gleaned from an {{analysis of}} the modern Justices’ practice of citing law review articles. This article describes the results of an empirical study of the nearly two thousand “signed” opinions authored by the Justices—majority <b>opinions,</b> <b>plurality</b> <b>opinions,</b> concurring opinions, and dissenting opinions issued after oral arguments—dated between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011, which cited at least one American law review article. Opinions were coded to determine the following: (1) whether one or more law review articles (including law student “notes” or “comments”) were cited in the opinions; (2) which Justices wrote the opinions citing law review articles; (3) the professional status of the articles’ authors {{at the time that the}} cited articles were published (as a full-time law professor, legal practitioner, judge, law student, or “other”); and (4) the ranking of the law reviews that published the cited articles according to Washington and Lee University School of Law’s “combined score” ranking system (the “W 2 ̆ 6 L” system). The results of this coding project are contained in a lengthy appendix to this article, which lists all 1, 023 cited articles in the 1, 961 opinions issued in 792 cases. The present study demonstrates that the Justices in the twenty-first century have cited law review articles less frequently than their predecessors did in the 1970 s and 1980 s, when at least one Justice’s opinion in approximately half of the Court’s cases cited one or more law review articles (with an average of 0. 87 articles cited per opinion). During the first decade of the twenty-first century, one or more Justices cited at least one article in 37. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point of our considerations is the two books published in 2010 : “Ill Fares the Land” by the late Tony Judt and “Not for Profit” by Martha Nussbaum. The authors of both books share the conviction that neoliberal changes {{in the world of}} global capitalism radically impoverish culture and their consequences may be dramatic and irreversible. In our paper we would like to emphasize the dangers to solidarity and social cohesion posed by neoliberal postulates. We also claim that promoting the neoliberal ideology in the context of higher education and institutions of civic society endangers the very democracy understood as reasonable pluralism (in John Rawls’ terminology), consisting in rationality, <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions,</b> lifestyles and conceptions of good, as well as consensus as the aim of social and political practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} possible spiritual aspects in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books. With help {{of secondary}} literatury {{and my own}} research this thesis seeks to corroborate the idea of embodied Christianity in these books and it also seeks to overcome some Christian's presumption, that Harry Potter is a book leading its readers to occult and practise magic. The thesis presents examples of parallels between Harry Potter and some Christian principles contained in the Bible. The <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> concerning propriety or impropriety of reading Harry Potter for Christians is described. At the close the thesis deals with the attitude of Czech Christian churches towards this phenomena. Part of the thesis is also an outcome from a questionary concerning people's opinion on spiritual aspects in Harry Potter books.

25|$|In {{regard to}} the {{detention}} of detainees without charge, in section I of the O'Connor <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion,</b> the plurality relied on the time-honored traditions of war, the Geneva Convention, and {{a long list of}} other international treaties, to hold that the government had authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) to hold any enemy combatants, provided enemy combatants had been seized on the battlefield participating in active hostilities, for the sole objective of preventing an enemy combatant from returning to the battlefield, and then only so long as there continued to be “active hostilities.” The plurality held that such protective detention could be applied to both citizen and non-citizen enemy combatants.|$|E
25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this <b>Plurality</b> <b>Opinion,</b> Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone in their school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to limiting {{the size of}} donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual may give to all candidates and parties. In 2012, Shaun McCutcheon, a Republican Party activist, sought to donate more than was allowed by the federal aggregate limit on federal candidates. McCutcheon et al filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC). In 2014, the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling of the DC District Court's dismissal of McCutcheon v. FEC and struck down the aggregate limits. The <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> invalidated only the aggregate contribution limits, not limits on giving to any one candidate or party. The decisive fifth vote for McCutcheon came from Justice Thomas, who concurred in the judgment {{on the grounds that}} all contribution limits are unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of media ownership is commonly {{regarded as one}} of the crucial aspects negatively impacting on media pluralism. A high {{concentration of}} the media market increases the chances to reduce the plurality of political, cultural and social points of views. Even if ownership of the media is one of the main concerns when it comes to assessing media pluralism, the concept of media pluralism is broader as it touches many aspects, from merger control rules to editorial freedom, the status of public service broadcasters, the working conditions of journalists, the relationship between media and politics, representation of local and regional communities and the inclusion of minorities' voices. Also, it embraces all measures guaranteeing citizens' access to diversified sources so to allow the formation of a <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> in the public sphere without undue influence of dominant powers.|$|R

She drew fire for a highly controversial Audiovisual Media Law proposed shortly afterwards, however. Defended by the government as a reform intended to fragment ownership of media companies so as to encourage <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinion,</b> the bill was criticised by part of the opposition {{as a means to}} silence voices critical of the government, especially those in the Clarín media group (the country's largest).

[...] Citing the <b>plurality</b> <b>opinion</b> in De Veau v.

They also joined with Powell to reverse that portion of the judgment of the California Supreme Court that forbade the university to consider race in the admissions process.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{religious education}} through {{the principle of}} religious neutrality which should {{be compared with the}} principle of political neutrality, on which I have published my note in the English journal, Learning for Democracy, Vol. 2, No. 3, 2006, Critical Press (its Japanese version is included in this paper). Since citizens must have political knowledge, political education is necessary both in public and private schools. The principle of political education may be compatible with the principle of political neutrality if pupils are encouraged both to think critically and to choose from a <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions</b> based on their reason and conscience. As opposed to political education, education pertaining to religion should be left mainly to individual families. Even school education pertaining to basic facts about religion (let alone denominational education) will almost certainly fail to be neutral, and for this reason should be kept to a minimum. Thus religious education and political education are asymmetrical...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} {{regarding}} the need for recently adopted legislative and normative acts oriented toward a transition to a market economy.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of Czech sociology, from its outset {{up until the}} present time, has had four lasting features: a tendency to put {{too much emphasis on}} personal grudges, a deep interest in the serious problems of the time, an ability for forming well-grounded statements on contemporary issues, & a natural <b>plurality</b> of <b>opinions.</b> These features are evident still in contemporary Czech sociology. In the postcommunist period, Czech sociology managed {{to come to terms with}} some of the more shadowy aspects of its past (cooperation with the regime) without any personal conflicts & was able to relatively quickly fill in the information gap in relationship to Western sociology. Several alternative interpretations of the transformation processes were formulated, & some neglected subject areas were cultivated. Impulses stemming from globalization are accepted in a critical & relatively reasonable manner, but there is a tangible lack of study devoted to cultural processes & the influence of mass media on society. Czech sociology has thus come to terms with the trauma that accompanies every fundamental social change, & has done so in a rational & practical manner...|$|R
