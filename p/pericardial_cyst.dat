40|$|Abstract Introduction Congenital <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts</b> are benign lesions {{that arise}} from the {{pericardium}} during embryonic development. The diagnosis is based on typical imaging features, but atypical locations and signal magnetic resonance imaging sequences {{make it difficult to}} exclude other lesions. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a novel method {{that can be used to}} differentiate tissues based on their restriction to proton diffusion. Its use in differentiating <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts</b> from other <b>pericardial</b> lesions has not yet been described. Case presentation We present three cases (a 51 -year-old Caucasian woman, a 66 -year-old Caucasian woman and a 77 -year-old Caucasian woman) with <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts</b> evaluated with diffusion-weighted imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Each lesion demonstrated a high apparent diffusion coefficient similar to that of free water. Conclusion This case series is the first attempt to investigate the utility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts.</b> Diffusion-weighted imaging may be a useful noninvasive diagnostic tool for <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts</b> when conventional imaging findings are inconclusive. </p...|$|R

40|$|We report here {{a case of}} {{a patient}} who {{underwent}} surgical resection of a giant <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> that was growing rapidly, causing anterior chest pain. An asymptomatic 56 -year-old woman underwent a complete medical checkup in a health-care center. Her chest X-ray showed an unusually large bulge on the left cardiac border, and she was referred to our hospital. The chest X-ray taken 2 years ago in another hospital showed similar bulge on the same left cardiac border, but it was noticeably smaller. Chest CT revealed a 9. 5 × 4. 5 cm <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> within the anterolateral aspect of the left cardiac border. The CT number of the mass was approximately 15 - 20 HU. The mass also showed slight hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted MR images and hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted MR images.

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} case of a 36 -year-old woman with a recent upper {{respiratory}} illness who presented with chest pressure, lasting for five days, which improved with leaning forward.

In our patient, treatment with ibuprofen and colchicine resulted in a decrease in cyst size, suggesting an inflammatory component.

40|$|Four adult {{patients}} with <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts</b> were studied by two-dimensional echocardiography. In all cases echocardiography demonstrated a round echo-free structure, of varying size, {{related to one}} of the cardiac chambers, from which it was separated by a definite wall of echoes.

This report assesses the importance of two-dimensional echocardiography and its greater reliability and sensitivity compared with: (1) M-mode echo in identifying pericardial tumors and establishing their relationships to nearby cardiac structures, and (2) standard chest X-ray in differentiating solid masses from cysts and in defining the characteristics of cysts walls. Particular stress is laid on the role of two-dimensional echo cardiography leading directly to surgery in patient number 4, who had a teratoma and in whom early surgery was essential.

40|$|Aim: Examining {{the cases}} {{operated}} due to <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> diagnosis {{in terms of}} age, gender, complaints, diagnosis methods, operative methods and postoperative complications. Material and Metod: The records of 41 cases who were operated between 1999 – 2011 and diagnosed with <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> through histopathological examination were retrospectively examined. Results: The age averages of the patients included in the study, 22 of whom were male (53. 7 %) an 19 of whom were female (46. 3 %), was 51. 7 years. 14 patients (35. 0 %) {{in the study were}} asymptomatic during consultation, and dyspnea (20. 0 %) and coughing (20. 0 %) were the most frequent symptoms. <b>Pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> was right cardiophrenic located in 28 patients (68. 3 %), and left  cardiophrenic located in 6 patients (14. 6 %).

25|$|Pericardial effusion* is a {{collection}} of fluid in the pericardium. It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually hemangiosarcoma or a heart base tumor, idiopathic pericarditis. Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias, uremia, <b>pericardial</b> <b>cysts,</b> or hypoalbuminemia. Rarely pericardial effusion can be caused by infection and consist of pus. An echocardiogram should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor).

30|$|Coronary CT or {{angiography}} {{might be}} considered to obtain more information, {{especially with regard to}} the degree of adhesion and location of the coronary vessels. When coronary CT shows the involvement of coronary vessels, the need for coronary artery bypass grafting or CPB to resect the cyst should be anticipated; however, coronary CT and angiography may not always exclude the possibility of the involvement of coronary vessels preoperatively because some literature reported epicardial cysts with involvement of the coronary vessels and CPB requirement to resect those cysts despite negative findings on coronary CT or angiography [2 – 4]. Considering the incidence of the disease, we suspected that the cyst was more likely a <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> than an epicardial cyst. Therefore, involvement of the coronary vessels was not suspected. However, as mentioned above, CT cannot differentiate between a <b>pericardial</b> <b>cyst</b> and an epicardial cyst preoperatively. Moreover, in the present case, CT revealed that the cyst compressed the left ventricle. According to these facts, we should have predicted higher possibility of involvement of the coronary vessels and should have performed coronary CT and angiography for evaluation.|$|E
