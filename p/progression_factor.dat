40|$|Background Mesothelin has {{attracted}} much interest as a tumor specific antigen; {{it has been}} reported to promote tumor development and to be a good target for cancer treatment. Most studies to date have used human mesothelin in immunocompromised mice. Since these models do not allow for study of the natural immune response to mesothelin expressing tumors, we have undertaken the characterization of mouse mesothelin so the effects of this protein can be assessed in immunocompetent mouse strains. Methods We analyzed mouse mesothelin expression, tissue distribution, shedding and biochemistry. In addition we constructed stable mesothelin overexpressing lines of the pancreatic cancer line Panc 02 by two methods and tested them for growth and tumorigencity in vitro and in vivo. Results We show here that mouse mesothelin is similar to human mesothelin in biochemical characteristics, tumor expression and tissue distribution, suggesting the mouse may be a suitable model for study of mesothelin. Stable overexpression of mesothelin in a pancreatic cancer cell line did not increase cell proliferation or anchorage-independent growth in vitro, suggesting that mesothelin is not necessarily a tumor <b>progression</b> <b>factor.</b> Surprisingly overexpression of mesothelin inhibited tumor formation in vivo in immunocompetent mice.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{confluent}} cultured fibroblasts must be rendered competent by a factor contained in platelets before they can respond to plasma components and progress from G 0 to S phase of the cell cycle. Somatomedin-C is one of the components of platelet-poor plasma necessary for cell cycle <b>progression,</b> but other <b>factors</b> present in somatomedin-C-deficient plasma are also required. Because both competence and <b>progression</b> <b>factors</b> contained in somatomedin-C-deficient serum modulate somatomedin-C action in fibroblasts, this study was undertaken to examine their possible influence on the binding of 125 I-labeled somatomedin-C. Exposure of BALB/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts to high concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor alone prevented the time-dependent decrease in somatomedin-C binding which occurs in serum-free medium. Lower concentrations of the growth factor or 5 % (vol/vol) platelet-poor plasma reduced but did not abolish this decrease. In contrast, sequential addition of platelet-derived growth factor followed by platelet-poor plasma resulted in a 75 % increase in 125 I-labeled somatomedin-C binding over basal levels during the first 2 hr. Binding increased by 125 % when somatomedin-C-deficient platelet-poor plasma was substituted for normal platelet-poor plasma.

40|$|Fibroblast {{replication}} {{is regulated}} by exogenous signals provided by growth factors, mediators that {{interact with the}} target cell surface and signal the cell to proliferate. A useful model of growth regulation, the "dual control model," suggests that growth factors can be grouped either as competence factors or as progression factors, and that optimal replication of fibroblasts requires the presence of both types of growth factors. Although most growth factors are soluble mediators, recent studies have demonstrated that, for some cell types, the extracellular matrix can replace the requirement for a competence factor. Since fibronectin is an important constituent of the extracellular matrix that interacts with specific domains on the fibroblast surface, we examined the ability of fibronectin {{to act as a}} competence factor to promote the growth of human diploid fibroblasts. To accomplish this, fibronectins purified from two sources, human plasma and human alveolar macrophages, were tested for their ability to (a) stimulate fibroblast replication in serum-free medium containing characterized progression factors (insulin or alveolar macrophage- derived growth factor); (b) provide a growth-promoting signal early in G 1. Fibronectin stimulated fibroblast replication in a dose-dependent manner {{in the presence of a}} fixed dose of a <b>progression</b> <b>factor.</b> Conversely, fibronectin conferred on previously unresponsive fibroblasts the ability to replicate in a dose-dependent manner when cultured with increasing amounts of a <b>progression</b> <b>factor.</b> Moreover, fibronectin signaled growth-arrested fibroblasts to traverse G 1 approximately 4 h closer to S phase. No differences were observed in the ability of plasma or macrophage fibronectins to provide a competence signal for fibroblast replication. Since fibronectin is a major component of the extracellular matrix, these observations suggest that it may provide at least one of the signals by which the matrix conveys the "competence" that permits fibroblasts to replicate in the presence of an appropriate progression signal...|$|E

To this end, we find that A. fumigatus requires a carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mediated genetic network to support in vivo fungal fitness and disease progression. While CCR as mediated by the transcriptional repressor CreA is not required for pulmonary infection establishment, loss of CCR inhibits fungal metabolic plasticity and the ability to thrive in the dynamic infection microenvironment.

40|$|Chronic renal {{allograft}} rejection; pathophysiologic considerations. Chronic rejection {{is currently}} the most prevalent cause of renal transplant failure. Clinically, chronic rejection presents by chronic transplant dysfunction, characterized by a slow loss of function, often in combination with proteinuria and hypertension. The histopathology is not specific in most cases but transplant glomerulopathy and multilayering of the peritubular capillaries are highly characteristic. Several risk factors have been identified such as young recipient age, black race, presensitization, histoincompatability, and acute rejection episodes, especially vascular rejection episodes and rejections that occur late after transplantation. Chronic rejection develops in grafts that undergo intermittent or persistent damage from cellular and humoral responses resulting from indirect recognition of alloantigens. <b>Progression</b> <b>factors</b> such as advanced donor age, renal dysfunction, hypertension, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, and smoking accelerate deterioration of renal function.
