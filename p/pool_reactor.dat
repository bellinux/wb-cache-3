During its existence, the school was the only educational venue in the U.S. from where a comprehensive twelve month education and training in either [...] "Reactor Hazards Analysis" [...] or [...] "Reactor Operations" [...] could be obtained, with accompanying certificates.

50|$|Maria is a pool type reactor with a {{power of}} 20 to 30 MW (thermal). Despite it being a <b>pool</b> <b>reactor,</b> it {{contains}} channels (aluminum tubes) individually connected to the primary coolant. The water pool provides cooling for elements (e.g., fuel elements) that are not otherwise cooled, and also acts as radiation shielding. Maria uses enriched uranium as fuel (80% enrichment in 235U till year 1999; 36% since). The fuel elements and channels are vertical but arranged conically. Water and beryllium blocks serve as the moderator (70% and 30% of the moderation, respectively). Elements of boron carbide sheathed in aluminum are utilized for control, compensation, and safety. The use of beryllium blocks results in a comparatively large fuel lattice pitch, and consequently large volume for payload targets. There is also a graphite reflector (aluminum sheathed). Maria supplies a neutron flux of 4x1014 n/cm2s (thermal neutrons) and 2x1014 n/cm2s (fast neutrons). There are six horizontal channels for controlled use of neutron beams. There is also a window of lead-containing glass through which the core can be viewed. The reactor is housed in a sealed containment.|$|E

The method used in the calibration consisted in the steady-state energy balance of the primary cooling loop of the reactor. For this balance, the inlet and outlet temperatures and the water flow in this primary cooling loop were measured.

This magnetic domain size is smaller than particle size. No significant change of domain size at this packing density implies the domain wall motion is hindered by the porosity effectively up to at least 60 % of packing density. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Contamination of the {{atmosphere}} by radioactive isotopes of iodine constitutes a serious biological hazard and, for this reason, provisions should be made at reactors to prevent such releases {{in the event of}} an accident. The efficiency of activated charcoal for adsorption of iodine vapor from air streams was measured by using a radioactive tracer method, and efficiencies of 99. 6 to 99. 999 +% were obtained for various conditions. Comparative tests were run with silver-plated copper ribbon. A criterion for selecting an iodine removal material was developed based on efficiency and resistance to air flow. The iodine vapor adsorption efficiency of a commercial charcoal filter was measured. Various materials were considered for possible application in the emergency exhaust system of the building housing the 5 -Mw swimming <b>pool</b> <b>reactor</b> at the Puerto Rico Nuclear Center.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the washout of tritiated water by snow and rain from gaseous effluent releases at Donald C. Cook Nuclear Power Plant.
