Excitation of the polymer in the visible spectrum was found {{to lead to a}} transient <b>photoconductance</b> due to dissocn. of excitons at the interface between ZnO and the conjugated polymer. From the similar decay kinetics of the <b>photoconductance</b> and the effects of UV illumination, it is concluded that the measured <b>photoconductance</b> is due to electrons in ZnO. Increasing the wt. fraction of ZnO in the blend films leads to a higher <b>photoconductance.</b> This is attributed to enhanced formation of mobile electrons by interfacial dissocn. of excitons at clusters of ZnO nanoparticles rather than at individual nanoparticles. The dependence of the <b>photoconductance</b> on the wt. fraction of ZnO is found to be different for ZnO:MDMO-PPV and ZnO:P 3 HT blends. This is most likely due to the presence of a smaller no. of relatively large ZnO clusters in ZnO:P 3 HT blends and a shorter exciton diffusion length, as compared with ZnO:MDMO-PPV blends. After exposure of the blend films to UV light, {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude and the lifetime of the <b>photoconductance</b> is obsd.

We propose that the response of crystalline samples is mainly due to the promotion of electrons from the valence bands of both SrTiO 3 and LaAlO 3.

Due to the large sensitivity of the technique, the presence of unoxidized Al beneath the barrier layer can be monitored very accurately. The disappearance of a negative contribution to the photocurrent indicates the complete oxidation of the barrier layer, which coincides with the maximum magnetoresistance.

In addition, under optical excitation near the quantum wells material absorption edge we observed the photocurrent declines with increasing reverse bias, i. e. the negative differential <b>photoconductance.</b> This phenomenon is associated with a blue shift of the InGaN quantum well absorption edge arising due to compensation of its build-in piezoelectric field by the p-n-junction electric field. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that each quantum well corresponds to two peaks in the small-signal <b>photoconductance</b> vs. reverse voltage dependence.
