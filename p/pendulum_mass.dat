40|$|Various {{versions}} of pendulum masses {{have been developed}} abroad within {{the past few years}} by means of which resonant vibrations of rotating shafts can be eliminated at a given tuning. They are already successfully employed on radial engines in the form of pendulous counterweights. Compared with the commonly known torsional vibration dampers, the pendulum masses have the advantage of being structurally very simple, requiring no internal damping and being capable of completely eliminating certain vibrations. Unexplained, so far, remains the problem of behavior of pendulum masses in other critical zones to which they are not tuned, their dynamic behavior at some tuning other than in resonance, and their effect within a compound vibration system and at simultaneous application of several differently tuned pendulous masses. These problems are analyzed in the present report. The results constitute an enlargement of the scope of application of pendulum masses, especially for in-line engines.

40|$|The {{configuration}} of long span cable-stayed bridge varies at different construction stages {{and so does}} its natural frequencies. The vibration control performance of a multi-stage <b>pendulum</b> <b>mass</b> damper (MPMD), whose natural frequency can be altered by controlling the pendulum wire length, was studied for mitigation of the wind-induced vibration of a long span cable-stayed bridge tower during construction. A theoretical framework for predicting the buffeting response of the coupled MPMD-bridge system was first developed. Four different construction stages of the bridge were selected for study. The effectiveness of MPMD was further examined by an experimental investigation. A 1 : 100 scale model of the bridge tower together with a two-stage <b>pendulum</b> <b>mass</b> damper were designed and manufactured. Two kinds of excitations, harmonic and white noise excitation, were applied respectively in the lateral direction of the bridge tower (le in the direction normal to the bridge longitudinal axis), which was considered as the most critical loading direction. The effect of various parameters, including damping ratio, mass ratio, and frequency tuning ratio of the damper, was considered in this study. Both the theoretical and experimental investigations showed that the MPMD can significantly reduce the displacement responses of the bridge tower for the concerned construction stages and the total damping of the tower was enhanced significantly by the MPMD.
