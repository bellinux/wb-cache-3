Agrarian interests were <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the session, representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed {{to know more about}} her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship between her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E

5|$|Soma ascends to the castle's {{keep and}} confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole desire {{is to leave}} the castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conflict is over.|$|E

The two parties of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance — the Liberals and the Democrats — issued a statement after the parade condemning the violent anti-gay protests and calling for tolerance. They did not, however, comment on the issue of same-sex unions. The opposition Social Democratic Party also condemned the anti-gay violence.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} was a crushing defeat for the Conservative Party, {{with the party}} having its lowest percentage share {{of the popular vote}} since 1832 under the Duke of Wellington's leadership, being wiped out in Scotland and Wales. A number of prominent Conservative MPs lost their seats in the election, including Michael Portillo, Malcolm Rifkind, Edwina Currie, David Mellor, Neil Hamilton and Norman Lamont. Such was the extent of Conservative losses at the election that Cecil Parkinson, speaking on the BBC's election night programme, joked upon the Conservatives winning their second seat that he was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subsequent election for the leadership would be contested.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} {{played their}} first Test match {{together in the}} Third Test at Queens Park Oval, Trinidad, {{the first time that}} twins had played in the same Test match. Waugh top-scored with 64 in the first innings of another rain-affected draw, before taking his first Test wicket, Curtly Ambrose. He admitted that he was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> weather prevented him from having to spend more time facing the West Indian pacemen. He did not pass 20 in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, as the West Indies retained the Frank Worrell Trophy 2–0 with a 343-run victory. He was the most successful bowler in the second innings, taking 4/80, including the wicket of Viv Richards. His bowling included short-pitched bowling, reasoning that the Australians were going to be bounced anyway.|$|E
25|$|The Prince was {{originally}} created by Mechner as {{the protagonist of}} his new game. His inspiration for the character's athleticism was the opening ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, referencing main character Indiana Jones' approach to situations encountered. Indiana Jones' less impervious portrayal compared to other action heroes also influenced Mechner's portrayal of the Prince. The character was based on multiple similar figures in ancient literature, including One Thousand and One Nights. The character's movements were created using rotoscoping, with Mechner video taping his brother doing the movements, then mapping them into the game. Originally a plain figure in white clothing, the Prince was restyled for its Japanese release in a turban and baggy pants. This look pleased Mechner, and became associated with the character during the original trilogy. Speaking in 2010, Mechner said that during his time writing the series bible {{for the production of}} future Prince of Persia games, he was attempting to force the character into the conventions of western fiction, forgetting the character's literary origins. By the time Prince of Persia 3D released to a lukewarm response, Mechner was actually <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Prince had run his course, as he no longer recognized the character.|$|E

After having received [...] "about 40 scripts that were all set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys", Hamm was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movie offered a role [...] "the opposite to Don Draper". The feature received generally favorable reviews and earned $144million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Published by Crave Entertainment on December 14, 1999, Asteroids Hyper 64 is the Nintendo 64 port of Asteroids. The game's {{graphics}} were {{upgraded to}} 3D, {{with both the}} ship and asteroids receiving polygon models along static backgrounds, and it was supplemented with weapons and a multiplayer mode. IGN writer Matt Casamassina was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gameplay was faithful to the original but felt the minor additions and constant [...] "repetition" [...] {{was not enough to}} make the port [...] "warrant a $50 purchase". He was disappointed about the lack of music and found the sound effects to be of poor quality.|$|E
500|$|So {{received}} mostly favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote [...] "only {{a handful of}} Western rock musicians have managed to use exotic rhythms and instruments with so much ingenuity and conviction". Pareles also praised his vocals, describing them as [...] "grainy but not bluesy, ageless and joyless, the voice of some ancient mariner recounting disasters". Tim Holmes writing for Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "a record of considerable emotional complexity and musical sophistication" [...] and was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> records would assist exposing Gabriel to mainstream pop music.|$|E

500|$|Containment during 1967, when he {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his memoirs, involved something other than the use of military [...] "counterforce". He was never <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> policy he influenced was associated with the arms build-up of the Cold War. In his memoirs, Kennan argued that containment did not demand a militarized U.S. foreign policy. [...] "Counterforce" [...] implied the political and economic defense of Western Europe against the disruptive effect of the war on European society. Exhausted by war, the Soviet Union posed no serious military threat to the United States or its allies {{at the beginning of the}} Cold War but rather an ideological and political rival.|$|E
500|$|Eric Johnson plays Whitney Fordman, Lana's boyfriend {{in season}} one, who becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's budding {{friendship}} and hazes him.

[...] When compared to its predecessor, , GamePro was convinced [...] The Battle for Middle-earth II had improved upon the original in several fundamental ways. GameSpot believed that The Battle for Middle-earth II offered better gameplay and a much broader scope that encompassed more of Middle-earth.|$|E
