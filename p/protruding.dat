5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} comprises {{at least}} two known subspecies; one is the nominate subspecies Laevistrombus canarium canarium, {{and the other is}} Laevistrombus canarium guidoi. L.canarium guidoi distinguishes itself from the other subspecies by its solid white colour, the outline of the posterior canal and a more prominent posteriorly <b>protruding</b> outer lip. The presence of a freely <b>protruding</b> lip at the posterior portion of the columella is also a distinctive character.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have sensors, often {{modified}} setae (bristles), for smell, taste, {{touch and}} vibration, <b>protruding</b> through their cuticle ("skin"). Unlike insects, spiders and other chelicerates {{do not have}} antennae.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly <b>protruding</b> outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{inclusion}} of the five <b>protruding</b> heads in the paintings frame is often seen as referencing a similar motif found on Ghiberti's Porta del Paradiso, the bronze doors of the Florence baptistry which Michelangelo was known to greatly admire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the fort there is a {{courtyard}} planted with trees. Around it on various levels are rooms, enclosures and towers accessible through a complex set of stairways that may have once had a defensive purpose. Massive doors with <b>protruding</b> iron spikes protect sections of the fort.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of vowel rounding: {{protrusion}} and compression. In <b>protruded</b> rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips <b>protrude</b> like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally ("compressed") and do not <b>protrude,</b> with only their outer surface visible. That is, in <b>protruded</b> vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term endolabial), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus exolabial). [...] observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German [...] and , are typically <b>protruded,</b> whereas front rounded vowels such as German [...] and [...] are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front <b>protruded</b> vowels are uncommon, and a contrast between the two types {{has been found to be}} phonemic in only one instance.|$|R
5000|$|As {{there are}} no {{diacritics}} in the IPA to distinguish <b>protruded</b> and compressed rounding, [...] (a mid front rounded vowel modified by endolabialization) will be used here as an ad hoc symbol for <b>protruded</b> mid front vowels.|$|R

5|$|Ocular hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, {{which lead}} to a similar facial {{resemblance}} between patients. Facial abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines.

5|$|Organ cases {{occasionally}} {{feature a}} few ranks of pipes <b>protruding</b> horizontally {{from the case}} {{in the manner of a}} row of trumpets. These are referred to as pipes en chamade and are particularly common in organs of the Iberian peninsula and large 20th-century instruments.|$|E

5|$|The Baden {{culture in}} {{southern}} Poland {{was the latest}} of the Danubian ancestry cultures and continued between 3200 and 2600 BCE.

5|$|The Temple of Al-lāt {{is largely}} ruined {{with only a}} podium, a few columns and the door frame remaining. Inside the compound, a giant lion relief (Lion of Al-lāt) was {{excavated}} and in its original form, was a relief <b>protruding</b> from the temple compound's wall.|$|E

5000|$|As {{there are}} no {{diacritics}} in the IPA to distinguish <b>protruded</b> and compressed rounding, an old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an ad hoc symbol for the <b>protruded</b> palatal approximant. Another possible transcription is [...] or [...] (a palatal approximant modified by endolabialization).|$|R
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and <b>protruding</b> one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route185 (NY185) is an east–west {{state highway}} in Essex County, New York, in the United States.

5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, {{known as}} the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago. This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had <b>protruding</b> ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes. A few had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks, possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which would be the females).|$|E

5000|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>protruded</b> [...] and compressed [...] holds for the semivowels [...] and [...] {{as well as}} labialization. In Akan, for example, the [...] is compressed, as are labio-palatalized consonants as in Twi [...] "Twi" [...] and adwuma [...] "work", whereas [...] and simply labialized consonants are <b>protruded.</b> In Japanese, the [...] is compressed rather than <b>protruded,</b> paralleling the Japanese [...] The distinction applies marginally to other consonants. In Southern Teke, the sole language reported to have a phonemic , the labiodental sound is [...] "accompanied by strong protrusion of both lips", whereas the [...] found as an allophone of [...] before [...] in languages such as English is not <b>protruded,</b> as the lip contacts the teeth along its upper or outer edge. Also, {{in at least one}} account of speech acquisition, a child's pronunciation of clown involves a lateral [...] with the upper teeth contacting the upper-outer edge of the lip, but in crown, a non-lateral [...] is pronounced with the teeth contacting the inner surface of the <b>protruded</b> lower lip.|$|R
5000|$|Megabalnus stultus {{differs from}} the other species of Megabalanus in that the basal margin is sinuous, rather than straight, and <b>protrudes</b> medially, whereas in other species it <b>protrudes</b> little if at all. The shell is [...] "dirty white" [...] in colour, often with a purple tinge, and pale blue in parts.|$|R
5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) <b>protruding</b> through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing skyward. This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib <b>protruding</b> to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, <b>protruding</b> ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been {{considered}} unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.|$|E
