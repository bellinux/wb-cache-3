40|$|Biased (degree-dependent) {{percolation}} {{was recently}} shown to provide new strategies for turning robust networks fragile and vice versa. Here we present more detailed results for biased edge percolation on scale-free networks. We assume a network {{in which the}} probability for an edge between nodes i and j to be retained is proportional to (k_ik_j) ^-α with k_i and k_j the degrees of the nodes. We discuss two methods of network reconstruction, sequential and simultaneous, and investigate their properties by analytical and numerical means. The system is examined away from the percolation transition, where {{the size of the}} giant cluster is obtained, and close to the transition, where nonuniversal critical exponents are extracted using the generating functions method. The theory is found to agree quite well with simulations.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of many kinetic processes in 1 + 1 (space-time) dimensions results in 2 d directed percolative landscapes. The active phases {{of these models}} possess numerous hidden geometric orders characterized by various types of large-scale and/or coarse-grained percolative backbones that we define. For the patterns originated in the classical directed percolation (DP) and contact process (CP) we show from the Monte-Carlo simulation data that these percolative backbones emerge at specific critical points {{as a result of}} continuous phase transitions. These geometric transitions belong to the DP universality class and their nonlocal order parameters are the capacities of corresponding backbones. The multitude of conceivable percolative backbones implies the existence of infinite cascades of such geometric transitions in the kinetic processes considered. We present simple arguments to support the conjecture that such cascades of transitions is a generic feature of <b>percolation</b> as <b>well</b> as many others transitions with nonlocal order parameters.

40|$|We {{consider}} a directed {{variant of the}} negative-weight percolation model in a two-dimensional, periodic, square lattice. The problem exhibits edge weights which are taken from a distribution that allows for {{both positive and negative}} values. Additionally, in this model variant all edges are directed. For a given realization of the disorder, a minimally weighted loop/path configuration is determined by performing a non-trivial transformation of the original lattice into a minimum weight perfect matching problem. For this problem, fast polynomial-time algorithms are available, thus we could study large systems with high accuracy. Depending on the fraction of negatively and positively weighted edges in the lattice, a continuous phase transition can be identified, whose characterizing critical exponents we have estimated by a finite-size scaling analyses of the numerically obtained data.

The response of these objects to small, local perturbations is also investigated with extensive numerical simulations. We find the fractal dimension of the watersheds to generally decrease with the Hurst exponent, which quantifies the degree of spatial correlations. Moreover, in two dimensions, our results match the range of fractal dimensions 1. 10 ≤ d_f ≤ 1. 15 observed for natural landscapes. We report that the watershed is strongly affected by local perturbations. For perturbed two and three dimensional systems, we observe a power-law scaling behavior for the distribution of areas (volumes) enclosed by the original and the displaced watershed, and for the distribution of distances between outlets. Finite-size effects are analyzed and the resulting scaling exponents are shown to depend significantly on the Hurst exponent.

However the question of existence of the rate function i. e., whether the log-probability normalized by n^ 2 tends to a limit, had remained open.

A field experiment was carried out to study the distribution characteristics of soil water and nitrate under sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation in 2003. Results indicate that the main change of soil water content was within 0. 6 m soil layers under sprinkler irrigation where main winter wheat roots distribute. Under surface irrigation, soil water could reach soil layer below the root zone. During the period of winter wheat growth, the concentration Peak of soil nitrate appeared above 0. 4 m soil layer and moved above 0. 6 m under sprinkler irrigation.
