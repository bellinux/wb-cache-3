5|$|A solar cell, or <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> (PV), is {{a device}} that {{converts}} light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens {{was among those who}} recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
25|$|The first {{practical}} <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> was publicly demonstrated on 25 April 1954 at Bell Laboratories. The inventors were Calvin Souther Fuller and Gerald Pearson.|$|E
25|$|Solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{vary from}} 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction concentrated photovoltaics. Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22%. Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through magnifying lens) onto a smaller sized <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> However, such {{concentrated solar power}} requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.|$|E
30|$|PV {{concentrator}} systems {{reduce the}} area of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> required, increase the solar radiation intensity on the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> {{and can lead to}} a reduction in total system cost, if the costs of the concentrator and tracking assembly are less than that of {{the area of}} <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> displaced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Photovoltaic</b> <b>cells,</b> as {{the primary}} part of a solar {{photovoltaic}} system, are a nonlinear DC power supply related to multiple parameters. The demand of increasing the generating efficiency of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> requires having {{a good understanding of}} their electrical characteristics. In this study, the mathematical and physical model of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> was built by the means of Matlab and Simulink based on the internal principles and equivalent circuits of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> After the simulation of such practical and versatile model, it’s found that the nonlinear P-V and I-V characteristics of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells,</b> with the change of sunlight intensity and temperature, could be accurately reflected by this high simulation precision model. Furthermore, the Maximum Power Point Tracking method was proposed using the logical formula dP/dI= 0 of the maximum power point of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> This method can simply and fast implement the tracking for the maximum power point.

50|$|However, the {{efficiencies}} {{of these}} new types of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> have risen from 2.5% in 2001, to 5% in 2006, to greater than 10% in 2011. This is because improved methods for solution processing of acceptor and donor materials led to more efficient blending of the two materials. Further research can lead to polymer-fullerene based <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> that approach the efficiency of current inorganic <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{technology}} used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to gallium arsenide-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then {{evolved into the}} modern III-V multijunction <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> used on spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|The Sir E. Scott {{secondary}} school in Tarbert serves {{the whole of}} the Isle of Harris and Scalpay. This school has a primary and secondary department and can educate up to sixth year. The largest <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> installation in Scotland is a 21kW system at the school.|$|E
25|$|Large {{solar power}} <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> arrays or thermal power plants {{would be needed}} to meet the {{electrical}} power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 megawatt-hours per person per year.) These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with wireless power transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in the band gap of organic photovoltaic materials leads to different chemical structures and forms of organic solar cells. Different forms of solar cells includes single-layer organic <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells,</b> bilayer organic <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> and heterojunction <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> However, {{all three of these}} types of solar cells share the approach of sandwiching the organic electronic layer between two metallic conductors, typically indium tin oxide.|$|R

30|$|In this study, poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) [P 3 HT] and [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid {{methyl ester}} [PCBM] were blended {{and used as}} an active layer in polymer BHJ <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> The {{performance}} characteristics of polymer <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> using pentacene-doped PEDOT:PSS as a hole-conducting layer have been investigated. In details, an investigation is taken to understand the effect of pentacene-doped PEDOT:PSS films {{on the performance of}} polymer <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with various amounts of pentacene in a PEDOT:PSS solution. We present the fabrication of efficient polymer <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> by optimizing the parameters including the amount of pentacene and annealing temperature of pentacene-doped PEDOT:PSS thin films, which are important parameters because these can affect power conversion efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The optical {{band gap}} (see below) determines what {{portion of the}} solar {{spectrum}} a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> absorbs. A semiconductor will not absorb photons of energy less than the band gap; and {{the energy of the}} electron-hole pair produced by a photon is equal to the bandgap energy. A luminescent solar converter uses a luminescent medium to downconvert photons with energies above the band gap to photon energies closer to the band gap of the semiconductor comprising the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|Optical fiber {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} power using a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> to convert the light into electricity. While this method of power transmission is not as efficient as conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor {{as in the case of}} use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields. Other examples are for powering electronics in high-powered antenna elements and measurement devices used in high-voltage transmission equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is then pointed at a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{among the}} <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> {{considered}} as renewable energy sources, organic <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> such as nanoscale polymer semiconductors have been intensively developed [1]. As alternative technologies to conventional <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells,</b> polymer bulk-heterojunction [BHJ] <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> have gained great attention {{since they have}} several advantages such as low-cost fabrication, mechanical flexibility [2, 3], and easy fabrication process including spin-coating [4]. The BHJ-structured device is an intimate blend of donor and acceptor materials that are phase-separated into nanodomains, where one or both materials absorb photons to form bound electron-hole pairs (excitons). An interpenetrating network in the BHJ structure provides a large interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation [5, 6], leading to high efficiency of device performance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method developed to {{significantly reduce the}} necessary time for the ageing tests for different types of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> Two ageing factors have been applied to the photovoltaic cells: the concentrated light and the temperature. The maximum power of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> was monitored during the ageing process. The electrical dc and ac parameters of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> were measured and analyzed at 1 sun irradiance, {{before and after the}} test stress.

40|$|The p-GaN/i-InxGa 1 −xN/n-GaN double-heterostructure <b>photovoltaic</b> (PV) <b>cells</b> {{have been}} {{fabricated}} and the theoretical photovoltaic properties were also calculated in this work. From theoretical simulation, higher efficiency {{can be obtained}} in GaN/InGaN double-heterostructure <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with higher In composition in i-InGaN intrinsic layer. GaN/InGaN double-heterostructure <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with In compositions of 10 %, 12 %, and 14 % were fabricated and characterized for demonstrating with the simulated results. The corresponding photoelectrical conversion efficiency of fabricated GaN/InGaN <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with In compositions of 10 %, 12 %, and 14 % is 0. 51 %, 0. 53 %, and 0. 32 % under standard AM 1. 5 G measurement condition, respectively. GaN/InGaN <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with In composition of 10 % showed high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2. 07 [*]V and fill factor (F. F.) of 80. 67 %. The decrease of Voc and FF was observed as In composition increasing from 10 % to 14 %. For comparing with the fabricated GaN/InGaN <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells,</b> theoretical conversion efficiency of GaN/InGaN <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> with In compositions of 10 %, 12 %, and 14 %, is 1. 80 %, 2. 04 %, and 2. 27 %, respectively. The difference of GaN/InGaN photovoltaic properties between theoretical simulation and experimental measurement {{could be attributed to}} the inferior quality of InGaN epilayer and GaN/InGaN interface generated as the increase of In composition...|$|R
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hybrid <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> that contains piezoelectric materials {{can be increased}} simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field {{set up by the}} vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.|$|E
25|$|BP Solar begun {{constructing}} a new solar <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> manufacturing plant at its European headquarters in Tres Cantos, Madrid. For phase {{one of the}} Madrid expansion, BP Solar aimed to expand its annual cell capacity from 55 MW to around 300 MW. Construction of this facility was underway, with the first manufacturing line expected to be fully operational in 2009. The new cell lines would use innovative screen-printing technology. By fully automating wafer handling, the manufacturing lines {{would be able to}} handle the very thinnest of wafers available and ensure the highest quality. Thin wafers are of particular importance since there has been a silicon shortage in recent years. However, after the new national law limiting installed power by year, in April 2009 BP Solar closed its factories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{photovoltaic}} effect was experimentally demonstrated first by French physicist Edmond Becquerel.

40|$|<b>Photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> {{are often}} {{perceived}} as an ugly addition to glazing. Improvements could make photovoltaics more attractive for use in architecture, increasing the opportunities to generate electricity on the surfaces of buildings. This research demonstrates methods of integrating crystalline-silicon <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> into decorative glazing. The aim was to explore {{the use of a}} combination of opaque, reflective and coloured materials with crystalline-silicon <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> in glazing designs, to enhance appearance whilst maintaining good photovoltaic generation. Colour was incorporated through the use of Lumogen F dyes (BASF) added to the photovoltaic encapsulants Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate: Solutia Vistasolar Fastcure 486. 00). The absorption and emission properties of these new material combinations were measured. The dyes degraded quickly under both accelerated and outdoor testing. Glazing designs were created that incorporated Lumogen dyes, plus opaque and reflective materials. The opaque and reflective materials were used to disguise the square <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> This demonstrated that crystalline-silicon <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> could be assimilated into a wide variety of architectural glazing. Reflective materials and fluorescent dyes were shown to improve maximum electrical current from widely-spaced crystalline-silicon <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells.</b> Further work is recommended to establish durable material combinations for use with photovoltaics in decorative glazing.
