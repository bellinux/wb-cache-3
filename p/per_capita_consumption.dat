40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper applies {{a battery}} of panel unit root {{procedures}} to test for convergence in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> energy <b>consumption</b> among 22 African countries. Specifically, the study implements both the conventional panel unit root testing procedures and the Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM). The results from the standard panel unit root tests provide evidence of convergence in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> energy <b>consumption</b> for the 22 countries as a group. However, these procedures lack the ability to separate the series in the panel into stationary and nonstationary groups. The results from the SPSM procedure provide support for <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> energy <b>consumption</b> convergence for Angola, Mozambique...|$|R

Empirical results of the Tobit model reveal that the association between <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> fuelwood <b>consumption</b> is non-linear and that <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> fuelwood <b>consumption</b> is inversely associated with family size and education of the household head.
