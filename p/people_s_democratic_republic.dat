Efforts to make aid more effective-as articulated in the 2005 Paris Declaration and recently reiterated in the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action-are becoming an increasingly prominent part of the development agenda. A common criticism, though, is that these discussions have limited impact at sector level. Human resources for health are characterized by a rich and complex network of interactions and influences-both across government and the donor community. This complexity provides a good prism through which to assess the potential of the aid effectiveness agenda to support health development and, conversely, possibilities to extend the impact of aid-effectiveness approaches to sector level...|$|R

A review and analysis of the health management and leadership capacity issues that affect the performance of district health managers in Lao PDR (Laos).

The challenges faced by Laos with regards to health management and leadership capacity and performance are similar to those faced by low- and middle income countries elsewhere. They relate both to the competency of managers and the broader health system in which they operate. In seeking to strengthen management and leadership capacity, Laos must not focus only on building the competence of individual managers but adopt a holistic approach that pays equal attention to systemic and structural issues affecting management performance...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of the sustainable development paradigm in the late 1980 s, land-use planning has become a key arena for political debates over society-environment interactions and, in practice, an important means for territorialisation projects.

The paper argues that the latter tensions reflect an important dynamism and reactivity in the planning arena. It concludes that the capacity of land-use planners to adapt to specific contexts and evolving socio-environmental challenges should be harnessed in order to reconcile conflicting approaches to planning and, perhaps, to achieve sustainable development...|$|R

We find that poverty incidence declines under the entire range of distributional assumptions considered. Nevertheless, the most important determinant of poverty impact is the degree of rural bias.

Simulation results show that the formation of free trade agreement (FTA) between ASEAN and the Plus- 6 economies (the People 2 ̆ 019 s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea in East Asia; and the other three economies of Australia, India, and New Zealand) can increase bilateral trade between the Lao PDR and ASEAN+ 6 by 1 billion, and ASEAN+ 3 by 981 million.

Following cultivation with different nitrogen fertiliser regimes, multiple metabolomic data sets, including minerals, were produced and analysed using multivariate statistical methods to reveal the degree of similarity between the genotypes and to identify discriminatory compounds supported by multiple technology platforms. Results revealed little effect of nitrogen supply on metabolites related to quality, despite known yield differences. All platforms revealed unique metabolic signatures for each variety and many discriminatory compounds could be identified as being relevant to consumers in terms of nutritional value and taste or flavour. For each platform, metabolomic diversity was highly associated with genetic distance between the varieties. This study demonstrates that multiple metabolomic platforms have potential as phenotyping tools to assist breeders {{in their quest to}} combine key yield and quality characteristics. This better enables rice improvement programs to meet different consumer and farmer needs, and to address food security in rice-consuming countries...|$|R

Southeast Asia is a complex mosaic of continental and maritime environments that include ancient stable landmasses, alluvial plains and deltas of large rivers, inland seas, and volcanic islands. The outer margin of Southeast Asia is marked by a number of islands and deep oceanic trenches with frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. A long human occupation has modified the landscape, converting alluvial valleys and deltas to agriculture, mostly rice. Closer to the present time, widespread deforestation, spread of plantation agriculture, agricultural expansion, and urbanization have further modified the physical landscape. The related degradation has been particularly severe on rainforests, peat swamps, mangroves, and coral reefs. The original widespread forest cover of Southeast Asia has been reduced to about half its original size.

It will be shown that significant strides {{have been made in}} relation to both the targets, especially in the province of Xayaboury where the contraceptive prevalence rate is the highest and maternal mortality is the lowest in the country. That said, it is unlikely that either target will be realised by 2015 for the nation as a whole. Some of the reasons for this are canvassed such as problems with the existing health infrastructure and its personnel, the cost of health care, the demographic profile and cultural expectations of women of childbearing age, geographic barriers, the absence of communication and transport infrastructure and the influence of international donors on how monies are expended. As discussions now begin to set the framework for the post-MDG compact of the international community to address poverty and well-being, it would be valuable to consider the multiplicity of factors which directly impact maternal and infant mortality rates (such as family planning, age at first birth, access to antenatal care and government expenditure on maternal health care) and explain what causes change, over non-contextualised statistics that simply report changes...|$|R

The aims of this study were: to evaluate the level of job satisfaction in local community residents on their becoming laborers in a rubber company; to compare socioeconomic profit from major rubber– and non–rubber–related activities by focusing on rice production and rubber worker activities; and to estimate the factors that affect rubber worker income levels and rice farmer profits. The main methodology involved application of comparative analysis between the incomes of rubber workers and rice farmers, using socioeconomic characteristics to compare the two groups 2 ̆ 7 respondents through descriptive analysis and an ordinary least squares regression model.
