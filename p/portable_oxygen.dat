25|$|On-board oxygen {{generating}} systems (OBOGS) and Oxygen concentrators use zeolites {{in conjunction}} with pressure swing adsorption to remove nitrogen from compressed air in order to supply oxygen for aircrews at high altitudes, as well as home and <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> supplies.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} to the equipment pioneered by Deane and Siebe was {{the requirement for}} a constant supply of air pumped from the surface. This restricted the movements and range of the diver and was also potentially hazardous as the supply could get cut off {{for a number of}} reasons. Early attempts at creating systems that would allow divers to carry a <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> source did not succeed, as the compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, two basic templates for scuba, (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus), had emerged; open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaust is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver's unused oxygen is filtered from the carbon dioxide and recirculated.|$|E
25|$|To {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} developing decompression sickness, pilots breathe 100% oxygen for an hour prior to take off to remove nitrogen from the blood. A <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> supply is used during transport to the aircraft. Since 2001, more than a dozen pilots have reportedly suffered the effects of decompression sickness, including permanent brain damage in nine cases; initial symptoms include disorientation and becoming unable to read. Factors increasing the risk of illness since 2001 include longer mission durations and more cockpit activity. Conventional reconnaissance missions would limit pilot duties to maintaining flight path for camera photography. Operations over Afghanistan included more real time activities, such as communication with ground troops, increasing their bodies' oxygen requirements and the risk of nitrogen bubble formation. U-2 pilots now exercise during oxygen pre-breathing. In 2012, modifications were initiated under the Cockpit Altitude Reduction Effort (CARE), increasing the cabin pressure from 3.88 psi to 7.65 psi, a 15,000 foot altitude equivalent. The urine collection device also was rebuilt to eliminate leakage.|$|E

2500|$|Oxygen from {{gas bottles}} or liquid {{containers}} {{can be applied}} directly via a nasal cannula or mask. Oxygen concentrators based upon pressure swing adsorption (PSA), VSA, or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) {{can be used to}} generate the oxygen if electricity is available. Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology, which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries, and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to [...] The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen).|$|E

2500|$|In March 1970, Johnson {{suffered}} {{an attack of}} angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital on Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. He was urged to lose {{a considerable amount of}} weight.

The following summer, again gripped by chest pains, he embarked on a crash water diet, shedding about [...] in less than a month. In April 1972, Johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Charlottesville, Virginia. [...] "I'm hurting real bad," [...] he confided to friends. The chest pains hit him nearly every afternoon—a series of sharp, jolting pains that left him scared and breathless. A <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank stood next to his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air. He continued to smoke heavily, and, although placed on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only in fits and starts. Meanwhile, he began experiencing severe abdominal pains. Doctors diagnosed this problem through X-rays as diverticulosis—pouches of tissue forming on the intestine. His condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended, so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey. DeBakey discovered that even though two of the former President's coronary arteries were critically damaged, the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications.|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, this system will be the first system of its kind to be used in healthcare service to administer the process of oxygen therapy at hospital settings, pre-clinics, and home. Furthermore, as this system is portable and small, hypoxaemic patient can use it continuously during all life activities.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLong-term {{oxygen therapy}} (LTOT) in {{patients}} with chronic hypoxaemia is an expanding field. Traditional stationary oxygen, with and without portable compressed gas cylinders, and <b>portable</b> liquid <b>oxygen</b> equipment is available today. No official guidelines exist for the prescription of liquid oxygen vs traditional oxygen supply in LTOT, although it is generally thought that patients receiving liquid oxygen are younger and less seriously affected. The authors tested this hypothesis by comparing register data from two national Scandinavian registers of patients on LTOT {{in the same time}} period; one including all the patients on traditional oxygen treatment alone, e. g. concentrators and compressed gas cylinders (n= 1039), the other including all the patients using <b>portable</b> liquid <b>oxygen</b> alone (n= 117). About 80 % of the patients in both groups suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Younger patients were found in the liquid oxygen group (P< 0 · 004), but with clinically slightly worse blood gas derangement (mostly statistically significant). They had higher frequency of previous or present oedema (P< 0 · 0001), and there were more smokers in this group (P< 0 · 0001). No significant differences were seen with respect to sex distribution or oxygen delivery systems. Higher oxygen dose and longer daily oxygen treatment (P< 0 · 0001) were prescribed for the liquid oxygen patients compared with the patients on traditional oxygen with statistically higher oxygen tension during the prescribed treatment. A slight further increase in PaCO 2 was seen in both groups during oxygen treatment, of doubtful significance. Compared with patients on traditional oxygen, liquid oxygen thus appears to be prescribed for younger patients, independent of clinical status or blood gas levels...|$|R
