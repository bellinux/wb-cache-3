40|$|In {{infected}} patients, {{the rapid}} identification of pathogens is critical. After {{a long period}} of slow technological improvement, the microbiology laboratory is now undergoing significant evolution. This work evaluated the contribution of recent MALDI-TOF MS technology in terms of the diagnosis and clinical management of patients and its implementation in the laboratory of tomorrow. The studies were conducted over a 3. 5 -year period, mostly in the <b>iris</b> <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> network of Brussels. First, we confirmed the accurate performance of MALDI-TOF MS in the identification of routine isolates, regardless of whether the Biotyper (92. 7 % correct species identification) or VITEK MS (93. 2 %) (n= 986) commercial system was used, and demonstrated the supremacy of this technology over conventional identification techniques for fastidious bacteria, including Campylobacter and related organisms (98. 3 %, 72. 2 % and 79. 9 % correct species identification by Biotyper, Vitek NH Card and API Campy, respectively; n= 234). Second, we showed that the direct MALDI-TOF MS identification of bacteria from positive blood cultures was not only feasible but also led to an 24 -h reduction in the time-to-identification. In an adult population, more than 13 % of the direct identifications from positive blood cultures resulted in the faster adaptation of the antimicrobial treatment. Third, we demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS could easily be implemented in a network, which was associated with significant cost savings and reduction in the time-to-identification. Finally, our promising Blastocystis subtyping results suggest that the number of MALDI-TOF MS applications may be increased. In the future, automation of the technique will make its use in clinical laboratories even easier, eliminating the use of conventional identification techniques. Improvement of the preanalytical procedures is also important to make MALDI-TOF MS a suitable instrument for resistance and toxicity mechanism detection and subtyping.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of fusion at normalisation/segmentation level prior to feature extraction. While there are several biometric fusion methods at data/feature level, score level and rank/decision level combining raw biometric signals, scores, or ranks/decisions, this type of fusion {{is still in its}} infancy. However, the increasing demand to allow for more relaxed and less invasive recording conditions, especially for on-the-move iris recognition, suggests to further investigate fusion at this very low level.

40|$|Iris {{recognition}} {{has received}} increasing {{attention in the}} field of biometrics due to its high performance in human identification. A challenge of iris recognition is to extract the small-size data with sufficient information from distinctive iris patterns. We propose a novel feature extraction algorithm for iris recognition, which utilizes a bank of Gabor filters and an effective encoding method. In image preprocessing, the lower portion of the iris is normalized and unwrapped into a rectangular block where the occluded area is masked out. Then multichannel Gabor filters are used to decompose the iris block. An iris code is generated by analyzing and encoding the horizontal variation of each filtered image. Finally, a feature selection scheme is adopted to remove redundant features to reduce the data size and improve the performance. Experimental results on <b>public</b> <b>iris</b> databases show that the proposed approach has a smaller code size and a lower equal error rate.

40|$|Rotation {{invariance}} {{is important}} for an iris recognition system since changes of head orientation and binocular vergence may cause eye rotation.

In these methods, {{the complexity of the}} method is increased, and when the rotation scale is beyond the certain scope, the error rates of these methods may substantially increase. In order to solve this problem, a new rotation invariant approach for iris feature extraction based on the non-separable wavelet is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a bank of non-separable orthogonal wavelet filters is used to capture characteristics of the iris. Secondly, a method of Markov random fields is used to capture rotation invariant iris feature. Finally, two-class kernel Fisher classifiers are adopted for classification.

Hidden Markov Models are used to parametrically model the local frequencies of the iris. Also discussed is a transform of the iris image from two to one dimensional space and overcoming limited data with the generation of synthetic images. I. Problem IRIS recognition is a problem that has received much media attention recently with the public’s heightened awareness of <b>public</b> security. <b>Iris</b> recognition is the identification of a person’s identity based on an image of their eye. This is done by analyzing the various patterns that makeup the iris. These patterns are ideal for biometric identification because they are both hard to alter as well as exceptionally complex. It has been shown that iris patterns are stable from about one year of age until death, meaning that the patterns on the iris are relatively constant over a person’s lifetime. [1] Another important feature of the iris is the great variability over many eyes. Each iris is unique (even the left and right eyes are different) and similar to fingerprints – Iris patterns are not shared between identical twins. II. Previous Solutions THERE have been numerous studies on the validity of using iris detection as a means of identifying a person’s identity. The most successful and only complete solution is John G.

Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are expressed in several types of cancer cells, particularly in several histological types of breast cancer. Activation of GRs is not associated with any specific cellular response. Both proapoptotic and ­antiapoptotic responses have been observed, depending on the study or the type of breast cancer cells. Therefore, it is of relevance to investigate the possible modulation of apoptotic effect of chemotherapeutic agents when cancerous cells have previously been exposed to GCs. Methods: In vitro cell growth was assayed by counting MCF- 7 cells upon exposure to epirubicin (25 nM), 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) (15 µM), and paclitaxel (15 nM), either with or without prior exposure to the GC dexamethasone (Dex) (100 nM).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine and analyze the dose rate to personnel throughout the proposed IRIS nuclear power plant. To accomplish this objective, complex models of the IRIS plant have been devised, advanced transport theory methods employed, and computationally intense simulations performed. IRIS is an advanced integral, light water reactor with a 335 MWe expected power output (1000 MWth). Due to its integral design, the IRIS pressure vessel has a large downcomer region. The large downcomer and the neutron reflector provide {{a great deal of}} additional shielding. This increase in shielding ensures that the IRIS design easily accomplishes the regulatory dose limits for radiation workers. However, The IRIS project set enhanced objectives of further reducing the dose rate to significantly lower levels, comparable or below the limit allowed for general <b>public.</b> The <b>IRIS</b> nuclear power plant design is very compact and has a rather complex geometric structure. Programs that use conventional methods would take too much time or would be unable to provide an answer for such a challenging deep penetration problem. Therefore, the modeling of the power plant was done using a hybrid methodology for automated variance reduction implemented into the MAVRIC sequence of the SCALE 6 program package. The methodology is based on the CADIS and FW-CADIS methods. The CADIS method was developed by J. C. Wagner and A. Haghighat. The FW-CADIS method was developed by J. C. Wagner and D. Peplow.

METHODS:Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab, compound trabeculectomy and panretinal photocoagulation were given to 38 patients(38 eyes) with neovascular glaucoma, {{which could not be}} controlled by drugs, from January 2013 to January 2014 in Anyang Eye <b>Hospital.</b> <b>Iris</b> neovascularization, IOP and changes of visual acuity were observed before and after treatments. The patients were followed up for 6 mo after treatments. RESULTS: Seven days after intravitreal injection, 36 cases(94. 74 %) had complete regression of iris neovascularization. Two cases(5. 26 %) had regression of small blood vessels in the iris, a little thick blood vessels were remained. At 1 mo after compound trabeculectomy, iris neovascularization in all patients were subsided; at 3 mo after treatments, the iris neovascularization in 8 patients(21. 05 %) were performed again, and accepted intravitreal injection of ranibizumab again. Six months after the first treatments, all patients showed no iris neovascularization. The mean IOP before injection was 42. 82 ± 10. 29 mmHg. At 5 d after the drug injection was 39. 13 ± 9. 71 mmHg. Before and after the drug injection, change of IOP was not statistically significant(q = 2. 65, P > 0. 05). At 1 wk, 1, 3 and 6 mo after compound trabeculectomy, IOP was 10. 53 ± 1. 81 mmHg, 10. 11 ± 1. 73 mmHg, 11. 29 ± 2. 49 mmHg, 12. 58 ± 3. 01 mmHg,which decreased significantly(q = 23. 15, 23. 46, 22. 61, 21. 68, all P q = 20. 51, 20. 81, 19. 96, 19. 04, all P CONCLUSION: Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab at perioperative period of compound trabeculectomy can effectively improve the success rate of the surgeries and reduce risk of complications, and the effect is certainly safe...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} between eye cyclotorsion degrees and patient's age, gender, diopter and other factors in corneal refractive surgery. METHODS: A total of 762 wavefront-guided LASIK patients with 1524 eyes were retrospectively analyzed from January 2010 to December 2013 in our <b>hospital.</b> <b>Iris</b> recognition was accomplished successfully and eye cyclotorsion degrees were recorded intraoperatively for all the patients. The correlations between eye cyclotorsion degrees and patient's age, gender, different eye, diopter and the dominant eye or not were statistically analyzed. In which correlation {{analysis was used to}} analyze the relationship between eye cyclotorsion degrees and age and diopter, while the correlations with gender, different eye and the dominant eye or not were analyzed using t -test. RESULTS: The eye cyclotorsion degrees of patients were 0 to 9. 7 degrees with an average of 3. 08 ± 2. 22 degrees. Amongst the average cyclotorsion of 444 men with 888 eyes were 3. 05 ± 2. 26 degrees, 318 women with 636 eyes were 3. 12 ± 2. 15 degrees and there were no significant differences(t = 1. 905, P = 0. 168). The average age of all the patients was 22. 6 ± 5. 4 y. No significant correlation was found between cyclotorsion degrees and age(r =- 0. 012, P = 0. 748). The mean spherical equivalent was - 4. 76 ± 1. 77 degrees, and there was no significant correlation between the eye cyclotorsion degrees and spherical equivalent(r = 0. 017, P = 0. 633). The mean cylinder was - 0. 60 ± 0. 64 degrees of no significant correlation with eye cyclotorsion degrees(r =- 0. 004, P = 0. 910). The cyclotorsion of dominant eyes of all the patients was 3. 0 ± 2. 17 degrees, and the non-dominant eyes were 3. 11 ± 2. 12 degrees. No significant differences were found(t =- 0. 521, P = 0. 603). CONCLUSION: The eye cyclotorsion degrees occurred in LASIK surgery had no correlation with age, gender, different eye, diopter and the dominant eye or not...|$|R
