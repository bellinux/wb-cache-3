40|$|Two hundred {{sediment}} {{samples were}} collected and their toxicity evaluated to aquatic species in a previous study in the agriculturally dominated Central Valley of California, United States. Pyrethroid insecticides were the main contributors to the observed toxicity. However, mortality in approximately {{one third of the}} toxic samples could not be explained solely by the presence of pyrethroids in the matrices. Hundreds of pesticides are currently used in the Central Valley of California, but only a few dozen are analyzed in standard environmental monitoring. A significant amount of unexplained sediment toxicity may be due to pesticides that are in widespread use that but have not been routinely monitored in the environment, and even if some of them were, the concentrations harmful to aquatic organisms are unknown. In this study, toxicity thresholds for nine sediment-associated pesticides including abamectin, diazinon, dicofol, fenpropathrin, indoxacarb, methyl parathion, oxyfluorfen, <b>propargite,</b> and pyraclostrobin were established for two aquatic species, the midge Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca. For midges, the median lethal concentration (LC 50) of the pesticides ranged from 0. 18 to 964  μg/g organic carbon (OC), with abamectin being the most toxic and <b>propargite</b> being the least toxic pesticide. A sublethal growth endpoint using average individual ash-free dry mass was also measured for the midges. The no–observable effect concentration values for growth ranged from 0. 10 to 633  μg/g OC for the nine pesticides. For the amphipods, fenpropathrin was the most toxic, with an LC 50 of 1 – 2  μg/g OC. Abamectin, diazinon, and methyl parathion were all moderately toxic (LC 50 s 2. 8 – 26  μg/g OC).

Exposure estimates {{greater than or equal}} to noncancer reference values occurred for 50 % of the exposed populations (adults and children) for MITC subchronic and chronic exposures, methyl bromide subchronic exposures (year 2000 monitoring), and 1, 3 -dichloropropene subchronic exposures (1990 monitoring). Short-term chlorpyrifos exposure estimates exceeded the acute reference value for 50 % of children (not adults) in the exposed population. Noncancer risks were uniformly higher for children due to a proportionately greater inhalation rate-to-body weight ratio compared to adults and other factors.

40|$|The aim of our {{investigation}} was to evaluate the efficiency of some insecticide - acaricide commonly used by farmers for controlling the mite Aculops lycopersici M. The following active substances {{were included in the}} experiment: spirodiclofen, etoxazol, bifentrin, <b>propargite</b> and abamectin. The examinations were carried out on tomatoes grown in greenhouses with an area of ​​ 0, 1 ha, in the region of village Borievo, in the period of summer-autumn production of tomatoes. For determining the number of adult mites’ present control on tomato plants was performed. The control was conducted from early July to late August, 2013 and 2014, at an interval of 10 days. Leaves were collected from 100 tomato plants from the lower, middle and upper part of the plant. The adult forms of the mite were counted on the collected leaves. Damages were estimated according to the occupancy of the mites at the foliage and of damages on fruits that are more important. Control of the efficiency of the active ingredient is determined {{based on the number of}} affected plants and efficiency of insecticides - acaricides is calculated according to Abbott, after one, three and seven days after treatment. ...|$|E

O delineamento estatístico adotado foi o de blocos casualizados. As aplicações foram feitas com pulverizador tipo pistola. Após a preparação da calda, foi determinado o pH. Empregou-se máquina de varredura e microscópio estereoscópico para as avaliações da população acarina. A adição de Natur'l Óleo pode afetar negativamente a eficiência do pyridaben 200 CE e 750 PM e cyhexatin 500 PM, no controle do ácaro-da-leprose. Triona e Assist não afetaram as eficiências dos acaricidas testados. Pelo índice de iodo, mediu-se o grau de insaturação das misturas dos acaricidas com Natur'l Óleo, concluindo-se que houve incorporação das moléculas dos acaricidas pelas ligações insaturadas do óleo; porém, isto não explica o diferente comportamento dos produtos no controle do ácaro da leprose dos citros. Aiming {{to study}} the influence of adition of oil to acaricides, a field experiment was conducted in 1994, at Viradouro, SP, using Assist, Triona and Natur'l Óleo, in dosages of 500 mL per 100 liters of water, added to the acaricides: pyridaben (formulations 200 EC and 750 WP) at 75 mL and 20 g; <b>propargite</b> 720 EC at 100 mL; fenbutatine oxide 500 SC at 80 mL; and cyhexatin 500 WP at 50 g. The experimental design used was randomized blocks. The applications were carried out by a gun sprayer. After {{the preparation of the}} solution, the pH was determined. The brushing machine and the steroscopic microscope were used to estimate the mite populations. The addition of Natur'l Óleo can affect negatively the efficiency of acaricides in the control of the citrus leprosis mite, as occured with pyridaben 200 EC and 750 WP and cyhexatin 500 WP. Triona and Assist did not affect the efficiency of the acaricides tested. The insaturation level of the acaricide mistures with Natur'l Óleo was measured using the iodine index method indicating that there was incorporation of the acaricide molecules by the insaturated links of the oil; however, this doesn't explain the different behavior of the products in the control of the citrus leprosis mite...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Two hundred sediment {{samples were collected}} and their toxicity evaluated to aquatic species in a previous study in the agriculturally dominated Central Valley of California, United States. Pyrethroid insecticides were the main contributors to the observed toxicity. However, mortality in approximately {{one third of the}} toxic samples could not be explained solely by the presence of pyrethroids in the matrices. Hundreds of pesticides are currently used in the Central Valley of California, but only a few dozen are analyzed in standard environmental monitoring. A significant amount of unexplained sediment toxicity may be due to pesticides that are in widespread use that but have not been routinely monitored in the environment, and even if some of them were, the concentrations harmful to aquatic organisms are unknown. In this study, toxicity thresholds for nine sediment-associated pesticides including abamectin, diazinon, dicofol, fenpropathrin, indoxacarb, methyl parathion, oxyfluorfen, <b>propargite,</b> and pyraclostrobin were established for two aquatic species, the midge Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca.

40|$|The Servo agro spray oil (petroleum based {{horticulture}} oil) {{was evaluated}} {{in the laboratory}} against tea red spider mite, Oligonychus coffeae to determine its effect on adult mortality, viability of eggs, oviposition deterrence and repellent properties. The same was also evaluated {{in the field to}} determine its effect on mite population. Direct spray method was used in the laboratory at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 %. Mortality of O. coffeae was both concentration and time dependent. Deposition of eggs by adult mites on treated leaf surfaces decreased significantly and the viability of eggs was also significantly reduced. In addition, different concentrations of the Servo agro spray also exhibited repellent properties against adult mites. In the field Servo agro spray oil significantly reduced the mite population and its bio-efficacy was comparable to that of the synthetic pesticide (<b>propargite</b> 57 EC). No phytotoxic effect was observed when tea bushes were sprayed with different doses of Servo agro spray. Tea samples were taint free. Quality (appearance of liquor, flavour, taint and taste) of made tea was not adversely affected by treatments with Servo agro spray oil.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{determine}} the residual toxicity of the main pesticides used in citrus, on Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) under laboratory conditions. For this, it was used the residual contact bioassay. Citrus leaves of the variety Pêra were sprayed in a Potter tower. The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenbutatin oxide and <b>propargite</b> were innocuous to N. californicus. On the other hand, abamectin, azocyclotin e cyhexatin caused mortalities of 29. 8; 32. 0 e 34. 1 %, respectively, two hours after transference. Dicofol, pyridaben and chlorfenapyr were extremely toxic to the predator mite, causing 100 % of mortality two hours after the application. This way, to this population of N. californicus, the releases can be performed safely 3 days after the application, except for cyhexatin (5 days), dicofol and pyridaben (14 days) and chlorfenapyr (21 days), without risk of significant adult mortality rates due to the application of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi verificar a influência dos resíduos de calda sulfocálcica sobre a eficiência de acaricidas empregados no controle de Brevipalpus phoenicis. Inicialmente, o experimento foi instalado em um pomar de citros, em que foram selecionadas 10 plantas que continham frutos com verrugose. Realizou-se a aplicação de calda sulfocálcica (8 g i. a. L- 1 de água) em cinco plantas e as outras cinco plantas permaneceram sem aplicação de produto fitossanitário. Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: <b>propargite</b> a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, {{cyhexatin}} a 250 mg, azocyclotin a 250 mg, fenpyroximate a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e dinocap a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida. Após 1, 7 e 16 dias da aplicação, transferiram-se para cada fruto 10 ácaros B. phoenicis para avaliar a mortalidade. Constatou-se que os resíduos de calda sulfocálcica não prejudicaram a eficiência dos acaricidas avaliados no controle de B. phoenicis. The {{objective was}} to assess the influence of lime sulfur residues on the acaricidal efficiency against Brevipalpus phoenicis mite. Initially, the experiment was conducted in a citrus orchard where 10 plants presenting scab fruits were selected. Secondly, the application of lime sulfur (8 mg a. i. L- 1 of water) was performed in five plants, and the other five plants remained without application. Next lime sulfur application, 64 fruits in the plants with lime sulfur application were protected with plastic cups and others 64 fruits also were protected in the plants without lime sulfur application with plastic cups. After 30 days of field application, fruits were harvested and transported to the laboratory. These fruits were partially waxed, leaving an arena of approximately 2. 5 cm in diameter with scab and without paraffin and entrapped with entomological glue. Afterwards, acaricides application were done following the concentration expressed in mg of active ingredient per liter of water: <b>propargite</b> (720 mg), fenbutatin oxide (400 mg), cyhexatin (250 mg), azocyclotin (250 mg), fenpyroximate (50 mg), dicofol (960 mg), dinocap (738 mg) and control treatment by using the petri dish-Potter tower method.

40|$|Foliar {{sprays of}} {{pesticides}} are frequently {{used to control}} two-spotted mites on rose flowers, but these also destroy predatory mites and pose {{a high risk of}} contamination for humans and the environment. Using a novel approach to avoid spray applications on rose plants, modified acaricide-treated string curtains were adapted to control the pest. Two main aims of this study were: (i) to identify the lethal concentration of string curtains treated with <b>propargite,</b> dicofol, flufenoxuron, acrinathrin or taufluvalinate (s-fluvalinate) on Tetranychus urticae, and (ii) to test the design (feasibility) and efficiency of the string curtains to trap the phytophagous mites on the plants during their circadian migration. Bioassay results in the lab confirmed T. urticae circadian migration, toxicity of the five kinds of treated string curtains and a concentration-dependent repellent effect of each chemical on T. urticae females. Of the two products tested in the field, dicofol was more effective than acrinathrin in controlling T. urticae compared to an acaricidal spray of the same products. The effect of acaricide-treated string curtain use on Phytoseiulus persimilis did not differ significantly from the control. The string curtain technique proved to be effective, but because of some biotic and abiotic constraints and the low economic threshold of mites, even for the commercialized high canopy stem roses, the present device could be more appropriate for another horticultural crop, e. g. tomato.

On {{the basis of}} 24 -h LD 50 values after topical application, the only pesticide that had higher activity than permethrin was fipronil, with LD 50 values lower than permethrin for 107 -, 4, 849 -, and 2 -fold against Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, and An. quadrimaculatus Say, respectively. Abamectin, imidacloprid, spinosad, diazinon, and carbaryl showed slightly lower activity than permethrin (3 ̆c 20 -fold). However, bifenazate showed very low activity against the three mosquito species tested, with LD 50 values higher than permthrin for 3 ̆e 1000 -fold. On the basis of 24 -h LD 50 values, Cx. quinquefasciatus was the least susceptible species to nine pesticides tested (DNOC, azocyclotin, chlorfenapyr, carbaryl, spinosad, imidaclorid, diazinon, abamectin, and permethrin), whereas Ae. aegypti was the least susceptible species to six pesticides tested (dicofol, amitraz, <b>propargite,</b> hydramethylnon, cyhexatin, and diafenthiuron), and An. quadrimaculatus was the least susceptible species to four pesticides tested (bifenazate, pyridaben, indoxacarb, and fipronil).

This invasive pest species is not only found in Kenya, but in Eastern and Southern Africa, as well as parts of Europe and Asia. In the current study, populations of T. evansi were collected from farms in the four major tomato-growing areas of Kenya (Loitoktok, Kibwezi, Athi-River and Subukia) and their susceptibility compared to a laboratory culture (ICIPE) that had been maintained for three years without exposure to acaricides. Susceptibility of T. evansi eggs and adults (contact and residual) to Brigade (bifenthrin), Dimethoate (dimethoate), Karate (lambdacyhalothrin), Kelthane (dicofol), Omite (<b>propargite)</b> and Polytrin (profenofos+ cypermethrin) was tested in the laboratory using respective manufacturer’s recommended concentrations. Dimethoate resulted in variable ovicidal mortality while Kelthane, Brigade, Karate, Omite and Polytrin had high mortality across all populations. Similarly, adult contact and residual mortality was lower than that of the other chemicals when exposed to Dimethoate regardless of the location. Furthermore, it also had no residual effect on the mites from ICIPE and Kibwezi. On the other hand, Kelthane was most lethal against the mites from all locations followed by Brigade and Polytrin in that order. Omite caused significantly lower mortality on mites from Subukia while Karate produced variable effects on mites from Kibwezi, Loitoktok and Subukia. The implications of these findings are further discussed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} an association between childhood cancer and pesticide exposure. California leads the nation in agricultural pesticide use. A mandatory reporting system for all agricultural pesticide use in the state provides information on the active ingredient, amount used, and location. We calculated pesticide use density to quantify agricultural pesticide use in California block groups for a childhood cancer study. Pesticides with similar toxicologic properties (probable carcinogens, possible carcinogens, genotoxic compounds, and developmental or reproductive toxicants) were grouped together for this analysis. To prioritize pesticides, we weighted pesticide use by the carcinogenic and exposure potential of each compound. The topranking individual pesticides were <b>propargite,</b> methyl bromide, and trifluralin. We used a geographic information system to calculate pesticide use density in pounds per square mile of total land area for all United States census-block groups in the state. Most block groups (77 %) averaged less than 1 pound per square mile of use for 1991 – 1994 for pesticides classified as probable human carcinogens. However, {{at the high end}} of use density (> 90 th percentile), there were 493 block groups with more than 569 pounds per square mile. Approximately 170, 000 children under 15 years of age were living in these block groups in 1990. The distribution of agricultural pesticide use and number of potentially exposed children suggests that pesticide use density would be of value for a study of childhood cancer.

Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades cytotoxic proteins, dysfunction in the UPS may contribute to PD etiology. Our goal {{in this study was}} to screen pesticides for proteasome inhibition and investigate (i) whether ambient exposures to pesticides that inhibit the UPS increase PD risk and (ii) whether genetic variation in candidate genes of the UPS pathway modify those increased risks. We assessed 26 S UPS activity in SK-N-MC u cells by fluorescence. We recruited idiopathic PD cases (n= 360) and population-based controls (n= 816) from three counties in California with considerable commercial agriculture. We determined ambient pesticide exposure by our validated GIS-based model utilizing residential and workplace address histories. We limited effect measure modification assessment to Caucasians (287 cases, 453 controls). Eleven of 28 pesticides we screened inhibited 26 S UPS activity at 10 μM. Benomyl, cyanazine, dieldrin, endosulfan, metam, <b>propargite,</b> triflumizole, and ziram were associated with increased PD risk. We estimated an odds ratio of 2. 14 (95 % CI: 1. 42, 3. 22) for subjects with ambient exposure to any UPS-inhibiting pesticide at both residential and workplace addresses; this association was modified by genetic variation in the s-phase kinase-associated protein 1 gene (SKP 1; interaction p-value= 0. 005). Our results provide evidence that UPS-inhibiting pesticides {{play a role in the}} etiology of PD and suggest that genetic variation in candidate genes involved in the UPS pathway might exacerbate the toxic effects of pesticide exposures. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

During 1988 – 1994, a total of 7, 143 cases of invasive cancer were diagnosed among children under 15 years of age in California. Building {{on the availability of}} high-quality population-based cancer incidence information from the California Cancer Registry, population data from the U. S. Census, and uniquely comprehensive agricultural pesticide use information from California’s Department of Pesticide Regulation, we used a geographic information system to assign summary population, exposure, and outcome attributes at the block group level. We used Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (RRs) by pesticide use density adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, and sex for all types of childhood cancer combined and separately for the leukemias and central nervous system cancers. We generally found no association between pesticide use density and childhood cancer incidence rates. The RR for all cancers was 0. 95 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 80 – 1. 13] for block groups in the 90 th percentile and above for use of pesticides classified as probable carcinogens, compared to the block groups with use of < 1 lb/mi 2. The RRs were similar for leukemia and central nervous system cancers. Childhood leukemia rates were significantly elevated (RR = 1. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 2. 13) in block groups with the highest use of <b>propargite,</b> although we saw no dose–response trend with increasing exposure categories.
