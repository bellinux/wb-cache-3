5000|$|The lack of {{a formal}} system in {{traditional}} Chinese philosophy motivates {{the creation of a}} “systemic overcoat.” There is no historical narrative in Chinese philosophy similar to the one that exists in Western philosophy. [...] The material studied under the discipline of Chinese philosophy had been sifted in the early 20th century from the paradigms of classics, poetry, masters, and collected writings to create this field. [...] The academic philosophical model that is applied now to this discipline appeared only after Hu Shi’s Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Feng Youlan’s History of Chinese Philosophy. [...] Both Feng Youlan and Hu Shi comprehended the lack of narrative in Chinese thought and thus proceeded to create a categorization that mirrored that of the Western paradigm. However, by <b>preformatting</b> the outline and selectively choosing material that fit, they presented a warped version of the original. [...] An accurate understanding of these texts is impossible because the original context has become obscured. The overcoat may express the concepts of Western philosophy that are present in Chinese thought, but in the process it causes an abstraction from the reality these concepts were couched in originally.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a reconfigurable interface board based on FPGAs and a UNIX workstation to implement a correlation tracker with 3. 8 ms latency. The correlation tracker is part of an active mirror system in use at the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope, La Palma, Canary Islands. The reconfigurable interface is used to leverage the workstation CPU, relieving it of tasks that it performs poorly such as rapid context switching and low-level bit manipulation. The reconfigurable interface handles control of external devices, high-performance input (16 MB/s) and data <b>preformatting.</b> The workstation CPU, a 64 -bit microprocessor, performs the bulk of the computation.

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the introduction of a new <b>preformatted</b> medical order sheet coupled with an introductory course affected prescription quality and the frequency of errors during the prescription stage in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Two-phase observational study consisting of two consecutive 4 -month phases: pre-intervention (phase 0) and post-intervention (phase I) conducted in an 11 -bed NICU in a Swiss university hospital. Interventions consisted of the introduction of a new <b>preformatted</b> medical order sheet with explicit information supplied, coupled with a staff introductory course on appropriate prescription and medication errors. The main outcomes measured were formal aspects of prescription and frequency and nature of prescription errors. Eighty-three and 81 patients were included in phase 0 and phase I, respectively. A total of 505 handwritten prescriptions in phase 0 and 525 in phase I were analysed. The rate of prescription errors decreased significantly from 28. 9  % in phase 0 to 13. 5  % in phase I (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Compared with phase 0, dose errors, name confusion and errors in frequency and rate of drug administration decreased in phase I, from 5. 4 to 2. 7  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 5. 9 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 3. 6 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), and 4. 7 to 2. 1  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. The rate of incomplete and ambiguous prescriptions decreased from 44. 2 to 25. 7 and 8. 5 to 3. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Inexpensive and simple interventions can improve the intelligibility of prescriptions and reduce medication errors. WHAT IS KNOWN: ? Medication errors are frequent in NICUs and prescription is one of the most critical steps. ? CPOE reduce prescription errors, but their implementation is not available everywhere. What is New: ? <b>Preformatted</b> medical order sheet coupled with an introductory course decrease medication errors in a NICU. ? <b>Preformatted</b> medical order sheet is an inexpensive and readily implemented alternative to CPOE...|$|R
