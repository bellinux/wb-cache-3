50|$|Paneth {{cells are}} found {{throughout}} the small intestine and the appendix {{at the base of}} the intestinal glands. The <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> numbers demonstrate an ascending trend with highest numbers towards the distal end of the small intestine. Like the other epithelial cell lineages in the small intestine, paneth cells originate at the stem cell region near the bottom of the gland. However, unlike the other epithelial cell types, paneth cells migrate downward from the stem cell region and settle just adjacent to it. This close relationship to the stem cell region is thought to suggest that Paneth cells are important in defending the gland stem cells from microbial damage, although their function is not entirely known. Furthermore, among the four aforementioned intestinal cell lineages, the Paneth cells live the longest (18-23 days).|$|E

Certain {{characteristic}} features of the pathology seen point toward Crohn's disease; it shows a transmural pattern of inflammation, meaning the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall. Ulceration is an outcome seen in highly active disease. There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer—a characteristic sign known as skip lesions. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show mucosal inflammation, characterized by focal infiltration of neutrophils, a type of inflammatory cell, into the epithelium. This typically occurs in the area overlying lymphoid aggregates. These neutrophils, along with mononuclear cells, may infiltrate the crypts, leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess). Granulomas, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show [...] "caseation", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as tuberculosis. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal villi, atypical branching of the crypts, and {{a change in the}} tissue type (metaplasia). One example of such metaplasia, <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia, involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine and a key regulator of intestinal microbiota) {{in other parts of the}} gastrointestinal system.|$|E

Whereas its role in the maintenance of the stem cell compartment has been clearly demonstrated, its role in the <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> fate remains unclear. We performed genetic studies to elucidate the functions of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. We analysed mice with inducible gain-of-function mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and mice with a hypomorphic β-catenin allele that have not been previously described. We demonstrated that acute activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling induces de novo specification of Paneth cells in both the small intestine and colon and that colon cancers resulting from Apc mutations expressed many genes involved in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. This suggests a key role for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. We also showed that a slight decrease in β-catenin gene dosage induced a major defect in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, but only a modest effect on crypt morphogenesis. Overall, our findings show that a high level of β-catenin activation is required to determine <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> fate and that fine tuning of β-catenin signalling is critical for correct <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> lineage...|$|E

A shift in {{intestinal microbiota}} composition favouring the presence of Firmicutes over Bacteroidetes has been observed in obese subjects. A similar shift has been reported in mice with deficiency of active <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> alpha-defensins. We aimed at investigating changes in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobial levels in the gut of obese subjects. Next, we studied activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as a possible mechanism involved in altered <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> function. <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> numbers were counted in jejunal sections of 15 severely obese (BMI > 35) and 15 normal weight subjects. Expression of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobials human alpha-defensin 5 (HD 5) and lysozyme were investigated using immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and western blot. Activation of the UPR was assessed with western blot. Severely obese subjects showed decreased protein levels of both HD 5 and lysozyme, while <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> numbers were unchanged. Lysozyme protein levels correlated inversely with BMI. Increased expression of HD 5 (DEFA 5) and lysozyme (LYZ) transcripts in the intestine of obese subjects prompted us to investigate a possible translational block caused by UPR activation. Binding protein (BiP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4) levels were increased, confirming activation of the UPR in the gut of obese subjects. Furthermore, levels of both proteins correlated with BMI. Involvement of the UPR in the lowered antimicrobial protein levels in obese subjects was strongly suggested by a negative correlation between BiP levels and lysozyme levels. Additionally, indications of ER stress were apparent in Paneth cells of obese subjects. Our findings provide the first evidence for altered <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> function in obesity, which may have important implications for the obesity-associated shift in microbiota composition. In addition, we show activation of the UPR in the intestine of obese subjects, which may underlie the observed <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> compromise.

Such translocation {{is thought to be}} important in the high morbidity and mortality rates of patients who receive nothing by mouth. Recently, Paneth cells, important constituents of innate intestinal immunity, were found to be crucial in host protection against invasion of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This study investigates the influence of food deprivation on <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> function in a mouse starvation model. Quantitative PCR showed significant decreases in mRNA expression of typical <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobials, lysozyme, cryptdin, and RegIII gamma, in Heal tissue after 48 hours of food deprivation.

40|$|Abstract Background Enteric {{antimicrobial}} peptides secreted from Paneth cells, including α-defensins (in mice named cryptdins), are key effector {{molecules of}} innate immunity {{in the small}} intestine. The importance of Paneth cells α-defensins emerged from studies of enteric bacterial infection in genetically modified mice, {{as well as from}} recent studies linking reduced levels of these α-defensins to Crohn's disease localized to the ileum. However, analysis of expression of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> α-defensins is incomplete. We therefore performed a comprehensive evaluation of the distribution of antimicrobial molecules along the mouse small intestinal tract to identify potential variations in regional expression. Results In conventionally reared mice, the repertoire of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobials differs between duodenum and ileum. In contrast to the uniform expression of most <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobials, both cryptdin 4 and cryptdin-related sequences (CRS) 4 C peptides were expressed at progressively increasing amounts (10 1 - and 10 4 -fold, respectively) comparing duodenum and ileum. In tissues other than the small intestine, expression of CRS peptides was noted in thymus and caecum. Most <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> products were also produced in the small intestine of germ-free mice at levels similar to those in controls, however CRS 4 C and RegIIIγ had reduced levels in the former (3 - and 8 -fold, respectively). No significant changes in expression levels of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobial peptides was observed after oral challenge with either Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes, supporting current notions on the constitutive nature of this defensive system. Conclusion The repertoire of antimicrobial peptides changes along the small intestinal tract, and a subset of these molecules are up-regulated upon colonization, but not in response to enteric bacterial pathogens. The changes detected upon colonization suggest that <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobial peptides may {{play an important role in}} commensal microbial homeostasis, in addition to their proposed role in protection against infection. In addition, the differential expression of CRS 4 C along the small intestine suggests mechanisms of regulation that are distinct from other <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> derived antimicrobial peptides. </p...|$|E

40|$|The small {{intestinal}} epithelium self-renews {{every four}} or five days. Intestinal stem cells (Lgr 5 (+) crypt base columnar cells (CBCs)) sustain this renewal and reside between terminally differentiated <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> {{at the bottom of}} the intestinal crypt. Whereas the signalling requirements for maintaining stem cell function and crypt homeostasis have been well studied, little is known about how metabolism contributes to epithelial homeostasis. Here we show that freshly isolated Lgr 5 (+) CBCs and <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> from the mouse small intestine display different metabolic programs. Compared to <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells,</b> Lgr 5 (+) CBCs display high mitochondrial activity.

40|$|Paneth cells {{residing}} at {{the base}} of the small intestinal crypts contribute to the mucosal intestinal first line defense by secreting granules filled with antimicrobial polypeptides including lysozyme. These cells derive from the columnar intestinal stem cell located at position 0 and the transit amplifying cell located at position + 4 in the crypts. We have previously shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST), a leading cause of gastrointestinal infections in humans, effects an overall reduction of lysozyme in the small intestine. To extend this work, we examined small-intestinal tissue sections at various time points after ST infection to quantify and localize expression of lysozyme and assess <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> abundance, apoptosis, and the expression of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation markers. In response to infection with ST, the intestinal Paneth cell-specific lysozyme content, the number of lysozyme-positive Paneth cells, and the number of granules per <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> decreased. However, this was accompanied by increases in the total number of Paneth cells and the frequency of mitotic events in crypts, by increased staining for the proliferation marker PCNA, primarily at the crypt side walls where the transit amplifying cell resides and not at the crypt base, and by apoptotic events in villi. Furthermore, we found a time-dependent upregulation of first β-catenin, followed by EphB 3, and lastly Sox 9 in response to ST, which was not observed after infection with a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 mutant deficient in type III secretion. Our data strongly suggest that, in response to ST infection, a <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation program is initiated that leads to an expansion of the <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> population and that the transit amplifying cell is likely the main progenitor responder.

We previously showed that mice lacking functional FGFR- 3 have {{a significant decrease in}} the number of Paneth cells in the small intestine. Here, we used Caco 2 cells to investigate whether FGFR- 3 signaling can directly modulate expression of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation markers through its effects on TCF 4 /β-catenin or through other signaling pathways downstream of this receptor. Caco 2 cells treated with FGFR- 3 ligands or expressing FGFR- 3 K 650 E, a constitutively active mutant, resulted in a significantly increased expression of genes characteristic of mature Paneth cells, including human α-defensins 5 and 6 (HD 5 and HD 6) and <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> lysozyme, whereas enterocytic differentiation markers were reduced. Activation of FGFR- 3 signaling sustained high levels of β-catenin mRNA expression, leading to increased TCF 4 /β-catenin-regulated transcriptional activity in Caco 2 cells. Sustained activity of the TCF 4 /β-catenin pathway was required for the induction of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> markers. Activation of the MAPK pathway by FGFR- 3 is also required for the induction of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> markers in addition to and independent of the effect of FGFR- 3 on TCF 4 /β-catenin activity.

This work establishes the important impact of host genotype on <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> function and the composition of the intestinal microbiota. It further identifies specific AMP and microbial alterations in two commonly used inbred mouse strains that have varying susceptibilities to a variety of disorders, ranging from obesity to intestinal inflammation. This will be critical for future studies utilizing these murine backgrounds to study the effects of Paneth cells and the intestinal microbiota on host health and disease...|$|E
40|$|Paneth {{cells are}} {{important}} {{contributors to the}} intestinal antimicrobial barrier through synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Animal studies indicate that <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> numbers, location and granule morphology are altered by infection and zinc status. We examined human tissue to determine whether <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> numbers, distribution or granule morphology are altered in infective, inflammatory and nutritional disorders. Archival sections from infective disorders (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, HIV, helminth infection) were compared with active inflammatory conditions (coeliac, Crohn's and graft-versus-host diseases) and histologically normal tissues. A subset of tissues was studied by electron microscopy and TUNEL staining for apoptosis. Human defensin- 5 (HD 5) peptide and mRNA was analysed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sections from a tropical population cohort study were then analysed to determine the relationship of granule depletion to infection, nutritional status and plasma zinc concentration. In HIV-related cryptosporidiosis, but not other disorders, Paneth cells were reduced in number and markedly depleted of granules. <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> granule depletion was associated with reduced HD 5 immunoreactivity, {{but this was not}} due to apoptosis and there was no reduction in mRNA transcripts. In the tropical population studied, depletion of granules was associated with reduced body mass index, reduced plasma zinc levels and HIV infection. <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> granules in human small intestine may be depleted in response to infective and nutritional stress. We postulate that this is one mechanism through which zinc status influences host susceptibility to intestinal infection...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} {{is associated}} with bacterial translocation (BT) and endotoxemia. Most translocating bacteria belong to the common intestinal microbiota, suggesting a breakdown of intestinal barrier function. We hypothesized that diminished mucosal antimicrobial host defense could predispose to BT. Two rodent models of portal hypertension with increased BT were used, CCl(4) -induced ascitic cirrhosis and 2 -day portal vein-ligated (PVL) animals. BT was assessed by standard microbiological techniques on mesenteric lymph nodes. Total RNA was isolated systematically throughout the intestinal tract, and expression of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> α-cryptdins and β-defensins was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To determine functional consequences, mucosal antimicrobial activity was assessed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. BT was detectable in 40 % of rats with cirrhosis. Compared with the group without BT, these animals exhibited diminished intestinal <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> α-cryptdin 5 and 7 expression. In contrast, PVL was associated with BT in all animals but did not affect antimicrobial peptides. The decrease in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobials was most pronounced in the ileum and the coecum. Other antimicrobials showed no changes or even an induction {{in the case of}} BT at different sites. Antimicrobial activity toward different commensal strains was reduced, especially in the distal ileum and the cecum in experimental cirrhosis with BT (excluding PVL). Conclusion: Compromised <b>Paneth</b> <b>cell</b> antimicrobial host defense seems to predispose to BT in experimental cirrhosis. Understanding this liver-gut axis including the underlying mechanisms could help us to find new treatment avenues...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{methylmercury}} on the intestinal epithelium were studied in 14 adolescent male Macaca mulatta monkeys weighing 3 to 5 kg. They {{were divided into}} three groups: two controls received daily applesauce vehicle without methylmercury. Nine chronic low-dose animals received 0. 2 to 1. 0 mg of methylmercury per day for 80 to 491 days. Three acute high-dose animals received 2. 0 mg methylmercury for 17 to 18 days, when they became terminally ill. Light and electron microscopic observations were made on samples of duodenum and ileum following perfusion and immersion fixation in a glutaraldehyde-paraformaldehyde fixative. Numerous uniquely structured inclusions were prominent in the <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> of the chronic low-dose animals and some necrotic <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> were seen, especially in the most chronic and higher dosed animals of the group. Acute high-dose treatment produced some inclusions in the <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> {{similar to those of}} the chronic low-dose group, but degenerative and necrotic cells were more frequently seen. These alterations were not seen in other intestinal epithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> are selectively altered. These findings suggest that a function of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> may be to eliminate metals from the body...|$|R
50|$|Lysozyme {{is another}} {{defensive}} molecule secreted by <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> into the lumen.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} immunocytochemically whether preterm and newborn {{infants with}} necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) show differences in numbers of lysozyme positive <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> compared with normal controls, and {{to relate the}} findings {{to the possibility that}} lysozyme deficiency may facilitate the bacterial infections thought to be associated with this condition. METHODS: Tissues from 10 infants with NEC and from 11 matched controls were sectioned and stained immunocytochemically for lysozyme. Differences in the numbers of <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells</b> and degree of lysozyme positivity in the tissues were assessed. RESULTS: Tissues from NEC patients showed no, or very few, lysozyme positive <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas controls showed strong positive staining. CONCLUSIONS: A deficiency or developmental defect in <b>Paneth</b> <b>cells,</b> resulting in an absence of lysozyme, may render the intestine more susceptible to bacterial infection, allowing organisms to adhere and translocate across the mucosa. Such enhancement of infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC...|$|R
