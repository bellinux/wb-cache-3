This compound imposes maximal inhibition on reactions involving electron transport from water to a terminal acceptor such as ferricyanide at concentrations of about 1 [mu]. At concentrations of about 10 [mu], dibromothymoquinone also inhibits electron transport reactions catalyzed by photosystem II {{in the presence of}} p-phenylenediimines or <b>p-benzoquinones.</b> This inhibition is observed in both untreated and KCN/Hg-inhibited chloroplast preparations. Thiol incubation of chloroplasts exposed to dibromothymoquinone relieves inhibition at both sites. This reversal of inhibition is, however, different for the two sites. Restoration of ferricyanide reduction, which is blocked by 1 [mu] dibromothymoquinone, required high thiol/inhibitor ratios and incubation times with thiol of up to 3 min. The reversal of inhibition of p-phenylenediimine reduction by photosystem II, on the other hand, requires a thiol/inhibitor ratio of 1, and incubation times as short as 5 s.

40|$|Quinones are {{ubiquitous}} in the environment. They occur naturally {{but are also}} in widespread use in human and industrial activities. Quinones alone are relatively benign to bacteria, but in combination with copper, they become toxic by a mechanism that leads to intracellular thiol depletion. Here, it was shown that the yahCD-yaiAB operon of Lactococcus lactis IL 1403 provides resistance to combined copper/quinone stress. The operon is {{under the control of}} CopR, which also regulates expression of the copRZA copper resistance operon as well as other L. [*]lactis genes. Expression of the yahCD-yaiAB operon is induced by copper but not by quinones. Two of the proteins encoded by the operon appear to play key roles in alleviating quinone/copper stress: YaiB is a flavoprotein that converts <b>p-benzoquinones</b> to less toxic hydroquinones, using reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as reductant; YaiA is a hydroquinone dioxygenase that converts hydroquinone putatively to 4 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in an oxygen-consuming reaction. Hydroquinone and methylhydroquinone are both substrates of YaiA. Deletion of yaiB causes increased sensitivity of L.

40|$|The rhizosphere, {{the narrow}} zone of soil around plant roots, {{is a complex}} network of {{interactions}} between plants, bacteria, {{and a variety of}} other organisms. The absolute dependence on host-derived signals, or xenognosins, to regulate critical developmental checkpoints for host commitment in the obligate parasitic plants provides a window into the rhizosphere's chemical dynamics. These sessile intruders use H 2 O 2 in a process known as semagenesis to chemically modify the mature root surfaces of proximal host plants and generate <b>p-benzoquinones</b> (BQs). The resulting redox-active signaling network regulates the spatial and temporal commitments necessary for host attachment. Recent evidence from non-parasites, including Arabidopsis thaliana, establishes that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production regulates similar redox circuits related to root recognition, broadening xenognosins' role beyond the parasites. Here we compare responses to the xenognosin dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ) between the parasitic plant Striga asiatica and the non-parasitic A. thaliana. Exposure to DMBQ simulates the proximity of a mature root surface, stimulating an increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration in both plants, but leads to remarkably different phenotypic responses in the parasite and non-parasite. In S. asiatica, DMBQ induces development of the host attachment organ, the haustorium, and decreases ROS production at the root tip, while in A. thaliana, ROS production increases and further growth of the root tip is arrested. Obstruction of Ca 2 + channels and the addition of antioxidants both lead to a decrease in the DMBQ response in both parasitic and non-parasitic plants. These results are consistent with Ca 2 + regulating the activity of NADPH oxidases, which in turn sustain the autocatalytic production of ROS via an external quinone/hydroquinone redox cycle. Mechanistically, this chemistry is similar to black and white photography with the emerging dynamic reaction-diffusion network laying the foundation for the precise temporal and spatial control underlying rhizosphere architecture...|$|R

Foram testados também outros oxidantes como: peróxido de hidrogênio (H 2 O 2 30 %), OXONE, dimetil dioxirano (DMD) e ácido iodoxibenzóico (IBX), no entanto, os únicos que oxidaram fenóis foram o OXONE e o DMD, restringindo-se aos fenóis alquil dissubstituídos. Na segunda parte, foram feitos estudos de otimização das reações de Diels-Alder em versão multicomponente (MCR) com p-benzoquinonas, assim como a possibilidade de aumento de escala dessas reações (Esquema 1). Nesses estudos testou-se também essa metodologia (Diels-Alder/MCR) sob o efeito de microondas. As MCR {{realizadas}} sob refluxo apresentaram rendimentos na faixa de 60 - 70 %, mantendo esse rendimento até uma escala de 100 mmol. Já as MCR realizadas sob microondas apresentaram rendimentos na faixa de 30 - 40 %, no entanto o tempo reacional diminui de 24 horas para 30 minutos e não se utiliza solvente. Em relação a reação de Diels-Alder, foi realizado um estudo teórico através de cálculos computacionais das energias dos orbitais moleculares de fronteira (HOMO e LUMO), para compreender a reatividade dos pares dienodienófilos frente à reação. Com relação aos dienófilos, quanto mais substituintes alquílicos tiver menos reativo é perante a reação de Diels-Alder. Já com relação aos dienos, constatou-se pelos cálculos que o grupo substituinte benzamida ativa mais o dieno do que o grupo acetamida e que o substituinte alquílico no carbono terminal do dieno também faz com que a energia de HOMO seja maior. In {{the first}} part of this thesis we describe the study of the oxidation of phenols to <b>p-benzoquinones.</b> The metal complexes used as catalysts in this study are: [CoII(salen) ], [CoII(dmsalen) ], [CoII(salpn) ], [CoII(dmsalpn) ], [CuII(salen) ], [NiII(salen) ] and [VOIV(salen) ]. The oxidation with [CoII(salen) ] showed better results, oxidizing ten of the eleven phenols employed. We also employed other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 30 %), OXONE, dimethyl dioxirane (DMD) and iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX), however, OXONE and DMD oxidized only the alkyl disubstituted phenols. In the second part, we studied the optimization of the Diels-Alder reaction in multicomponent version (MCR) with <b>p-benzoquinones,</b> as well as the scalingup of these reactions. We also tested this methodology (Diels-Alder/MCR) under microwave irradiation (Scheme 1). The Diels-Alder reactions in the multicomponent version conducted under reflux conditions showed yields in the range of 60 - 70 %. This range was kept up even in the scale up of these reactions to 100 mmol. When these reactions were conducted under microwave irradiation, the yields were obtained in the range of 30 - 40 %. In this case the reactions were conducted in the absence of solvents and was observed a decrease of the reaction time from 24 hours to 30 minutes. A theoretical study of the Diels-Alder reaction was conducted through computer calculations of the frontier molecular orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO), in order to explain the reactivity of diene-dienophiles pairs. Through these calculations we can conclude that the greater the number of alkyl groups attached to double bonds of the dienophile, the lower the reactivity of it face to the Diels-Alder reaction in the normal electron demand. In the case of the dienes it was found by the calculations that the benzamide substituent group is a better activating group to the diene than the acetamide group.

40|$|Laccase (benzenediol:oxygen {{oxidoreductase}}, EC 1. 10. 3. 2), a multi-copper-containing oxidoreductase enzyme, is able {{to catalyze}} the oxidation of various low-molecular weight compounds, specifically, phenols and anilines. Due to their high stability, selectivity for phenolic substructures, and mild reaction conditions, laccases are attractive for fine chemical synthesis. In this study, new green domino syntheses were developed by conducting the reaction in an aqueous medium, an environmentally-friendly solvent, and using laccase as a biocatalyst. The first study presents a work on the synthesis of naphthoquinones in the aqueous medium. Herein, laccase was used to oxidize o- and p-benzenediols to generate o- and <b>p-benzoquinones</b> in situ. These quinones then underwent Diels-Alder and oxidation reactions to finally generate napthoquinone products. This reaction system can yield naphthoquinones in up to 80 % yield. The next part of this thesis reports the cascade synthesis of benzofuran derivatives from the reaction of catechols and 1, 3 -dicarbonyl compounds via oxidation-Michael addition {{in the presence of}} laccase and Sc(OTf) 3 /SDS in an aqueous medium. Depending on the substrates, one-pot yields of benzofurans averaged 50 - 79 %. From an environmental concern, this system still produced a hazardous waste from the transition metal catalyst. Therefore, the development of alternative methodologies to replace the lanthanide metal catalyst in this synthesis is a high priority to enhance the overall green chemistry aspect. As a consequence, lipase was used as a catalyst to replace Sc(OTf) 3 for the synthesis of benzofuran derivatives. In addition, this catalytic system was also used to catalyze the reaction of anilines and catechol. In the last part of this thesis, laccase was applied to the modification of high-lignin softwood kraft pulp. This modification demonstrates the potential of laccase-facilitated grafting of amino acids to high lignin content pulps to improve their physical properties in paper products which resulted from the increase of carboxylic acid group of the fibers. In this study, a variety of amino acids were examined. Laccase-histidine treatment provided the best yield of acid groups on pulp fiber and was used in the preparation of handsheets for physical strength testing. Laccase-histidine-treated pulp showed an increase in the strength properties of the resulting paper. Ph. D.

40|$|Agriculture in the Indian {{sub-continent}} aims at competitive {{production of}} {{higher level of}} food, vegetables and fruits and industrial raw materials from the existing cultivable land through innovative research and development applications. The land holdings with the farmers are small, not amendable to the mechanized agricultural practices responsible for high crop yields, such as obtained in the developed part of the globe. Production of agriculture per unit area and time is largely dependent on provision of fertilizers and irrigation in ample measure for the adequate expression of genetic potential of improved varieties of food grain, vegetable crops and industrial crops. 	Urea is the widely used nitrogenous fertilizer. However, it appears that benefits from large level of urea fertilizer can be expanded by increasing the effectiveness of fertilization. Recovery of applied fertilizer urea-N seldom exceeds 50 % in many crops; it is yet low in waterlogged paddies. The products of hydrolysis and nitrification are prone to losses through volatilization, and denitrification and leaching. Arrest of N-loss in the crop fields can help increase N utilization. This, if achieved, will provide several advantages: decrease the cost of agricultural production and increase profits to farmers, expand the use of urea in optimal amount over larger cultivated area and contain N- pollution that results from inefficient use of urea-N. Regulation of urea transformation reactions that occur in soil for better utilization of its N by crops has been an active R& D area. Several classes of compounds viz. phosphorodiamidates and triamidates, sulphahydryl reagents, dihydric phenols, aminocresols, catechol, <b>p-benzoquinones,</b> dihydric phenols etc, {{have been found to}} restrict hydrolysis of urea in soil. Ammonium polyphosphate and phosphoric, boric and nitric acid have been found to reduce volatilization of ammonia generated from urea. Rapid nitrification or oxidation of ammonium to nitrate in soil catalysed by microbes has been founds to be inhibited by nitrapyrin (2 -chloro - 6 - tricholoro methyl pyridine), BHC, sodium azide, sodium chlorate, dicyandiamide (DCD), ATC (4 -amino- 1 - 2 - 4 triazole), N-serve and certain other compounds. The use of many of these chemicals has been restricted to academic experimental levels because of high cost, lack of availability and adverse side effects. Nitrification inhibitory properties of several plants materials like Karanj (Pongamia glabra), Neem (Azaddirachta indica), and tea (Camellia sinensis) waste have been evaluated by many researchers and their advantages and disadvantages have been reported. Commercial use of these materials has not been possible due to lack of their availability, cumbersome coating process with urea, inefficient promotional activities etc. The recent inclusion of botanicals in the list of plant based materials is the natural essential oils and their by- products. The advantages of these materials are that they are easily available, cheap, eco-friendly and can be cultivated as per their requirement.

At pH 7. 0, Aox for o-benzoquinone and <b>p-benzoquinone</b> are 6. 0 × 106 and 4. 7 × 105 mol- 1 dm 3 s- 1, respectively. o-Benzoquinone appears to be a more effective electron transfer mediator than <b>p-benzoquinone.</b> Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} DNA adduct formation in HL- 60 cells and human bone marrow treated with either hydroquinone or <b>p-benzoquinone</b> and {{have found that}} these treatments produce the same DNA adduct in both cell types. The DNA adduct level from these treatments varied from 0. 05 to 7. 5 adducts per 10 (7) nucleotides {{as a function of}} treatment time and concentration for both compounds. Reaction of calf thymus DNA with <b>p-benzoquinone</b> produced three adducts as detected by 32 P-postlabeling. These adducts have been identified as (3 '-hydroxy) - 3,N 4 -benzetheno- 2 '-deoxycytidine- 3 '-phosphate; (3 '-hydroxy) - 1,N 6 -benzetheno- 2 '-deoxyadenosine- 3 '-phosphate; and (3 '-hydroxy) - 1,N 2 -benzetheno- 2 '-deoxyguanosine- 3 '-phosphate. The DNA adduct formed in HL- 60 cells did not correspond to any of the principal adducts formed in DNA reacted with <b>p-benzoquinone,</b> suggesting that cellular environment modifies DNA adduct production by <b>p-benzoquinone.</b> These studies demonstrate that DNA adduct formation occurs in human bone marrow treated with benzene metabolites and suggest that P 1 -enhanced 32 P-postlabeling may be used to detect DNA adducts resulting from benzene exposure...|$|E

The reaction involves a rigid transition state that facilitates the formation of one diastereomeric transition state and is reversible. This satisfies two necessary criteria for asymmetric synthesis. The Diels-Alder reactions of 1,l-dialkylspiro[2. 4]- 4, 6 - heptadienes with maleic anhydride and <b>p-benzoquinone</b> in chloroform were studied. The spirodienes were generated by the reactions of 6, 6 - dialkylfulvenes with dimethyloxosulfonium methylide in dimethyl sulfoxide. Complete facial differentiation of cis- 9 -tert-butyldispiro[4. 0. 5. 1]- 1, 3 -dodecadiene was found in its Diels-Alder reactions with maleic anhydride and <b>p-benzoquinone.</b> Less complete facial differentiation was effected with 1,l-dimethylspiro[2. 4]- 4, 6 - heptadiene and dispiro-[4. 0. 5. 1]- 1, 3 -dodecadiene.

It is hypothesized that PBQ is formed during hydrolysis of the corresponding diimine [51]. Presumably, the <b>p-benzoquinone</b> monoimine occurs as an intermediate of the reaction proceeding under alkaline conditions [52]. Due to the very small differences of UV/VIS spectra taken from solutions assumed to contain either PBQ or one of the corresponding imines, mainly this spectroscopic technique does not deliver sufficiently specific data for a sound identification of the questioned molecular structures.|$|E
