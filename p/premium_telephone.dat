50|$|Pay-per-call (PPCall, {{also called}} cost-per-call) is an {{advertising}} {{model in which}} the rate paid by the advertiser {{is determined by the}} number of telephone calls made by viewers of an ad. Pay Per Call providers charge per call, per impression or per conversion. It is similar to online pay per click (PPC) advertising, but induces the viewer to make a telephone call instead of viewing an external website. Both enterprises looking to reach certain locations, or local/regional businesses can benefit from Pay Per Call campaigns, because it allows customers to talk with the seller before buying a product or service. Vendors of pay-per-call advertising attribute the growth of the model to the popularity of smartphones and claim that it reduces the costs of on-line click fraud. Pay-per-call advertising is {{not to be confused with}} premium-rate telephone numbers. Pay-per-call is the inverse of a <b>premium</b> <b>telephone</b> number, in that the advertiser who receives the call, not the caller, is charged for the service. Since it is cost per lead advertising, the rates are higher than for toll-free telephone number service. In general, the advertiser is only billed for calls that last at least one minute.|$|E

A two-stage probit model was used to estimate the new market shares {{for a wide range of}} conditions.

50|$|In 1991, BT sold ClubCall to {{bookmaker}} Ladbrokes at a {{time when}} the <b>premium</b> rate <b>telephone</b> market was flourishing.

5000|$|In Japan, <b>premium</b> rate <b>telephone</b> number {{service was}} known as [...] "DIAL Q2" [...] and began with the prefix 0990 {{followed}} by six digits. The digit following determined the service class. The prefix 0990-3 was for adult services. The prefixes 0990-5 and 0990-6 were used for other services. To prevent unintentional charges, subscribers may optionally register a four digit password which is then required when accessing a premium rate service. The DIAL Q2 service ended operations in early 2013.|$|R
50|$|In the UK Ofcom classes TV {{programs}} which encourage viewers to call presenters {{live on a}} <b>premium</b> rate <b>telephone</b> number as advertisements and the regulations applicable to advertisements apply to these channels rather than the rules for editorial content. This restricts what may be said and shown on-air on unencrypted channels more stringently than if the content were a normal program. However regulation of adult TV channels has not been devolved to the Advertising Standards Authority. Ofcom regulates these channels directly.|$|R

50|$|A {{widespread}} {{misuse of}} scratchcards is the free-of-charge distribution of cards offering {{a range of}} prizes, ranging from extremely low-value to very desirable; for example from time-limited discount vouchers redeemable only through a specified agent to cars. Cards always reveal that a prize has been won, but the nature and value of the prize can only be determined by phoning a <b>premium</b> rate <b>telephone</b> claim line costing a significant sum per minute. Calls to this number are designed by the promoter always to take several minutes, and the prize won is, in reality, always of far less value {{than the cost of}} the call, and usually not worth claiming. Regulatory authorities for telephone services have been taking action against such schemes, issuing warnings and large fines.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the show, {{phone-in}} viewer puzzles are announced.

There were also various occasional twists to this aspect of the show, including other variations in the prize values, having one, two or four puzzles in a show instead of the usual three, and various bonus games (mostly games of chance) by which a caller can win even more money. These are usually themed to an event (e.g. Wimbledon) or a season (e.g. snow).|$|R
50|$|Lifestyle Satellite Jukebox was a {{music video}} request channel in the UK (and across Europe) {{in the late}} 80s and early 90s which was owned by the now defunct WHSTV (WH Smiths' TV division). The channel {{broadcast}} via transponder 5 on the Astra 1A satellite after the Lifestyle had closed down for the day (generally around 22:00).

50|$|Under the editorship of Chris Hunt, the {{magazine}} published its first issue in July 1988, {{six months before}} The Source began in newsletter form. Prior to the first issue, {{the magazine}}'s parent company had also run a <b>premium</b> rate 0898 <b>telephone</b> information line using the same name, presented by voice of now Radio 1 DJ Dave Pearce that invited MCs to call up and record their own rhyme after listening to the best rhyme of the previous week. The early issues were its biggest selling and saw Hunt bringing together a talented group of writers and photographers, including Ekow Eshun, Malu Halasa, Vie Marshall and Normski the future television presenter and celebrity, who was given his own section in the magazine to showcase his rap photography. Chris Hunt had two stints as Editor of the magazine before leaving the title for the final time in 1993. His longtime Deputy Editor Andy Cowan took over the title in November 1993 and although it has changed owners several times (Popular Publications, Future Publishing, Ministry Of Sound), HHC and Popular Publications were owned by Music Maker Publications throughout the early 1990s until Music Maker was acquired by Future Publishing. Future Publishing sold the title to Ministry Of Sound in 2000. The first Ministry issue featured Mariah Carey on the front cover. Ministry tried to continue with its 'female artists only' cover policy which had proved successful for their dance magazine but after Kelis and Lauryn Hill {{it became apparent that}} they were rapidly running out of suitable candidates. Ministry sold the title after one year and Andy Cowan continued to run and publish the magazine. In April 2006, Hip Hop Connection published its 200th consecutive edition, rerunning many of the classic rap interviews from its 18-year history. It is now owned by Cambridge based Infamous Ink.|$|R
