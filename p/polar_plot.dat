40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} enhanced bivariate <b>polar</b> <b>plots</b> that allow the concentrations of two pollutants to be compared using pair-wise statistics for exploring the sources of atmospheric pollutants. The new method combines bivariate <b>polar</b> <b>plots,</b> which provide source characteristic information, with pair-wise statistics that provide information on how two pollutants are related to one another. The pair-wise statistics implemented include weighted Pearson correlation and slope from two linear regression methods. The development uses a Gaussian kernel to locally weight the statistical calculations on a wind speed-direction surface together with variable-scaling. Example applications of the enhanced <b>polar</b> <b>plots</b> are presented by using routine air quality data for two monitoring sites in London, United Kingdom for a single year (2013). The London examples demonstrate {{that the combination of}} bivariate <b>polar</b> <b>plots,</b> correlation, and regression techniques can offer considerable insight into air pollution source characteristics, which would be missed if only scatter <b>plots</b> and mean <b>polar</b> <b>plots</b> were used for analysis. Specifically, using correlation and slopes as pair-wise statistics, long-range transport processes were isolated and black carbon (BC) contributions to PM 2. 5 for a kerbside monitoring location were quantified. Wider applications and future advancements are also discussed...|$|R

Methods: Ten patients with CAD underwent rest and stress 99 mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Software was developed in-house for generating <b>polar</b> <b>plots</b> from semi-automatic quantification of rest and stress perfusion from SPECT, function from cine CMR and viability from delayed contrast enhancement (DE) CMR.
