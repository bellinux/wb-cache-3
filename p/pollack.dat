5|$|<b>Pollack</b> {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences.

5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. <b>Pollack</b> then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter <b>Pollack,</b> Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Pollack’s {{emphasis}} on the player’s experience along with his effectiveness in growing the WSOP cast him in a good light. This can be seen most clearly through the extent of support he received when he announced his resignation as commissioner. One commentator declared, “the news hit the poker world … {{like a ton of}} bricks,” and that his tenure in the role “may be unmatched.” Well-known players like Phil Hellmuth, Peter Eastgate and Barry Goldstein expressed their esteem for <b>Pollack.</b>|$|E
