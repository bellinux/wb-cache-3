40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{pneumatic}} actuation system for generation of liquid metal droplets {{according to the}} so-called StarJet method. In contrast to our previous work, {{the performance of the}} device has been significantly improved: the maximum droplet generation frequency in continuous mode has been increased to fmax = 11 kHz (formerly fmax = 4 kHz). In addition, the droplet diameter has been reduced to 60 μm. Therefore, a new fabrication process for the silicon nozzle chips has been developed enabling the production of smaller nozzle chips with higher surface quality. The size of the metal reservoir has been increased to hold up to 22 mL liquid metal and the performance and durability of the actuator has been improved by using stainless steel and a second <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connection</b> to control the sheath flow. Experimental results are presented regarding the characterization of the droplet generation, as well as printed metal structures...|$|E
40|$|The Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is {{designed}} to monitor the major constituents of the ISS's internal atmosphere. This mass spectrometer based system {{is an integral part}} of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and is a primary tool for the management of ISS atmosphere composition. As a part of NASA Change Request CR 10773 A, several alterations to the hardware have been made to accommodate improved MCA logistics. First, the ORU 08 verification gas assembly has been modified to allow the verification gas cylinder to be installed on orbit. The verification gas is an essential MCA consumable that requires periodic replenishment. Designing the cylinder for subassembly transport reduces the size and weight of the maintained item for launch. The redesign of the ORU 08 assembly includes a redesigned housing, cylinder mounting apparatus, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connection.</b> The second hardware change is a redesigned wiring harness for the ORU 02 analyzer. The ORU 02 electrical connector interface was damaged in a previous on-orbit installation, and this necessitated the development of a temporary fix while a more permanent solution was developed. The new wiring harness design includes flexible cable as well as indexing fasteners and guide-pins, and provides better accessibility during the on-orbit maintenance operation. This presentation will describe the hardware improvements being implemented for MCA as well as the expected improvement to logistics and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in locating a nuclear waste repository in unsaturated fractured rock has lead to rock characterization studies. Essential {{to a study}} of this type is the measurement of natural rock fracture apertures and gas conductivities. Six <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> located in unsaturated crystalline rock were tested using gas flow tests conducted in parallel boreholes. It was believed, but not possible to verify accurately enough given the limited orientation data, that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> represented individual fractures. For the purpose of analysis, {{it was assumed that}} the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> tested were "equivalent" to isolated individual fractures intersecting both test boreholes. Analytical equations were developed to treat fractures inclined to the borehole axis. These equations were used to calculate equivalent pneumatic apertures and equivalent gas conductivities from the test data. Equivalent pneumatic apertures calculated ranged from 9 to 200 microns and equivalent gas conductivities ranged from 3. 78 E- 3 to 1. 92 m/s...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to develop a {{selection}} method of the pneumatic connectors for directional 3 / 2 valve. The method was established to minimize resistance and loss of pressure in the valve with mounted <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> for the selected pipe diameters. Directional valve was modeled in 3 D CAD software SolidWorks while 3 D models of the air connections have been downloaded from the website of one of the leading suppliers of pneumatic. Based on developed solid model the simulation of compressed air flow in the software for computational fluid dynamics Ansys CFX was conducted. The studies using CFD methods helped to determine which air connections best meet the assumptions. Performed numerical tests enable proper selection of items to the newly designed pneumatic systems for a particular group of valves. As a consequence, this translates into a reduction in energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the entire pneumatic complex system. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report shows}} methods and {{workflow}} when exploring {{the potential to}} change Outotecs HCD Silver Electrolysis machine to a module type. It’s done {{as an attempt to}} lower the workshop and installation costs and to give customer a more accurate prize directly. To do this a concept was produced which was set to a stress test. Additional objectives were to investigate freight and installation procedures, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> and to calculate the difference in cost. Once the concept, a reinforced type of the original frame, was chosen stress tests in computer simulations were made and appropriate alterations were made. To make the module more “plug and play”-based changes such as relocation of the drive unit. A basic drawing of a freight frame was also made to ensure that the module could be shipped. Since the costs are not calculated it’s not explored if this is a cheaper way to manufacture the machine. But it seems to work to build the module this way so this question will be answered later. Parts of the module can be implemented on the original machine and therefore the work has not been in vain anyway...|$|R

Interlinked air suspension, which {{formed by}} {{interconnecting}} {{two or more}} air springs of traditional air suspension using switchable <b>pneumatic</b> pipe <b>connections,</b> can further improve vehicle’s riding comfort and driving stability. The structure and working principle of this suspension is introduced, the model of interlinked air suspension is developed and validated via experiments.

40|$|Over {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} trend towards smaller and more sensitive components and products in the fields of information, communications, medical and precision technology. Subsequent to increasing component miniaturization and integration densities, especially the rapid developments in the cross-sectional field of micro electronics have led more and more to demands for conductive dots with diameters of < 200 #mu#m punctiform micro-dispensing volumes in the picoliter range. Due to the results obtained from the peristaltic micro pump project, decisive advances could be made in the production of micro dispensing geometries in dot form using electrically-conductive adhesives implemented in a new micro dispensing technique. The new peristaltic dispensing process treats the media gently and enables isotropic conductive dots with tiny diameters of 130 #mu#m to be reproduced by implementing for the first time an unpressurized adhesive cartouche. The micro dispensing system utilized possesses a dispensing head (disposable/re-usable types available) with an adapted 3 -chamber geometry and a buna N membrane, integrated micro magnetic valves, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> and a quick-action lock. The micro dispensing system developed forms a sound basis for the flexible manufacture of microelectronic products in the future with three-dimensional substrates, multi-stage fitting processes, various bonding materials and a wide range of micro dispensing geometries and sequences. The developments achieved during the project support the industrial implementation of micro products and therefore represent and important contribution towards advancing micro system technology in Germany.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{research results}} {{from a series of}} field experiments and analyses used to test interpretive models for investigating the role of fractures in fluid flow through unsaturated, fractured tuffs. It summarizes the experimental design of single- and cross-hole pneumatic injection tests, including borehole configuration and testing schedules, data collection system, interpretive models developed and tested, data, and conclusions. Single-hole tests were interpreted by Guzman et al. (1996) by means of steady-state analysis to obtain permeability values based solely on late pressure data. This dissertation and Illman et al. (1998) employ pressure and pressure-derivative type-curves to analyze transient data. Air permeabilities determined from transient analyses agree well with those derived from steady-state analyses. Cross-hole pneumatic tests were analyzed by means of a graphical matching procedure using newly-developed pressure and pressure-derivative type-curves. Analyses of pressure data from individual monitoring intervals using these new type-curves, under the assumption that the rock acts as a uniform and isotropic fractured porous continuum, yield results that are comparable with parameters obtained from a numerical inverse procedure described in Illman et al. (1998). The results include information about <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connections</b> between the injection and monitoring intervals, corresponding directional air permeabilities, and air-filled porosities. Together with the results of earlier site investigations, single- and cross-hole test analyses reveal that at the Apache Leap Research Site in central Arizona: (1) the pneumatic pressure behavior of fractured tuff is amenable to analysis by methods that treat the rock as a continuum on scales ranging from meters to tens of meters; (2) this continuum is representative primarily, but not exclusively, of interconnected fractures; (3) its pneumatic properties vary strongly with location, direction and scale, in particular, the mean of pneumatic permeabilities increases, and their variance decreases with scale; (4) this scale effect is most probably due to the presence in the rock of various size fractures that are interconnected on a variety of scales; and (5) given a sufficiently large sample of spatially varying pneumatic rock properties on a given scale of measurement, these properties are amenable to analysis by geostatistical methods, which treat them as correlated random fields defined over a continuum...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the functional-physiological {{influences on the}} depth distribution of deepwater cisco (bloater), Coregonus hoyi, in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we compared their gas bladder anatomy with the putative ancestor, shallowwater cisco, C. artedi, from a shallow inland lake. There were no general differences in the gas bladder anatomy—both coregonines possessed simple micro retia (counter-current gas multipliers) and an open <b>pneumatic</b> duct <b>connection</b> between the bladder and esophagus. Bloater possessed a significantly smaller duct diameter relative to body size in comparison with shallowwater cisco, yet the estimated {{resistance to air flow}} through the duct of bloater was ∼ 7. 2 times lower than that of cisco. In light of these findings, we discuss evidence for two modes of gas bladder inflation in bloater: 1) gas deposition via micro retia at depth, and 2) gas acquisition via aquatic surface gulping (ASG). Because the hypolimnetic distribution of adult bloater precludes them from using ASG, we infer that these fish utilize micro retia to deposit gas into their bladders. We hypothesize that bloater compensate for relatively modest rates of gas deposition by not voiding excess gas. This “gas bladder conservation (GBC) hypothesis” for bloater is supported by four pieces of evidence: 1) deepwater habitation with no access to the surface to perform ASG, 2) a lack of extensive retia and modest gas deposition rates in coregonines, 3) a tendency to bloat when brought from depth to the surface, and 4) previous findings of a confined depth range, centered around the depth of neutral buoyancy.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{main advantages}} and disadvantages of mobile mortar concrete plants in comparison with stationary concrete mixing units. The main idea of the mobility is to provide quick movement. In its turn, this approach imposes some restrictions on dimensions and weights of concrete mixing equipment. However {{in the context of the}} concrete mixing equipment and construction site as whole the mobility concept is considered in the form of three components: minimum expenses on site preparation for assembly of a mortar concrete plant, transportability, reduction in installation and startand-adjustment periods. In this regard processing chain for production of concrete and mortar mixes is divided in separate complete operations. Then it is necessary to develop modules which are performing the required operations. Every module is developed in accordance with the size of a shipping container in order to make transportation convenient. Detachable connections are stipulated in the place of module linkages, electrical wiring, pipelines for supply water and chemical admixtures, <b>pneumatics.</b> Henceforth, these <b>connections</b> make it possible to reduce time for on-site assembly and disassembly of the equipment. The paper presents a mobile mortar concrete unit of block-module arrangement which has been developed within the framework of the State Scientific Research Programme at the BNTU. The unit has been manufactured using production capacities of JSC “Viprotekh” and it has been successfully introduced in production process. One of the promising directions is to use the mobile mortar concrete plants which are located and which are operating directly on construction sites. Their economic efficiency becomes higher with an increase of distance to the nearest stationary mortar concrete unit and scope of concreting works. Mobile mortar concrete plants are mainly intended for construction organizations which are realizing construction projects away from urban infrastructure and transportation networks: bridges, dams, highways, transport junctions. While ensuring the same production output of concrete these plants are located in close proximity to the construction site and the required mortars can be supplied directly to the site with the help of special concrete pumps. </p...|$|R
