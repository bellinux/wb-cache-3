The 2-satisfiability problems <b>provide</b> <b>one</b> of two major subclasses of the conjunctive normal form formulas that can be solved in polynomial time; the other of the two subclasses is Horn-satisfiability.|$|E

5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may <b>provide</b> <b>one</b> such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Oldham's {{town centre}} {{contains}} the highest concentration of retailing, cultural facilities and {{employment in the}} Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. It has been extensively redeveloped {{during the last few}} decades, and its two shopping centres, Town Square and the Spindles, now <b>provide</b> <b>one</b> of the largest covered retail areas in Greater Manchester. The Spindles (named with reference to textile spindles) is a modern shopping centre with over 40 retailers, banks, building societies and catering outlets. It houses one of Europe's largest stained glass roofs, created by local artist Brian Clarke in celebration of the music of one of Oldham's famous sons, composer and conductor Sir William Walton.|$|E
5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, {{consisting of a}} host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may <b>provide</b> <b>one</b> or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E
5|$|Production {{occurred}} during June and July 1979. Filming {{took place in}} Latina, Italy, {{as well as in}} New York City and Santo Domingo. Several of the actors' contracts had specified being provided with trailers for the duration of production; however, none were present when filming started and only Johnson was able to convince the producers to <b>provide</b> <b>one.</b> McCulloch and Johnson had known each other for many years by the time they collaborated on Zombi 2, having first met while they were members of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with the younger McCulloch coming to idolise Johnson's work. The underwater scene featuring a shark attack was devised by Ugo Tucci; it was shot without Fulci's approval by Giannetto De Rossi in Isla Mujeres, with the zombie portrayed by a local shark trainer.|$|E

5|$|The large convoys of East Indiamen {{were among}} the {{principal}} targets for any French raider. These huge ships sailed from Britain with general cargo, or often military stores and troops, to India or other ports in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, or China. There they would sell their cargoes and take on spices, tea, silk and other luxury goods before making the return journey to Britain. A round trip took over a year and an East Indiaman sailing to Britain would routinely carry {{hundreds of thousands of}} pounds worth of trade goods; one large convoy that sailed from Canton in January 1804 was worth over £8 million. East Indiamen were well-protected, armed with up to 30guns, and generally travelled in large convoys in which the ships could <b>provide</b> <b>one</b> another with mutual protection. Such convoys often had a Royal Navy escort, usually including a ship of the line.|$|E

25|$|While {{glucokinase}} {{has been}} shown to occur in certain cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine and stomach, its function and regulation have not been worked out.

It is suspected that these cells are involved in incretin functions.|$|E
