40|$|Although bats are {{important}} reservoirs of diverse viruses {{that can cause}} human epidemics, {{little is known about}} the presence of <b>picornaviruses</b> in these flying mammals. Among 1, 108 bats of 18 species studied, three novel <b>picornaviruses</b> (groups 1, 2, and 3) were identified from alimentary specimens of 12 bats from five species and four genera. Two complete genomes, each from the three <b>picornaviruses,</b> were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they fell into three distinct clusters in the Picornaviridae family, with low homologies to known <b>picornaviruses,</b> especially in leader and 2 A proteins. Moreover, group 1 and 2 viruses are more closely related to each other than to group 3 viruses, which exhibit genome features distinct from those of the former two virus groups. In particular, the group 3 virus genome contains the shortest leader protein within Picornaviridae, a putative type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 ′-untranslated region instead of the type IV IRES found in group 1 and 2 viruses, one instead of two GXCG motifs in 2 A, an L→V substitution in the DDLXQ motif in 2 C helicase, and a conserved GXH motif in 3 C protease. Group 1 and 2 viruses are unique among <b>picornaviruses</b> in having AMH instead of the GXH motif in 3 C pro. These findings suggest that the three <b>picornaviruses</b> belong to two novel genera in the Picornaviridae family.

25|$|The genome is non-segmented and positive-sense (the {{same sense}} as {{mammalian}} mRNA, being read 5' to 3'). Unlike mammalian mRNA picornaviruses {{do not have}} a 5' cap but a virally encoded protein known as VPg. However, like mammalian mRNA, the genome does have a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. There is an un-translated region (UTR) {{at both ends of the}} <b>picornavirus</b> genome. The 5' UTR is usually longer, being around 500–1200 nucleotides (nt) in length, compared to that of the 3' UTR, which is around 30–650 nt. It is thought that the 5' UTR is important in translation and the 3' in negative strand synthesis; however the 5' end may also have a role to play in virulence of the virus. The rest of the genome encodes structural proteins at the 5' end and non-structural proteins at the 3' end in a single polyprotein.|$|E

2500|$|The virus {{responsible}} for the disease is a <b>picornavirus,</b> the prototypic member of the genus Aphthovirus.

Similarly, we compared our rate estimates for the RNA polymerase 3 Dpol gene from five viruses to four published 3 Dpol rates.

Therefore, increasing the pH of sludge should cause rapid inactivation of indigenous <b>picornaviruses...</b>|$|R
2500|$|A <b>picornavirus</b> is a virus {{belonging}} to the family Picornaviridae, [...] a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Vertebrates, including humans, serve as natural hosts. Picornaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that represent a large family of small, cytoplasmic, plus-strand RNA(~7.5kb) viruses with a 30nm icosahedral capsid. Its genome {{does not have a}} lipid membrane. Picornaviruses are found in mammals and birds. There are currently 80 species in this family, divided among 35 genera. These include the Enterovirus, Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Rhinovirus and Hepatovirus genera. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including paralysis, meningitis, hepatitis and poliomyelitis. Picornaviruses are in Baltimore IV class. Their genome single-stranded (+) sense RNA is that functions as mRNA after entry into the cell and all viral mRNA synthesized is of genome polarity. The mRNA encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This polymerase makes complementary minus strands of RNA, then uses them as templates to make more plus strands. So, an overview of the steps in <b>picornavirus</b> replication are in order: attachment, entry, translation, transcription/genome replication (one and the same process), assembly and exit.|$|E
2500|$|Genomic RNAs of picornaviruses possess {{multiple}} RNA {{elements and}} they are required for both negative and plus strand RNA synthesis. The cis acting replication(cre) element is required for replication. The stem-loop-structure that contains the cre is independent of position but changes with location between virus types when it has been identified. Also, the 3’ end elements of viral RNA are significant and efficient for RNA replication of picornaviruses. The 3’ end of <b>picornavirus</b> contains poly(A) tract which be required for infectivity. On the other hand, RNA synthesis is hypothesized to occur in this region.3’ end NCR of poliovirus is not necessary for negative-strands synthesis. However, it is important element for positive—strand synthesis. Additionally,5’ end NCR that contain secondary structural elements is required for RNA replication and poliovirus translation initiation(IRES). Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) [...] are RNA structures that allow cap independent initiation of translation, {{and are able to}} initiate translation {{in the middle of a}} messenger RNA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picornavirus</b> {{belongs to}} the family Picornaviridae. <b>Picornavirus</b> virions are nonenveloped and the +ssRNA nonsegmented genome is {{encapsulated}} in an icosahedral protein structure made from four capsid proteins encoded by the virus. <b>Picornavirus</b> viral replication typically {{takes place in the}} cytoplasm of the cell. <b>Picornavirus</b> +ssRNA genome then gets translated via internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that is recognized by host cell ribosomes for cap independent translation. To compete with other mRNA transcripts, <b>picornavirus</b> destroys cap dependent translation in the host so host cell ribosomes will favor translation of viral transcripts. +ssRNA makes -ssRNA intermediates to make more viral +ssRNA. The genome of <b>picornavirus</b> is exhibited in Figure 1. As displayed, <b>picornavirus</b> does not have a viral 5’ cap but instead encodes for a protein Vpg. The absence of the 5’ cap is why the <b>picornavirus</b> genome depends on cap dependent translation for replication. The genome, however, does contain a poly-A tail on {{the opposite end of the}} Vpg protein. Both ends of the genome has UTR (untranslated regions). The <b>picornavirus</b> genome has three proteins (P1, P2, P3). P1 encodes for a proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) that make the capsid proteins. P2 and P3 proteins assist in infectivity of the <b>picornavirus</b> to hijack and interfere with host cell functionality. Specifically, 2B, 2C, and 3A proteins interfere with host cell function and the 3D protein encodes as the RNA polymerase. 2A and 3C act as proteinases and their function varies among the different genera of <b>picornavirus.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Picornaviruses</b> are {{responsible}} {{for a range of}} human and animal diseases, but how their RNA genome is packaged remains poorly understood.

Here we report the atomic structure of one such virus, Ljungan virus, the type member of the genus Parechovirus B, which has been linked to diabetes and myocarditis in humans. The 3. 78 -Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure shows remarkable features, including an extended VP 1 C terminus, forming a major protuberance on the outer surface of the virus, and a basic motif at the N terminus of VP 3, binding to which orders some 12 % of the viral genome.

The structures of the two particles are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder {{on the inside of}} the empty particle. The full virus contains the small viral protein VP 4, whereas the empty particle harbours only the uncleaved precursor, VP 0.

Peptide scanning data extend the previously reported VP 3 antigenic site, while structure-based predictions suggest further epitopes. HAV contains no pocket factor and can withstand remarkably high temperature and low pH, and empty particles are even more robust than full particles.
