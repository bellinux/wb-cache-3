40|$|Oleoresin of pine (Pinus merkusii) is a Non Wood Forest Products {{commodity}} from West Sumatra. This oleoresin {{was obtained}} by tapping pine trees with square system followed by light burning to stimulate more oleoresin exudate to bleed. This research was carried out to assess the effect of storage time and kind of <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container for pine resin collected from the field with square tapped method, on rosin recovery rate and its physico­chemical properties. Prior to distillation, the pine oleoresin was kept in two kinds of containers, i. e. <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel and <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> aluminium. The distillation of pine oleoresin kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container produced about 58 ­ 63 % of rosin and 20 ­ 26 % of turpentine oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the distillation products of pine oleoresin previously kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> aluminium amounted to 56 ­ 63 % of rosin recovery and 22 ­ 27 % of turpentine. Analysis of variance of the experimental results indicated that container and storage time caused significant effect on ash content of rosin. The ash content of rosin from pine oleoresin after being kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel container was somewhat {{lower than that of}} the one being kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel container. The storage time of pine oleoresin up to 6 weeks in aluminium container could produce the rosin still comply with its prime quality and equivalent to WW (Water White) quality of rosin. Meanwhile, the storage time of pine oleoresin in steel container could last only for 4 weeks to meet the requirement to produce at such quality. The prolonged storage time of pine oleoresin caused the decrease in rosin quality. It is concluded that a <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container can be used to keep pine oleoresin up to 6 weeks, and still rendering a prime quality rosin based on the Indonesian National Standard...|$|R

40|$|Herein is {{described}} the fabrication {{and use of}} a plastic multilayer 3 -channel microfluidic fixture. Multilayer devices were produced by laser machining of plastic polymethylmethacrylate and polyethyleneterapthalate laminates by ablation. The fixture consisted of an array of nine individually addressable gold or gold/ITO working electrodes, and a resistive platinum heating element. Laser machining of both the fluidic pathways in the <b>plastic</b> <b>laminates,</b> and the stencil masks used for thermal evaporation to form electrode regions on the <b>plastic</b> <b>laminates,</b> enabled rapid and inexpensive implementation of design changes. Electrochemiluminescence reactions in the fixture were achieved and monitored through ITO electrodes. Electroaddressable aryl diazonium chemistry was employed to selectively pattern gold electrodes for electrochemical multianalyte DNA detection from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) samples. Electrochemical detection of dsDNA was achieved by melting of dsDNA molecules in solution with the integrated heater, allowing detection of DNA sequences specific to breast and colorectal cancers with a non-specific binding control. Following detection, the array surface could be renewed via high temperature (95 [*]°C) stripping using the integrated heating element.
