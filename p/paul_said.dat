5|$|On May 1, 2009, <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 {{matched his}} poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined {{to seek a}} third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|Adrian <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as {{a smoker}} to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa {{was more like a}} temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Paul {{went against}} the {{majority}} of Republicans and voted to block implementation of the Medicare Part D program, which expanded Medicare {{to cover the costs}} of medications for the elderly and disabled, and which prohibited the government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to try to get lower prices for the covered medications. In 2007, he again {{went against the}} majority of House Republicans when he voted with all of the Democrats in support of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which, if enacted, would have given the government the authority to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices with the manufacturers. During the 2012 presidential primary campaign, <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that although he remains opposed to Medicare Part D, repealing it was not one of his immediate priorities.|$|E
25|$|Randel Helms {{argues that}} the books of the Bible were written for and against {{different}} points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write {{because they wanted to}} challenge or correct those who had written before them. So, for example, <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that he opposed Peter because he felt that Peter was clearly in the wrong (Galatians 1 and 2). Helms notes that Jeremiah condemned the entire religious establishment, that the prophets and priests were frauds, every one of them (Jeremiah 8:10). Luke felt the need to write another gospel even though other writers had already drawn up their own account of events (Luke 1:1). Luke felt that Mark's gospel was filled with errors and edited it freely, even the words of the dying Christ were not left unaltered.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with economic analyst and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but he cautioned that those who do {{should be aware that}} the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E
25|$|Paul's dreams, visualized by Brenna in 1780s, materialized in Saint Michael's Castle – the emperor's {{principal}} Saint Petersburg residence {{intended to}} replace the Winter Palace associated with Catherine's reign. The site chosen for the castle was highly significant to Paul: it housed the wooden Summer Palace of empress Elisabeth, it was Paul's birthplace, but also a place where his dreaded mother was proclaimed empress {{by the same people}} who killed his father. <b>Paul</b> <b>said</b> that he had a vision of Archangel Michael who instructed him to erect a church on his birthplace, and indeed the castle designed by Brenna had a prominent church integrated in its western facade. Authorized immediately after Catherine's death, the castle was completed by Brenna in four years and occupied by the royal family shortly before Paul's own death. It had a strong Baroque styling clearly contrary to Catherinian palladianism.|$|E
