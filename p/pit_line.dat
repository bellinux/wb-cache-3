50|$|Stansfield Hall {{railway station}} {{was the second}} station in Todmorden in West Yorkshire, England and was {{situated}} on the Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line.</b> It opened in 1869 and the last train called in 1944 but was not officially closed until 1949.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{a second}} {{terminal}} was planned near the Moore Market Complex, with six platforms to be {{constructed in the}} first phase of the project and four platforms each in the second and third phases. For additional infrastructure, the goods yard at Salt Cotaurs will be closed to provide more <b>pit</b> <b>line</b> and stabling line facilities for the new terminal.|$|E
5000|$|Cornholme {{railway station}} served {{the village of}} Cornholme in West Yorkshire, England on the Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line.</b> The station was opened by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in July 1878 (nearly thirty years after the line itself) and closed by the LMS on 26 September 1938. [...] The line remains in use for {{passenger}} trains between York/Leeds and Blackpool, which run non-stop between Hebden Bridge and Burnley.|$|E

5000|$|... {{this project}} was started on 1 May along with gauge {{conversion}} from meter to broad from very same station to pilibhit. In this project railway will develop this station as terminal for many northwest and north bound trains(from Delhi, sitapur, pilibhit, tanakpur, shahjahanpur, behraich, mailani, lalkuan, kathgodam. Seven platforms are under construction with a washing <b>pit</b> <b>line</b> and loop line along with an entirely new large station building and dual entrance.|$|E

50|$|Trains {{continue}} up the Calder {{valley to}} Burnley and Blackburn; it also runs {{parallel with the}} Leeds and Liverpool Canal from Burnley. The section from Todmorden to Burnley (often called the Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line)</b> was opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway (later L&YR) on 12 November 1849. The East Lancashire Railway (later L&YR) built the Burnley to Preston line, Burnley to Accrington 18 September 1848, Accrington to Blackburn 19 June 1848, and the Blackburn to Preston section on 1 June 1846.|$|E

5000|$|Portsmouth {{railway station}} {{was on the}} Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line</b> and served the village of Portsmouth, {{which was part of}} Lancashire, before being {{incorporated}} into the West Riding of Yorkshire in the late 1880s. It is now in the successor county of West Yorkshire. It opened along with the line in 1849 but was closed as an economy measure on 7 July 1958. [...] Few traces of the station remain, although the line itself remains in use for passenger trains between Burnley and Hebden Bridge or Todmorden.|$|E
50|$|A {{project to}} {{reinstate}} the Manchester-Burnley curve was first proposed in 2009, {{although it was}} not until the end of 2011 that the finance was finally secured as part of the Regional Growth Fund initiative announced by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. As first built, the curve ran from a junction approximately 66 ft north-east of the viaduct 550 yd and connected on to the Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line</b> at Stanfield Hall Junction, near the footbridge on Stansfield Road (the remains of the curve can still be seen from this bridge).|$|E
5000|$|The 1923 Grouping saw {{the station}} {{pass into the}} hands of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, but it wasn't until after {{nationalisation}} in 1948 that traffic and services began to decline. The Great Harwood line was the first to lose its passenger services in 1957, whilst the through coaches to London were 'temporarily' suspended in 1959 for electrification work to take place on the Crewe to Manchester route but never reinstated. The biggest losses came though in the 1960s - Wigan trains were withdrawn in January 1960, those to Hellifield in September 1962 and the Southport line & Blackpool Central station both fell victim to the Beeching Axe in 1964. By 1970, the through links to [...] and Liverpool had also gone, leaving only the Manchester via Bolton & Colne to Preston lines along with a few seasonal trains between [...] and [...] via [...] and the Copy Pit route to serve the station. Thus when the lines & station were resignalled in 1973 (control passing to the new power box at Preston as part of the WCML modernisation scheme), three of the station's seven platforms were closed and a fourth (the current platform 4) reduced in length and downgraded to emergency use only. The remaining trains could quite easily be accommodated on platforms 1-3 (the northernmost island of the two). This method of operation would remain until the station underwent its most recent major rebuild in 2000 (see below). The 1980s & 90s would though see a revival in service provision, with the reopening to regular passenger traffic of the Copy <b>Pit</b> <b>line</b> in 1984 (initially on a twice-daily trial basis with services funded by a local building society) and the Ribble Valley line to Clitheroe a decade later in 1994. The latter would be served as an extension of the existing route from Manchester via Bolton, whilst the former brought regular services to & from Blackpool, Leeds and [...] to the station for the first time in more than a decade.|$|E
