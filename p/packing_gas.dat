40|$|To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the gas-assisted injection molding process, we have developed a computational model for the gas assisted infection molding (GAIM) process. This model has been set up to deal with (non-isothermal) three-dimensional flow, in order to correctly predict the gas distribution in GAIM products. It employs a pseudo-concentration method. in which the governing equations are solved on a fixed grid that covers the entire mold. Both the air downstream of the polymer front and the gas are represented by a fictitious fluid that does not contribute to the pressure drop Fn the mold. The model has been validated against both isothermal and non-isothermal gas injection experiments. In contrast to other models that have been reported in the literature, our model yields the gas penetration from the actual process physics (not from a presupposed gas distribution).

The occurrence of parking configurations, as those for which hard rods and packing constraints are both fulfilled, is then studied.

40|$|Although gas-assisted {{injection}} molding (GAIM) has been practiced in industry {{for more than}} a decade, the process is not completely understood, particularly with respect to the gas penetration mechanism.

On the other hand, the packings do not enhance the mass transfer significantly.

Motivated by applications such as outgassing of crystal-rich magmas, we map gas migration patterns in experiments where we vary (1) particle fractions and liquid viscosity (10 Pa s – 500 Pa s), (2) container shape (horizontal parallel plates and upright cylinders), and (3) methods of bubble generation (single bubble injections, and multiple bubble generation with chemical reactions).

The first occurs at the random loose <b>packing,</b> when <b>gas</b> bubbles begin to deform; the second occurs near the random close packing, and is characterized by gas migration in a fracture-like manner. We suggest that changes in gas migration behavior are caused by dilation of the granular network, which locally resists bubble growth.

This behavior may explain the efficient loss of volatiles from viscous slurries such as crystal-rich magmas...|$|R
