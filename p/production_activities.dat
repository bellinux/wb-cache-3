5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential <b>production</b> <b>activities,</b> including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the spatial density of <b>production</b> <b>activity</b> on labor {{productivity}} and total factor productivity in Korean manufacturing. A theoretical model that directly relates productivity growth to the spatial density of <b>production</b> <b>activity</b> is developed. The empirical results show that a higher density of <b>production</b> <b>activity</b> would lead to an increase in productivity in four regions (Gwangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Chungcheongnam-do, and Gyeonggi-do) out of 15 regions. Our empirical analysis further suggests that any increase in the density of <b>production</b> <b>activity</b> in the metropolitan cities (except for Gwangju) could lead to a decrease in productivity. It can be thus concluded that there is a potential for Korean firms to increase productivity by readjusting the density of <b>production</b> <b>activity</b> across regions.

US funding for the military component of Plan Colombia was on average US$540 million per year between 2000 and 2008, while the Colombian government invested approximately US$812 million per year. Following the September 11 attacks, Plan Colombia resources began to be used for anti-guerrilla operations. Over 80% of US aid to Colombia between 2000 and 2007 was military assistance, which came to reinforce the modernization of the Colombian armed forces under the Pastrana and Uribe administrations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{large-scale}} investigations about language {{learning and the}} increased emphasis on reading skills in the 1920s led {{to the notion of}} [...] "vocabulary control". It was discovered that languages have a core basic vocabulary of about 2,000 words that occur frequently in written texts, and it was assumed that mastery of these would greatly aid reading comprehension. Parallel to this was the notion of [...] "grammar control", emphasizing the sentence patterns most-commonly found in spoken conversation. Such patterns were incorporated into dictionaries and handbooks for students. The principal difference between the oral approach and the direct method was that methods devised under this approach would have theoretical principles guiding the selection of content, gradation of difficulty of exercises and the presentation of such material and exercises. The main proposed benefit was that such theoretically based organization of content would result in a less-confusing sequence of learning events with better contextualization of the vocabulary and grammatical patterns presented. Last but not least, all language points were to be presented in [...] "situations". [...] Emphasis on this point led to the approach's second name.
