40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} sentence elaboration on self-regulated learning {{in order to examine}} age differences in resource allocation to the construction of textbase and discourse-level representations. Older and younger adults learned about a topic by reading a series of sentences varying in elaboration (from simple factoids to highly elaborated text) and manner of presentation (<b>progressive</b> change in <b>elaboration</b> vs. random change in elaboration). Younger readers were more likely to recall information from factoids; older adults, from highly elaborated text. Relative to young, older readers showed an advantage in the progressive presentation condition, which minimized frequent changes between textbase and discourse-level processing. Older adults showed poorer memory monitoring for factoids and less elaborated discourse relative to young, but when passages were highly elaborated or presented progressively, age differences were eliminated. Results support the idea that textbase and discourse-level encoding arise from functionally distinct systems whose regulation depends on text properties and reader age. ...|$|R
40|$|Relationships {{between the}} major {{lineages}} of snakes are assessed {{based on a}} phylogenetic analysis of the most extensive phenotypic data set to date (212 osteological, 48 soft anatomical, and three ecological characters). The marine, limbed Cretaceous snakes Pachyrhachis and Haasiophis emerge as the most primitive snakes: characters proposed to unite them with advanced snakes (macrostomatans) are based on unlikely interpretations of contentious elements or are highly variable within snakes. Other basal snakes include madtsoiids and Dinilysia – both large, presumably non-burrowing forms. The inferred relationships within extant snakes are broadly similar to currently accepted views, with scolecophidians (blindsnakes) being the most basal living forms, followed by anilioids (pipesnakes), booids and booid-like groups, acrochordids (filesnakes), and finally colubroids. Important new conclusions include {{strong support for the}} monophyly of large constricting snakes (erycines, boines, pythonines), and moderate support for the non-monophyly of the ‘trophidophiids’ (dwarf boas). These phylogenetic results are obtained whether varanoid lizards, or amphisbaenians and dibamids, are assumed to be the nearest relatives (outgroups) of snakes, and whether multistate characters are treated as ordered or unordered. Identification of large marine forms, and large surface-active terrestrial forms, as the most primitive snakes contradicts with the widespread view that snakes arose via minute, burrowing ancestors. Furthermore, these basal fossil snakes all have long flexible jaw elements adapted for ingesting large prey (‘macrostomy’), suggesting that large gape was primitive for snakes and secondarily reduced in the most basal living foms (scolecophidians and anilioids) in connection with burrowing. This challenges the widespread view that snake evolution has involved <b>progressive,</b> directional <b>elaboration</b> of the jaw apparatus to feed on larger prey. Michael S. Y. Lee and John D.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} survey and characterize {{the development of a}} key link between chemically mediated neurotransmission and neuronal cytoarchitecture in mammalian basal ganglia. Peroxidase immunohistochemical and Golgi impregnation/gold toning methods were combined to doubly label the tachykinin neuromodulator signature and somatodendritic structure of neostriatal neurons in late fetal, postnatal and adult cats. The results supported 3 conclusions of considerable significance. (1) Colocalization of immunohistochemical and Golgi impregnation/gold toning labels is a feasible, rational and productive means to identify and determine the somatodendritic morphogenesis of tachykinin neurons. (2) The application of this method to developing feline neostriatum demonstrates directly that the principal tachykinin cells are medium-sized spiny neurons, which undergo <b>progressive</b> growth and <b>elaboration</b> of cell bodies, dendritic arbors and dendritic spines during the late fetal and postnatal periods. (3) There is a strong but incomplete concordance between tachykinin and medium-sized spiny neuronal phenotypes, because a minor variant of medium-sized spiny neurons and rare subgroups of medium- and large-sized sparse spiny neurons also show the tachykinin neuromodulator signature. Taken together, these results suggest that neostriatal neurons show an early commitment to heterogeneous tachykinin phenotypes, although the full and final expression of their somatodendritic characteristics coincides with synaptogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this study}} was to examine the structural organization of preschoolers’ living kinds concept and the nature of developmental change in that concept from roughly 3. 5 - to 4. 5 -years-old. Specifically, this study was designed to assess whether preschoolers’ living kind conceptual development involves <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of an existing biologically based skeletal framework or conceptual reorganization. Unlike previous studies, this study employed a longitudinal design, an extensive stimulus set, alternate indices of understanding, and complementary statistical analyses. Thirty-five 3. 0 - to 3. 5 -year-olds participated in four testing sessions over the course of one year; each testing session included three phases that involved four object classes: plants, animals, mobile and immobile objects. The phases involved statements participants generated relative to the four classes, what biological and psychological properties they attributed to the classes, their assignment of “alive” to the classes, and their answers to open-ended questions about living kinds. By examining preschoolers’ responding in the different testing contexts over time and examining the relationship of responding across testing context and across the domains of biological and psychological understanding, this study was able to assess the structure of preschoolers’ living kinds concept and whether that structure is organizationally stable or labile during the preschool period. Results suggest that certain aspects of a mature, biologically based framework are in place early in the preschool period while other aspects have not yet been developmentally constructed and that the nature of the developmental change that takes place between roughly 3. 5 to 4. 5 years involves both <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of an existing biologically based skeletal framework and organizational restructuring.

Using an inductive methodology combining survey and focus group data, we observe that the hierarchical power structure typical of the Corporation has shaped the typifications of this group through a disciplinary form of control similar to the one described by Foucault in his analysis of Bentham’s Panopticon. Relying on the <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of the concept of discipline in Foucault’s work, we subsequently highlight how the structural vision of agency that he has proposed could help enrich our understanding of institutional agency and complexity, thereby opening new potential research avenues to address some of the current gaps in {{the literature}} on institutional work regarding contextual embeddedness and institutional deviance...|$|E

Previous {{studies suggest that the}} NMJ becomes progressively larger with age, to a greater degree in fast-twitch muscles than slow-twitch muscles. To better understand this process, quantitative morphometry was conducted on soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) nerve terminals from C 57 BL/ 6 NNia mice aged 4, 8, 10, 12, 18, 22, 24, and 32 months. Computer-aided morphometry of camera lucida drawings of aging nerve terminals indicated significant differences in the size and complexity of NMJs in both muscles between different age groups; however, there were no significant net trends with age. The magnitude and direction of the morphometric changes depended on the particular ages compared, and occurred to a greater degree in the EDL.

They discuss that efficiency of trade-offs between cost and environmental factors can be analysed by operations research. The amount of pollution emitted by a vehicle depends on several factors. Over the years, {{a wide range of}} emission and fuel consumption models have been presented. A comprehensive analysis of several vehicle emission models for road freight transportation is presented by Demir et al. (2011). In their research the ‘comprehensive modal emission model’ is exploited. Incorporating the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions into existing planning methods for vehicle routing was introduced by Bektaş and Laporte (2011). They offer some new integer programming formulations for the VRP, named pollution routing problem (PRP), that minimizes both operational cost, and carbon tax. Extending their model with independent objective function for emission level will be very useful, because emission tax is trivial in comparison with other costs. Moreover, considering heterogeneous fleet of vehicle instead of homogenous may lead to more reductions in energy consumption.|$|E

Twenty high school students wrote about their emotional reactions to the death on 3 consecutive days. The writings were coded using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and analyzed using a mixed-methods software (T-LAB). A measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Events Scale–Revised) obtained at baseline (14 days after the death) and 1 week and 4 months' postwriting was used to classify the students into four adjustment trajectories: Delayed Distress, Recovery, Stable-Negative, and Stable-Positive. Textual analysis revealed a <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of the traumatic event across the 3 writing days, moving from a factual perspective to the processing of emotions to an integrated emotional and cognitive restructuring of the event.

Methods: Primary care physicians identified consecutive patients who consulted with symptoms that the physician considered unexplained by physical disease. Four hundred twenty consultations with 36 physicians were audio recorded and transcribed, and physician and patient speech was coded turn by turn. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis modeled the probability of the physician proposing medical care {{as a function of the}} quantity of patients ’ speech of specific kinds that preceded it. Results: Whether physicians proposed medical care was unrelated to patients ’ attributions to disease or demands for treatment. Proposals of explicitly somatic responses (drugs, investigation or specialist referral) became more likely after patients had elaborated their symptoms and less likely after patients indicated psychosocial difficulties. Proposals of a further primary care consultation were responses simply to lengthening consultation. Conclusions: The findings are incompatible with the influential assumption that physicians offer medical care to patients with unexplained symptoms because the patients demand treatment for a physical disease. Instead, the reason why many of these patients receive high levels of medical care should be sought by investigating the motivations behind physicians ’ responses to patients’ symptom presentation. Key words: somatization, communication, physician-patient relations, symptoms. MUS medically unexplained symptoms...|$|E

The guiding principle of our approach is context dependence, within and (in contrast to Marr [1982]) between levels of organization. We propose that three mechanisms guide the emergence of representations: competition, cooperation, and chronotopy; which themselves allow for two central processes: proactivity and progressive specialization. We suggest that the main outcome of development is partial representations, distributed across distinct functional circuits. This framework is derived by examining development at the level of single neurons, brain systems, and whole organisms. We use the terms encellment, embrainment, and embodiment to describe the higher-level contextual influences that act at each of these levels of organization. To illustrate these mechanisms in operation we provide case studies in early visual perception, infant habituation, phonological development, and object representations in infancy. Three further case studies are concerned with interactions between levels of explanation: social development, atypical development and within that, developmental dyslexia. We conclude that cognitive development arises from a dynamic, contextual change in embodied neural structures leading to partial representations across multiple brain regions and timescales, in response to proactively specified physical and social environment...|$|E

This inherent hedonic property of olfactory stimuli makes this sensory modality particularly suitable for studying autobiographical memory. In the present work, adolescents (first experiment), young adults (second experiment), and elderly (third experiment) {{of both sexes}} were asked to smell 10 familiar odorants and to report if these odorants evoked personal autobiographical memories or referential memories (i. e., names and objects). The participants were then required to link these memories to triplets of words using the <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> method of the Loci mnemonic. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether 1) odorants evoking autobiographical memories led to faster reaction times (RTs) and to a greater number of correct responses in the recall of the items associated to such memories than do odorants evoking referential memories, 2) females differed from males on the above tasks along with the life span, and 3) the preferential codes (i. e., autobiographical or referential) attributed to the odorants vary according to gender and age. In general, it was observed that the way in which the odorants were encoded affected the subsequent retrieval. Indeed, data analyses have shown that odorants evoking autobiographical memories lead to faster RTs (experiments 2 and 3) and that females outperform males (experiments 1 and 2). However, these effects are greatly age and gender dependent. Furthermore, females are more prone than males to code the odorants autobiographically (as shown by the higher amount of autobiographical experiences that they have provided at all ages relative to males).

In an initial experiment, 14 {{subjects}} were asked to memorize 20 triplets of concrete, high-imagery, high-frequency words, connecting them to 20 well-known mnemonicloci and following ‘progressive elaboration’ instructions. Their performance on serial recall was compared with that of a group of subjects who used ‘progressive elaboration’ instructions but did not know locimnemonics. Both groups revealed a position effect in the triplet (the item in first position was remembered better than the second or third in the triplet). However, the overall performance of the locimnemonic group was far better, especially in the order of recall both within the triplets and between them. In the second experiment following the same procedure, {{the effects of}} different modalities of a 7 -day delayed test were analyzed in 8 groups of 7 subjects. The mnemonic group performed better both on free recall and recognition, but not on cued recall. When a word strongly associated to the first word of the triplet was given as a cue, both locimnemonic and control subjects gave a low, not significantly different, performance. It is argued that the latter cue is in conflict both with the cue-locus and with the specific encoding of the triplet given also by controls. Further, in all groups, retrieval seems to proceed from the first to the second to the third items. The most general result of the two experiments is that <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> instructions make locimnemonics not only powerful with series of materials, but also capable of maintaining the order of information within and between the loci.

The common ancestry of these genera {{is supported by}} antennulary segmentation, rostral morphology, cephalothoracic sensillar patterns, presence of lateral body processes, elongation of P 1 endopod, segmentation of male P 3 endopod and P 5 armature in both sexes. Two new species of Ancorabolus are described from Frierfjord/Langesundfjord in Norway. A. inermis sp. nov. and A. confusus sp. nov. occur sympatrically in southern Scandinavia and can be readily differentiated by the pattern of body processes. Re-examination of Sars' (1909) material revealed that his widely adopted redescription of the type species A. mirabilis {{was based on an}} amalgamate of these two species. All records of A. mirabilis from outside the Firth of Clyde (Scotland) which cannot be identified as A. inermis or A. confusus have to be regarded as unconfirmed. Norman's (1903) material of A. mirabilis collected in East Finmark (Norway) and erroneously designated as types, is radically divergent in cephalic process pattern, caudal ramus configuration, antennary armature and P 1 morphology. It is allocated to a new genus and species, Juxtaramia polaris. Both sexes of Arthropsyllus serratus are redescribed from new and existing material collected in southern Norway. Re-examination of Norman's (1911) material from the Firth of Clyde did not provide any conclusive evidence to maintain A. serratus spinifera as a valid subspecies. A. australis is transferred as the type species of a new genus Breviconia, since it deviates significantly from the revised diagnosis of Arthropsyllus. Laophontodes echinatus Brady, 1918 is regarded as species inquirenda in Breviconia. A new genus and species, Uptionyx verenae, is described from a hydrothermal vent of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, northeastern Pacific Ocean. Parsimony analysis of the Ancorabolus -group identifies Arthropsyllus as the most primitive offshoot and Juxtaramia-Ancorabolus as the terminal clade with both Uptionyx and Breviconia diverging from intermediate nodes.

40|$|The {{problematic}} {{relationship between}} feminism and postmodernism manifests itself, in contemporary fiction by women, as {{a conflict between}} political and aesthetic practices which is ultimately waged upon the ground of subjectivity. Angela Carter's novels offer an extended exploration of subjectivity which utilises, in many ways self consciously, the ongoing theorisation of subjectivity and related notions - notably desire, gender and power - which characterises contemporary feminist and postmodernist philosophy. This thesis offers a series of readings of Carter's novels which traces their engagement with particular aspects of the theorisation of subjectivity. It attempts to present Carter's novels as examples of how the aesthetic and the political can {{to a certain extent}} be combined, and of how feminist political practice can be both represented and problematised in the postmodernist fictional text, while postmodernist aesthetic practices are also exploited but problematised in and by that exploitation. The Introduction explores the relationship between feminist and postmodernist theories of the subject, through a survey of theorists from both 'camps' and a brief survey of contemporary women novelists, before discussing the critical neglect of Carter's fiction. Chapter 2 explores more extensively the confluence of feminist, postmodernist and psychoanalytic models of the subject and offers an exemplary reading of a short story by Carter, in order to demonstrate certain stylistic and thematic characteristics of her fiction. In particular, psychoanalytic models of subjectivity are examined. The succeeding two Chapters address Carter's early (pre- 1972) novels in order to explore the development of her fictional career from its context of 1960 s British fiction, and trace the <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of certain thematic preoccupations in their nascent form. Three further Chapters individually address each novel in Carter's 'trilogy' so as to demonstrate how each text explores a particular aspect of the construction of the postmodern self. The Conclusion offers a reading of Carter's fiction as extensively engaged, both at a formal and a thematic level, with the deconstruction of conventional notions of the self in order to expose the political interests invested in those notions. Carter's last novel is also addressed {{in the context of this}} discussion, as are the ways in which Carter's fiction offers contributions to the feminist/postmodernist debate as discussed throughout the thesis. Throughout the thesis, extensive reference is made to critical and theoretical works which elucidate or impinge upon the themes addressed in Carter's novels, and Carter's own comments in interviews and in her critical texts are also utilised...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) is {{considered}} {{here in the}} context of the Enlightenment effort to develop a science of man. His Philosophie zoologique (1809) and the Systeme analytique (1820) are the two principal relevant works examined in depth to discover how he meant to base a science of man on his biologie. A central problem to the formation of a science of man was to account scientific ally for the soul. The fate of the soul is investigated in this study not only to shed light on the meaning of Enlightenment but above all to understand that union of philosophe and naturaliste by which Lamarck characterized himself. Descartes' attempt to formulate a purely materialistic science of man, notwithstanding the classical split he made between body and soul, foreshadowed an important naturalistic current in the 18 th century of which Lamarck was a brilliant exponent. Descartes' divine soul was dropped completely; consequently a most important role was given to a material soul, which, under the influence of Newton's physics, assimilated forces. The debate over the nature of this material soul involved such physiological issues as sensibility, irritability, and the production of feeling and thought from animal organization. Lamarck intended his evolutionary biology to supply a natural history of the soul, and to provide a convincing proof for the argument that the physique and the moral, "two orders of phenomena apparently so distinct," had a common basis of organization. Lamarck epitomized the evolution of life as a progressive interiorization of certain material forces or subtle fluids from the environment into, and correlative with a <b>progressive</b> <b>elaboration</b> of, animal organization. The chief subtle fluids involved were heat (or caloric) and electricity, and they acted like forces in causing the motions of the organs essential to life. In addition, these subtle fluids were apparently endowed with a vital soul although Lamarck does not explicitly admit it. In man, at least, the subtle fluids undoubtedly amount to an unconscious inner man or traditional soul. While an analysis of Lamarck's ideas enables one to characterize him as a vitalist [...] inspite of his professed mechanicism [...] it is necessary to study the intellectual climate of his day in order to understand the significance of that vitalism. In one way Lamarck's vitalism is a return to ancient Greek and Ionian ideas, a continuation of the Renaissance, which of course the Enlightenment was. Lamarck's vitalism was also a brilliant, even if not popular, solution to the problem of providing a scientific account of the natural origin of the soul. A successful solution would have been an invaluable victory for science, which was bidding against the Church for greater authority. In another way, Lamarck's vitalism points up the failure of mechanistic thinking in some central biological problems, for, as Diderot saw, mechanism itself gives rise at its limits to vitalism. If natural science would not adopt vitalist thinking, it would not adopt Lamarck's approach to understanding life and man; the problem of the soul would have to be quietly ignored, at least until experimental ap proaches had become more sophisticated.
