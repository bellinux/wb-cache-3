40|$|Pulse {{wave imaging}} (PWI) is an ultrasound-based method for {{non-invasive}} characterization of arterial stiffness based on <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation.</b> Reliable numerical models of <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in normal and pathological aortas {{could serve as}} powerful tools for local pulse wave analysis and a guideline for PWI measurements in vivo. The objectives of this paper are to (1) apply a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation of a straight-geometry aorta to confirm the Moens-Korteweg relationship between the pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the wall modulus, and (2) validate the simulation findings against phantom and in vitro results. PWI depicted and tracked the <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> along the abdom-inal wall of canine aorta in vitro in sequential Radio-Frequency (RF) ultrasound frames and estimates the PWV in the imaged wall. The same system was also used to image multiple polyacrylamide phantoms, mimicking the canine measurements as well as modeling softer and stiffer walls. Finally, the model parameters from the ca-nine and phantom studies were used to perform 3 D two-way coupled FSI simulations of <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> and estimate the PWV. The simulation results were found to correlate well with the corresponding Moens-Korteweg equation. A high linear correlation was also established between PWV 2 and E measure-ments using the combined simulation and experimental findings (R 2 0. 98) confirming the relationship established by the afore-mentioned equation.

5000|$|The soliton {{hypothesis}} in neuroscience is a {{model that}} claims to explain how action potentials are initiated and conducted along axons based on a thermodynamic theory of nerve <b>pulse</b> <b>propagation.</b> It proposes that the signals travel along the cell's membrane {{in the form of}} certain kinds of solitary sound (or density) pulses that can be modeled as solitons. The model is proposed {{as an alternative to the}} Hodgkin-Huxley model in which action potentials: voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane open and allow sodium ions to enter the cell (inward current). The resulting decrease in membrane potential opens nearby voltage-gated sodium channels, thus propagating the action potential. The transmembrane potential is restored by delayed opening of potassium channels. Soliton hypothesis proponents assert that energy is mainly conserved during propagation except dissipation losses; however, measured temperature changes are also consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model.|$|E

40|$|The {{preferred}} vascular {{access for}} hemodialysis is an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the arm: a surgically created connection between an artery and vein. The surgeon selects the AVF location {{based on experience}} and preoperative diagnostics. However, 20 - 50 % of all lower arm AVFs are hampered by a too low access flow, whereas complications associated with too high flows are observed in 20 % of all upper arm AVFs. We hypothesize that a <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> model fed by patient-specific data {{has the ability to}} assist the surgeon in selecting the optimal AVF configuration by predicting direct postoperative flow. Previously, a 1 D wave propagation model (spectral elements) was developed in which an approximated velocity profile was assumed based on boundary layer theory. In this study, we derived a distributed lumped parameter implementation of the <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> model. The elements of the electrical analog for a segment are based on the approximated velocity profiles and dependent on the Womersley number. We present the application of the lumped parameter <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> model to vascular access surgery and show how a patient-specific model is able to predict the hemodynamical impact of AVF creation and might assist in vascular access planning. The lumped parameter <b>pulse</b> wave <b>propagation</b> model was able to select the same AVF configuration as an experienced surgeon in nine out of ten patients. In addition, in six out of ten patients predicted postoperative flows were in the same order of magnitude as measured postoperative flows.

50|$|In 1872 after {{completing}} {{a course in}} engineering at Ghent University, Moens began to study medicine at Leiden University. He became a pathology assistant in 1874 and in 1875 (probably) he took up an appointment as assistant to Adriaan Heynsius, Professor of Physiology at Leiden. In this role he began his work on arterial wave travel using reservoirs, elastic tubes and air chambers. These studies {{formed the basis of}} this doctorate in 1877 and were published in a 145-page monograph, Die Pulscurve, in 1878. The key finding of this work was an empirical relationship that described the velocity of <b>pulse</b> <b>propagation</b> in elastic tubes. Except for a numerical constant {{this turned out to be}} identical to the theoretical prediction derived by Diederik Korteweg in 1878 and the relationship is now known as the Moens-Korteweg equation. In 1878 he retired from physiological research and became a medical practitioner in Goes. He was offered the chair of physiology in Leiden in 1885 when Hynsius died, but he turned it down. Willem Einthoven was subsequently appointed to the post.|$|E
50|$|The {{analogy between}} these extreme optical events and {{hydrodynamic}} rogue waves was initially developed by noting {{a number of}} parallels, including the role of solitons, heavy-tailed statistics, dispersion, modulation instability, and frequency downshifting effects. Additionally, forms of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation are used to model both optical <b>pulse</b> <b>propagation</b> in nonlinear fiber and deep water waves, including hydrodynamic rogue waves. Simulations were then conducted with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation {{in an effort to}} model the optical findings. For each trial or event, the initial conditions consisted of an input pulse and a minute amount of broadband input noise. The initial conditions (i.e., pulse power and noise level) were chosen so that the spectral broadening was relatively limited in the typical events. Collecting the results from the trials, very similar filtered energy statistics were observed compared with those seen experimentally. The simulations showed that rare events had experienced significantly more spectral broadening than the others because a soliton had been ejected in the former class of events, but not {{in the vast majority of}} events. By applying a correlation analysis between the redshifted output energy and the input noise, it was observed that a particular component of the input noise was elevated each time a surplus in the redshifted noise was generated. The critical noise component has specific frequency and timing relative to the pulse envelope—a noise component that efficiently seeds modulation instability and can, therefore, accelerate the onset of soliton fission.|$|E
50|$|Light {{was first}} {{captured}} in its flight by N. Abramson in 1978, {{who used a}} holographic technique to record the wavefront of a pulse propagating and being scattered by a white-painted screen placed in its path. This high-speed recording technique allowed the dynamic observation of light phenomena like reflection, interference and focusing that are normally observed statically. More recently, light-in-flight holography has been performed in a scattering medium rather than using a reflective screen. Light can also be captured in motion in a scattering medium using a streak camera that has picosecond temporal resolution, thus removing the need for interferometry and coherent illumination but requires additional hardware to raster scan the two-dimensional (2D) scene, which increases the acquisition time to hours. A few other techniques possess the temporal resolution to observe light in motion as it illuminates a scene, such as photonic mixer devices based on modulated illumination, albeit with a temporal resolution limited to a few nanoseconds. Alternatively, time-encoded amplified imaging can record images at the repetition rate of a laser by exploiting wavelength-encoded illumination of a scene and amplified detection through a dispersive fibre, albeit with 160 ns temporal and spatial resolution. Recent studies based on computer tomography using data from multiple probe pulses enabled reconstruction of picosecond <b>pulse</b> <b>propagation</b> phenomena in condensed media. In 2015 a method to visualize events evolving on picosecond time scales based on single-photon detector arrays has been demonstrated.|$|E
