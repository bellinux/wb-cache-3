This decrease is likely due to people moving away from isolated farms. Starting in the 1990s, a sharp increase takes place to 568 in 2011, simultaneously with a 2.5-fold {{increase in the number}} of homes: undoubtedly due to the construction of both 'urbanizations'.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{meaning of}} the phenomenological differential equations for a competing population is reviewed. It is concluded that {{it is virtually impossible}} to construct the differential equations precise enough for studying stability. We consider instead a method of phenomenological analysis which can be applied to a set of <b>population</b> <b>curves.</b> We suggest an ecological index calculated from the <b>population</b> <b>curves,</b> which indicates a group property of the entire system. As a function of time, the index is presumably insensitive to Volterra type fluctuations. A marked increase of the index's value however indicates a marked change of the environmental conditions. It is not easy to deduce the group property from the <b>population</b> <b>curves</b> alone, because a change in population is in general due to the superposition of external disturbances and Volterra fluctuations...|$|R

50|$|The Economist article {{pointed out}} that in many {{emerging}} countries the middle class has not grown incrementally, but explosively. The rapid growth results {{from the fact that}} the majority of the people fall into the middle of a left-skewed bell-shaped curve, and when the peak of the <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> crosses the threshold into the middle class, the number of people in the middle class grows enormously. In addition, when the curve crosses the threshold, economic forces cause the bulge to become taller as incomes at that level grow faster than incomes in other ranges. The point at which the poor start entering the middle class by the millions is the time when poor countries get the maximum benefit from cheap labour through international trade, before they price themselves out of world markets for cheap goods. It is also a period of rapid urbanization, when subsistence farmers abandon marginal farms to work in factories, resulting in a several-fold increase in their economic productivity before their wages catch up to international levels. That stage was reached in China some time between 1990 and 2005, when the middle class grew from 15% to 62% of the population, and is just being reached in India now.|$|E

40|$|Context. Population {{studies of}} the {{distribution}} of T 4 /TSH set points suggest a more complex inverse relationship between T 4 and TSH than that suggested by physiological studies. The reasons for the similarities and differences between the curves describing these relationships are unresolved. Methods. We subjected the curve, derived from empiric data, describing the TSH suppression response to T 4, and the more mathematically derived curve describing the T 4 response to TSH, to the different possible models of population variation. The implied consequences of these in terms of generating a population distribution of T 4 /TSH equilibrium points (a “population curve”) were generated and compared to the empiric <b>population</b> <b>curve.</b> The physiological responses to primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were incorporated into the analysis. Conclusions. Though the <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> shows a similarly inverse relationship, it is describing a different relationship than the curve describing the suppression of TSH by T 4. The <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> is consistent with the physiological {{studies of the}} TSH response to T 4 and implies a greater interindividual variation in the positive thyroid T 4 response to TSH than in the central inhibitory TSH response to T 4. The <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> in the dysthyroid states is consistent with known physiological responses to these states...|$|E
40|$|We model sparse {{functional}} {{data from}} multiple subjects with a mixed-effects regression spline. In this model, the expected values for any subject (conditioned on the random effects) {{can be written}} as the sum of a <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> and a subject-specific deviate from this <b>population</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> and the subject-specific deviates are both modeled as free-knot b-splines with k and k ′ knots located at tk and tk ′, respectively. To identify the number and location of the “free ” knots, we sample from the posterior p (k, tk, k ′, tk ′ |y) using reversible jump MCMC methods. Sampling from this posterior distribution is complicated, however, by the flexibility we allow for the model’s covariance structure. No restrictions (other than positive definiteness) are placed on the covariance parameters ψ and σ 2 and, as a result, no analytical form for the likelihood p (y|k, tk, k ′, tk′) exists. In this paper, we consider two approximations to p(y|k, tk, k ′, tk′) and then sample from the corresponding approximations to p(k, tk, k ′, tk ′ |y). We also sample from p(k, tk, k ′, tk ′, ψ, σ 2 |y) which has a likelihood that is available in closed form. While sampling from this larger posterior is less efficient, the resulting marginal distribution of knots is exact and allows us to evaluate the accuracy of each approximation. We then consider a real data set and explore the difference between p(k, tk, k ′, tk ′, ψ, σ 2 |y) and the more accurate approximation to p(k, tk, k ′, tk ′ |y) ...|$|E

40|$|Martian {{highland}} craters typically lack ejecta deposits, have no noticeable rim, and {{are flat}} floored. In addition, crater size frequency distribution curves show that highland craters have depleted populations less than 20 km in diameter. A variety of processes {{have been suggested}} to explain these observations including deposition of aeolian or volcanic materials up to the crater rim crests, thermal creep, terrain softening, and mass wasting. However, none of these processes adequately explains both the crater morphology and population distribution. In order to explain both the Martian highland crater morphology and population distribution, a fluvial process is proposed which is capable of removing the loose crater rim material. The resulting effect is to decrease the crater diameter, thereby causing the <b>population</b> <b>curves</b> to bendover. The eroded material is redistributed, burying or partially burying smaller diameter craters before complete erosion. This material may also be deposited into local topographic lows, creating the depositional basins observed.

40|$|Monitoring the {{abundance}} of insect populations is increasingly valuable to understand their population dynamics, plan management strategies and assess the attainment of conservation targets. As monitoring is often constrained in time and space, {{it is important to}} have a model of the temporal variation in numbers to enable limited field data to be fitted into a broader framework, and to estimate the total detectable population on a site. We use adult butterflies as a study system, because they are widely monitored, sensitive indicators of environmental change. We derive a generic algebraic expression for the shape of the <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> that describes how the number of adult butterflies observed at a site varies through the flight period. This novel expression contains parameters corresponding to total detectable population, start-date and length of eclosion period, and mean life span. These can be optimised to fit observed series of counts (e. g. butterfly transect data, moth light-trap counts) for individual species, sites and years, using a reliable grid-refinement optimisation procedure. Assumptions about survivorship and death rate are supported by field observations of the life span of two species tested. The modelled <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> (POPFIT) closely fits observed transect data for three further species. We give two simplified methods of estimating the total transect population: from the Index of Abundance and from the peak population. We discuss extrapolation of transect results to estimate total site population, taking account of observed sampling efficiencies. Our new method compares favourably with previous models for assessing patterns of population change at monitored sites and can assist with the planning of optimal monitoring strategies. As well as population estimates, it allows standardised phenological parameters to be derived from field data and provides a standard curve for theoretical studies. The method is applicable to all insect species whose adults have distinct, non-overwintering generations and to all other monitored organisms with similar demographies. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{the profile of}} land use and {{population}} density in European cities {{with respect to the}} distance to the city centre. More specifically we address the scaling of land use and density curves with respect to city population and rely on fine grained land use data. Our main objective is to retrieve generic laws that can support the calibration of monocentric urban economic models for European cities. We use the GMES Urban Atlas database, providing a precise description of land use at 5 m resolution in the 305 major European urban areas (more than 100. 000 inhabitants). We combine this dataset with population density from the Geostat population grid, which covers the whole of European Union (EU) with a 1 km 2 resolution. Population is allocated proportionally to surface and weighted by soil sealing and density classes of the GMES data. We analyse the evolution with distance to the city centre, which we define for convenience as the location of the city hall, of population density and of the share of land used for different purposes: housing, roads, railways, urban green, water, agriculture, forest. To this end, we define concentric rings of fixed width around the city centre, in which we average each land use and population. In order to compare different cities and to identify a global picture, i. e. a standard representative European city, we study scaling relationships for the ob- tained monocentric land use shares and density curves. We analyse the scaling of these curves with respect to city population, following similar approaches con- ducted in the literature for different parameters (such as income or road space). The total population for each city is computed from the population grid. We find that land use curves, in particular housing and roads shares, tend to scale like the square root of city <b>population.</b> <b>Population</b> <b>curves</b> have roughly exponential shapes, as it has been widely modelled in the literature, although usually not based on land use and soil sealing data. <b>Population</b> <b>curves</b> tend to scale like the city population to a power close to 1 / 3.

40|$|The heat {{activation}} of Neurospora tetrasperma ascospores is a reversible process, since activated spores may {{be returned to}} secondary dormancy by preventing respiration, and these secondarily dormant spores may be induced to germinate by reheating. Activation of the spores brings about a large increase in respiration prior to the germination of the spores. As the spores are reversibly activated or deactivated the rate of respiration is increased or is decreased. By poisoning the cells with iodoacetamide {{it is possible to}} prevent all germination without greatly inhibiting this increase in respiration. Precisely with the beginning of germination a secondary rise in respiration occurs. The respiration of the spores is cyanide sensitive.

The maximum dynamic isolated joint torque (upper extremity) on 14 subjects was collected using a dynamometer multi-joint testing unit. These data were reduced to a table of coefficients of second degree polynomials, computed using a least squares regression method. All the coefficients were then organized into look-up tables, a compact and convenient storage/retrieval mechanism for the data set. Data from each joint, direction and velocity, were normalized with respect to that joint's average and merged into files (one for each curve for a particular joint). Regression was performed on each one of these files to derive a table of normalized <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> coefficients for each joint axis, direction, and velocity. In addition, a regression table which included all upper extremity joints was built which related average torque to lean body mass for an individual.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the correlation between plasma stavudine concentrations and lipoatrophy (LA), one of the major adverse events in patients on stavudine and one of the major reasons to discontinue stavudine. METHODS: Plasma drug concentrations were retrospectively analysed in patients who were on a stavudine-containing regimen for at least 12 months. We defined two groups of patients: 21 patients with LA and 15 patients without LA or other stavudine-related side effects (i. e. neuropathy). RESULTS: We analysed stavudine concentrations in 212 plasma samples: 87 in the control group and 125 in the LA group, with a mean of four plasma samples per person (at least two a year). Demographics were comparable in LA patients and controls, except the duration of stavudine use, which was longer in the LA group: 55 versus 42 months in the control group. Overall, LA patients had higher drug exposure to stavudine when compared with the controls, and this was seen in the geometric concentration ratios (CRs), which were 0. 978 and 0. 741, respectively (P = 0. 04), and also a higher percentage of CR values > 1. 0, representing a drug concentration above the normal <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> (46 % versus 23 %, P = 0. 02). In addition, the duration of stavudine therapy was independently associated with LA (P = 0. 05). In the multivariate analysis, both duration of stavudine (P = 0. 05) and CR > 1. 0 (P = 0. 02) were independently correlated with LA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} {{sources of}} variation in plasma concentrations of nelfinavir and its active metabolite M 8 and {{to evaluate the use}} of therapeutic drug monitoring for nelfinavir treatment. METHODS: Plasma samples and patient's characteristics were obtained from outpatient clinic. Differences between groups of patients were studied by comparing the observed plasma concentrations with the corresponding concentration on a pharmacokinetic <b>population</b> <b>curve</b> based on median plasma levels. RESULTS: Plasma samples (618) were available from 355 patients taking 1250 mg nelfinavir twice daily. The median ratio between M 8 and nelfinavir concentrations was 0. 29. This ratio appeared to be independent of the time after ingestion. Statistically significantly lower M 8 concentrations were found in Black and Asian patients, or when comedication with CYP 3 A 4 inducers was used. Coadministration of CYP 2 C 19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole, decreased the median M 8 /nelfinavir ratio. Nevertheless, nelfinavir concentrations and summed concentrations of nelfinavir and M 8 were only marginally affected in these patients. Diarrhoea was identified as a cause for lower nelfinavir concentrations, without changing the M 8 /nelfinavir ratio. In a number of patients with suspected therapy failure or intoxication, abnormal nelfinavir plasma concentrations were found. Dose adjustments based on nelfinavir plasma levels were helpful in a number of patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the total concentration of nelfinavir and M 8 together is not significantly influenced when variation in M 8 levels occurs. Consequently, measuring M 8 concentrations in addition to nelfinavir concentrations is not required for the purpose of therapeutic drug monitoring for this drug...|$|E
