40|$|The {{evolution}} of herbivory within an insect lineage is often enabled by novel morphological innovations.

40|$|Sediment {{dynamics}} on a storm-dominated shelf (western Bay of Plenty, New Zealand) were mapped {{and analyzed}} using the newly developed multi-sensor benthic profiler MARUM NERIDIS III. An area of 60 km × 7 km between 2 and 35 m water depth was surveyed with this bottom-towed sled {{equipped with a}} high-resolution camera for continuous close-up seafloor photography and a CTD with connected turbidity sensor. Here we introduce our approach of using this multi-parameter dataset combined with sidescan sonography and sedimentological analyses to create detailed lithofacies and bedform distribution maps and to derive regional sediment transport patterns. For the assessment of sediment distribution, photographs were classified and their spatial distribution mapped out according to associated acoustic backscatter from a sidescan sonar. This provisional map was used to choose target locations for surficial sediment sampling and subsequent laboratory analysis of grain size distribution and mineralogical composition. Finally, photographic, granulometric and mineralogical facies were combined into a unified lithofacies map and corresponding stratigraphic model. Eight distinct types of lithofacies with seawards increasing grain size were discriminated and interpreted as reworked relict deposits overlain by post-transgressional fluvial sediments. The dominant transport processes in different water depths were identified based on type and orientation of bedforms, as well as bottom water turbidity and lithofacies distribution. Observed bedforms include subaquatic dunes, coarse sand ribbons and sorted bedforms of varying dimensions, which were interpreted as being initially formed by erosion. Under fair weather conditions, sediment is transported from the northwest towards the southeast by littoral drift. During storm events, a current from the southeast to the northweast is induced which is transporting sediment along the shore in up to 35 m water depth. Shorewards oriented cross-shore transport {{is taking place in}} up to 60 m water depth and is likewise initiated by storm events. Our study demonstrates how benthic <b>photographic</b> <b>profiling</b> delivers comprehensive compositional, structural and environmental information, which compares well with results obtained by traditional probing methods, but offers much higher spatial resolution while covering larger areas. Multi-sensor benthic profiling enhances the interpretability of acoustic seafloor mapping techniques and is a rapid and economic approach to seabed and habitat mapping especially in muddy to sandy facies...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Evaluation of {{diagnostic}} records {{as a supplement}} to direct examination has an important role in treatment planning of orthodontic patients with aesthetic needs. Photogrammetry as a quantitative tool has recently attracted the attention of researchers again. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to design computer software to analyze orthodontic patients’ facial <b>profile</b> <b>photographic</b> images and to estimate reliability and validity of its measurement. Materials and Method: <b>Profile</b> <b>photographic</b> images of 20 volunteered students were taken in the natural head position with standard technique. Manual linear and angular measurements were used as a gold standard and compared with the results obtained from Aesthetic analyzer Software (designed for that purpose). Dahlberg’s method error and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was used to estimate validity, reliability and inter-examiner errors. Results: Almost all the measurements showed a high correlation between the manual and computerized method (ICC> 0. 75). The maximum method errors computed from Dahlberg’s formula were 1. 345 mm in linear and 3. 294 degrees in angular measurements. At the highest levels, inter-examiner errors were 1. 684 mm and 3. 741 degrees in linear and angular measurements, respectively. Conclusion: Although a low budget has been allocated for the design of Aesthetic Analyzer software, its features are comparable with commercially available products. The software’s capabilities can be increased. The results of the current study indicated that the software is accurate and repeatable in photographic analysis of orthodontic patients...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} report quantifies {{the soft tissue}} profile changes that occur {{as a result of}} the placement of orthodontic brackets. It also assesses whether patients are able to perceive any changes in their own profiles immediately post bonding. Using a standardised <b>photographic</b> technique, <b>profile</b> photographs were taken of a group of patients both before and immediately after the placement of orthodontic brackets. A series of angular and linear measurements were made each on the photographic images using a computer software program. The data obtained from the ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs were then compared. Patients were also asked several standard questions about their ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs. The results indicate that the placement of orthodontic brackets can cause changes in the soft tissue profile of patients. Statistically significant changes were found for four of the ten profile measurements that were investigated, namely the Nasolabial Angle, the Maxillo-Mandibular Contour, the Interlabial Angle and the Lower Lip Projection. It was also found that patients are able to perceive changes in their profiles brought about by the placement of orthodontic brackets, and that most are able to correctly recognise which photograph was taken after bracket placement. The majority of patients prefer the photographs of their profiles taken before bracket placement. This study was conducted using a standardised orthodontic bracket. Future research may be carried out to compare profile changes occurring with other bracket systems. This may assist manufacturers in designing brackets that are more comfortable and acceptable for patients...|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{individual}} sea turtles is mostly achieved by checking artificial tags previously attached to them, a method {{which is made}} difficult by the considerable tag loss rate and which requires repeated manipulation of the marked individuals. We describe an individual recognition method for sea turtles of the family Cheloniidae based on a mark-recapture study that relied on both artificial tagging (Inconel tags, style 681) and natural marks (facial profile photographs). Juvenile green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata turtles were manually caught at Arvoredo Island, southern Brazil, and through visual comparison of facial profile photographs {{we were able to}} identify recaptured individuals with 2, 1, or no artificial tags. Additionally, Bayesian inference based on tag loss information indicated that the way a tag is attached (position and distance from the flipper edge) affects significantly the probability of its loss.

40|$|The {{research}} {{field is}} collaborative <b>photographic</b> portraiture. <b>Profiles</b> is an extended series of works inspired by Piero della Francesca’s diptych of Battista Sforza and Federico Montefeltro c. 1470. Against a neural background, fourteen people were photographed in strict symmetrical profile. The individual portraits were created and then divided into seven pairs, and hung face to face. The {{aim of the}} practice-based research was to discover if the apparent psychology of sitters for portraits was ever present or if a more neutral approach could be just or even more revealing. As the portraits were hung face to face they appeared, somewhat in the vein of Piero della Francesca’s painting to be coupled. The profiles present the viewer with the contours of faces, jaws, hairlines but the transient characteristics of facial expression are not revealed. The gazes are fixed, reciprocated but disengaged and unsentimental. The viewer is clearly present but blocked and not, as in so much portraiture, in a closer, intimate relationship to the subject. The work was shown in a solo exhibition at Victoria Miro Gallery, London 2002. Profiles II and III extended the series specifically in relation to babies as portrait subjects. Photographed in profile and three times larger than life size they appear almost monumental and emptied out of the usual meanings that we tend to associate with infants. Profiles {{was part of a}} British Council touring exhibition. J. J. Charlesworth reviewed Profiles in Art Monthly (Dec/Jan 2002 - 03 number 262) noting how she forces a starkly scientific frame on her anonymous, uniformly dressed subjects, a technique that still produces an intense individuality through its obsessive intense detail. ...|$|R

[...] AGU Fall Meeting 3 – 7 December 2012, San Francisco, CaliforniaProject “Arctic Ocean sea ice {{and ocean}} {{circulation}} using satellite methods”ù (SATICE), {{is the first}} high-rate, high-precision, continuous GPS positioning experiment on sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The SATICE systems collect continuous, dual-frequency carrier-phase GPS data while drifting on sea ice. Additional geophysical measurements also collected include ocean water pressure, ocean surface salinity, atmospheric pressure, snow-depth, air-ice-ocean temperature <b>profiles,</b> <b>photographic</b> imagery, and others, enabling sea ice drift, freeboard, weather, ice mass balance, and sea-level height determination. Relatively large volumes of data from each buoy are streamed over a satellite link to a central computer on the Internet in near real time, where they are processed to estimate the time-varying buoy positions. SATICE system obtains continuous GPS data at sub-minute intervals with a positioning precision of a few centimetres in all three dimensions.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. A study {{is made of}} three problems on luminosity distributions in galaxies: the nature of red compact galaxies, the systematic properties of spheroids, {{and the effect of}} decomposing observed profiles into spheroid and disk components. <b>Photographic</b> brightness <b>profiles</b> are measured and discussed for sixteen compact and four normal galaxies, with the following results. (i) Red compacts are qualitatively E and SO galaxies. (ii) Their central and mean surface brightnesses are generally normal. Only II Zw 67 and VII Zw 421 are noticeably compact. (iii) Profile components which Sandage, in the Hubble Atlas, called lenses occur with great frequency and strength. They are the "large, nearly uniform brightness halos" described by Zwicky. VII Zw 793 has an exceptionally strong lens, which must be a disk because it shows spiral structure. (iv) II Zw 67 and VII Zw 421 seem to be prototypes of a class of very luminous, early-type objects with dominant spheroid-like lenses, and spectra characteristic of metal-poor stars. (v) Lenses are a distinct and independent component in galaxy profiles. They seem to be morphologically intermediate between spheroids and disks. A systematic study of galaxy spheroids is made by fitting the de Vaucouleurs r[superscript 1 / 4]-law to the profiles of sixteen compact and nineteen normal galaxies. The results are as follows. (i) Ellipticals with massive neighbors have bright outer halos not possessed by more isolated objects. Possible tidal explanations are considered. (ii) The brightness and radius parameters are related by B[subscript oV]= 3. 02 log r[subscript o] + 19. 74 B mag arcsec[superscript - 2] ([ [...] . ]). Here r[subscript o] varies from 1. 0 to 14. 1 kpc, and B[subscript oV] from 19. 8 to 23. 3 B[ [...] . ]. Brighter galaxies tend to have larger r[subscript o] and fainter [subscript oV'] with considerable scatter. (iii) Some compacts are truly compact in having abnormally small r[subscript o] and bright B[subscript oV] for their absolute magnitude; most are just intrinsically faint. (iv) The B[subscript oV](log r[subscript o]) relation can be used to determine distances. We show that the Virgo cluster is closer than its redshift distance by δ(m-M) ≤ 0 [ [...] . ] 07 ± 0 [ [...] . ] 23, a null result supporting the uniform Hubble flow advocated by Sandage and Tammann. Detailed comparisons are made of how profile models due to de Vaucouleurs, Hubble and King fit galaxies. We show that the above results are model independent. Finally, exponential disk parameters are derived for seven S 0 compacts and for NGC 7457. The central disk brightness B(0) [subscript c] is generally normal, but is unusually faint in two objects. Scale lengths are ~ 7 kpc, at the long end of the distribution found in normal galaxies. Spheroids clearly contribute significantly to the disk parameters. We therefore decompose the profiles into their underlying components. The disks, actually lenses in these objects, are shown to have a (possibly complete) inner brightness cutoff, where they enter the dominant part of the spheroid. Parameters of the underlying distributions are poorly determined, because there is considerable freedom in their relative strength. However, spheroids, and the above results on spheroids, are little affected by decomposition. In contrast, disks become significantly fainter. Motivated by this, we use model galaxies to investigate the spheroid contribution to B(0) [subscript c] derived for a composite profile. Exponentials with B(0) [subscript c] = 20 - 25 B[ [...] . ] are added to spheroids {{with a wide range of}} parameters. These reproduce very well the distribution of B(0) [subscript c] observed for normal galaxies. Thus the near universality of B(0) [superscript c] = 21. 65 ± 0. 30 B[ [...] . ], observed by Freeman for 28 of 36 galaxies, is largely due to the contribution of the spheroid. Real disks can be much fainter. Measurements of galaxies with no spheroid are found to be consistent with this conclusion...|$|R
