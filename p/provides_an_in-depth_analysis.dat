50|$|Contrastive paremiology {{being an}} ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian {{connections}} and discussions on cross-cultural translatability. In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared {{with a new}} introduction that <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre {{and can be found}} only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.|$|E
5000|$|In both The Politics of Individualism and [...] "Does Work Really Work?", Brown's {{conception}} of libertarian socialism {{is that all}} social bonds should be developed by individuals who have {{an equal amount of}} bargaining power, because, in Brown's view, an accumulation of monetary wealth leads to the centralization of economic and political {{power in the hands of}} a small elite, reducing the bargaining power—and thus the liberty—of the other individuals in society. She <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of why, in her view, the wage labor system is inherently corrupt and unreformable and why it must be abolished and replaced with a system in which people would be completely free to choose to perform (or not to perform) voluntary activities, a system that would, in Brown's view, encourage people to be creative and self-directed, that would celebrate enjoyment and fulfillment.|$|E

5000|$|Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague (c.1520-1609), in {{his work}} Netzach Yisroel ("Eternity of Israel"), <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> as to this {{seemingly}} unconnected sequence of action and punishment. Rabbi Lowe explains, {{as a rule of}} thumb, that the logic of Chazal is of an unrelated plane to that of common human intellect. Thus, one who scoffs at it is judged in the opposite of this higher plane, i.e. Tzoah Rotachat, which is considered a matter of irrelation to the relatively superior human body (since it is released as waste) and the antithesis of godly knowledge and presence (as is brought in Talmud Sukka p. 42b that one is obligated to distance himself from the excrement of a child who has the ability of speech since this excrement produces an intense odor comparative to infant who cannot yet speak [...] ). Rabbi Lowe concludes that excrement is the polar opposite of refined godly intellect and worship and is thus the natural consequence of the scoffer thereof and of the Jew who chooses idol worship and Shituf.|$|E
