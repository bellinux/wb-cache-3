5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs <b>pamaquine</b> and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, <b>pamaquine,</b> and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
50|$|Like primaquine, <b>pamaquine</b> causes {{haemolytic}} anaemia {{in patients}} with G6PD deficiency. Patients should therefore always be screened for G6PD deficiency prior to being prescribed <b>pamaquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pamaquine</b> is more toxic {{and less}} efficacious than primaquine. <b>Pamaquine</b> is {{therefore}} no longer {{used and the}} only drug currently recommended by the World Health Organization is primaquine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pamaquine</b> was {{the second}} {{synthetic}} antimalarial drug to be discovered (after methylene blue). It was synthesised by Schulemann, Schoenhoeffer and Wingler in 1924. In 1926, Roehl demonstrated that <b>pamaquine</b> was effective in treating malaria in birds, and introduced it into use in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pamaquine</b> is {{effective}} against the hypnozoites of the relapsing malarias (P. vivax and P. ovale); and unlike primaquine, {{it is also}} very effective against the erythrocytic stages of all four human malarias. One small clinical trial of <b>pamaquine</b> as a causal prophylactic was disappointing (whereas primaquine is an extremely effective causal prophylactic).|$|E
50|$|<b>Pamaquine</b> is an 8-aminoquinoline drug {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of malaria. It is closely related to primaquine.|$|E
50|$|Primaquine is {{an analog}} of <b>pamaquine</b> {{which was the}} first drug of the 8-aminoquinoline class; {{tafenoquine}} is another such drug.|$|E
50|$|The 8-aminoquinoline {{family of}} drugs {{contains}} three members, primaquine, tafenoquine and <b>pamaquine</b> {{and are used}} in the treatment of malaria. They may be used to eradicate malaria hypnozoites from the liver and have both been used for malaria prophylaxis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pamaquine</b> is {{no longer}} {{available}} anywhere, but primaquine is still used routinely worldwide {{as part of the}} treatment of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria. Tafenoquine is currently in Phase III clinical trials and is not yet available to prescribe.|$|E
50|$|A large {{trial of}} <b>pamaquine</b> {{performed}} by the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Indian Medical Corps in 1929 showed {{for the first time}} that it was possible to prevent relapse of vivax malaria. Prior to this, it was understood that patients with vivax malaria would suffer from relapses, but there was no treatment that could prevent the relapses from occurring.|$|E
50|$|The {{researchers}} tested patient {{responses to}} various potential treatments. The {{majority of these}} treatments {{had not yet been}} evaluated on humans, and their toxicity and potency was thus unknown. Most were 8-aminoquinoline compounds, analogs of <b>pamaquine,</b> an existing alternative to quinine that was unfavorable due to its higher toxicity. The researchers tested a wide range of doses, including some exceptionally high doses of treatments known to be toxic. The purpose of this was to establish a maximum margin of safety, and to observe the manifestation of side effects. Thus, adverse side effects were intentionally caused to subjects, to demonstrate the possible worst-case reaction to extremely high-potency treatments. In one case, a subject died several days after he was injected with a high dosage of SN-8233, a potential treatment considered in the study.|$|E

40|$|Three {{antimalarial}} drugs, artesunate, pyrimethamine, and <b>pamaquine,</b> {{were evaluated}} for their growth-inhibitory effects against Babesia equi and Babesia caballi in in vitro culture.

40|$|<b>Pamaquine,</b> {{synthesized}} in 1926, {{was introduced}} in the treatment of malaria as a schizonticide. It was soon found, however, that the great schizonti-cidal activity which it possessed in cathemerium malaria of canaries did not obtain in the human malarias. It was shown to be relatively ineffec-tive in acute attacks of vivax malaria and to have only minimal activity against the asexual forms of P. falciparum, although it did eradicate the gameto-cytes in this infection. In addition, the general usefulness of <b>pamaquine</b> was limited by the fre-quent occurrence of toxic effects with doses in the therapeutic range. Nonetheless, evidence was advanced favoring both a prophylactic (1, 2, 3) and curative action (4) in vivax malaria. The toxicity of the drug and an incomplete under-standing of the biology of vivax malaria led the commission on malaria of the Health Organiza-tion of the League of Nations (5) to state that its prophylactic action was not practical and to dis-count the work of Sinton on its curative action (4). The commission recommended that pama...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It was {{reported}} in 1946 that the administration of <b>pamaquine</b> during the incubation period delayed but did not prevent primary attacks of a New Guinea strain of Plasmodium vivax malaria. The observation {{that none of the}} four test subjects in this study had relapses has not previously been published and may have important implications for the evaluation of other 8 -aminoquinoline compounds against relapsing vivax malaria. In 1926, <b>pamaquine</b> (plasmoquine) was the first drug to be synthesized with a marked activity against human malaria parasites. 1 This 8 -aminoquinoline drug, taken in combination with quinine, was able to cure many Plasmodium vivax infec-tions when taken daily over a period of 2 âˆ’ 3 weeks. 2 Pam-aquine also prevented primary attacks of P. vivax malaria when administered at a daily dose of 60 mg base from the day before until the sixth day after exposure to sporozoite-infected mosquitoes. 3 Subsequent concerns about drug toxicity, in-cluding the sudden onset of severe hemolytic reactions, prompted the Malaria Commission of the League of Nation...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} that Heinz body anemias and possibly normal erythrocyte aging result from oxidative damage to the cell (1 - 4) and its hemoglobin (1 - 7) through processes encompassed by the term "oxidative hemolysis" (2). Suggestions that H 202 produces such damage in senescent erythrocytes (8) and during drug-induced oxidative hemolysis (9 - 11) have been advanced but disputed (2, 12). Recently two drugs, primaquine and <b>pamaquine,</b> both of which can produce oxidative hemolysis in man, {{have been reported to}} generate H 202 in vitro (13).

40|$|The binding of four 8 -aminoquinoline antimalarials (primaquine, pentaquine, <b>pamaquine,</b> and pla. smocid) {{to native}} and {{denatured}} calf thymus DNA {{has been studied}} by equilibrium dialysis and direct spectrophotometry. The binding of the 8 -aminoquinolines to DNA is (a) accompanied by a decrease in absorbance of the ligand, (b) decreased {{by an increase in}} ionic strength, (c) decreased by addition of Mg 2 + {{to a greater extent than}} would be expected from ionic strength effects alone, and (d) decreased under some conditions by the presence of 4 ii urea. In 0. 01 ii potassium phosphate (pH 6), the total binding of the 8 -aminoquinolines to various DNA preparations at DNA nucleotide to aminoquinoline ratios of 6 or greater occurs in the following order: native DNA = denatured DNA> native DNA in 4 M urea> denatured DNA in 4 M urea. At low ionic strengths and pH 6, the binding of the singly protonated 8 -aminoquinolines is less than, but comparable to, the binding of chloro-quine, a divalent cation at the same pH. At a DNA nucleotide to aminoquinoline ratio of 10 and an ionic strength of 0. 012 (pH 6), the percentages of the aminoquinolines bound to native T) NA decrease in the following order: chloroquine> pentaquine> plasmocid> priniaquine> <b>pamaquine.</b> At an ionic strength of 0. 15 or greater, the binding of pentaquin...|$|E

40|$|Anti-malarial 8 -aminoquinolines drugs cause acute {{hemolytic}} anemia in individuals with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G 6 PDD). Efforts to develop non-hemolytic 8 -aminoquinolines have been severely limited {{caused by the}} lack of a predictive in vivo animal model of hemolytic potential that would allow screening of candidate compounds. This report describes a G 6 PDD mouse model with a phenotype closely resembling the G 6 PDD phenotype found in the African A-type G 6 PDD human. These G 6 PDD mice, given different doses of primaquine, which used as a reference hemolytic drug, display a full array of {{hemolytic anemia}} parameters, consistently and reproducibly. The hemolytic and therapeutic indexes were generated for evaluation of hemotoxicity of drugs. This model demonstrated a complete hemolytic toxicity response to another known hemolytic antimalarial drug, <b>pamaquine,</b> but no response to non-hemolytic drugs, chloroquine and mefloquine. These results suggest that this model is suitable for evaluation of selected 8 -AQ type candidate antimalarial drugs for their hemolytic potential...|$|E
40|$|The causal {{prophylactic}} {{activity of}} several reference and experimental antimalarial compounds was assessed in sporozoite-induced infections of NMRI mice with Plasmodium berghei yoelii (strain 17 X). The animals were inoculated with 10 000 sporozoites per mouse and treated once 2 - 4 hours later. The test system {{has proved to}} be very suitable in experiments involving more than 3 000 mice. The infection rate in 448 untreated controls was 97. 3 %. Lowering the sporozoite content of the inoculum to 1 000 or 100 sporozoites markedly reduced the rate (65. 1 % and 32. 7 %). In experiments with primaquine the causal prophylactic activity was also influenced by the time of drug administration before or after sporozoite inoculation. No causal prophylactic effect was demonstrable with quinine, chloroquine, amodiaquine, amopyroquine, RC- 12, or B 505. Primaquine was active, but <b>pamaquine</b> and pentaquine were only sporadically active. The pre-erythrocytic stages of P. b. yoelii were only slightly sensitive to dapsone, sulfadiazine, and sulformethoxine; they were 10 - 100 times more susceptible to proguanil, cycloguanil, and pyrimethamine. The experimental 6 -aminoquinolines NI 147 / 36, NI 187 / 82, and BA 138 / 111 and the 7 -chlorolincomycin derivative U 24729 were also studied. Experiments in which curative activity against blood-induced infections of P. b. yoelii was evaluated showed that the causal prophylactics act more specifically against the pre-erythrocytic than against the erythrocytic forms. This specificity was most pronounced among the DHFR-inhibitors, whose outstanding activity may be {{explained by the fact that}} the rate of multiplication of the pre-erythrocytic forms of P. b. yoelii is greater than that of other plasmodia used hitherto; it is also greater than the rate shown by the malaria parasites of man and that of the erythrocytic forms of P. b. yoelii itself. We believe that this feature will render P. b. yoelii very useful for determination of the causal prophylactic activity of new compounds, but it may also overrate the potency of drugs that interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis...|$|E
