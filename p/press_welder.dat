5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that {{if this is going to}} work there needs to be a new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel space-frame chassis built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production. Murray's 'iStream' simplifies each process with an eighty percent smaller factory with lower cost production, making light weight efficient cars. There are no sheet metal <b>presses,</b> spot <b>welders</b> or paint plants. It would be built local to its market. Murray is currently negotiating production licences. The T25 and T27 were expected to be available in 2016.|$|R
