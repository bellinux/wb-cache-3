40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to a transition system specification in process algebra, a structural operational semantics (SOS) of a programming language usually involves auxiliary entities: stores, environments, etc. When specifying SOS rules, particular auxiliary entities often need to be <b>propagated</b> <b>unchanged</b> between premises and conclusions. The standard technique is to make such propagation explicit, using variables. However, referring to all entities {{that need to be}} <b>propagated</b> <b>unchanged</b> in each rule can be tedious, and it hinders direct reuse of rules in different language descriptions. This paper proposes a new interpretation of SOS rules, such that each auxiliary entity is implicitly propagated in all rules in which it is not mentioned. The main benefits include significant notational simplification of SOS rules and much-improved reusability. This new interpretation of SOS rules is based on the same foundations as Modular SOS, but avoids the notational overhead of grouping auxiliary entities together in labels. After motivating and explaining implicit propagation, the paper considers the foundations of SOS and Modular SOS specifications, and defines the meaning of SOS specifications with implicit propagation by translating them to Modular SOS. It then shows how implicit propagation can simplify various rules found in the SOS literature...|$|E

However, the presence of multiple gene copies in natural genomes has generally not been found in the absence of specific functional selection. Here, we show that the massive amplification of a chromosomal locus (up to 880 copies per cell) occurs {{in the absence of any}} direct selection, and is associated with low-order amplifications of flanking segments in complex chromosomal alterations. These results were obtained from mutants with restored phenotypes that spontaneously appeared from genetically engineered strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suffering from severe fitness reduction. Grossly extended chromosomes (macrotene) were formed, with complex structural alterations but sufficient stability to <b>propagate</b> <b>unchanged</b> over successive generations.

Both unity Lewis number, where only hydrodynamic instability appears, and subunity Lewis number, where the flame propagation is strongly affected by the combined effect of hydrodynamic and thermodiffusive instabilities are considered. The simulations aim at studying the initial linear growth of perturbations superimposed on the planar flame front as well as the long-term nonlinear evolution. The dispersion relation between the growth rate and the wavelength of the perturbation characterizing the linear regime is extracted from the simulations and compared with linear stability theory. The dynamics observed during the nonlinear evolution depend strongly on the domain size and on the Lewis number. As predicted by the theory, unity Lewis number flames are found to form a single cusp structure which <b>propagates</b> <b>unchanged</b> with constant speed.

40|$|Acoustic wave fields {{propagating}} long ranges {{through the}} ocean are refracted by the inhomogeneities in the ocean's sound speed profile. Intuitively, {{for a given}} acoustic source frequency, the inhomogeneities become ineffective at refracting the field beyond a certain fine scale determined by the acoustic wavelength. On the other hand, ray methods are sensitive to infinitely fine features. Thus, {{it is possible to}} complicate arbitrarily the ray dynamics, and yet have the wave field <b>propagate</b> <b>unchanged.</b> This feature raises doubts about the ray/wave correspondence. Given the importance of various analyses relying on ray methods, a proper model should, at a minimum, exclude all of the fine structure that does not significantly alter the propagated wave field when the correspondence to the ray dynamics is being relied upon. We develop a simple, efficient, smoothing technique to be applied to the inhomogeneities - a low pass filtering performed in the spatial domain - and give a characterization of its necessary extent as a function of acoustic source frequency. We indicate how the smoothing improves the ray/wave correspondence, and show that the so-called ``ray chaos'' problem remains above a very low frequency (about 15 - 25 Hz) ...|$|R

We are interested in using Algorithm EW to distinguish successful and unsuccessful memes early in their lifecycle. More precisely, the task of interest is to classify memes into two groups – those which will ultimately be successful (acquire more than S posts) and those that will be unsuccessful (attract fewer than U posts) – very early in the meme lifecycle.|$|R
40|$|Models that {{solve the}} one-dimensional, solar {{modulation}} equation have reproduced the 11 -year galactic cosmic ray using functional representations of global merged interaction regions (MIRs). This study extends those {{results to the}} solution of the modulation equation with explicit time dependence. The magnetometers on Voyagers 1 and 2 provide local magnetic field intensities at regular intervals, from which one calculates the ratio of the field intensity to the average local field. These ratios in turn are inverted to form diffusion coefficients. Strung together in radius and time, these coefficents then fall and rise with the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field, becoming representations of MIRs. These diffusion coefficients, calculated locally, <b>propagate</b> <b>unchanged</b> from approx. 10 AU to the outer boundary (120 AU). Inside 10 AU, all parameters, including the diffusion coefficient are assumed constant in time and space. The model reproduces the time-intensity profiles of Voyager 2 and Pioneer 10. Radial gradient data from 1982 - 1990 between Pioneer 10 and Voyager 2 are about the same magnitude as those calculated in the model. It is also shows agreement in rough magnitude with the radial gradient between Pioneer 10 and 1 AU. When coupled with enhanced, time-dependent solar wind speed at the probe's high latitude, as measured by independent observers, the model also follows Voyager 1 's time-intensity profile reasonably well, providing a natural source the model also follows Voyager 1 's time-intensity profile reasonably well, providing a natural source for the observed negative latitudinal gradients. The model exhibits the 11 -year cyclical cosmic ray intensity behavior at all radii, including 1 AU, not just at the location of the spacecraft where the magnetic fields are measured. In addition, the model's point of cosmic ray maximum correctly travels at the solar wind speed, illustrating the well-known propagation of modulation. Finally, at least in the inner heliosphere this model accounts for the delay experienced by lower-rigidity protons in reaching their time-intensity peak. The actual delays in this model, however, are somewhat smaller than the data. In the outer heliosphere the models sees no delays, and the data are ambiguous as to their existence. It appears that strong magnetic field compression regions (merged interaction regions) that are 3 - 4 times the average field strength can, at least in a helioequatorial band, disrupt effects, such as drifts, that could dominate in quieter magnetic fields. The question remains: Is the heliosphere ever quiet enough to allow such effects to be unambiguously measured, at least in the midlatitudes...|$|R
30|$|Consider, as an illustrative example, the {{diffusion}} of “memes”, that is, short textual phrases which <b>propagate</b> relatively <b>unchanged</b> online (e.g., ‘lipstick on a pig’). Suppose it is of interest to predict which memes will “go viral”, appearing in thousands of blog posts, and which will not. In this case, intrinsic-based features could include language measures, such as the sentiment or emotion expressed in the text surrounding the memes in blog posts or news articles. Simple dynamics-based features for memes might measure the cumulative number of posts or articles mentioning the meme of interest at some early time τ and {{the rate at which}} this volume is increasing. Network dynamics-based features might count the cumulative number of network communities in a blog graph GB that contain at least one post which mentions the meme by time τ and the number of blogs in the kmax-shell of GB that, by time τ, contain at least one post mentioning the meme. Alternatively, {{in the case of an}} epidemic, the intrinsic-based features could include the infectivity of the pathogen, simple dynamics-based features might capture the number of individuals infected by the disease in the early stages of the outbreak, and network dynamics-based features could include metrics that characterize the way the epidemic is progressing over the communities of relevant social and transportation networks.|$|R
40|$|Fibre Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs) {{are among}} the most promising devices for inclusion in the next generation of high speed photonic networks since they provide high reflectivity and large dispersion with low insertion losses and are readily compatible with WDM systems. An additional feature of FBGs is that they are intrinsically nonlinear devices and this nonlinearity can be used to increase their functionality in a photonic network. Recently using an all-fibre source we have successfully demonstrated all-optical switching in FBGs involving a variety of geometries. Importantly both self-switching and logic gate operations have been demonstrated. Central to most of our results has been the formation of a gap soliton {{at the front of the}} grating which then <b>propagates</b> <b>unchanged</b> throughout its entire length. Gap solitons are nonlinear pulses which can propagate coherently through a grating by balancing the grating dispersion with the nonlinearity Furthermore gap solitons can exist at frequencies within the bandgap of the grating, i. e. at frequencies where linear radiation is completely reflected. Under CW excitation the creation of a stationary gap soliton can alter the transmission of grating from essential zero to unity. Thus FBGs are promising candidates for all-optical switches. To observe all-optical switching we used an all-fibre erbium amplifier chain to amplify nanosecond pulses from a directly modulated diode. The resulting pulses, with peak powers in excess of 10 kW, were coupled into an 8 cm apodised FBG. The transmitted pulse was directly detected using a PIN photodiode with a temporal resolution of < 50 ps. In the simplest configuration we measured the transmitted intensity as a function of the input power and the results are shown in Fig. 1 a. In the linear regime the transmission is x 4 % while it increases to nearly ~ 40 % at higher intensities. We then split the input into two orthogonally polarised beams and recombined them at the input to the grating. In this geometry the FBG functions as an 'AND' gate. When a single pulse was incident upon the grating the power was below the threshold for gap soliton formation. However if both pulses were coincident then the threshold was exceeded and a single gap soliton was formed which propagated through the grating (see Fig. 1 b solid line). Contrast ratios as high as 17 dB were measured. Using a pump-probe geometry all-optical switching of a weak probe beam was demonstrated. In this configuration the weak CW probe beam was tuned to the bandgap of the grating while the pump wave-length was far from resonance. When the pump was incident upon the grating it altered the Bragg wavelength resulting in optical pulse compression of the probe beam. This is we believe the first demonstration of the optical pushbroom. In conclusion we have demonstrated all-optical switching in FBGs using a variety of geometries. These results indicate the versatility of FBGs for nonlinear experiments as well as offering promise for high-speed all-optical devices in the near future...|$|R

This study aimed {{to determine whether}} transcutaneous electrical stimulation using interferential current (IFC) applied to the abdomen increased colonic PS in STC children. Methods: Eight children (8 – 18 years) with confirmed STC had 24 -h colonic manometry using a water-perfused, 8 -channel catheter with 7. 5 cm sidehole distance introduced via appendix stomas. They then received 12 sessions (20 min/ 3 × per week) of IFC stimulation (2 paraspinal and 2 abdominal electrodes), applied at a comfortable intensity (< 40 mA, carrier frequency 4 kHz, varying beat frequency 80 – 150 Hz). Colonic manometry was repeated 2 (n = 6) and 7 (n = 2) months after IFC. Results: IFC significantly increased frequency of total PS/ 24 h (mean ± SEM, pre 78 ± 34 vs post 210 ± 62, p = 0. 008, n = 7), antegrade PS/ 24 h (43 ± 16 vs 112 ± 20, p = 0. 01) and high amplitude PS (HAPS/ 24 h, 5 ± 2 : 10 ± 3, p = 0. 04), with amplitude, velocity, or <b>propagating</b> distance <b>unchanged.</b> There was increased activity on waking and 4 / 8 ceased using antegrade continence enemas.

40|$|Combining {{modes of}} vibration, such as {{longitudinal}} and torsional vibration, is advantageous in many ultrasonic {{applications such as}} ultrasonic drilling, welding, and motors. In this work we present a novel approach to the design a longitudinal-torsional (LT) ultrasonic horn which adapts the front mass in a traditional Langevin transducer. Different approaches, such as degeneration of longitudinal vibration and coupling between longitudinal (L) and torsional (T) modes, {{have been used to}} generate the LT mode of vibration. The degeneration approach creates a non-uniform section, by cutting and twisting a number of slots along the path of the L wave such that part of the wave converts into T wave whilst the remaining part <b>propagates</b> <b>unchanged</b> through the section; these two parts are recombined near the output surface to form LT vibration. The mode coupling approach uses two set of vibration generators, usually piezoelectric elements, where one set generates L vibration whilst the second set generates T vibration. An exponential cross-sectional horn uses to combine the two modes where the area reduction factor is selected such that these modes resonate at the same frequency. However, many limitations prevent the wide usage of these methods in ultrasonic applications. These limitations are the complex design and excitation, possible coupling with surrounding modes, instability in operating at different boundaries, difficulty in securing the structure without influencing the vibrational response and the low produced torsionality, which is the ratio of torsional to longitudinal response at the output face. The new approach is based on combining the principles of these methods to overcome the previously stated limitations, the slotting technique is incorporated into the exponential cross-sectional path and the horn produced is utilised as the front mass of a Langevin transducer. A set of design and performance criteria are used to optimise the transducer and includes applicable design; methods of securing the transducer; and the excitation features of LT transducer such that it can operate without the effects of surrounding modes of vibration and can produce high response and torsionality at the output surface. A methodology which combines mathematical and experimental modelling is used to optimise LT transducer design. The mathematical modelling, which includes finite element (FE) and analytical methods, is performed to optimise the geometry and to predict electromechanical parameters, modal parameters and the dynamic behaviour of LT transducer. The experimental modelling is used to validate the mathematical results and to characterise the fabricated prototypes under different operating conditions. The dimensions of the initial design of the L mode Langevin transducer are derived from the principles of the wave equation. This transducer has a set of piezoceramic components sandwich between a cylindrical back mass and an exponential front mass connected by a pre-stressed bolt. The dimensions are used to create the FE model, using the FE software package ABAQUS, where different shapes of cut at different dimensions and at various angle of twist along the front mass are introduced and examined by a modal analysis procedure to the front mass. An optimised model is then utilised in a size scaling study to confirm the suitability of using this approach for different ultrasonic applications. The dimensions of the optimised design are also used in the analytical study, based on Mason’s electric equivalent circuit approach, to predict the electromechanical parameters where a one-dimensional equivalent circuit approach is created separately for each part whilst the combination vibrational motion in the front mass is represented by two, longitudinal and torsional, equivalent circuits. The complete equivalent network of the LT transducer is then solved using the mathematical software package MATHEMATICA. The analytical model is also extended to validate some of particular FE findings such as the distribution of the response amplitude and the location of the longitudinal nodal plane along the transducer’s structure. Two optimised models of different sizes are fabricated and characterised through different testing techniques including electrical impedance analysis, experimental modal analysis (EMA) and experimental harmonic analysis. Optimisation of the pre-stressing of the transducer is performed by applying different torques to the pre-stressed bolt and measuring the electrical impedance spectra where the results are compared to analytical findings. EMA is then used to describe the natural characteristics of the structures where the results are used to accurately extract the modal parameters and to validate the predictions of the FE and analytical model. Different levels of harmonic excitation are used to characterise the fabricated prototypes where the results are compared to the findings of the mathematical modelling. A case study of the design of the LT drill is presented to validate the design approach for real ultrasonic applications. A similar methodology is applied and the resulting LT drill is tested for both unloaded and loaded operating conditions. The results obtained show that this new approach can be easily and successfully applied to ultrasonic applications to produce a torsional to longitudinal amplitude response of 0. 8 which is measured on a fabricated prototype. ...|$|R
