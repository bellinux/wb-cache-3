50|$|They {{are small}} bundles of sclerenchyma tissue in plants that form durable layers, {{such as the}} cores of apples and the gritty texture of pears (Pyrus communis). Sclereids are {{variable}} in shape. The cells can be isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within parenchyma tissues. But compared with most fibres, sclereids are relatively short. Characteristic examples are brachysclereids or the stone cells (called stone cells because of their hardness) of <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> <b>quinces</b> (Cydonia oblonga) {{and those of the}} shoot of the wax plant (Hoya carnosa). The cell walls fill nearly all the cell's volume. A layering of the walls and the existence of branched pits is clearly visible. Branched pits such as these are called ramiform pits. The shell of many seeds like those of nuts as well as the stones of drupes like cherries and plums are made up from sclereids.|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{research}} concerning growth inhibitors, {{which has}} been pursued for several decades already, dealt mainly with {{the effect of these}} substances on the germination process. WIESNER (1894) demonstrated the presence of a growth inhibitor in the slime of the mistletoe (Viscum album) which prevented the germination of a great variety of seeds. OPPENHEIMER (1922) supplemented the analysis by placing seeds on the pulp of ripe tomatoes and he observed a strong inhibitive effect {{as a result of this}} treatment. In addition, however, he found that the inhibiting substance is thermolabile and insoluble in ether or alcohol. REINHARD (1933) corroborated Oppenheimer’s results for the most part. According to this author, however, the inhibiting agent in tomato juice is thermostabile, and it is not destroyed by boiling, neiher by neutralisation or by diluting the juice 50 times. In other fleshy fruits such as apples, <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> <b>quinces</b> KÖCKEMANN (1934) detected inhibiting substances capable of preventing the germination of Lepidium seeds. These substances were reported to be sensitive to peroxide and to alkali, thermostabile and soluble in water and in ether, but insoluble in petroleum ether. On the other hand, the inhibiting agent extracted by LEHMANN (1937) from the exocarp if buckwheat is thermolabile. In Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa, finally, RUGE (1939) demonstrated the presence of an inhibitor that reduces the speed of germination to a considerable extent. FRÖSCHEL’S investigations on Trifolium and Beta will be dealt with in 4. This survey is not quite exhaustive, but clearly demonstrates that the inhibiting agent should not be regarded as a definite, well-defined chemical substance which is always the same in every individual case, but as a group of substances with analogous activities but most probably with widely divergent physical and chemical properties. Following KÖCKEMANN (1934) we can classify the inhibiting substances into two groups, as follows : 1. inhibiting substances in the testa or in the seed, and 2. inhibiting substances in the mesocarp of pulpy fruits...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MCom (International Trade)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. South African {{exports to}} South America have not {{increased}} in recent years, despite the high growth in import demand in South America. Reasons {{for the latter}} may include the high barriers to trade between South Africa and the different South American countries. The main objectives {{of this study are}} firstly, to determine and measure the barriers to trade for South Africa in the different South American countries; secondly, to identify realistic export opportunities for South Africa in the South American countries and finally, to assist the various export promotion organisations, export councils and industry associations to focus their export promotion activities on the product–country combinations with a realistic potential for export success. The literature study focused on defining and identifying the different barriers to trade and their influence on trade. Trade barriers are any parts of the trading process that increase trade costs. The trade barriers focused on in this study are tariffs, non–tariff barriers (NTBs), transport cost, time to import, infrastructure, logistics, distance, cultural distance and exchange rate. The effect of these costs on prices and the result on the price competitiveness of export prices are discussed. The four largest trade barriers that South Africa faces when exporting to South American countries are tariffs, cost, time and language. Compared to the world, South America applies relatively high tariffs for goods imported from South Africa. The total transport cost and time are higher than the world averages. The language gap is also large, because Spanish is South America’s overall most spoken language. The Decision Support Model (DSM), developed by Cuyvers et al. (1995) and Cuyvers (1997), was chosen as the methodology to identify the most recent realistic export opportunities for South Africa in the South American countries (as described in the methodology). Filter 3. 2 of the DSM was reconstructed and the data was updated. The DSM results are presented according to product–country combinations. The South American countries in the top 50 product–country combinations, ranked according to each country’s number of export opportunities, are Brazil (25), Peru (7), Argentina (5), Colombia (4), and Chile (4). These five countries are also the countries with the lowest trade barriers for iii South Africa in South America. The products with the highest potential export values within the top 50 product–country combinations are: transportation products (e. g. 1500 cc– 3000 cc automobiles and diesel trucks), mineral products (e. g. different variations of coal, anthracite and sulphurs), vegetable products (e. g. maize (except seed corn) and fresh <b>pears</b> <b>and</b> <b>quinces),</b> chemicals (e. g. polypropylene, ammonium, monoammonium, nitrogen–phosphorus–potassium), machinery (e. g. generators, engines, furnaces, boring machines etc.) and foodstuffs (wine, sugar and tobacco). It is recommended that the South African trade promotion organisations, namely the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the provincial trade promotion organisations, the various export councils and industry organisation use {{the results of this study}} to focus their investments in the production and export promotion strategies on the identified product–country combinations.

Introduction: The term pomology in {{its general}} sense {{applies to all}} those subjects, both {{practical}} and scientific, which {{have to do with}} the growing of fruit. The word comes from the Latin, pomum, a word that was used generically for"fruit. " In later Latin it came to be associated more particularly with apple -like fruits. The word is also handed down to us in the French,pomme, meaning "apple". In English we know it as pome, a botanical term used to designate fruits that have the peculiar morphological structure of the apple,pear,and quince. In its true sense we may define pomology as the science of fruits, and its limitations as a science or an art depends upon the use of the term fruit. A concise definition of a fruit,in a horticultural sense is, we may say, impossible. The science may be divided into three parts: systematic pomology, the classification of fruits, practical pomology,the science of growing fruit, and commercial pomology, the science of marketing fruits.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of agricultural crops is seriously limited by salinity. This problem is rapidly increasing, particularly in irrigated lands. Like {{almost all the}} fruit tree species, Pyrus communis is generally considered a salt sensitive species, but only little information is available on its behavior under saline conditions. Previous studies, {{carried out in the}} Department of Fruit Tree and Woody Plant Science (University of Bologna), focused their attention on <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> <b>quince</b> salt stress responses to understand which rootstock would be the most suitable for pear in order to tolerate a salt stress condition. It has been reported that <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> <b>quince</b> have different ability in the uptake, translocation and accumulation of chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) ions, when plants were irrigated for one season with saline water (5 dS/m). The aim of the present work was to deepen these aspects and investigate salt stress responses in <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> <b>quince.</b> Two different experiments have been performed: a “short-term” trial in a growth chamber and a “long-term” experiment in the open field. In the short-term experiment, three different genotypes usually adopted as pear rootstocks (MC, BA 29 and Farold® 40) <b>and</b> the <b>pear</b> variety Abbé Fétel own rooted have been compared under salt stress conditions. The trial was performed in a hydroponic culture system, applying a 90 mM NaCl stress to half of the plants, after five weeks of normal growth in Hoagland’s solution. During the three-weeks of salt stress treatment, physiological, mineral and molecular analyses were performed in order to monitor, for each genotype, the development of the salt stress responses in comparison with the corresponding “unstressed” plants. Farold® 40 and Abbé Fétel own rooted showed the onset of leaf necrosis, due to salt toxicity, one week before quinces. Moreover, quinces displayed a significant delay in premature senescence of old leaves, while pears emerged for their ability to regenerate new leaves from apparently dead foliage with the salt stress still running. Physiological measurements, such as shoots length, chlorophyll (Chl) content, and photosynthesis, have been carried out <b>and</b> revealed that <b>pears</b> exhibited a significant reduction in water content and a wilting aspect, while for quinces a decrease in Chl content and a growth slowdown were observed. At the end of the trial, all plants were collected and organs separated for dry weight estimation and mineral analyses (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn Mg, Ca, K, Na and Cl). Mineral contents have been affected by salinity; same macro/micro nutrients were altered in some organs or relocated within the plant. This plant response could have partially contributed to face the salt stress. Leaves and roots have been harvested for molecular analyses at four different times during stress conditions. Molecular analyses consisted of the gene expression study of three main ion transporters, well known in Arabidopsis thaliana as salt-tolerance determinants in the “SOS” pathway: NHX 1 (tonoplast Na+/H+ antiporter), SOS 1 (plasmalemma Na+/H+ antiporter) and HKT 1 (K+ high-affinity and Na+ low-affinity transporter). These studies showed that two quince rootstocks adopted different responsive mechanisms to NaCl stress. BA 29 increased its Na+ sequestration activity into leaf vacuoles, while MC enhanced temporarily the same ability, but in roots. Farold® 40, instead, exhibited increases in SOS 1 and HKT 1 expression mainly at leaf level in the attempt to retrieve Na+ from xylem, while Abbé Fétel differently altered the expression of these genes in roots. Finally, each genotype showed a peculiar response to salt stress that was the sum of its ability in Na+ exclusion, osmotic tolerance and tissue tolerance. In the long-term experiment, potted trees of the pear variety Abbé Fétel grafted on different rootstocks (MC, BA 29 and Farold® 40), or own rooted and also rootstocks only were subjected to a salt stress through saline water irrigation with an electrical conductivity of 5 dS/m for two years. The purposes of this study were to evaluate salinity effects on physiological (shoot length, number of buds, photosynthesis, etc.) and yield parameters of cultivar Abbé Fétel in the different combinations and to determine the salt amount that pear is able to tolerate over the years. With this work, we confirmed the previous hypothesis that pear, despite being classified as a salt-sensitive fruit tree, can be cultivated for two years under saline water irrigation, without showing any salt toxicity symptoms or severe drawbacks on plant development and production. Among different combinations, Abbé Fétel grafted on MC resulted interesting for its peculiar behaviors under salt stress conditions. In the near future, further investigations on physiological and molecular aspects will be necessary to enrich and broaden the knowledge of salt stress responses in pear. ...|$|R

Biodiversity of predatory mites were measured using biodiversity indices and {{were analyzed using}} one-way ANOVA. As a result, a total of 20 species from 15 genera and six families of predatory mites were collected and identified. There {{was a significant difference}} in Shannon-Wiener indices of predatory mites among sampling sites. The highest and least values of Shannon-Wiener index for predatory mites were estimated in Laeen (1. 92 ± 0. 02) and Torogh (1. 26 ± 0. 06), respectively. In terms of species richness, the highest value of Margalef’s index was measured for Laeen (2. 49 ± 0. 02) which was significantly higher than those of other sites. The value of evenness of Torghabe-Shandiz was the highest and that of Torogh was the least. The dominant predator species in pomefruit orchards of Mashhad and Torghabe-Shandiz regions were Eustigmaeus anauniensis and Stigmaeus elongatus with relative abundance of 33. 5 % and 17. 6 %, respectively...|$|R
