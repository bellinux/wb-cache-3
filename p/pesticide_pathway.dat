40|$|International audienceDevelopment {{efforts for}} the {{reduction}} of land use needs and the improvement of farmer livelihoods in northern Thailand {{have resulted in the}} introduction of new pesticide-intensive crop species. Cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides pose a health risk to farmers and consumers, though <b>pesticide</b> exposure <b>pathways</b> are not well understood. Farmers believe that cross-crop pesticide contamination between ornamental chrysanthemums and food crops is a possible source of pesticide exposure. Therefore, we used spatial analysis to test the hypothesis that cross-crop pesticide contamination may be a <b>pesticide</b> exposure <b>pathway.</b> Data on cholinesterase inhibition detection on food crops from 2006 to 2008 were spatially correlated with crop field areas and chrysanthemum cultivation areas. Statistical analysis was used to determine factors that influence the likelihood of cholinesterase inhibition detection on a crop. Our results show that the application of cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides to a food crop contributed significantly to the likelihood that the crop would exhibit cholinesterase inhibition, but accounted for less than 10  % of the total cases of detection. Demonstration of cross-crop pesticide contamination is given by greater detection for crops grown closer to chrysanthemum cultivation areas, crops tested on days of the week when samples were taken directly from the field based on proximity to chrysanthemum cultivation, and crops of species with more exposed edible parts. Mechanical barriers may be useful in reducing the risk of cross contamination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} organophosphorous pesticides destruction by oxidizing system, which was synthesized in the polluted aqueous sulfuric acidic solutions by constant current conducting. Bulk electrolyses with lead electrode were performed in an undivided cell under amperestatic conditions to study the oxidative cleavage of commercial pesticides and pure active ingredients. The pesticides were completely destroyed following pseudofirst-order kinetics estimated according to chemical oxygen demand (COD) data and phosphate ions accumulation. The assessment of decay rate constants shows the high mineralization degree. Moreover, the general current efficiency corresponds to high impact of chemical reactions in the bulk along with electrochemical interactions and defines the reasonable treatment process time as 120 min. The decay rate constants obtained by phosphate formation are higher for glyphosate than rate constants estimated by COD. It {{may be explained by}} P–C bond breaking and phosphate ions cleavage. For further study of organophosphorous <b>pesticides</b> oxidation <b>pathways</b> in detail by described process, the conditions of electrolysis should be milder...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundWomen {{living in}} {{agricultural}} areas may experience high pesticide exposures compared {{with women in}} urban or suburban areas because of their proximity to farm activities. ObjectiveOur objective was to review {{the evidence in the}} published literature for the contribution of nonoccupational <b>pathways</b> of <b>pesticide</b> exposure in women living in North American agricultural areas. MethodsWe evaluated the following nonoccupational exposure pathways: paraoccupational (i. e., take-home or bystander exposure), agricultural drift, residential pesticide use, and dietary ingestion. We also evaluated the role of hygiene factors (e. g., house cleaning, shoe removal). ResultsAmong 35 publications identified (published 199522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2013), several reported significant or suggestive (p < 0. 1) associations between paraoccupational (n = 19) and agricultural drift (n = 10) <b>pathways</b> and <b>pesticide</b> dust or biomarker levels, and 3 observed that residential use was associated with pesticide concentrations in dust. The 4 studies related to ingestion reported low detection rates of most pesticides in water; additional studies are needed to draw conclusions about the importance of this pathway. Hygiene factors were not consistently linked to exposure among the 18 relevant publications identified. ConclusionsEvidence supported the importance of paraoccupational, drift, and residential use pathways. Disentangling exposure pathways was difficult because agricultural populations are concurrently exposed to <b>pesticides</b> via multiple <b>pathways.</b> Most evidence was based on measurements of pesticides in residential dust, which are applicable to any household member and are not specific to women. An improved understanding of nonoccupational <b>pesticide</b> exposure <b>pathways</b> in women living in agricultural areas is critical for studying health effects in women and for designing effective exposure-reduction strategies.

40|$|Public {{concern has}} {{recently}} escalated over pesticide contamination of South African aquatic ecosystems. This review of published {{literature on the}} occurrence of pesticides within South African freshwater systems indicates that fewer than 50 studies of selected pesticides have been undertaken, with emphasis being on organochlorines. Extensive historical usage {{has led to the}} widespread persistence of selected organochlorines. Few studies have established linkages between <b>pesticides,</b> exposure <b>pathways,</b> environmental concentrations and the monitoring of toxicological effects on non-target organisms. Emphasis is now being placed on developing more field-relevant assessments, including microcosm and mesocosm studies, in situ bioassays and field studies. There are few data relating to the extent of exposure and effects of pesticides in South African aquatic environments, and thus further research is needed. Research should focus on multidisciplinary approaches that increase effective decisionmaking in data-poor circumstances. A pesticide risk assessment programme for aquatic ecosystems needs to be implemented in South Africa, which could feed into the National Toxicity Monitoring Programme. Preliminary risk assessment models should be used to detect pesticides posing possible or definite risks, whereafter more detailed chemical, toxicological and biological monitoring assessments should be performed if risks are predicted...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify the transport <b>pathways</b> of <b>pesticides</b> from a sloped litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) orchard to a nearby stream based on a three-component hydrograph separation (baseflow, interflow, surface runoff). Dissolved silica and electrical conductivity were chosen as representative tracers. During the study period (30 d), 0. 4 and 0. 01 % of the applied mass of atrazine and chlorpyrifos, respectively, were detected in the stream after 151 mm of rainfall. Baseflow (80 – 96 %) was the dominant hydrological flow component, followed by interflow (3 – 18 %) and surface runoff (1 – 7 %). Despite its small contribution to total discharge, surface runoff was the dominant atrazine transport pathway during the first days after application because pesticide concentrations in the surface runoff flow component declined quickly within several days. Preferential transport with interflow became the dominant pathway of atrazine. Because chlorpyrifos was detected in the stream water only twice, it {{was not included in}} the hydrograph separation. A feature of the surface runoff pathway was the coincidence of pesticide and discharge peaks. In contrast, peak concentrations of pesticides transported by interflow occurred during the hydrograph recession phases. Stormflow generation and pesticide transport depended on antecedent rainfall. The combination of high-resolution pesticide concentration measurements with a three-component hydrograph separation has been shown to be a suitable method to identify <b>pesticide</b> transport <b>pathways</b> under tropical conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background Farmworkers {{and their}} {{families}} are exposed to <b>pesticides</b> through multiple <b>pathways.</b> Few studies have examined the frequency with which farmworkers engage in pesticide safety practices and the factors associated with their adoption. Methods Using a large sample of farmworkers (n[*]=[*] 554), we evaluated relationships between pesticide safety behaviors and farmworkers' beliefs, training history, handling of pesticides at work, perceived occupational exposure, and employers' provision of personal protective equipment. Results Performing behaviors at work was determined largely by whether personal protective equipment was provided. For home behaviors, female gender, living in a labor camp, being trained in the last 5 years, handling pesticides directly, and not perceiving organizational barriers to protecting oneself were associated with taking more precautions. Conclusions These findings call for interventions that involve and engage multiple stakeholders to increase adoption of pesticide safety behaviors and reduce pesticide exposure in farmworkers. Am. J.

40|$|In {{assessing}} the potential health {{risks associated with}} exposure to pesticides, attention has historically focused on single pathways of exposure (e. g., from pesticide residues in food, water, or residential/nonoccupational uses) for individual chemicals, {{and not on the}} potential for individuals to be exposed to multiple <b>pesticides</b> by all <b>pathways</b> concurrently. In 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) imposed upon the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) the requirement to consider potential human health risks from all pathways of dietary and nondietary exposures to more than one pesticide acting through a common mechanism of toxicity. This document provides guidance to OPP scientists for evaluating and estimating the potential human risks associated with such multichemical and multipathway exposures to pesticides. This process is referred to as cumulative risk assessment.

40|$|Children up to 6 {{years of}} age who lived with {{pesticide}} applicators were monitored for increased risk of pesticide exposure: 48 pesticide applicator and 14 reference families were recruited from an agricultural region of Washington State in June 1995. A total of 160 spot urine samples were collected from 88 children, including repeated measures 3 - 7 days apart. Samples were assayed by gas chromatography flame photometric detector for dimethylphosphate metabolites. Dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) was the dominant metabolite. DMTP levels were significantly higher in applicator children than in reference children (p = 0. 015), with median concentrations of 0. 021 and 0. 005 microg/ml, respectively; maximum concentrations were 0. 44 and 0. 10 microg/ml, respectively. Percentages of detectable samples were 47 % for applicator children and 27 % for reference children. A marginally significant trend of increasing concentration was observed with decreasing age among applicator children (p = 0. 060), and younger children within these families had significantly higher concentrations when compared to their older siblings (p = 0. 040). Applicator children living less than 200 feet from an orchard were {{associated with higher frequency}} of detectable DMTP levels than nonproximal applicator children (p = 0. 036). These results indicate that applicator children experienced higher organophosphorus pesticide exposures than did reference children in the same community and that proximity to spraying is an important contributor to such exposures. Trends related to age suggest that child activity is an important variable for exposure. It is unlikely that any of the observed exposures posed a hazard of acute intoxication. This study points to the need for a more detailed understanding of <b>pesticide</b> exposure <b>pathways</b> for children of agricultural workers...|$|R
40|$|Farm ditch networks, {{infrastructures}} {{designed to}} regulate excess water in cropped landscapes, constitute <b>pesticide</b> dispersal <b>pathways</b> or buffer zones, {{depending on their}} soil properties. Despite the key role that ditch soils play in the regulation of water and pesticide fate, their properties, especially in intermittently flooded ditches, remain poorly characterized. Therefore, {{our aim was to}} evaluate the specificity of ditch material properties to determine whether ditches require an approach that differs from that of field soils when studying water and pesticide fate in farmed landscapes. We thus analysed the variations in the pedological, herbicide sorption and flow properties of soil materials along a 2 D cross-section of an intermittently flooded ditch in the Roujan catchment of southern France. We found that {{the upper part of the}} ditch bed soil profile is composed of 3 horizons that formed after the original creation of the ditch, most likely via the deposition of field-eroded particles and the accumulation of organic matter. These specific horizons have greater porosity, mostly due to their dense root systems, and contain up to 2 times more organic carbon than the neighbouring banks or field soils. Consequently, the hydraulic conductivity is greater, and the sorption of hydrophobic herbicides is up to 2 times greater in ditch bed materials than it is in soils located farther away from the ditch surface. Moreover, significant macroporal flow was evidenced in both profiles but with different contribution to the global flow. The contrasts in the hydrodynamic and sorption properties between both the ditch bed and banks materials likely results in significantly different water and pesticide infiltration patterns in ditches compared to crop fields. Given these differences, we recommend investigating the specific properties of ditch beds when studying and modelling water and pesticide fate in croplands...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} of pesticides {{has been based}} on direct toxic effects on aquatic organisms. Indirect effects data are taken into account but with limitations, as it is frequently difficult to predict their real impacts in the ecosystems. In this context the main aim of this work was to assess how the exposure to the herbicide pendimethalin (Prowl®), under environmentally relevant concentrations, may compromise the nutritional composition of food for a relevant group of primary consumers of freshwater food webs—the daphnids, thus affecting their reproduction performance and subsequently the long-term sustainability of active populations of this grazer. Therefore, Daphnia magna individuals were chronically exposed in a clean medium to a control diet (NCF – i. e., non-contaminated green algae Raphidocelis subcapitata) and to a contaminated diet (CF – i. e., the same monoalgal culture grown in a medium enriched with pendimethalin in a concentration equivalent to the EC 20 for growth inhibition of algae), during which reproductive endpoints were assessed. The algae were analysed for protein, carbohydrate and fatty acid content. The chemical composition of R. subcapitata in the CF revealed a slight decrease on total fatty acid levels, with a particular decrease of essential ! 9 monounsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, the protein content was high in the CF. D. magna exposed to CF experienced a 16 % reduction in reproduction, measured as the total number of offspring produced per female. Additionally, an internal pendimethalin body burden of 4. 226 "g g− 1 was accumulated by daphnids fed with CF. Hence, although it is difficult to discriminate the contribution of the pesticide (as a toxic agent transferred through the food web) from that of the food with a poor quality—compromised by the same pesticide, there are no doubts that, under environmentally relevant concentrations of <b>pesticides,</b> both <b>pathways</b> may compromise the populations of freshwater grazers in the long term, with consequences in the control of the primary productivity of these systems. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This paper aims to {{investigate}} the potential pesticide dermal contamination among the agricultural community by observing the microenvironmental and macroactivity interaction between farm children and adult farmer. Methods A 24 hours timeline activity was observed and recorded in the agricultural farming village, Kuala Selangor. In this study, 2 homes were monitored for 2 days following a pesticide application. A total of 2 adult farmers and 5 children (7 - 10 year old) were recruited {{to participate in this}} study. Twentyfour hour videotape segments and time-activity diaries were collected during the study. Results The microenvironment and macroactivity interaction were modelled in this study. By considering only the potential dermal exposure pathway, the biological vulnerability and exposure pattern to pesticides were observed. Finding showed a greater extent of interaction between human and its environment, where adult farmers are the main contributor of environmental contaminants, and children is one of the vulnerable receivers of the contaminants’ residuals from the environment. Conclusion The daily activities and behaviors practiced by the agricultural community were among the contributing factors which help to highlight the <b>pesticide</b> dermal contamination <b>pathway</b> in the farming village.

40|$|Children of farmworkers can {{be exposed}} to <b>pesticides</b> through {{multiple}} <b>pathways,</b> including agricultural take-home and drift as well as residential applications. Because farmworker families often live in poor-quality housing, the exposure from residential pesticide use may be substantial. We measured eight locally reported agricultural pesticides and 13 pesticides commonly found in U. S. houses in residences of 41 farmworker families {{with at least one}} child < 7 years of age in western North Carolina and Virginia. Wipe samples were taken from floor surfaces, toys, and children’s hands. We also collected interview data on possible predictors of pesticide presence, including characteristics of the household residents, cleaning practices, and characteristics of the home. All families were Spanish-speaking, primarily from Mexico. Results indicate that six agricultural and 11 residential pesticides were found in the homes, with agricultural, residential, or both present in 95 % of homes sampled. In general, residential pesticides were more commonly found. Presence of both types of pesticides on the floor was positively associated with detection on toys or hands. Agricultural pesticide detection was associated with housing adjacent to agricultural fields. Residential pesticide detection was associated with houses judged difficult to clean. Although the likelihood of agricultural pesticide exposure has been considered high for farmworker families, these results indicate that residential pesticide use and exposure in this population merit further study...|$|R

Women {{of childbearing age}} and children living in rural agricultural regions are at-risk for pesticide exposure {{from a variety of}} pathways including occupational track-in, drift from farming activities, residential usage, and dietary intake. The purpose of this dissertation research is to answer the questions: "What do mothers perceive as <b>pesticide</b> exposure <b>pathways</b> for themselves and their children? How do these perceptions differ between cultural groups?" The study involves a secondary analysis of data collected during the summer of 2007 in the Red River Basin of the North from the University of Minnesota's Regional Sustainable Development Partnerships and the Division of Environmental Health Sciences. Sixteen women from three diverse groups participated: Caucasians enrolled in the Women Infant and Children federally subsidized nutrition program, new American immigrants, and Native Americans. Due to culture, economics, and geography, these groups may experience increased health risks from pesticide exposure. Photovoice was used as a qualitative methodology to document mothers' concerns about pesticide exposure and other health issues for their children, since it enables participants, including those who lack verbal acumen {{in the language of the}} dominant culture, to use photographs to address questions like, "Why does this situation exist? Do we want to change it, and, if so, how?" Caucasian and Native American mothers voiced concern about pesticide exposure from drift due to agricultural spraying on the ground and by plane. All participants wanted advanced notice to take precautionary measures before fogging or spraying. Perceptions of pesticide exposure differed according to the cultural lens of each group: Caucasian women saw the necessity of industrial agriculture and pesticide usage as a trade-off; Native American women voiced concerns about pesticide contamination to traditional foods; and new American immigrants expressed a need to learn how to read labels and use pesticides safely. Participants suggested culturally congruent strategies for the delivery of educational information. Consumption of locally grown organic foods was identified as one strategy to reduce pesticide exposure.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{environmental}} fate of the insecticide and nematicide ethoprophos in the soil-water interface following the pesticide application in simulated maize and potato crops under Mediterranean agricultural conditions, particularly of irrigation. Focus {{was given to the}} soil-water transfer pathways (leaching and runoff), to the pesticide transport in soil between pesticide application (crop row) and non-application areas (between crop rows), as well as to toxic effects of the various matrices on terrestrial and aquatic biota. A semi-field methodology mimicking a "worst-case" ethoprophos application (twice the recommended dosage for maize and potato crops: 100 % concentration v/v) in agricultural field situations was used, in order to mimic a possible misuse by the farmer under realistic conditions. A rainfall was simulated under a slope of 20 ° for both crop-based scenarios. Soil and water samples were collected for the analysis of pesticide residues. Ecotoxicity of soil and aquatic samples was assessed by performing lethal and sublethal bioassays with organisms from different trophic levels: the collembolan Folsomia candida, the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Although the majority of ethoprophos sorbed to the soil application area, pesticide concentrations were detected in all water matrices illustrating <b>pesticide</b> transfer <b>pathways</b> of water contamination between environmental compartments. Leaching to groundwater proved to be an important transfer pathway of ethoprophos under both crop-based scenarios, as it resulted in high pesticide concentration in leachates from Maize (130 µgL(- 1)) and Potato (630 µgL(- 1)) crop scenarios, respectively. Ethoprophos application at the Potato crop scenario caused more toxic effects on terrestrial and aquatic biota than at the Maize scenario at the recommended dosage and lower concentrations. In both crop-based scenarios, ethoprophos moved with the irrigation water flow to the soil between the crop rows where no pesticide was applied, causing toxic effects on terrestrial organisms. The two simulated agricultural crop-based scenarios had the merit to illustrate the importance of transfer <b>pathways</b> of <b>pesticides</b> from soil to groundwater through leaching and from crop rows to the surrounding soil areas in a soil-water interface environment, which is representative for irrigated agricultural crops under Mediterranean conditions...|$|R

Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict <b>pesticide</b> sources, transport <b>pathways</b> and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2  min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387  μg L−  1. Samples {{from all of}} the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0. 1  μg L−  1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013 / 39 /EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25 %). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30 - or 4 -fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52 %), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport...|$|R

Evaluating the combined effects of these stressors on organisms is a great challenge in environmental sciences. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study to assess the molecular stress response of an aquatic fish species subjected to individual and combined pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures. For that, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were acclimated to two different temperatures (22 and 32 degrees C) for 15 days. They were then exposed for 96 h to a cocktail of herbicides and fungicides (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations of 8. 4 mu gL(- 1) and 42 mu gL(- 1)) at these two temperatures (22 and 32 degrees C). The molecular response in liver was assessed by 2 D-proteomics. Identified proteins were integrated using pathway enrichment analysis software to determine the biological functions involved in the individual or combined stress responses and to predict the potential deleterious outcomes. The <b>pesticide</b> mixtures elicited <b>pathways</b> involved in cellular stress response, carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolisms, methionine cycle, cellular functions, cell structure and death control, with concentration- and temperature-dependent profiles of response. We found that combined temperature increase and pesticide exposure affected the cellular stress response: the effects of oxidative stress were more marked and there was a deregulation of the cell cycle via apoptosis inhibition. Moreover a decrease in the formation of glucose by liver and in ketogenic activity was observed in this multi-stress condition. The decrease in both pathways could reflect a shift from a metabolic compensation strategy to a conservation state. Taken together, our results showed (1) that environmental cocktails of herbicides and fungicides induced important changes in pathways involved in metabolism, cell structure and cell cycle. with possible deleterious outcomes at higher biological scales and (2) that increasing temperature could affect the response of fish to pesticide exposure...|$|R
40|$|Pesticides {{are widely}} used in the world due to their {{importance}} in agricultural production, especially in developing countries, where their use is high. Different health effects such as adverse reproductive outcomes, neurological disorders and cancers {{have been associated with}} pesticide exposure. Populations can be exposed to <b>pesticides</b> via different <b>pathways,</b> such as their occupation or via the environment, when pesticides applied to agricultural fields are transported from their intended treatment sites to neighboring residential areas. Environmental exposure to pesticides can occur through several pathways, such as spray drift, volatilization and dispersion, while take-home pathway and personal use can also contribute to pesticide exposure within the living environment. There are different methods and techniques described in the literature, which are used to assess environmental exposure to pesticides. Measurement techniques, such as bio-monitoring and the collection of environmental samples have been used to determine environmental exposure to pesticides. The main advantage of bio-monitoring is that the actual total pesticide exposure (the dose) of a subject is measured, but short half-lives of most biomarkers limit their application to short-term health effects and small study populations due to high costs. Modelling techniques, making use of geographic information systems, have been developed recently and have become one of the preferred techniques when researchers want to study long-term health outcomes related to environmental pesticide exposure in large study populations. However, validation studies are generally lacking for these models, which represents a problem for the use of these techniques. Currently, a new prospective cohort study in the city of Molina, Chile, has been initiated to study chronic health effects related to environmental factors (such as pesticides). The aim of the Maule Cohort (MAUCO) is to enroll 10, 000 subjects aged 38 to 74 years living in the city of Molina and follow them up for 10 years. As this region is heavily involved 4 in agricultural activities and this cohort focusses on chronic, long-term health effects, past environment exposure to pesticides {{is one of the main}} interests. Geospatial modelling, making use of the subjects’ residential history, data on agricultural land-use, and (historical) pesticide use would be the most suitable in this context to determine (past) environmental exposure to pesticides. In addition, a sub-study, making use of biomarkers and environmental samples, is recommended to determine validity of the modelled environmental pesticide exposures...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide point {{contamination}} {{caused by}} the handling of pesticides at cleaning and filling places on the farms can be limited by the installation of on-farm biopurification systems (BPS), composed of various organic materials in which biodegradation and sorption of the pesticides are the main removal processes for treating the pesticide-contaminated wastewater. Different studies indeed conclude that such systems ensure a high retention and degradation percentage. However, pesticides are not always degraded completely, resulting in the accumulation of even more toxic and mobile metabolites. The efficacy can be improved by introducing micro-organisms which developed, because of the extensive use of <b>pesticides,</b> specialised metabolic <b>pathways</b> enabling them to mineralize pesticides to CO 2 and other harmless end-products. Different studies show that labcultivated inoculants are not recommended because of their poor survival ability in a new biotope. In addition, although soils from pesticide-treated fields often contain the capacity to degrade/mineralize the pesticide, the responsible micro-organisms can not always be cultivated. Therefore, this study investigates, as an alternative for bioaugmentation with pure cultures, whether soils showing pesticide-mineralizing activity are advisable for stimulating mineralization in BPS. The soils qualified for this strategy are long-term contaminated soils or pesticide-primed soils. Lab-scale biofilter microcosms (BM), consisted of a mixture of straw and peat and bioaugmentated with either a linuron-primed soil containing a linuron mineralizing population or a non-primed soil without linuron mineralizing capacity, were irrigated with either a linuron solution or clean tapwater. Afterwards, the BM were subjected to sequential stress conditions (e. g. sudden pesticide supply-stop, a cold period, drought and irrigation with a pesticide mixture) expected to occur in real systems. Additionally, the minimal amount of soil to accomplish increased mineralization activity was determined. The change in pesticide mineralizing activity of the BM was monitored by means of 14 C-mineralization experiments performed with samples regularly taken from the BM. The BM inoculated with the linuron-primed soil directly gained the ability of mineralizing this pesticide which {{was not the case}} for the BM with the non-primed soil. The mineralizing activity was maintained {{for more than a year}} and application of the pesticide even resulted into increased activity. These results were accomplished with both 50 vol% and 0. 5 vol% pesticide-primed soil. Subjecting the BM to a cold period and irrigation with a pesticide mixture did not have any effect on the mineralizing activity in the samples. Ceasing the linuron supply and a drought period caused no damage to the activity. However, the linuron mineralizing population did decrease but could reestablish when the initial conditions returned. In contrast, the BM inoculated with the non-primed soil developed a linuron mineralizing activity only after an extended period of pesticide supply and this activity showed less resistance towards stress periods. status: publishe...|$|R
