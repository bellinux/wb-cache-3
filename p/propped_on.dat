25|$|On 4 April, {{the body}} of John Paul II was moved onto a red velvet catafalque, with his head <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> three red pillows. The Papal Gentlemen, clothed in black morning coats and white gloves, were chosen as pallbearers and stood {{along the sides of}} the pope's bier. Cardinal Martínez Somalo, dressed in red and gold vestments, officiated the {{asperges}} rite. He blessed the pope with the holy waters of baptism three times: {{to the right of the}} pope, at his head and then to his left. An acolyte then brought to the Camerlengo a thurible and boat. Cardinal Martínez Somalo incensed the pope three times.|$|E
25|$|The body of John Paul II {{was dressed}} in his vestments {{and moved to the}} Clementine Hall on the third level (considered the second floor) of the Apostolic Palace on 3 April. His body was laid on a sloped olive-sheeted catafalque and his head <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> a stack of three gold pillows. Near the catafalque was a wooden {{crucifix}} and a paschal candle symbolic of Jesus Christ as the light of the world in the face of darkness and death. His body was guarded by the Swiss Guard, a corps of men which has sworn to protect the pope through several centuries. During a period of private visitation Vatican officials and a contingent of officials from the Italian government viewed the body of John PaulII.|$|E
25|$|He is briefly {{mentioned}} in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where following the Death Eaters attack at the Quidditch World Cup, Mundungus {{put in an}} insurance claim to the Ministry of Magic for a twelve-bedroomed tent with an en-suite jacuzzi, while in reality he had been sleeping under a cloak <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> sticks. As a member of both the original and the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix, he is assigned guard duty to protect Harry, but abandons his position to conduct a shady cauldron-trading deal, leaving a critical opening through which Dementors manage to attack Harry. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry catches Mundungus outside the Three Broomsticks trying to sell what had been Sirius's property (which now belongs to Harry after Sirius's death) to Aberforth, and the boy confronts him. Mundungus goes into hiding but is later jailed in Azkaban for impersonating an Inferius during a botched robbery.|$|E

500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the event was between Randy Orton and Triple H over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the August {{pay-per-view}} event, SummerSlam, WWE's previous pay-per-view event, Orton defeated Chris Benoit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, thus making Orton the youngest World Heavyweight Champion in WWE history. On the August 16, 2004 edition of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Orton successfully retained the title in a rematch with Benoit. After the match, Evolution (Batista, Ric Flair, and Triple H), Orton's fellow stablemates, threw him a fake celebration, only to reveal {{that they were not}} pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up; Triple H, however, abruptly changed the thumbs up to a thumbs-down and told Batista to drop Orton to the mat. Flair and Batista then began to beat Orton in the ring as Triple H claimed that Orton was nothing without Evolution. Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former group members. On the August 23 edition of Raw, after Orton refused to give Triple H the World title, Orton spat in Triple H's face and hit him with the title belt. General Manager Eric Bischoff then scheduled a match between the two for the World Heavyweight title at Unforgiven. The following week on Raw, Eugene defeated Triple H in a singles match after Orton interfered and performed an RKO on Triple H. On the September 6 edition Raw, Orton defeated Kane in a Steel Cage match, which Orton won by escaping the cage. Shortly after the match ended, Ric Flair and Batista came out and, along with Triple H, began attacking Orton. In an interview with the Daily Star in 2006, Orton revealed that WWE chairman, Vince McMahon, {{came up with the idea}} of having Orton be a fan favorite the day of SummerSlam. According to Orton, transforming into a fan favorite was [...] "tough" [...] because [...] "no one bought it".|$|E
500|$|After {{losing the}} Intercontinental Championship, Orton became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26. At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship. Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history {{at the age of}} 24. Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking his hand for showing the ability to [...] "be a man". The following night, after Orton successfully defended the championship against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a [...] celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista's dropping Orton to the mat. Ric Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring as Triple H revealed his jealousy for Orton's title. He ordered Orton to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt. Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates. A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven. Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of nowhere to beat and humiliate the group. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a Steel Cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming General Manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last pinning Triple H in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match. He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses. Orton was granted another chance at the championship in January 2005, but lost a six-man championship Elimination Chamber match to Triple H at New Year's Revolution. On the January 10 Raw, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the World title.|$|E

Another actress present at the event, Beatrix Dussanne, described her performance: [...] "The miracle again took place; Sarah, old, mutilated, once more illuminated a crowd by the rays of her genius.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} monuments {{are in the}} chancel and the chapel. [...] Behind the altar is the free-standing tomb chest of Sir Thomas St. Pol, who died in 1588, and his wife. [...] On {{the sides of the}} chest are pilasters decorated with acanthus leaves, and the panels between them contain shields with wreaths. [...] On top of the chest are effigies {{of a man and a}} woman. [...] The man is dressed in plate armour and is holding a sword and a prayer book. His head rests on a helmet, his feet on a cushion. [...] The woman is wearing a long dress, a cloak and a hat,and is holding a Bible. [...] Above them is a canopy carried by six pillars. [...] The entablature is decorated with an egg and dart frieze. [...] On the top of the canopy, above each pillar, is the statue of a weeping figure. [...] In the centre is an altar, in front of which is a kneeling female figure, and on the top is a male figure, also kneeling. [...] The whole monument is painted and gilded. [...] On the north side of the chapel is the tomb of Sir George St. Pol, who died in 1613, and his wife. [...] On the side of the tomb are three niches. [...] The central niche contains a carving of Sir George's daughter, and the lateral niches have mourning putti. [...] On the tomb are two recumbent effigies, each lying on their right side, <b>propped</b> <b>on</b> an elbow. [...] The nearer effigy is a female in mourning dress with a ruff and a hat, holding a prayer book. [...] Behind in a higher position on a step is a male figure in plate armour, holding a sword. [...] The effigies are contained in a semicircular-headed recess, the archivolt of which is decorated with roses. [...] The back wall has an inscribed panel surrounded by scrolls and memento mori. [...] At the sides are pillars supporting a frieze and an entablature. [...] On top of the monument are flaming urns, an achievement of arms, shields and obelisks. [...] In the north wall of the chapel is an alabaster painted and gilded plaque to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick who died in 1619. [...] It contains a circular medallion carved with the head and shoulders of the deceased, behind which is the profile of his wife. [...] On each side are pilasters, and above is an entablature [...] carrying a coat of arms and heraldic supporters. [...] Underneath is a panel inscribed with a poem. [...] This memorial is thought to have been made by Epiphanius Evesham. [...] Elsewhere, on the east wall of the chapel and the south wall of the chancel, are brass memorial plaques.|$|E
