It is also available at: [URL] mechanical properties of PVC sheets can be modified substantially by both uniaxial and biaxial stretching of the material above its glass transition temperature. Previous experimental studies have established a clear pattern in the relationship between tensile properties of oriented PVC products and imposed strains. Several mathematical models have been scrutinised to assess whether the established pattern of behaviour can be modelled and predicted. Of these, "the filament theory", proposed by Turner, emerged as the best candidate. The filament theory has been refined and developed further into "the composite model". In its present form it gives a good correlation between predicted and measured yield stress values of oriented rigid PVC sheets and is also capable of predicting the "established pattern" of property dependence upon imposed strain...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of top and bottom layers on shock {{absorbing}} performances of a 3 -layered cushion system using RC core slab reinforced with Aramid Fiber Reinforced <b>Pastic</b> (AFRP) rods are discussed {{on the basis of}} experimental results. This system consists of RC core slab, sand and/or Expanded Poly-Styrol (EPS). In order to study {{the effects of}} top and bottom layers on the shock absorbing performances, both material and thickness of top and bottom layer were changed. Furthermore, these results were compared with the results when single sand layer was used as cushion material. The experiments were conducted by a free drop of 3 tf heavy weight from a height of 30 m on the center of the cushion system. The results achieved from these experiments are: (1) Transmitted impact force can be effectively decreased by using thicker sand layer in top and EPS in bottom. (2) Impact force in case using sand in bottom layer are bigger than in case of single sand layer. (3) Thickness and material of top layer are more effective against the crack pattern of RC core slab...|$|E
40|$|Bifurcation cancer (BC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} dismal GIT {{malignancies}} because of the diffidulties in early diagnosis and treatment. Both endoscopic stenting or pdlliative surgery improve the survival conditions; the median survival, however, does not exceed 16 months. This study was performed to assess the feasibility of combined modality therapy in BC. Since Jan. 1990 to Feb. 1994, 61 consecutive jaundiced pts with BC (38 females, 23 males, mean age 56, 9 years) were entered into this procpective study. In 36 pts the endoscopic drainage (<b>pastic</b> llF stents) alone was performed; in 25 subjects the drainage of the biliary tree was done by a transhepatic approach using 24 F metalic self-expanding stents. The stenting was in 29 pts completed by regional chemotherapy or by intraluminal radiotherapy (iridium- 192 wires). Endoscopic stenring (two stents) was successful in 78 % out of cases, the transhepatic one reached 96 %. Nedian survival in pts, treated by stenting alone, was (in both types of stents) 236 days. Complications did not exceed 2, 3 %. In pts, treated by bilioduodenal endoprostheses and regional chemotherapy, or intraluminal radiotherapy the survival median reached 594 days (interval 160 to 713 days). No weighty side effects either local or systemis we were able to demonstrate. On the basis of our results is possible to conclude that in Be the combination of transhepatic insertion of metalic stents with subsequent regional chemotherapy and intralumiminal radiotherapy is the methos of choice at this time...|$|E
40|$|Growth of {{the yeast}} Brettanomyces/Dekkera in wine can {{drastically}} alter the aroma characteristics {{to the point}} where all varietal and regional flavor characteristics are overwhelmed by the flavors produced by these yeasts. To avoid spoilage {{it is important to know}} more about the aromas formed by these yeasts and be able to detect the changes in aroma early so that further growth of the yeast and further aroma modification can be avoided. Two groups of commercial wines with suspected "Brett" character were evaluated by two trained panels of judges. The first group included four Cabernet Sauvignon and two Pinot Noir wines; the second included four Cabernet Sauvignon wines. All were evaluated by sensory descriptive analysis and GC/MS 4 -ethyl phenol analysis. Characteristic "Brett" aromas such as plastic, burnt plastic, Band-aid (TM), cow manure, barnyard, and horse sweat were summarized by the first group of tasters as 'plastic. ' For the second group 'plastic' included only <b>pastic,</b> burnt plastic, and Band-aid (TM) odors. Dry manure and sweaty/animal were separate descriptors. In both groups, the wines were differentiated by univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate discriminant analysis (DA) by two descriptors: plastic and fruity. The greatest fruit character and lowest plastic scores defined the younger Cabernets, and the opposite was true for the older wines. There was little difference between the two Pinot Noirs for either descriptor. The a priori "Brett" observations from the winemakers proved to be a consistent predictor of Brett character for all wines. The observations also agreed with the 4 -ethyl phenol concentrations and the post-hoc plastic mean scores from the ANOVA analyses. The "strong Brett" wines were the older vintage wines with higher 4 -ethyl phenol concentrations, higher plastic and lower fruity mean scores. Wines with "maybe some" and "no Brett" had the lower 4 -ethyl phenol concentrations and more fruit with less plastic scores. This investigation shows that aroma modifications by Brettanomyces yeasts can be reliably detected and quantified with trained tasters. Further investigations into the chemical basis of the 'Brett' aromas will allow us to use chemical indicators to detect activity of these yeasts early...|$|E
40|$|Materials and players: The game {{is for a}} pair of two players. For {{each round}} of the game, 3 plastic-coated cards and one A 4 -size chart are used. There are two rounds in the game. Each round of the game {{consists}} of 3 communication sequences, corresponding to the 3 cards. If additional charts and/or cards have been provided, they are spares. It is best to use a black colour pen to fill the chart. If the participants use a written language that could not be provided, the words on the chart and the cards may have to be translated first. It is also possible to change the illnesses and symptoms if other illnesses are more salient in the particular country. Goal: The goal of the game is for the doctor to find out what illness the patient is suffering from by checking off symptoms on a chart. The fold on the right of the chart can be opened to find out the illness from the pattern of black dots. Set-up: Two participants are sitting at a table next to each other, slightly diagonally so that they face each other as well as the camera, which is in the centre in front of them. The arrows roughly indicate the gaze direction. This file was generated from an IMDI 1. 9 file and transformed to IMDI 3. 0. The substructure of Genre is replaced by two elements named "Genre" and "SubGenre". The original content of Genre substructure was: Interactional = '', Discursive = '', Performance = ''. These values have been added as Keys to the Content information. Linguistic target: This game targets body part possession (‘my head’), one of the core instances of inalienable possessio. There {{may or may not be}} predicative possession (‘have a headache’). Instead of posession proper, some languages use structures such as ‘head hurts’. The ‘weakness’ symptom is a control that is not expected to contain possessive structures (*‘my weakness’). Both first and second person reference are targeted. Rules of the game: Participant 1 plays the role of doctor, Participant 2 is the patient. The person in the role of the doctor should first be shown the chart and get instructions on how to complete the chart. The chart has to be folded so that the right-hand part is not visible. The visible part has the words for the symptoms on the far left, and three vertical columns of unfilled dots. Each column is for one game sequence, corresponding to the symptoms on one of the three cards that the patient has. The aim is for the doctor to colour in the dots for the correct symptoms and then open the folded part to match the dot pattern with the patterns on the right. This way the doctor can find out what the illness is and can inform the patient about it. The three <b>pastic</b> cards are face down in front of the patient, who starts by picking up one of the cards and looking at the list of symptoms. The doctor is not allowed to see what is on the card. When the patient has memorized the symptoms and put away the card, the doctor starts asking for his/her symptoms. It is not necessary to always go from top to down, the doctor is free to choose what to ask first. If the patients has a certain symptom, s/he responds by answering ‘yes’, and the doctor blackens the circle that is behind that symptom. If the patient has not got a specific symptom he responds by answering ‘no’, and the doctor goes on to the next symptom on his list. Even though the patient might know that there are no more symptoms on the card, the doctor still has to finish the whole chart. At the end of the sequence, when all dots have been either filled with black colour or left white, the doctor can check which illnesses the patient has by opening the folded paper and comparing the dot pattern to the patterns on the right. This diagnostic conversation is repeated 3 times for the 3 different sets of symptoms on the 3 cards. The order of the cards does not matter. The game is then repeated with reversed roles. The game sequences in summary: PLAYER 1 AS DOCTOR PLAYER 2 AS PATIENT set of symptoms 1 set of symptoms 2 set of symptoms 3 PLAYER 2 AS DOCTOR PLAYER 1 AS PATIENT set of symptoms 1 set of symptoms 2 set of symptoms 3 Final note: After a couple of sequences, both players may tend to reduce their utterances because they already know the context (e. g. HEADACHE? – head nod, EARS? – YES). If this happens, it is better to stop before roles are switched and first do one of the other games in between. After some other game activity, or after a pause, the game can be repeated with the reversed roles later on...|$|E
