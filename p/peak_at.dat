40|$|Positive-ion {{electron}} impact (PIEI), positive-ion {{chemical ionization}} (PICI) and negative-ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectra are presented for six pyrazolones and four pyrazolidines, and their fragmentation modes have been analyzed. In the PIEI mode, molecular ions were relatively intense for most compounds. <b>Peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 56 and 77 appeared in common for pyrazolones and <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 77 and 183 in common for pyrazolidines. In the PICI mode, [M + 1]+ quasi-molecular ions constituted base peaks for most compounds. Common <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 56 and 120 appeared for pyrazolones and <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 120 for pyrazolidines. In the NICI mode, pyrazolones gave both molecular and [M - 1]-quasi-molecular anions except dipyrone, and common <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 106. For pyrazolidines, molecular or quasi-molecular anions were small or missing except for ketophenylbutazone. A rapid extraction procedure with Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges from human body fluids of these compounds and their detection by wide-bore capillary gas chromatography (GC) were also presented. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
