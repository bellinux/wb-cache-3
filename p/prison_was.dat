5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Convict Establishment (or just The Establishment), Fremantle <b>Prison</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using convict labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle <b>Prison</b> <b>was</b> resistant to change.

5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction.
