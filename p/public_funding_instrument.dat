This paper proposes a set of policy and institutional reforms to improve the sector’s performance focusing on three aspects: completion of the sector’s deregulation, improvement of the allocation of <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> across policy <b>instruments</b> and restructuring the agricultural bureaucracy. These reforms will put down the foundation for an efficient incentive and institutional structure of support-service delivery. agriculture sector...|$|R

We first compare the organization of funding agencies, the portfolio of <b>funding</b> <b>instruments</b> and, finally, the repartition of funding by beneficiaries. Further, we identify the main structural characteristics of the funding systems, by looking at features like sectoral divisions, level of delegation and the role of different institutional levels in the management of funding. Against a widespread conception of research policies in central and eastern European countries converging towards a western-style model, our study displays profound differences between the considered countries, related to history but also to contextual factors in the reform phas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{modes of}} <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> of {{research}} and development are examined: namely indirect tax incentives and direct subsidies to private sector firms carrying out R&D. As well as considering the arguments concerning claimed advantages and disadvantages of these policy instruments, attention is paid to international experience of the effectiveness of each approach. In particular, insights are gained from a review of empirical studies of input-additionality, i. e. when public R&D spending leads to an increase of private investment. A macro-level study from the OECD presents a suitable state-of-the-art approach for comparing additionality generated by the two kinds of <b>funding</b> <b>instruments.</b> Additionality is implied in both cases, 70 percent for direct grants etc. and 32 percent for the indirect effects of tax incentives. Using these estimates the worth of long-term extra spending in Austria is around EUR 120 m for direct, and EUR 100 m for indirect R&D support. ...|$|R

40|$|Mutual support between State and Science {{developed}} constantly through modernity. In {{spite of}} the ambivalent of the citizens towards scientific activities, political support to research has grown in the recent years, even in periods of budgetary constrains, with a strong competitive stance. This is true for most European countries and particularly in Wallonia (the French speaking part of Belgium). This book presents the current patterns {{of change in the}} organisation of research and particularly an overview of the new funding schemas proposed by the authorities. The analysis of the mode of governance in the science policy regime is drawn "from below", with a reference to the actors, what they say and what they do when they refer to the <b>public</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>funding</b> their research. The actors considered are not only researchers but also public actors, industry and public servants. In this approach "Science" is not considered as a stable concept, but as a set of institutions, values, norms and practices, which at a given moment of history contribute to delineate what makes science [...] and what does not.

Concerning the overall effects of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> in Finland we can draw quite positive conclusions based on our empirical analysis: First, on average, <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases the private innovation effort of funded firms, in both nominal and real terms.

40|$|Funding {{of parties}} is common and {{controversial}} in new democracies. Nonetheless, the nascent literature {{about the effects}} of money in new party systems largely sidesteps the issue of <b>public</b> <b>funding.</b> This article seeks to begin filling this theoretical and empirical void. Two hypotheses are formulated about the expected effects of introduction and marginal increases in <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> on institutionalization of the party system. The hypotheses are then tested in a statistical study of all new democracies in Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and other former Soviet Republics. The results show strong support for the idea that <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases institutionalization of new party systems. This is in stark contrast to theories about more established democracies that hold introduction of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> decreases institutionalization of the party system. Furthermore, the results suggest that differing thresholds to <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> have divergent effects on political institutionalization, but this effect is not necessarily linear...|$|R
