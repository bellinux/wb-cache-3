25|$|In {{the nuclear}} power plants called {{pressurized}} water reactors, special large heat exchangers pass heat from the <b>primary</b> (<b>reactor</b> plant) system to the secondary (steam plant) system, producing steam from water in the process. These are called steam generators. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants using steam-driven turbines have surface condensers to convert the exhaust steam from the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.|$|E
25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.|$|E
25|$|The second easiest {{reaction}} is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium {{is commonly used}} by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this {{reaction is}} aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency against 80–90% theoretical efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The acidophilic archaea Sulfolobus metallicus and Metallosphaera sedula can {{tolerate}} up to 4% of copper {{and have been}} exploited for mineral biomining. Between 40 and 60% copper extraction was achieved in <b>primary</b> <b>reactors</b> and more than 90% extraction in secondary reactors with overall residence times of about 6 days. All of these microbes are gaining energy by oxidizing these metals. Oxidation means {{increasing the number of}} bonds between an atom to oxygen. Microbes will oxidize sulfur. The resulting electrons will reduce iron, releasing energy that can be used by the cell.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} of thermophilic sulfide-oxidizing archaea in copper extraction has attracted interest {{due to the}} efficient extraction of metals from sulfide ores that are recalcitrant to dissolution. Microbial leaching is especially useful for copper ores because copper sulfate, as formed during the oxidation of copper sulfide ores, is very water-soluble. Approximately 25% of all copper mined worldwide is now obtained from leaching processes. The acidophilic archaea Sulfolobus metallicus and Metallosphaera sedula tolerate up to 4% of copper and have been exploited for mineral biomining. Between 40 and 60% copper extraction was achieved in <b>primary</b> <b>reactors</b> and more than 90% extraction in secondary reactors with overall residence times of about 6 days.|$|R

25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E
500|$|In , the {{destruction}} of the top of the Citadel has caused its <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> to begin to melt down, forcing Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the Citadel to temporarily stabilize it while the city's inhabitants are evacuated. The Combine, however, attempt to accelerate the meltdown {{to send a message to}} their native universe for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the data to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel sends the message and detonates, destroying City 17.|$|E

[...] In a nuclear reactor called a boiling water reactor (BWR), water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators.|$|E
25|$|A {{molten salt}} reactor (MSR) is {{a class of}} {{generation}} IV nuclear fission reactor in which the <b>primary</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.|$|R

2500|$|A primary {{characteristic}} of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized pressure vessel. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating {{the water with}} submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer {{is connected to the}} <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer [...] "bubble" [...] provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.|$|E
2500|$|Reactivity {{adjustment}} to maintain 100% power as the fuel is burned up in most commercial PWRs is normally achieved by varying {{the concentration of}} boric acid dissolved in the <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant. Boron readily absorbs neutrons and increasing or decreasing its concentration in the reactor coolant will therefore affect the neutron activity correspondingly. An entire control system involving high pressure pumps (usually called the charging and letdown system) is required to remove water from the high pressure primary loop and re-inject the water back in with differing concentrations of boric acid. The reactor control rods, inserted through the reactor vessel head directly into the fuel bundles, are moved for the following reasons: ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{specially}} constructed {{tanks were}} used. The first one, {{based on the}} abandoned plant's <b>primary</b> <b>reactor</b> containment vessel, held [...] of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, {{it was the largest}} fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held [...] of water. As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill. The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column {{at the bottom of the}} large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{containment}} vessel — which housed both the <b>primary</b> (nuclear <b>reactor)</b> and secondary (steam plant) systems — {{is referred to}} as the [...] "DIG-ball" [...] due to its unique shape: a Horton Sphere. The sphere was originally constructed by Chicago Bridge and Iron Works to house the liquid metal cooled reactor of the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), with the dome designed to contain a liquid sodium explosion.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} recycle and reuse process {{water is a}} major {{contributing}} factor toward increased sustainability in the mining industry. However, the presence of toxic compounds has prevented this in most bioleaching operations. The ASTERTM process {{has been used for}} the bioremediation of cyanide (CN) and thiocyanate (SCN−) containing effluents at demonstration and commercial scale, increasing the potential for recycling of the treated effluent. The process relies on a complex consortium of microorganisms and laboratory tests have shown that the biomass retention, in suspended flocs or attached biofilm, significantly improved SCN− degradation rates. The current research evaluated the process performance in the presence of suspended solids (up to 5. 5 % m/v) ahead of implementation at a site where complete tailings removal is not possible. Experiments were performed in four 1 l CSTRs (with three <b>primary</b> <b>reactors</b> in parallel at an 8 h residence time, feeding one secondary reactor at a 2. 7 h residence time).

[...] The Fukushima prefectural government reported radiation dose rates at the plant reaching 1.015 mSv/h. The IAEA stated on 13 March that four workers had been injured by the explosion at the Unit 1 reactor, and that three injuries were reported in other incidents at the site. They also reported one worker was exposed to higher-than-normal radiation levels but the level fell below their guidance for emergency situations.|$|R
50|$|Influent {{entry is}} from above the filter media.
