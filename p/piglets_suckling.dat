The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the efficacy of teat sanitation in lactating sows in order to reduce the piglet bacterial invasion through contaminated teats leading to outbreaks of enteric diseases. The study was carried out in a farrowing pen with 60 sows divided into three groups of 20 animals. Group 1 animals served as the control group and were left untreated. In group 2, sow teats were treated with water and in group 3 with a commercial antiseptic with potent bactericidal action. Microbiological purity of the teats was determined during 24 days of the <b>piglet</b> <b>suckling</b> period. Study results showed the bacterial count per teat to be significantly lower in both experimental groups as compared with the control group (p< 0. 01). Also, bacterial count was significantly lower in group 3 treated with the antiseptic than in group 2 treated with water alone (p< 0. 01). Accordingly, sow teat sanitation is a potential prophylactic measure during the <b>piglet</b> <b>suckling</b> period as it significantly decreased bacterial count on sow teats, thus reducing the risk of bacterial invasion of the piglet alimentary system.

40|$|<b>Piglets</b> <b>suckled</b> by dams {{that had}} been vaccinated with K 88 antigen were {{significantly}} more resistant to deaths caused by neonatal diarrhea after challenge with a large dose of a K 88 -positive enteropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli than <b>piglets</b> <b>suckled</b> by control dams. The factors {{most likely to be}} involved in protection of the piglets were investigated by comparing the antibacterial activities of serum and mammary secretions from the two groups of dams. Vaccination stimulated the production of K 88 antibodies, which were associated with anti-adhesive activity directed against the adhesive properties of the K 88 antigen, and of O 8 antibodies; the latter antibodies were attributed to traces of O 8 antigen in the vaccine. Neutralizing activity against heat-labile enterotoxin was present in several dams before vaccination but was not stimulated by bacteriostatic activities were similar in serum and mammary secretions from both groups of dams and appeared to play no significant role in the protective after parturition were atrributed to exposure of the dams to the challenge strain excreted by the piglets. It was concluded that neutralization of the adhesive properties of K 88 antigen by K 88 antibodies in colostrum and in milk contributed significantly to the protection of piglets from vaccinated dams. However, the contribution of antibacterial activities associated with the greater levels of O 8 antibodies in colstrum from the vaccinated group cannot be entirely excluded...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether pregnant sows could be actively immunized against A. suum through repeated oral doses of ascarid eggs, or if at a maturity swine have been naturally immunized through repeated exposure to eggs. A comparison was made between passive immunity to A. suum acquired by: <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> naturally (farm) infected and experimentally immunized against A. suum; <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> a sow naturally (farm) infected; and piglets which were hysterectomy-derived and colostrum-deprived. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis was applied to sera of sows to determine changes in gamma globulin concentrations. These samples were taken at weekly intervals during immunization. Cellulose acetate electro-phoresis was also applied to colostral and milk wheys to determine if there was a difference between immunized sows and the nonimmunized sow. Piglets serum patterns were determined to compare differences in per cent gamma globulin and gamma concentrations. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis were applied to whey globulins using various saline extracts of adult worms and larval stages as antigens. Crude, semipurified and purified enzymes from both adult and larval stages of A. suum were tested for inhibition by antibodies in serum, colostral and milk wheysof two immunized sows and one nonimmunized sow. Three sows of the Yorkshire breed were used in this study. These animals were raised under farm conditions where piglets were kept with their dams until five weeks of age. At weaning, piglets were put into pens and fed ad libitum until weighing approximately 200 pounds. Sows were limit fed during breeding and gestation. Exposure to A. suum was highly probable under such conditions. Therefore, fecal flotation for identification of worm eggs was prepared for each sow at the time of isolation at these facilities. Several conclusions were made from this study among them was that results of challenging piglets with infective larvae of A. suum and enzyme inhibition analyses of this study suggest that all sows had specific antibodies to A. suum in colostrum and milk.

40|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) {{has been}} {{detected}} in the milk of various species, including the pig (1). It may {{play a significant role}} in postnatal adaptation of the gut in the suckling neonate (2). This study investigated whether TGF-β receptors exist in the gut of newborn pigs, and whether there are any developmental changes in the receptor expression during the postnatal period. Gastrointestinal tissue samples were collected from newborn unsuckled <b>piglets</b> and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> of different ages. The localization and quantification of TGF-β receptors along the gastrointestinal tract were performed by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses. In newborn unsuckled piglets, TGF-β receptors were widely distributed along the gastrointestinal tract (Figure). In the small intestine, TGF-β receptors I and II were predominantly localized on the apical membrane of the villus epithelium, while TGF-β receptor III was predominantly localized in the crypts. The mucus glands in the esophagus and the Brunner’s glands in the duodenum were strongly stained with receptor III antibody. Scattered mucosal lymphocytes located in lamina propria and in Peyer’s patches were also stained positively. In <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> there was a transient decline in the density of TGF-β receptors I and II in the intestinal mucosa.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{influence}} of maternal exposure to Ascaris suum on worm burden distributions in experimentally infected piglets. In the first study, sows were inoculated before and during gestation (6 months, long-term exposure) with 10000 A. suum eggs twice weekly. In a second study, sows were inoculated during gestation only (3 months, short-term exposure) with increasing doses of eggs (10 000 - 40 000 eggs twice weekly). Helminth-naive sows served as controls in both studies. The third study used the same design as the short-term exposure study, but piglets from exposed and control sows were cross-suckled within 4 h of birth before colostrum uptake. All piglets were inoculated 2 or 3 times with 50 A. suum eggs on days 4 and 7 (and 14) after birth, and left with the sows. At 10 weeks of age all piglets were necropsied, and liver lesions and worm burdens were recorded. Surprisingly, in piglets born to long-term exposed sows, the prevalence of A. suum infection and the mean worm burden were significantly higher than those in piglets from control sows. In contrast, neither worm burdens nor prevalence were significantly different between piglets from short-term exposed sows compared with their controls. In the cross-suckling experiment, 67 % of <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> control sows harboured worms at slaughter, compared with 15 % of <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> exposed sows. Maximum likelihood analysis of worm burden distribution and the degree of parasite aggregation showed 3 distinctly different types of overdispersed distributions: worm counts in piglets from control sows, in piglets from short-term exposed sows and in piglets from long-term exposed sows. When the worm burden data were analysed including the cross-suckled piglets by biological mother, it appeared that the control and short-term distributions converged and that only the long-term exposure was significantly different. Overall, the degree of parasite aggregation in piglets infected with A. suum decreased with exposure of the sows. A non-linear relationship was observed between prevalence of infection and mean worm burden, which was different for piglets from exposed and control sows, and similar to relationships of this type that previously have been found in human A. lumbricoides infections. It was concluded that in porcine, 4. suum infections maternal exposure alters the distribution of worms in their offspring, in which the duration of exposure appeared to be an important influence. The results of the cross-suckling further suggest that maternal factors, e. g. antibodies, are transferred via colostrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether intermittent suckling (IS) combined with an extended lactation can reduce postweaning growth check in pigs. Three weaning regimens [conventional weaning (CW), IS with 6 -h separation intervals (IS 6), and IS with 12 -h separation intervals (IS 12) ] were compared. In CW (n = 17 litters), litters had continuous access to the sow until weaning (d 21, d 0 = farrowing). In IS 6 and IS 12, litters were separated from the sow for 12 h/d, beginning at d 14 and lasting until weaning (d 41 to 45). Litters were with the sow from 1400 to 2000 and from 0200 to 0800 (IS 6, n = 14) or between 2000 and 0800 (IS 12, n = 14). Litter size was standardized within 2 d after farrowing by crossfostering, resulting in an average litter size of 10. 9 +/- 1. 8 piglets. Piglets had ad libitum access to creep feed from d 7 onward. One week after the onset of IS (d 20), creep feed intake was increased in litters from both IS groups compared with CW litters (P < 0. 05). Both IS groups consumed considerable amounts of creep feed before weaning (d 41 to 45). Total feed intake before weaning was greater (P = 0. 004) in IS 12 (3, 808 +/- 469 g/ piglet) than in IS 6 (2, 717 +/- 404 g/ piglet). In comparison, CW litters consumed 18 +/- 9 g/ piglet before weaning (d 21). Irrespective of weaning regimen, total feed intake of litters before weaning was highly correlated with postweaning feed intake (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, in all treatment groups, total preweaning feed intake was correlated with postweaning growth (P < 0. 10). Irrespective of treatment, <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> anterior teats grew faster than <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> middle or posterior teats during the first 2 wk of lactation. Body weights at the end of the experiment (d 55) were similar among weaning regimens. Onset of IS induced a growth check in both IS groups (34 % for IS 12 and 22 % for IS 6). Only a mild growth check was observed after weaning of IS litters (14 % for both IS groups). However, a serious growth check (98 %) was observed after weaning of CW litters. Results of the current study indicate that IS stimulated feed intake during lactation, providing a more gradual transition to weaning. Because the IS 6 regimen did not prevent the growth check after the onset of IS and is rather laborious, we suggest that IS 12 might be preferable for a practical implementation of IS...|$|E
40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize the behaviors and the body weight of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> in different social environments. Methods Two groups of sows and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> housed either in individual farrowing crates in separate pens (1. 8 × 2. 4 m, the control group) or in groups of three sows with their piglets in farrowing crates in a large common enclosure (5. 4 × 2. 2 m, the treatment group) were observed with the aid of video technology for 9 consecutive hours on days 1, 2, and 3, after mixing. Results Suckling, agonistic, and elimination behaviors of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> were significantly higher in the control group than in the treatment group. Inactive behavior was higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Most {{of the effects of the}} social environment on the <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> seem to be the result of large reductions in behaviors and body weight for piglets switching from high activity to low activity. Moreover, suckling behavior and birth body weight were highly correlated with body weight at the end of the test. Conclusion The social environment that resulted from mixing, thus, had significant effects on the behavior and body weight of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> and behavioral characteristics, therefore, should be considered when making improvements to the husbandry and care methods used in swine production...|$|R

The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate the development of muscle IL- 15 expression in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> and in early weaning piglets (day 14) at each level, that is, mRNA, protein, and secretion. Eight litters (eight piglets per litter) of newborn healthy piglets (Large × White × Landrace) with a similar initial weight (1618. 0  ±  140. 1 g) were chosen and divided into two groups. Group one used <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> that were killed, respectively, at days 1, 7, 14, 21, and group two used early (day 14) weaning piglets that were killed respectively, at days 15, 17, 19, 21. In group one, IL- 15 gene expression levels increased significantly (P    0. 05) among piglets at other ages. These findings indicated that increased IL- 15 mRNA expression did not result in a corresponding increase of its protein expression. In group two, which used early weaning piglets from days 15 – 19, IL- 15 mRNA and protein expression levels increased constantly (P    0. 05) compared with <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 14 of age. However, IL- 15 protein expression levels in early weaning piglets at day 21 of age dropped significantly (P <  0. 05) to the levels as <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 21 of age, while body weight increased (P <  0. 05) markedly to the levels as <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 21 of age. In both groups, the serum IL- 15 levels of piglets decreased significantly (P <  0. 01) over time.

A total of 299 multiparous (MP; parity 2. 5 ± 0. 03) and 303 primiparous (PP) sows of Large White × Duroc × Landrace genetics were individually housed in conventional farrowing crates from 1 wk before expected farrowing until weaning on Day 30. 7 ± 0. 05 postparturition. Before shed entry, sows were allocated randomly within parity to receive either boar exposure (BE; n = 454) or no BE (No BE; n = 149). Sows assigned to receive BE were then allocated to 1 of 2 litter size treatments: litter size unchanged (BE; n = 302) or BE and the litter permanently reduced (split weaned) to 7 piglets (BESPW 7; n = 152) on Day 18 of lactation. From Day 18 of lactation until weaning, sows in both BE treatments were taken daily to a detection mating area where they received 15 min of full physical BE and were artificially inseminated at the first observed estrus. Providing sows with BE increased the incidence of lactation estrus, with a further increase observed when litter size was reduced to 7 piglets (16 % No BE vs. 62 % BE and 75 % BESPW 7; P < 0. 05). Multiparous sows exhibited a greater incidence of lactation estrus than PP sows irrespective of treatment (81 compared to 52 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). Both MP and PP sows exhibited an increased incidence of lactation estrus when {{a portion of the}} litter was removed (MP: 76 vs. 89 % and PP: 47 vs. 61 %; P < 0. 05). Farrowing rates were higher in BE MP sows mated postweaning and all BESPW 7 sows mated postweaning when compared to their counterparts mated in lactation (P < 0. 05). Percentage live weight loss over the course of lactation was greatest for sows in the No BE compared to the BE and BESPW 7 treatments (7. 7 % ± 0. 5 vs. 5. 4 % ± 0. 3 and 4. 5 % ± 0. 4, respectively; P < 0. 05).

The main objective of the experiment was therefore to investigate fatty acid composition of tissues from sows at the end of gestation and from piglets during the first week of postnatal life in response to maternal dietary linseed oil intake. Sows received either a lard (LAR) -based diet or a linseed oil (LSO) -based diet during gestation and lactation. Fatty acid composition was evaluated in sow plasma, placenta and milk, and in different tissues of piglets on days 0, 3, 7, 21 and 32. The LSO diet increased the proportions of n- 3 PUFA and especially 22 : 6 n- 3 in the placenta. The carcass of LSO piglets at birth contained greater proportions of 20 : 5 n- 3, 22 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3.

40|$|Background: Crossfostering is the {{transference}} of piglets {{to either}} equalize litter size or to formation of homogeneous litters {{according to the}} birth weight. It is used {{in order to improve}} survival rate and weight gain of piglets during lactation. Several aspects influence the results of crossfostering, as the moment when this management is performed, size of the piglets and parity order (PO) of biological and adoptive dams. Crossfostering should be performed, preferably between six and 24 h after farrowing, before teat order has been established and so that piglets can absorb the maximum of colostrum immunoglobulins from their biological dams. Performance and viability of piglets during lactation depends on the quality of colostrum and milk production of biological and adoptive dam, which varies according to PO. The aim of the experiment was to assess the performance of biological and adopted piglets crossfostered in PO 1 and PO 5 females. Materials, Methods & Results: Thirty females (18 PO 1 and 12 PO 5 females), of Agroceres PIC® genetic, from a Piglet Production Unit, were used for this experiment. Piglets were crossfostered within eight to 24 h after farrowing. Litters were formed with 11 piglets each, with 1. 2 to 1. 6 kg at birth. Piglets were individually earmarked at the time they were crossfostered. In PO 1 sows 50 % of their original piglets remained and 50 % of piglets were adopted from PO 5 sows. Similarly, PO 5 sows kept 50 % of their piglets and received 50 % of adopted piglets from PO 1 sows. For the statistical analysis, four groups were taken into account as followed: PO 1 B 1 - <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> in their original PO 1 dam; PO 1 A 5 - piglets coming from PO 5 sows but adopted by PO 1 sows; PO 5 B 5 - <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> in their original PO 5 dam, and PO 5 A 1 - piglets coming from PO 1 sows but adopted by PO 5 sows. Piglets were weighed at seven, 14 and 18 days old. Discussion: The mortality rate until 18 days of lactation was 0. 9 % and was similar among groups (P > 0. 05). Within the same PO there was no difference (P > 0. 05) in weight among biological and adopted piglets (2. 53 vs. 2. 56, 4. 07 vs. 4. 08, 5. 05 vs. 5. 06 for litters of PO 1 sows and 2. 84 vs. 2. 82, 4. 80 vs. 4. 78, 5. 90 vs. 6. 05 for litters of PO 5 sows, at days seven, 14 and 18, respectively). Piglets nursed by PO 5 sows showed higher weight (P < 0. 05) than those nursed by PO 1 sows, regardless of being biological or adopted. Crossfostering performed in the period considered ideal, health status of farm and care given to piglets during lactation may have contributed to that mortality rate was extremely low in all groups. Performance and viability of piglets during lactation is dependent on the quality of colostrum and milk production of both adoptive and biological dams. Litters nursed by sows of higher PO may have immunity for a greater number of antigens and less chance of compromising their performance. Increased milk and colostrum production can provide to piglets a major input of nutrients and therefore better performance, which was observable in litters of PO 5 sows. When nursed by dams of the same PO, the performance of biological and adopted piglets was not affected by crossfostering when it was performed eight to 24 h after farrowing. There was a lower performance of piglets nursed by PO 1 sows compared to PO 5 sows, regardless of being biological or adopted...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDiagnostic Medicine/PathobiologySteven S. DritzThe {{overall goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to evaluate the effects of different amino acid (AA) levels on performance of pigs under commercial conditions. To reach this objective, a total of 12 experiments were conducted. For the sow research, 1, 102 highly prolific sows {{were used to determine}} the effects of AA and energy intake during late gestation on piglet birth weight and reproductive performance of sows. Weight gain depended on the energy and AA intake levels while sows fed increased amount of energy had increased stillborn rate; however, there was no statistical differences due to energy intake in stillborn rate of gilts. The modest increase in individual piglet birth weight is due to energy rather than AA intake during late gestation. Pre-weaning mortality was reduced in <b>piglets</b> <b>suckling</b> from sows fed high AA diets during late gestation while subsequent reproductive performance was not affected. With recent advances in statistical computing capability, linear and non-linear mixed models were refined to estimate the AA ratio dose-response relationships. Then, 4 experiments using 2, 420 wean-to-finish pigs were conducted to validate the methods for estimating the standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA to lysine (AA:Lys) ratio requirement. Subsequently, 7 experiments using 7, 562 pigs were conducted to estimate the SID tryptophan (Trp) to Lys and Valine (Val) to Lys ratio requirements of wean-to-finish pigs. In 11 - to 20 -kg pigs, optimum SID Trp:Lys ranged from 16. 6 % for maximum mean G:F to 21. 2 % for ADG. In 30 - to 125 -kg pigs, optimum SID Trp:Lys ratio ranged from 16. 9 % for maximum mean G:F to 23. 5 % for ADG. However, 18 % SID Trp:Lys captured 96 and 100 % of the maximum mean ADG and G:F for finishing pigs, respectively. In 25 - to 45 -kg pigs, optimum SID Val:Lys ratio ranged from 72. 3 % for maximum mean G:F to 74. 4 % for ADG with 99 % of the maximum mean ADG and G:F at approximately 69 % and 65 % SID Val:Lys ratio, respectively. In conclusion, optimum SID Trp:Lys and Val:Lys were consistently higher for ADG than G:F. This finding is critical for conducting economic evaluations and reference tables such as NRC (2012) should consider presenting requirement values for different response criteria...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptome {{analyses}} were conducted on the ileal mucosa of 14 - 35 day-old piglets to investigate postnatal gut development during suckling and post-weaning. The transcriptome profiles of 14 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> showed a considerably higher number of differentially expressed genes than did those of 21, 28 and 35 day olds, indicating an intensive gut development during the first 14 - 21 postnatal days. In addition, the analysis of biological pathways indicated that Chemotaxis Leucocyte chemotaxis was the most significantly affected pathway in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> between 14 and 21 days of age. Weaning negatively affected pathways associated with acquired immunity, but positively affected those associated with innate immunity. Interestingly, pathway Chemotaxis Leucocyte chemotaxis was found positively affected when comparing 14 and 21 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> but negatively affected in 28 day-old piglets weaned at 21 days of age, when compared with 28 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> Genes CXCL 13, SLA-DOA (MHC class II), ICAM 1, VAV 1 and VCAM 1 {{were involved in the}} pathway Chemotaxis Leukocyte chemotaxis and they were found to significantly change between 14 and 21 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> and between groups of <b>suckling</b> and weaned <b>piglets.</b> The expression of these genes significantly declined after weaning at 14, 21 and 28 days of age. This decline indicated that CXCL 13, SLA-DOA, ICAM 1, VAV 1 and VCAM 1 may be involved in the development of Peyer’s patches because lower gene expression clearly corresponded with smaller areas of Peyer’s patches in the ileal mucosa of piglets. Moreover, weaning piglets prior to a period of intensive gut development i. e., 14 days of age, caused significant adverse effects on the size of Peyer’s patches, which were not reverted even 14 days post-weaning...|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} the {{postnatal}} development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in mammals is influenced by dietary and hormonal factors. It was hypothesized that accelerated GI cell turnover during maturation {{would result in a}} precoucios conversion to more mature digestive functions. Thus, it was investigated if red kidney bean lectin, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) - a potent gut mitogen in adult rats - could accelerate the growth and maturation of the digestive system in suckling rats and <b>piglets.</b> <b>Suckling</b> rats and piglets were dosed with PHA either via enteral or parenteral administration for up to three consecutive days prior to natural weaning. The binding of PHA to the GI tract and extra-intestinal organs, GI organ growth, intestinal morphology and proliferation, disaccharidase activity pattern, and macromolecular absorption capacity were studied, as well as the pancreatic enzyme contents. Changes in these parameters were considered to be markers for maturation or development towards an adult-like GI function. Furthermore, the plasma levels of corticosterone and insulin (rat), and cholecystokinin (pig), were investigated. It was concluded that preweaning enteral exposure to PHA in suckling rats accelerated growth and induced precocious functional maturation of the GI tract and the pancreas. Similar results were also achieved when a crude PHA preparation was fed to suckling piglets. PHA treatment induced irreversible changes of the gut resembling those occurring at natural weaning, such as a reduced macromolecular absorption (intestinal closure), altered disaccharidase expression towards an adult-like activity pattern, and enhanced pancreas function. The ability of PHA to induce GI functional maturation in rats was age-dependent. Also, a direct binding and interaction of PHA with the GI epithelium was found to be a prerequisite to induce functional maturation, since parenteral administration had little effect. Shortly after administration, the binding of PHA to the intestinal epithelium temporarily caused mucosal disarrangement and functional impediment of the GI tract, probably resulting in the release of hormones and inflammatory cytokines. During a later phase, this led to a stimulatory response of the GI tract, as seen by an increase in crypt cell proliferation, gut growth, and the emergence of more adult-like enterocytes. Taking into consideration the temporal differences between rats and piglets with respect to natural maturational events, it was suggested that PHA exerted gut maturing effects in piglets and probably also in other mammals. Thus, these findings might lead {{to a better understanding of}} the role of the diet in GI functional maturation...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible {{gastroenteritis}} coronavirus (TGEV) is a porcine pathogen causing enteric {{infections that}} are lethal for <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> The enterotropism of TGEV {{is connected with}} the sialic acid binding activity of the viral surface protein S.

Virus binding assays with cryosections of the small intestine from a <b>suckling</b> <b>piglet</b> revealed the binding of TGEV to mucin-producing goblet cells. A nonenteropathogenic mutant virus that lacked a sialic acid binding activity was unable to bind to MGP and to attach to goblet cells.

40|$|Piglets {{establish}} a relatively stable teat order {{after the first}} week of lactation, when each piglet chooses a preferred teat or teat pair where they tend to suckle permanently. The mechanism underlying the choice that leads each piglet to the same suckling position is still not clarified. In the present case study, piglets with different preferred suckling positions (anterior, posterior) were transferred to a foster sow after completion of the regular 4 weeks of lactation by their biological mother. For both sows, which were identical based on parity, litter size and farrowing date, we examined the suckling positions of the experimental piglets. Piglets occupied exactly the same suckling positions on both sows. Thus, piglets precisely track positions on the mammary complex of a sows udder even when previously learned discriminable stimuli have been changed, such as odours, tastes, morphologies (of sows udder or the sow itself), vocalizations, and neighbouring littermates. Our observation indicates that the spatial configuration of the mammary complex, which is determined by two parallel rows of teats arranged in pairs, can hypothetically be proposed as an important cue for <b>piglet</b> <b>suckling</b> orientation. Therefore, additional attention should be given to th...|$|R

Here, we investigated the effect of dietary fibres on the abundance, composition, and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> Piglets were fed a control diet or creep feeds containing alfalfa, wheat bran, or pure cellulose, respectively, from postnatal day 7 to 22. Large intestinal digesta and mucosa samples were collected for quantitative analysis of bacterial group-specific 16 S ribosomal RNA- and butyrate production-related genes, and digesta samples for quantification of short-chain fatty acids. The alfalfa diet increased (P 0. 05), compared to other groups. In the distal colonic mucosa, the cellulose diet increased (P < 0. 05) the abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa and copies of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene compared to the alfalfa diet. These results indicated that dietary fibres modulate the abundance and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in the large intestine of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> and that a moderate supplementation of alfalfa and cellulose may benefit early-life gut health through the delivery of butyrate to the mucosa...|$|R
40|$|The organic <b>piglet</b> <b>suckling</b> period {{typically}} {{takes about}} 6 weeks {{due to the}} minimum requirement of the EEC Regulation 2092 / 91 of 40 days. But piglets weaned in such a period are often characterized by inferior performance and health status. It is {{the aim of the}} present study to examine whether a prolonged suckling period of 63 days results in better performance and health status of the piglets. Therefore 36 sows were divided into 2 groups of 18 sows each as a control group with 42 days suckling period and a test group with 63 days suckling period. The rearing period for both the control group and the test group ended on day 77 p. n., which was also the end of the piglets´ data collection period. Three farrowing cycles with 108 litters were recorded. The extended suckling period resulted in an improved growth rate and in a reduced number of medically treated piglets and did not negatively affect the body condition and teats of the sows. Hence a prolongation of the suckling period compared to the minimum requirement of the EEC Regulation 2092 / 91 seems to be advisable...|$|R
