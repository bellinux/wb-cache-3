5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a {{commission}} to investigate the case.

5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case.</b> This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case</b> of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case,</b> or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK.

25|$|A 1972 {{report by}} the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) noted that {{both sides in the}} {{conflict}} accused each other of perpetrating genocide. The report observed that {{it may be difficult to}} substantiate claims that the 'whole of the military action and repressive measures taken by the Pakistani Army and their auxiliary forces constituted genocide' that was intended to destroy the Bengali people in whole or in part, and that 'preventing a nation from attaining political autonomy does not constitute genocide: the intention must be to destroy in whole or in part the people as such'. The difficulty of proving intent was considered to be further complicated by the fact that three specific sections of the Bengali people were targeted in killings committed by the Pakistani Army and their collaborators: members of the Awami League, students, and East Pakistani citizens of the Hindu religion. The report observed, however, that there is a strong <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case</b> that particular acts of genocide were committed, especially towards the end of the war, when Bengalis were targeted indiscriminately. Similarly, it was felt that there is a strong <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case</b> that crimes of genocide were committed against the Hindu population of East Pakistan.|$|E
40|$|Debate {{continues}} {{over the}} acts/omissions doctrine, {{and over the}} concepts of duty and charity. Such issues inform {{the debate over the}} moral permissibility of euthanasia. Recent papers have emphasised moral sensitivity, medical intuitions, and sub-standard palliative care as some of the factors which should persuade us to regard euthanasia as morally unacceptable. I argue that these lines of argument are conceptually misdirected and have no bearing on the bare permissibility of voluntary euthanasia. Further, some of the familiar slippery slope arguments against voluntary euthanasia compromise the principle of autonomy to which both supporters and opponents of euthanasia adhere. I discuss a model for doctor/patient relationships which can be applied to cases which would be seen by all disputants as strong <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>cases</b> for euthanasia.

40|$|We {{claim that}} the stock market {{encourages}} business creation, innovation, and growth by allowing the recycling of ‘informed capital’. Due to incentive and information problems, start-ups face larger costs of going public than mature firms. Sustaining a tight relationship with a monitor (bank, venture capitalist) allows them to postpone their going public decision until profitability prospects are clearer or incentive problems are less severe. However, the earlier young firms go public, the quicker monitors’ informed capital is redirected towards new start-ups. Hence, when informed capital is in limited supply, factors that accelerate firms’ access to the stock market encourage business creation. Technological spill-overs associated with business creation and thick market externalities in the young firms segment of the stock market provide <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>cases</b> for encouraging young firms to go public. going public; growth; start-ups; venture capital...|$|R

(There had been other alleged attacks by Ananda Marga, namely on 15 September 1977 the military attaché at the Indian Embassy, Colonel Singh and his wife, were attacked in Canberra.

40|$|From Darwin’s {{study of}} the Galapagos and Wallace’s study of Indonesia, islands have played an {{important}} role in evolutionary investigations, and radiations within archipelagos are readily interpreted as supporting the conventional view of allopatric speciation. Even during the ongoing paradigm shift towards other modes of speciation, island radiations, such as the Lesser Antillean anoles, are thought to exemplify this process. Geological and molecular phylogenetic evidence show that, in this archipelago, Martinique anoles provide several examples of secondary contact of island species. Four precursor island species, with up to 8 mybp divergence, met when their islands coalesced to form the current island of Martinique. Moreover, adjacent anole populations also show marked adaptation to distinct habitat zonation, allowing both allopatric and ecological speciation to be tested in this system. We take advantage of this opportunity of replicated island coalescence and independent ecological adaptation to carry out an extensive population genetic study of hypervariable neutral nuclear markers to show that even after these very substantial periods of spatial isolation these putative allospecies show less reproductive isolation than conspecific populations in adjacent habitats in all three cases of subsequent island coalescence. The degree of genetic interchange shows that while there is always a significant genetic signature of past allopatry, and this may be quite strong if the selection regime allows, there is no case of complete allopatric speciation, in spite of the strong <b>primae</b> <b>facie</b> <b>case</b> for it.

40|$|Does {{political}} decision-making require experts or can {{a democracy}} {{be trusted to}} make correct decisions? This question has a long-standing tradition in political philosophy, going {{back at least to}} Plato’s Republic. Critics of democracy tend to argue that democracy cannot be trusted in this way while advocates tend to argue that it can.

In recent political philosophy, epistemic democrats have embraced this instrumentalist way of thinking about democracy.

In {{the first part of this}} paper I show that by using the notion of content I have developed elsewhere Friedman's formal account can be rendered immune to Kitcher's counter-examples.
