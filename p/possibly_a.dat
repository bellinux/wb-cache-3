5|$|Roman remains, <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> {{signal station}} or watchtower, have been {{identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey.

In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items {{have been identified}} including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and <b>possibly</b> <b>a</b> bath house.
