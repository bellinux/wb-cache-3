5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E

50|$|Steven M. Rainey is Lockheed Martin's chief F-22 {{test pilot}} {{and a former}} United States Air Force officer. He is noted {{for a number of}} {{achievements}} while flight testing the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. He was the first USAF <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly the aircraft, the first <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> perform aerial refueling in the F-22, and the first <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly cross-country in the Raptor.|$|R
5|$|After {{a year of}} {{developmental}} testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> the B-29. Tibbets taught two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> reach his high standards.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, a glider pilot license {{allows the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly {{unpowered}} gliders, self-launching motor gliders (including motor gliders and gliders with retractable engines or propellers), and sustainer motor gliders. An instructor must provide instruction and sign the logbook of the <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> authorize the <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> carry passengers. In Canada, motor gliders {{are classified as}} gliders, and may be operated by a glider pilot without the medical certificate required to operate an airplane.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his other}} {{achievements}} Macmillan {{was the first}} <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly from London to Sweden in a day; a prizewinner at the first International Light Aeroplane meeting; {{and was the first}} British <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly across the Andes.|$|R
5|$|CAP {{performs}} several {{missions that}} are not combat-related {{in support of the}} United States Air Force, including damage assessment, transportation of officials, communications support and low-altitude route surveys. The CAP fleet is used in training exercises to prepare USAF <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> intercept enemy aircraft over the Continental United States. Civil Air Patrol aircraft are flown into restricted airspace, where United States Air Force pilots may practice high-speed intercepts.|$|E
5|$|Colonel James Philo Hagerstrom (January 14, 1921 – June 25, 1994) was {{a fighter}} pilot and flying ace of the United States Army Air Forces in World War II and the United States Air Force in the Korean War.

5|$|Cresswell was {{responsible}} for converting <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> jet fighters as commanding officer of No.2 Operational Training Unit in Australia from 1953 until 1956. He resigned from the RAAF the following year, and flew with Bobby Gibbes' Sepik Airways in New Guinea before joining deHavilland Australia in 1959. Initially engaged by the company as a pilot, he later became a salesman. Cresswell resigned from deHavilland in 1974, but maintained his connection with military aviation, including No.77 Squadron. He died in December 2006, aged eighty-six.|$|E
50|$|Feliksas Vaitkus was {{the only}} <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly across the North Atlantic in 1935, {{and even though he}} landed in Ireland and not in Kaunas, he was entered in aviation’s history books for being the sixth <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> fly solo across the Atlantic.|$|R
2500|$|The 1977 {{model year}} was the last for the Cessna 150. It added only [...] "pre-select" [...] flaps, {{allowing}} the <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> set the flaps to any position without the <b>pilot</b> having <b>to</b> hold the switch during flap travel, enabling the <b>pilot</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on other flying duties. Only 427 1977 model 150Ms were built as production shifted to the improved Cessna 152 {{in the early part}} of 1977.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 2000, he has {{directed}} and produced the pilot for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He stayed on {{as an executive}} producer {{and went on to}} write and direct many more episodes.

5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the Caribou from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. The squadron is currently stationed at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, and is responsible for training RAAF <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> operate King Airs, and performing light transport tasks. It is also believed to have a ground surveillance capability.|$|E
5|$|German {{casualties}} {{amounted to}} three Bf 109s destroyed, two severely damaged, and two Bf 110s severely damaged. Seven Bf 110s and one Bf 109 suffered light damage. Johann Fuhrmann and Roman Stiegler {{were the only}} <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> die in this action. A third—Dietrich Robitzsch from Jagdgruppe 101—wrote-off a Bf 109 but was uninjured. Two pilots were wounded: Feldwebel Hans Troitzsch (Bf 109) and Leutnant Gustav Uellenbeck (Bf 110).|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Less than 35minutes {{into the}} flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the {{passengers}}, crew, and <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> {{the rear of}} the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
5|$|No. 78 Wing is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operational}} training wing, headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. It comprises Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons, operating the BAE Hawk 127 lead-in fighter, and No. 278 Squadron, a technical training unit. No.79 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, {{is responsible for}} converting new <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> fast jets, while No.76 Squadron at Williamtown conducts introductory fighter courses; both units also fly support missions for the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American <b>pilots</b> <b>to</b> make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid anti-aircraft fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly lower {{to avoid the}} missiles and become the target of anti-aircraft batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic radar jamming, the record of SAM kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E
