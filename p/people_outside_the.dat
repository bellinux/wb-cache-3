5|$|There {{are several}} factions within Invisible War that Alex is {{contacted}} by and {{can choose to}} side with and represent different viewpoints on how humanity's post-Collapse society should develop. The two factions handling reconstruction in city enclaves are a future version of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which builds and maintains the emergent city states, acting as the defacto government body; and the Order, a religion combining concepts from multiple faiths which has gained support from <b>people</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> enclaves and is opposed to the WTO's policies. Both the Order and the WTO are puppet organizations of the Illuminati, respectively led by Illuminati members Nicolette DuClare and Chad Dumier, the latter {{a veteran of the}} war against Majestic 12. Two other factions are the Knights Templar, a group led by former Order leader Saman that makes militant strikes against groups espousing biomod use; and the Omar, a cult of cybernetically-enhanced humans who share a hive mind.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield <b>people</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|Cosmopolitan {{democracy}}, {{also known}} as Global democracy or World Federalism, is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives.

This is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed.
