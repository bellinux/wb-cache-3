To reduce the effects of such an attack on military personnel, DOD has determined the quantity of chemical and biological <b>protective</b> suits, <b>masks,</b> <b>breathing</b> filters, gloves, boots, and hoods that are needed based on projected wartime requirements. DOD's assessment process is unreliable for determining the risk to military operations. DOD's 2000 report is inaccurate because it includes erroneous inventory data and wartime requirements. Inadequate inventory management is an additional risk factor because readiness can be compromised by DOD's inventory management practices, which prevent an accurate accounting of the availability or adequacy of its protective equipment. ...|$|R

40|$|As from 1994, {{when the}} Guideline for Physical Radiation Protection Surveillance came into force, the {{measurement}} of airborne radioactive substances is mentioned {{to be one of}} the procedures for routine incorporation monitoring, particularly for Th, U, Pu and other alpha emitters. In a seminar of the Coordinating Office on Incorporation Monitoring of the BfS (Federal Office of Radiation Protection) problems concerning measuring methods (selection and orientation of air sampling devices, fixing of flow rate etc.) and the interpretation of measuring results (reduction factors when using <b>protective</b> clothing with <b>breathing</b> <b>masks)</b> were discussed. Another important subject of the discussion was quality assurance (standardized sampling conventions, tests of dust samplers etc.) and, in particular, representative sampling. This report summarizes the results of discussions and defines the required regulations and the research work in this field. (orig.) Mit dem Inkrafttreten der Richtlinie fuer den physikalischen Strahlenschutz im Jahre 1994 wird die Messung von Aktivitaetskonzentrationen in der Raumluft als eines der Verfahren fuer die regelmaessige Inkorporationsueberwachung genannt, insbesondere fuer Th, U, Pu sowie andere Alphastrahler. In einem Fachgespraech der Leitstelle Inkorporationsueberwachung der BfS wurden daher Probleme bei der Messtechnik (Auswahl und Orientierung der Sammelkoepfe, Festlegung der Anstroemgeschwindigkeit usw.) sowie der Interpretation von Messergebnissen (Reduktionsfaktoren bei Verwendung von Schutzkleidung mit Atemmasken usw.) diskutiert. Ein weiterer gewichtiger Diskussionspunkt war die Qualitaetssicherung (einheitliche Konventionen bei der Probenahme, Typpruefungen der Staubmessgeraete usw.) und hier insbesondere die Repraesentativitaet der Probenahme.

40|$|The primary {{applications}} for ambient temperature carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalysts include emergency <b>breathing</b> <b>masks</b> and confined volume life support systems, {{such as those}} employed on the Shuttle. While Hopcalite is typically used in emergency <b>breathing</b> <b>masks</b> for terrestrial applications, in the 1970 s, NASA selected a 2 % platinum (Pt) on carbon for use on the Shuttle since it is more active and also more tolerant to water vapor. In the last 10 - 15 years there have been significant advances in ambient temperature CO oxidation catalysts. Langley Research Center developed a monolithic catalyst for ambient temperature CO oxidation operating under stoichiometric conditions for closed loop carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser applications which is also advertised as having the potential to oxidize formaldehyde (HCHO) at ambient temperatures. In the last decade it has been discovered that appropriate sized nano-particles of gold are highly active for CO oxidation, even at sub-ambient temperatures, {{and as a result}} there has been a wealth of data reported in the literature relating to ambient/low temperature CO oxidation. In the shorter term missions where CO concentrations are typically controlled via ambient temperature oxidation catalysts, formaldehyde is also a contaminant of concern, and requires specially treated carbons such as Calgon Formasorb as untreated activated carbon has effectively no HCHO capacity. This paper examines the activity of some of the newer ambient temperature CO and formaldehyde (HCHO) oxidation catalysts, and measures the performance of the catalysts relative to the NASA baseline Ambient Temperature Catalytic Oxidizer (ATCO) catalyst at conditions of interest for closed loop trace contaminant control systems...|$|R
