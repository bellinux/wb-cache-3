5|$|<b>Parasitic</b> ant species {{enter the}} colonies of host ants and {{establish}} themselves as social parasites; {{species such as}} Strumigenys xenos are entirely <b>parasitic</b> {{and do not have}} workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts. This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the <b>parasitic</b> ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A <b>parasitic</b> queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the <b>parasitic</b> queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parasitic</b> mites include Syringophiloidus bombycillae, first {{identified}} on this species, and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus bombycillae.

Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of <b>parasitic</b> worm infestation are generally low.|$|E

For ICs, unlike PCBs, physical measurement of the <b>parasitics</b> is almost never done, since in-situ measurements with external equipment are extremely difficult.

40|$|Abstract—The {{distributed}} interconnect <b>parasitics</b> within large transistors markedly {{degrade the}} output power and efficiency at millimeter-wave frequencies. This paper develops {{a model for}} such structures and proposes a layout technique to reduce the effect of source terminal <b>parasitics.</b> The technique is applied to a 60 -GHz prototype in 65 -nm CMOS technology, raising the output power from 5 to 10 dBm and the drain efficiency from 3. 7 % to 10. 7 %.

5|$|<b>Parasitic</b> cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. <b>Parasitic</b> cones of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|E
40|$|A general {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of the interconnections of analog circuits respecting high-level constraints on performances is described in this work. In our approach, sensitivities of performances to <b>parasitics</b> are computed, and a set of bounding constraints for <b>parasitics</b> is determined. Sensitivities are then used to generate the weights for a new cost function-driven analog area router. After the routing is completed, the actual values of critical <b>parasitics</b> are used to check if the user-defined constraints on circuit performances are met. If the requirements have not been satisfied, the bounding constraints generated on the <b>parasitics</b> are used to increase the weights associated to the <b>parasitics</b> which violated the constraints, and the circuit rerouted. Results are reported validating the effectiveness of this approach for layout-design automation of analog circuits...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} circuit sizing model that takes layout <b>parasitics</b> into account. The circuit and layout {{parameters}} {{are stored in}} a parameterized layout description format, GBLD. The layout <b>parasitics</b> are stored as closed form expressions. Layout optimization tools can modify the layout and recalculate <b>parasitics</b> on the fly. If the results of sensitivity analysis are passed to those tools, optimization for performance can be achieved with relatively few iterations involving time consuming circuit simulations...|$|R
40|$|Low noise {{amplifiers}} {{are ultimately}} limited in performance and power dissipation by <b>parasitics</b> {{introduced by the}} IC process. The important <b>parasitics</b> can be determined by investigating the tradeoffs between power, performance and the performance limits of simple building blocks. Most of these <b>parasitics</b> {{are related to the}} silicon substrate. Silicon-On-Anything is an IC technology in which the substrate is completely substituted by another material. The technology also includes an NPN device optimized specifically for low power RF. By adapting the LNA design methods, a reduction in power dissipation by one order of magnitude has already been demonstrated. Directions for further improvements are indicated...|$|R
5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a <b>parasitic</b> lifestyle, {{particularly}} as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts {{and can cause}} significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, <b>parasitic</b> isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some {{members of the family}} Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill the fish in the process.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>parasitic</b> wasp, {{especially}} in the Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the <b>parasitic</b> wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of <b>parasitic</b> wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} <b>parasitic</b> cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the <b>parasitic</b> species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced merula blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, {{lost the ability to}} recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Modern {{advances}} in reconfigurable analog technologies are allowing field-programmable analog arrays (FPAAs) to dramatically grow in size, flexibility, and usefulness. This paper presents rapid prototyping {{results of a}} bandpass filter as a sample analog circuit using our floating-gate based large-scale FPAA. A major source of <b>parasitics</b> introduced during the circuit mapping process is interconnect switches used for routing. Our goal is to obtain models of the mapped circuits that can be simulated using SPICE in order to observe the impact of interconnect <b>parasitics</b> on the relevant analog metrics. Our {{results indicate that the}} mapped analog circuits obtain desired responses even with interconnect <b>parasitics,</b> clearly demonstrating the practicality of our FPAA. I...|$|R
40|$|Pareto-optimal {{performance}} fronts {{have gained}} popularity as {{a representation of}} performance trade-offs of electronic circuits. They are also essential to support efficient bottom-up hierarchical design methodologies. Being such {{a key element in}} these methodologies, there have been many reported efforts to enhance the fronts with valuable information that goes beyond the nominal circuit behavior, such as the yield or the reconfiguration capabilities. However, the effect of layout <b>parasitics</b> is the factor that has been missing in the literature: the accuracy may be seriously degraded by layout <b>parasitics</b> not considered during the front generation. In this paper, we present a technique to generate layout-aware Pareto fronts that accurately accounts for the impact of both geometry and <b>parasitics.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another <b>parasitic</b> species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood <b>parasitic</b> species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E

50|$|From a {{macroscopic}} {{point of}} view, a generalized compact RLC model for CNT interconnects can be depicted as in, where {{the model of}} an individual MWCNT is shown with <b>parasitics</b> representing both dc conductance and high-frequency impedance i.e. inductance and capacitance effects. Multiple shells of a MWCNT are presented by the individual <b>parasitics</b> of each shell. Such model can also be applicable to SWCNTs where only a single shell is represented.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, DSPF models a {{detailed}} network of RC <b>parasitics</b> for every net. DSPF is therefore {{more accurate than}} RSPF, but DSPF files can be {{an order of magnitude}} larger than RSPF files for the same design. In addition, there is no specification for coupling caps in DSPF. DSPF is more similar to a SPICE netlist than the other formats. SPEF is an Open Verilog Initiative (OVI) — and now IEEE — format for defining netlist <b>parasitics.</b> SPEF is not identical to the SPF format, although it is used in a similar manner. Like the SPF format, SPEF includes resistance and capacitance <b>parasitics.</b> Also like the SPF format, SPEF can represent <b>parasitics</b> in detailed or reduced (pi-model) forms, with the reduced form probably being more commonly used. SPEF also has a syntax that allows the modeling of capacitance between different nets, so it is used by the PrimeTime SI (crosstalk) analysis tool. SPEF is smaller than SPF and DSPF because the names are mapped to integers to reduce file size.|$|R
5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus Boletus and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908.

Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being <b>parasitic</b> on Amanita muscaria.

5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small <b>parasitic</b> cones, tuff rings and {{fissures}} {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each <b>parasitic</b> cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an approach {{for analysis of}} crosstalk effects due to current pulses drawn from voltage supplies in mixed analog-digital CMOS integrated circuits. A test chip has been integrated and mounted in different ways, in order to compare measurements on chips mounted in package and mounted on board. The chip has been extensively simulated, using a realistic model of on-chip and off-chip <b>parasitics,</b> to study {{what happens on the}} analog section when digital switching noise is injected. Simulations results indicate that disturbances due to switching currents in digital blocks propagate through interconnection <b>parasitics,</b> and affect analog voltages, degrading circuit performance. Therefore, reduction of interconnection <b>parasitics</b> is essential in mixed-signal high-frequency circuits, such as radio-frequency front-ends. Measurements confirm simulation results.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{redesign}} iterations occurring {{in the design of}} analog integrated circuits, it is desirable to estimate layout-induced <b>parasitics</b> during the circuit synthesis phase. Since parameterized layouts allow us to build models of <b>parasitics</b> automatically and systematically, researchers have proposed to use them in an analog design flow so as to estimate <b>parasitics</b> during the circuit synthesis phase. In this paper, we propose methods for designing and representing the parameterized layout of a two-turn octagonal spiral inductor. The parameterized layout contains a parameterized 45 -degree polygon. Also, the parameterized layout is process-independent and can be used to generate design-rule-correct physical layouts for given inductance values. The proposed methods are general and {{can be applied to the}} design and representation of parameterized layouts for other basic building blocks in analog integrated circuits...|$|R

This process continues until the <b>parasitics</b> change only little. Unlike OASYS, the authors separated the sizing method from the model of the transistor.
