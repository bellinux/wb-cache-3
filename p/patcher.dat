500|$|Guitar Hero {{and other}} rock music-based games work with record {{companies}} to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 {{for the rights}} to use a master recording and $10,000 {{for the rights to}} make a cover. [...] The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. [...] However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. [...] Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that [...] "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small." [...] Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to {{want to be part of}} the success: [...] "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game." [...] Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they [...] "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse." [...] Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. [...] Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. [...] <b>Patcher</b> also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. [...] However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} [...] v10.5 build 9A466 the {{community}} has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created {{one of the earliest}} patching processes which made it convenient for users to install [...] onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple [...] [...] This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros. [...] Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity. [...] However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components. [...] The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel <b>Patcher</b> was created which removed the HPET requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.|$|E

[...] Since everything wears clothes of some kind (the soul wears a body, and the body garments; earth puts forth grass, and the firmament stars; ideas clothe themselves in words; society puts on fashions and habits), {{it can be seen}} that Carlyle felt free to bring in any subject he pleased; and so he did. Moreover, in order to have liberty of style, he represented himself to be the editor not the author of Sartor.

6000|$|Now, as Peter Stuyvesant had a {{singular}} inclination {{to govern the}} province by his individual will, his first move on his return, was {{to put a stop}} to this gratuitous legislation. Accordingly, one evening, when an inspired cobbler was holding forth to an assemblage of the kind, the intrepid Peter suddenly made his appearance with his ominous walking staff in his hand, and a countenance sufficient to petrify a millstone. The whole meeting was thrown into confusion--the orators stood aghast, with open mouth and trembling knees, while [...] "Horror!" [...] "Tyranny!" [...] "Liberty!" [...] "Rights!" [...] "Taxes!" [...] "Death!" [...] "Destruction!" [...] and a host of other patriotic phrases, were bolted forth before he had time to close his lips. Peter took no notice of the skulking throng, but strode up to the brawling, bully-ruffian, and pulling out a huge silver watch, which might have served in times of yore as a town-clock, and which is still retained by his descendants as a family curiosity, requested the orator to mend it and set it going. The orator humbly confessed it was utterly out of his power, as he was unacquainted with the nature of its construction. [...] "Nay, but," [...] said Peter, [...] "try your ingenuity, man; you see all the springs and wheels and how easily the clumsiest hand may stop it, and pull it to pieces, and why should it not be equally easy to regulate as to stop it?" [...] The orator declared that his trade was wholly different--that he was a poor cobbler, and had never meddled with a watch in his life--that there were men skilled in the art whose business it was to attend to those matters, but for his part he should only mar the workmanship, and put the whole in confusion. [...] "Why, harkee, master of mine," [...] cried Peter, turning suddenly upon him with a countenance that almost petrified the <b>patcher</b> of shoes into a perfect lapstone, [...] "dost thou pretend to meddle with the movements of government to regulate, and correct, and patch, and cobble a complicated machine, the principles of which are above thy comprehension, and its simplest operations too subtle for thy understanding, when thou canst not correct a trifling error in a common piece of mechanism, the whole mystery of which is open to thy inspection?--Hence with thee to the leather and stone, which are emblems of thy head; cobble thy shoes, and confine thyself to the vocation for which Heaven has fitted thee; but," [...] elevating his voice until it made the welkin ring, [...] "if ever I catch thee, or any of thy tribe, meddling again with affairs of government, by St. Nicholas, but I'll have every mother's bastard of ye flayed alive, and your hides stretched for drumheads, that ye may thenceforth make a noise to some purpose!" ...|$|E

Starting from the hypothesis where current software tools have made the creation of sound inaccessible for non-specialist users, we analyze {{the problems with the}} musical bias ingrained in DAWs and <b>Patchers,</b> the standard sound design tools. After identifying the Web Audio API as an appropriate technological backbone for an accessible tool, recent online applications are surveyed, followed by popular software used in a rapid prototyping scenario. By acknowledging the merits and shortcomings of these sound creators, we present Blendwave, the byproduct of a practice-based research and development effort towards democratizing sound design as a rapid prototyping activity for audiovisual authors. The idea of a sampler architecture is proposed as a way to augment the sound possibilities of sfxr-based tools while keeping their simplicity.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes what}} changes {{would be needed}} to lower the primary beams coming from switchyard into enclosure P 01 without changing trajectories in the downstream enclosures. There is a 680 foot pipe buried in the ground between Enclosure E and P 01 which allows primary beam to travel from the switchyard area to the research division area. This pipe is approximately 25 years old and has started to leak. The effects of the leaky pipe can be catastrophic to the transportation of the proton area beams. The vacuum group has devised an ingenious way of repairing a leak from the inside using remotely controlled grinders, <b>patchers,</b> welders and cameras mounted on carts that can be pulled into the pipe. A typical patch adds approximately one half of an inch of material which, in turn, restricts the aperture of the pipe. This pipe has three separate beams running through it split in the vertical plane. Pwest is the highest beam in the pipe and, in at least one location, the center of the beam clears the top of the pipe by one and one half inches. If a leak were to develop at a low spot in the pipe the patch to fix the leak might create an obstruction for the beam. Hence, the request from the Research Division Head...|$|R
40|$|KBSDE is a {{knowledge}} compiler {{that uses a}} classification-based approach to map solution constraints in a task specification onto particular search algorithm components that {{will be responsible for}} satisfying those constraints (e. g., local constraints are incorporated in generators; global constraints are incorporated in either testers or hillclimbing <b>patchers).</b> Associated with each type of search algorithm component is a subcompiler that specializes in mapping constraints into components of that type. Each of these subcompilers in turn uses a classification-based approach, matching a constraint passed to it against one of several schemas, and applying a compilation technique associated with that schema. While much progress has occurred in our research since we first laid out our classification-based approach [Ton 91], we focus in this paper on our reformulation research. Two important reformulation issues that arise out of the choice of a schema-based approach are: (1) compilability [...] Can a constraint that does not directly match any of a particular subcompiler's schemas be reformulated into one that does? and (2) Efficiency [...] If the efficiency of the compiled search algorithm depends on the compiler's performance, and the compiler's performance depends on the form in which the constraint was expressed, can we find forms for constraints which compile better, or reformulate constraints whose forms can be recognized as ones that compile poorly? In this paper, we describe a set of techniques we are developing for partially addressing these issues...|$|R
