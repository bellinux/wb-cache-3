Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> is able to show {{he or she was}} not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of pneumothorax {{depends on a}} number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube.

5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the {{different levels of}} the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played {{in a similar manner}} to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing and watching the scenery.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and <b>person</b> <b>involved,</b> assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E

Another <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> in the case was Huang Tingjian (Hartman, 20). Huang and his uncle were heavily fined, and Huang was exiled.

25|$|On July 17, 2016, Gavin Eugene Long shot six police {{officers}} in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, {{in the wake of}} the shooting of Alton Sterling. Three died and three were hospitalized, one critically; of the officers who died, two were members of the Baton Rouge Police Department, while the third worked for the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office. Long, who associated himself with organizations linked to black separatism and the sovereign citizen movement, was shot and killed by a SWAT officer during a shootout with police at the scene. Police arrested and questioned two other suspects, but Long was confirmed to be the only <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> in the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Any excommunication or interdict obliges the <b>person</b> <b>involved</b> {{to refrain}} from {{receiving}} Holy Communion, but a minister is obliged to deny Holy Communion only to those on whom an ecclesiastical superior or tribunal has publicly imposed the censure or declared that it has in fact been incurred.

While someone in this situation should not receive Communion until the excommunication is lifted, a priest may not {{on the grounds of}} the automatic excommunication refuse to administer the sacrament even if he knows of its existence.|$|E
