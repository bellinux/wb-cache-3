5000|$|An {{increasing}} number of collection agencies, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "debt buyers", <b>purchase</b> debts from <b>creditors</b> for a percentage {{of the value of the}} debt and pursue the debtor for the full balance, sometimes plus [...] "interest". This prevents a debtor from merely defaulting or forgetting a debt. It also generates immediate revenue, albeit much reduced, for the creditor and reduces the public relations risks involved with defaulted debt collection.|$|R

40|$|Why should {{economic}} scholars {{study the}} consumer debt collection process? First, {{the cost and}} effectiveness of the collections process has implications for the pricing and availability of consumer credit. Second, changes in technology {{and the structure of}} credit markets have transformed the collections industry. Small, mom-and-pop operations are increasingly being replaced by firms operating nationally, collecting on billions of dollars in bad debt <b>purchased</b> from <b>creditors.</b> In “Collecting Consumer Debt in America,” Bob Hunt explores how creditors and their agents attempt to collect past-due consumer debt, particularly unsecured debt. Creditors have a number of remedies open to them, but their effectiveness is limited by the fact that consumers can file for bankruptcy. Even outside of bankruptcy, consumers enjoy a variety of legal protections, including some they may not be aware of.; Also issued as Payment Cards Center Discussion Paper No 07 - 06 Consumer credit; Debt...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{recognized}} that a present security interestmay be established in property to be acquired by the debtor in thefuture. When the subsequent acquisition is in turn financed by apurchase money transaction the question arises whether the lien ofthe original mortgagee or that of the <b>purchase</b> money <b>creditor</b> haspriority. Professor Gilmore traces the historical priority given thepurchase money interest, {{the areas in which}} the priority has beenqualified, and the embodiment of the priority in the Uniform ConditionalSales Act. He then describes some of the solutions andraises some of the problems presented by Article 9 of the UniformCommercial Code, discussing the Code 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the purchasemoney interest in inventory, collateral other than inventory,and fixtures. He concludes by urging that defects in the Code berepaired in a uniform and careful manner rather than ignored ordenied through fear that such repair would hinder general adoptionof the Code...|$|R
40|$|Section 9 - 312 of the Uniform Commercial Code {{determines the}} {{priority}} of conflicting security interests 2 ̆ 7 in the same collateral. Generally, the first security interest filed is superior to all others. An exception is allowed for a purchase money security interest perfected within ten days of the debtor receiving the noninventory goods. In North Platte State Bank v. Production Credit Association, the Nebraska Supreme Court held the ten-day grace period begins when possession is received, rather than when the purchaser technically becomes a 2 ̆ 2 debtor 2 ̆ 2 of the <b>purchase</b> money <b>creditor.</b> This decision, though in direct conflict with other authority, is proper because it assures the certainty of security interests in noninventory collateral. This Note concentrates on the Nebraska decision that the North Platte State Bank 2 ̆ 7 s purchase money security interest did not have priority under UCC 9 - 312 (4) because it was filed {{two months after the}} debtor received possession of the collateral...|$|R
