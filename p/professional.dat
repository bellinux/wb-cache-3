40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the extent of the interdisciplinary collaboration between mental health (MHS) <b>professionals</b> and social security <b>professionals</b> (SSI), their perceptions of this interdisciplinary collaboration and whether these perceptions differed between <b>professionals</b> of the two organizations. Method: We obtained data from mental health <b>professionals</b> and social security <b>professionals</b> in the context of a national agreement between MHS and SSI to improve the collaboration between MHS <b>professionals</b> and SSI <b>professionals</b> in the support of individuals with mental disorders to improve work outcome of these individuals. Results: Mental health <b>professionals</b> as well as SSI <b>professionals</b> reported a moderate level of interdisciplinary collaboration, which does not seem to be affected by demographic variables, such as age, gender, profession and region. When <b>professionals</b> collaborated in a structural way they were more positive regarding their interdisciplinary collaboration with <b>professionals</b> of the other organization than <b>professionals</b> that collaborated in an ad hoc manner. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary collaboration was perceived as moderate by collaborating mental health <b>professionals</b> and social security <b>professionals.</b> In order to improve the collaboration between MHS and SSI on a local microlevel, organizations need to facilitate more structural collaboration between the <b>professionals.</b> Implications for Rehabilitation Collaborating mental health <b>professionals</b> and social security <b>professionals</b> perceived their interdisciplinary collaboration as moderate. In order to improve the collaboration between mental health services (MHS) and vocational rehabilitation services on a local microlevel, organizations need to facilitate more structural collaboration between the <b>professionals.</b> Integrated services with the participation of MHS as well as vocational rehabilitation services, e. g. to share client information and to refer clients to each other, need to be developed.
