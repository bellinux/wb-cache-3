The emergence of younger defenseman Matt Hunwick was <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for his expandability. Alberts became {{an integral part of}} the Flyers' defensive corps, leading the team in hits (157) and ranking third in blocked shots (133). His 12 assists and 13 points were career-highs.|$|E
5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for the group's success.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and {{other areas of the}} Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{density of}} {{skeletal}} muscle caveolae is increased in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its genetic homologue, the mdx mouse. This structural change is significant {{as it may}} indicate muscle regeneration. We identified in mdx mouse tibialis anterior muscles significantly increased levels of caveolin- 3, the chief protein in muscle caveolae, and reduced levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme regulated by caveolin- 3. Similar changes occurred in the corresponding mRNA levels. These data suggest that induction of caveolin- 3 occurs and this may at least <b>partly</b> be <b>responsible</b> for increased number of caveolae, altered nNOS-caveolin cycle, and regeneration of dystrophic muscles...|$|R

In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also <b>partly</b> <b>responsible.</b> The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E
5|$|Yet another DC-10, {{performing}} Western Airlines Flight 2605, {{crashed in}} Mexico City after a red-eye flight from Los Angeles barely 5 {{months after the}} crash of American Airlines flight 191. The Western Airlines DC-10's crash, however, was due to low visibility and an attempt to land on a closed runway. Ironically, the crash of yet another DC-10, United Airlines Flight 232, ten years later, restored some of the aircraft's reputation. Despite losing an engine and all flight controls and crash-landing in a huge fireball (which was caught on video by a local news crew), 185 people survived the accident. Experts praised the DC-10's sturdy construction as <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for {{the high number of}} survivors, though the efforts of the crew were primarily responsible.|$|E
5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E

The hypothesis posits that linguistic structures that are sensitive to conditions external to the language domain, such as pragmatic, discourse, or contextual information, may remain variable in bilingual speakers, even at very advanced proficiency levels.

40|$|Aim: The aim {{of present}} study was to {{determine}} the seroprevalence of Neospora caninum infection in aborted sheep population from Hamedan province of Iran. Materials and Methods: 358 serum samples of aborted ewes were evaluated for IgG-antibodies to N. caninum using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: 8 samples (2. 2 %) were found seropositive for this infection (2. 05 < Confidence interval 0. 95 < 2. 35). Further, no statistical difference found between infection rates in different ewes age groups and fetal age groups. Conclusion: Although the rate of infection is low but the result indicates that N. caninum infection may <b>partly</b> be <b>responsible</b> for abortion and economic losses in Sheep husbandry in this region...|$|R

In completing the first of 10 consecutive doubles, he took 128 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.94 and scored 1,844 runs at an average of 47.28. For Yorkshire, he topped both the batting and bowling averages and had the third highest batting average in the country. Hirst played in two end-of-season games for the Players against the Gentlemen; his 124 not out in the second match was his only century in the Players versus Gentlemen series.|$|E

The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines.

5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service.

The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E

40|$|AAT {{would thus}} permit an {{increase}} in benefitCameroon Full list of author information {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by a parasite of the genus Trypanosoma. In Africa, many pathogenic trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma congolense (T. congo-lense),Trypanosoma vivax (T. vivax),Trypanosoma simiae (T. simiae) and Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. brucei brucei) affect livestock. Most of these parasites are mainly transmitted by tsetse flies of the genus Glossina [1]. In sub-Saharan Africa, thirty-seven countries are affected by the Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana, covering an area of about 9 million km 2. This situation could <b>partly</b> be <b>responsible</b> for the malnutrition in Africa [2] because it is estimated that about 50 million cattle are exposed to the disease and US$ 35 million doses of trypa-nocides are used per year to overcome this pathology [3]...|$|R

We provide a comparison between experimental and numerical velocity profiles coupled with the numerical analysis of spatial and temporal wall shear stress evolution. The interaction between the graft and coronary flows has been demonstrated.

5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies {{have shown that the}} Indian Ocean Dipole is <b>partly</b> <b>responsible</b> for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general.

40|$|For {{the first}} time in Algeria, we report on the presentation, {{diagnosis}} and management of two cases of diffuse large B cell NHL with chronic HCV infection. Both Algerian patients came for medical consult without HCV-related symptoms. Systematic serological tests to identify HIV and hepatitis B and C infections which performed on all patients led to HCV diagnosis. Chemotherapy was given to both patients without exacerbation of the HCV infection. These observed cases shed new light on the possible pathogenesis of NHL in Algerian population. Indeed, in Algeria, HCV may <b>partly</b> been <b>responsible</b> of the unexplained increase of NHL incidence in Eastern region of Algeria especially among those who are frequently exposed to HCV risk factors (haemodialysis and dental care).

40|$|The {{collapse}} of primary commodity {{prices in the}} 1980 s has been prolonged and has severely affected many developing countries. While low commodity prices can be partly explained by sluggish demand due to slow growth in the industrialised countries, high interest rates and technological change, this does not seem a complete explanation. This paper examines the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that supply factors have <b>partly</b> been <b>responsible.</b> Many developing countries have faced severe balance of payments difficulties, {{in part due to}} the debt crisis, and have resorted to real exchange rate devaluations in order to boost export earnings. Such devaluations may have boosted export supplies, or prevented downward adjustments in capacity, and therefore put pressure on commodity prices. It also considers the policy implications of this externality, whereby attempts to boost export earnings in one primary producing country adversely affect the prices received by others. ...|$|R
40|$|Neutral {{interstellar}} atoms penetrate {{deeply into}} the inner heliosphere before they become ionized by various processes. As ions they are picked-up by the frozen-in magnetic fields and are convected outwards with the solar wind plasma. Thereby the primary plasma flow is mass, momentum, and energy-loaded. The dynamics of the distant multi-constituent solar wind is, however, not solely determined by these loading processes, but is also affected by the wave-mediated pick-up ion pressure gradients derivable from the pick-up ion distribution function. The action of the radial components of these pressures essentially counter balances the decelerating effect of the solar wind momentum loading, diminishing strongly the deceleration of the distant solar wind. Furthermore the latitudinal components of the pick-up ion pressures induce latitudinal forces acting on the multiconstituent solar plasma outflow and inducing nonradial bulk flow components. The enforced nonradial outflow geometry on the upwind hemisphere may <b>partly</b> be <b>responsible</b> for the magnetic flux deficit which was claimed since several years in the PIONEER- 10 magnetic flux data...|$|R
