40|$|The {{study of}} the ordered oxygen {{deficient}} perovskite EuBaCo 2 -xNixO 5. 50 shows that the doping of cobalt sites by nickel induces a strong ferromagnetic component at low temperature in the antiferromagnetic matrix of EuBaCo 2 O 5. 50. This system exhibits indeed phase separation, i. e. consists of ferromagnetic domains embedded in the antiferromagnetic matrix of EuBaCo 2 O 5. 50. Besides, a magnetic transition is observed {{for the first time}} at 40 K in the undoped and nickel doped phases, which can be attributed to the ferromagnetic ordering of the Eu 3 + moments below this temperature. Moreover sharp ultra magnetization multisteps are observed below 5 K, characteristic of motion of domain walls in a strong <b>pinning</b> <b>system</b> and very different from any metamagnetic transition...|$|E

40|$|High {{resolution}} scanning Hall probe microscopy {{has been}} used to study flux line pinning in a thin superconducting ph film evaporated on top of an ordered array of ferromagnetic Co dots. After magnetisation along the easy axis, all the nanomagnets are seen to be in single domain magnetic states with dipole stray field distributions (T > T-e). Upon cooling through the critical temperature of the superconducting film at H = 0, we observe strong screening of the dipole fields which we attribute to fluxoid quantisation. After field cooling, we find that flux lines are selectively Dinned at poles with the opposite sign of field and ordered structures which are commensurate with the underlying pinning array are observed. Each pinning site appears to be capable of trapping at least two nux lines, and no evidence has yet been seen for interstitial vortices at low temperatures. Results will be compared with those from thr disordered <b>pinning</b> <b>system</b> found naturally in Cu-rich epitaxial YBCO thin films. These typically contain micron-sized normal Cu-rich precipitates, which have a similar density to other artificially patterned systems;. We show that the precipitates act as strong pinning sites close to T-c, and also give rise to weak magnetisation peaks at average matching fields. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B,V.

We are interested in combinatorial characterization of <b>pinned</b> subspace-incidence <b>systems</b> that are minimally rigid, i. e. those systems that are guaranteed to generically yield a locally unique realization. As is customary, this {{is accompanied by a}} characterization of generic independence as well as rigidity. In a previous paper sitharam 2014 incidence, we used <b>pinned</b> subspace-incidence <b>systems</b> towards solving the fitted dictionary learning problem, i. e. dictionary learning with specified underlying hypergraph, and gave a combinatorial characterization of minimal rigidity for a more restricted version of <b>pinned</b> subspace-incidence <b>system,</b> with H being a uniform hypergraph and pins in X being 1 -dimension subspaces.

In this paper, we extend the combinatorial characterization to general <b>pinned</b> subspace-incidence <b>systems,</b> with H being a non-uniform hypergraph and pins in X being subspaces with arbitrary dimension.

Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass dowel <b>pin</b> <b>system.</b> Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass dowel <b>pin</b> <b>system.</b> The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional Dowel <b>pin</b> <b>system</b> however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.
