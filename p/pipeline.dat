The most notable form of art unique to the <b>pipeline</b> are <b>pipeline</b> maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a piece of metal delineating the path of the <b>pipeline</b> through the map. <b>Pipeline</b> maps were frequently created by welders working on the <b>pipeline,</b> and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the <b>pipeline.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} <b>pipeline,</b> Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about <b>pipeline</b> welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of <b>pipeline</b> welds. The Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> was unique among <b>pipeline</b> projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main <b>pipeline</b> to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the <b>pipeline</b> {{caused a}} massive {{economic}} boom in towns {{up and down}} the <b>pipeline</b> route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the <b>pipeline.</b> By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the <b>pipeline</b> had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

30|$|Next, it was {{investigated}} whether {{the size of}} the parcels through which <b>pipelines</b> pass are different. A significant difference between the <b>pipelines</b> in terms of the size of parcels was found (see Tables  7, 8, 9, 10). Because the average size of the parcels affected by the construction of the <b>pipelines</b> is different for the three <b>pipelines,</b> the comparison of the <b>pipelines</b> in terms of parcel size could be also made.|$|R
40|$|When using ground-penetrating radar to {{identify}} underground <b>pipelines</b> of similar dielectric constants (i. e.

In this study, by considering secondaryreflected travel-times theory of radar waves, we calculated dielectric constants of <b>pipelines</b> for which PE- and PVC-type non-metal <b>pipelines</b> were identified. An experiment by placing PE- and PVC-type non-metal <b>pipelines</b> and heavy metal (iron) <b>pipelines</b> in water were conducted. Based on the travel-time calculation, the dielectric constants of non-metal <b>pipelines</b> of similar composition (PE: 2. 3 and PVC: 3. 0) were quite close. The differences between experimental and theoretical values are acceptable in construction work and U. S. A.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of <b>pipelined</b> machine verification {{derives from the}} fact that there is a complex time-abstraction between the <b>pipelined</b> implementation and its specification that executes instructions sequentially. To study this problem, we de ne a simple three-stage <b>pipelined</b> machine in ACL 2. We prove that this <b>pipelined</b> machine returns the same result as its specification machine. In order to ease the proof, we define an intermediate abstraction called MAETT. This abstraction models the behavior of instructions in the <b>pipelined</b> architecture, and it allows us to define directly and verify invariant conditions about executed instructions. The author used a similar approach to verify a more realistic <b>pipelined</b> machine. This section serves as an introduction to the verification of <b>pipelined</b> machines...|$|R

When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the <b>pipeline</b> to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the <b>pipeline</b> wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} <b>pipeline</b> transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode.

Examples of modern <b>pipeline</b> transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil <b>Pipeline</b> and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas <b>Pipeline.</b> International <b>pipeline</b> transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan <b>pipeline,</b> presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through <b>pipeline</b> networks.|$|E
40|$|Information Extraction (IE) <b>pipelines</b> analyze text {{through several}} stages. The <b>pipeline’s</b> {{algorithms}} determine both its effectiveness and its run-time efficiency. In real-world tasks, however, IE <b>pipelines</b> often fail acceptable run-times because they analyze too much task-irrelevant text. This raises two interesting questions: 1) How much “efficiency potential ” {{depends on the}} scheduling of a <b>pipeline’s</b> algorithms? 2) Is it possible to devise a reliable method to construct efficient IE <b>pipelines?</b> Both questions are addressed in this paper. In particular, we show how to optimize the run-time efficiency of IE <b>pipelines</b> under a given set of algorithms. We evaluate <b>pipelines</b> for three algorithm sets on an industrially relevant task: the extraction of market forecasts from news articles. Using a system-independent measure, we demonstrate that efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude are possible without compromising a <b>pipeline’s</b> original effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{software}} <b>pipelining</b> methods {{based on}} an ILP (Integer Linear Programming) framework have been successfully applied to derive rate-optimal schedules under resource constraints. Such ILP based methods provide a way to establish bounds based on optimal solutions, {{which can be used}} by compiler developers to improve the performance of existing and proposed scheduling methods. However, like much other previous work on software <b>pipelining,</b> ILP based work has focused on resource constraints of simple function units: e. g. "clean pipelines" [...] - <b>pipelines</b> without structural hazards. The problem for architectures beyond such clean <b>pipelines</b> remains open. One challenge is how to represent such resource constraints for unclean <b>pipelines</b> (e. g. non-pipelined or <b>pipelined</b> but having structural hazards) and their assignment (mapping) simultaneously under a unified ILP framework.

40|$|Abstract. Due to high service {{temperatures}} and internal pressures {{in oil and}} gas <b>pipelines,</b> axial compression forces are induced in the pipe due to seabed friction. Slender trenched <b>pipelines</b> can experience global buckling in the vertical plane (upheaval buckling) while untrenched <b>pipelines</b> buckle in the horizontal plane (lateral buckling). Furthermore, deep subsea <b>pipelines</b> subjected to high external hydrostatics pressures can undergo catastrophic propagation buckling. In this study, the possible interaction between upheaval/lateral buckling and propagation buckling is numerically investigated using finite element analysis. A new concept is proposed for subsea <b>pipelines</b> design that gives higher capacity than conventional <b>pipelines...</b>|$|R
