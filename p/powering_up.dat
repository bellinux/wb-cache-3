5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne {{was on hand}} for <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large {{reactors}} would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall {{and others on the}} day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway {{decides not to}} help them. As Chakotay {{returns to}} Voyager on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link {{to force him to}} travel to the Borg cube with Voyager in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board the cube, and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also {{activates}} the cube, which begins <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> to attack Voyager. Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{narrative}} then skips to {{one month}} later, when the pilot re-emerges in space flying an armed Einhänder spacecraft. A message from Hyperion communicates that the player is committing {{an act of}} treason and must remove their armament and surrender. Nevertheless, the player fights their way through Selene fighters and faces the Hyperion, the game's final boss. The ending sequence depicts the player's spacecraft damaged and drifting in space. The pilot engages its thrusters and dives into an army of Selene spacecraft with the Moon in the background. An epilogue follows which states that {{the actions of the}} lone Einhänder pilot effectively ended the war by destroying the armies of both sides, leading to an eventual peace; however, the pilot's name and deeds were stricken from the records, and they are remembered only by veterans of the war. After the end credits, a lone Einhänder spacecraft is shown <b>powering</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
25|$|After {{reaching}} orbit, {{the crew}} began {{working through the}} post-insertion timeline, which included opening the orbiter's payload bay doors, deploying the Ku band antenna, <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> and activating the shuttle robotic arm, and performing a burn of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS).|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode. The {{cause was}} unknown and FH Aachen {{put out a}} call to all amateur radio {{operators}} {{to try to find}} out what was going on with the CubeSat. A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of <b>powering</b> <b>up,</b> turning on the heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E

25|$|Digital {{sampling}} is used {{to convert}} an audio wave to a sequence of binary numbers that {{can be stored in}} a digital format, such as MP3. Common features of all MP3 players are a memory storage device, such as flash memory or a miniature hard disk drive, an embedded processor, and an audio codec microchip to convert the compressed file into an analogue sound signal. During playback, audio files are read from storage into a RAM based memory buffer, and then streamed through an audio codec to produce decoded PCM audio. Typically audio formats decode at double to more than 20 times real speed on portable electronic processors, requiring that the codec output be stored for a time until the DAC can play it. To save power, portable devices may spend much or nearly all of their time in a low power idle state while waiting for the DAC to deplete the output PCM buffer before briefly <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> to decode additional audio.|$|E
25|$|Beerus awakens from a 39-year {{sleep and}} goes {{in search of}} a Super Saiyan God. He travels to meet Goku after {{learning}} that he had defeated Freeza, and easily defeated him despite his advanced stages of the Super Saiyan transformation. Beerus next travels to Earth, coming across partygoers of Bulma's birthday party, including Vegeta, who met Beerus during his youth and is fearful of him due to his superior strength. Although Beerus is disappointed that Vegeta does not know what a Super Saiyan God is, he stays at Bulma's party because he enjoys Earth's cuisine. Beerus is mostly calm until requesting some pudding from Majin Boo, who refuses to share, causing him to become enraged and easily beat Boo, Gotenks, Gohan, Android 18, Piccolo, and Tenshinhan in combat. Bulma slaps Beerus, who he slaps back and in doing so causes an angered Vegeta to grow in strength and seemingly surpass him. Beerus then easily defeats Vegeta after <b>powering</b> <b>up,</b> and moves to destroy the Earth until Goku pleads for him to allow the Earthlings time to find a way of making a Super Saiyan God appear. After the Saiyans perform a ritual, which sees Goku transform into a Super Saiyan God, Beerus duels him and though defeating him, spares him and the Earth. During Freeza's resurrection and subsequent battle with the heroes, Beerus observes the fight and worries Freeza that he will become involved until Beerus confirms he will not.|$|E
500|$|In April 1915, White was {{appointed}} a {{captain in the}} Australian Imperial Force and adjutant of the Mesopotamian Half Flight, the first AFC unit to see active service. Based initially in Basra and operating primitive Maurice Farman biplanes, the Half Flight assisted the Indian Army during the Mesopotamian campaign, conducting reconnaissance and sabotage missions. White successfully carried out several operations that involved landing behind enemy lines. On a mission in October 1915, {{he was forced to}} land owing to engine trouble and, rather than risk attempting repairs, taxied the aircraft some [...] past enemy encampments while his observer kept watch with his rifle at the ready; the [...] "Keystone Cops adventure", as historian Alan Stephens described it, culminated in the engine finally <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> and allowing White to take off and fly to the safety of the Australian base.

500|$|The Potato Sack is {{the name}} of an {{alternate}} reality game (ARG) created by the Valve Corporation and the developers of thirteen independent video games to promote the release of Valve's title, Portal 2, in April 2011. [...] Valve president Gabe Newell envisioned the game as a [...] "Cross Game Design Event" [...] in December 2010, and allowed the developers a free rein to design the game using Valve's Portal intellectual property. The game, requiring players to find and solve a number of puzzles hidden within updates of the thirteen games, ultimately led to the opportunity for players to release Portal 2 about 10 hours earlier than its planned release by playing games under the pretense of <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> GLaDOS, the sentient computer antagonist from the Portal series. The ARG's theme of potatoes is based on plot elements within Portal 2, specifically that for part of the game, GLaDOS's personality module is run off a potato battery.|$|E
500|$|Viewtiful Joe {{features}} unique gameplay {{elements in}} the form of Joe's [...] "Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power", which is designed to emulate camera tricks seen in films. VFX Power is used in both battling enemies and solving various puzzles. These three powers are limited by the [...] "VFX Gauge" [...] located {{at the top of the}} screen. Normally, the meter is full, giving the player access to Joe's super powers via his Viewtiful Joe transformation. The meter slowly empties when an ability is in use. Once it depletes, Viewtiful Joe changes to normal Joe, lowering his attack and defense and leaving him temporarily devoid of VFX Power. The VFX Gauge automatically refills over time and can also be manually filled by picking up bottles of [...] "VFX Juice". The first VFX Power is [...] "Slow", which slows time, causing the player's attacks to be more powerful, increasing Joe's reflexes, and allowing him to dodge attacks more easily. The second VFX Power, [...] "Mach Speed", allows Joe to move at a faster speed, creating multiple after-images of him when he unleashes a flurry of attacks on all enemies on the screen. It can additionally cause his attacks to envelop Joe in a temporary heat shield, rendering him immune to flame attacks and setting enemies on fire when struck. The last VFX Power, [...] "Zoom In", causes a camera close-up of Joe, <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> his normal attacks, granting him a set of new attacks, and paralyzing all lesser foes in proximity to him. However, any damage dealt to Joe whilst zoomed in is increased too. Any two VFX Powers can be combined. The VFX Gauge can be extended by collecting a certain number of V-Films present in each stage. The bar reverts to its normal length when a new stage begins.|$|E
