40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} pharmaceutical price regulation on delays in new drug launches. Because low price in one market may 'spill-over' to others, though parallel trade and external referencing, manufacturers may rationally prefer longer delay or non-launch to accepting a low price. We use a Cox proportional hazard model to analyze the launch experience in 25 major markets of 85 new chemical entities (NCEs) launched in the UK or US between 1994 and 1998. There are 1, 167 observed launches, or about 55 % of the maximum. The US leads with 73 launches, followed by Germany (66) and the UK (64). Only 13 NCEs launched in Japan, 26 in Portugal and 28 in New Zealand. Countries with fewer launches also have longer average launch lags. The launch hazard is positively related to expected price and to expected volume, controlling for income per capita. The originator firm(s) characteristics, specifically, launch in home country and global experience, also significantly reduce launch delay. Within the EU, likely <b>parallel</b> <b>export</b> countries have the most negative effects. Our results suggest that countries with lower expected prices or smaller expected market size experience longer delays in new drug access, controlling for per capita income and other country and firm characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of price {{regulation}} on delays in launch of new drugs. Because a low price in one market may ‘spill-over’ to other markets, through parallel trade and external referencing, manufacturers may rationally prefer longer delay or non-launch to accepting a relatively low price. We analyze the launch in 25 major markets, including 14 EU countries, of 85 new chemical entities (NCEs) launched between 1994 and 1998. Each NCE’s expected price and market size in a country are estimated using lagged average price and market size of other drugs in the same (or related) therapeutic class. We estimate a Cox proportional hazard model of launch in each country, relative to first global launch. Only 55 % of the potential launches occur. The US leads with 73 launches, followed by Germany (66) and the UK (64). Only 13 NCEs are launched in Japan, 26 in Portugal and 28 in New Zealand.

Laisvas prekių judėjimo principas yra pats svarbiausias elementas, kuriuo iki šiol buvo remiamasi, kuriant ir plėtojant Europos Sąjungos vidaus rinką. Lygiagrečios prekybos esmė Europos Sąjungoje yra prekiauti tokiais pačiais produkais, kokiais prekiauja jų gamintojų ar pradinių tiekėjų platinimo tinklai, tačiau prekyba vyksta ne pačiuose tikluose, o šalia jų. Magistro darbe tiriamas vaistų lygiagretus importas. Lygiagretus vaistų importas iš vienos valstybės narės, kur kainos yra mažesnės, į kitas valstybes nares, kur kainos yra didesnės, iš esmės leidžia šių vaistų pirkėjams pastarosiose valstybėse narėse turėti alternatyvų vaistų tiekimo šaltinį, o tai yra neabejotinai naudinga galutiniam šių vaistų vartotojui. Lygiagretūs importuotojai, vykdydami veiklą, negali pažeisti intelektinės nuosavybės - t. y. prekės ženklo - teisių. Tenka pripažinti, kad lygiagrečios prekybos santykis su prekės ženklo savininku nėra išsamiai reglamentuotas Europos Sąjungos teisės normomis ir įstatymais, todėl Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo praktika yra vienas svarbiausių teisės šaltinių. Prekės ženklo savininkas, žymėdamas identiškus produktus skirtingais prekių ženklais atskirose valstybėse narėse, prisideda prie valstybių narių rinkų padalijimo. Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo manymu perpakuoti arba keisti prekės ženklą yra objektyviai būtina tais atvejais, kai lygiagretus importuotojas negali teikti produktų į importo valstybės rinką originaliose pakuotėse, nes valstybių nacionalinės taisyklės, reguliuojančios prekės ženklus, neleidžia prekiauti produktais originaliose pakuotėse. Magistro darbu siekiama atskleisti, kada lygiagrečiam importuotojui susidaro būtinybė keisti prekės ženklą. Darbe tiriama Europos Sąjungos valstybių narių nacionalinė specifika ir nustatyta, kad valstybės narės turi skirtingas teisės normas, reguliuojančias produktų, apsaugotų intelektinės nuosavybės teisėmis, įvedimą į rinką. Pateikiami atvejai, kai dėl susidariusios objektyviosios būtinybės lygiagretus importuotojas yra priverstas pakeisti prekės ženklą, nes kitaip negalėtų patekti į priimančios valstybės rinką. Atskleista, kad būtinybė pakeisti prekės ženklą, gali susidaryti dėl valstybių rinkų apribojimo, dėl vartotojų priešiškumo, dėl vartotojų klaidinimo pavojaus. Taipogi darbas atskleidžia lygiagretaus importuotojo teisių ribojimus, norint pakeisti prekės ženklą. The {{parallel}} import of medical devices {{is becoming a}} significant phenomenon in the global economy. In the European Union the {{parallel import}} is linked {{to one of the}} fundamental freedoms of the European Union - the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is the most important element, which so far has been the basis for creation and development of the European Union's internal market. The essence of the parallel trade in the European Union is to trade the same products that are in the market of distribution networks of their manufacturers or primary suppliers, while the trade is taking place not in the same networks but next to them. The <b>parallel</b> <b>export</b> of drugs from one Member State where the prices are low to other Member States where the prices are higher basically allows the buyers of such drugs to have an alternative source of supply in the latter Member States, which certainly brings some benefits to the final consumer of such drugs. One of the measures that justify the restrictions on parallel trade is the protection of intellectual property - the trademark protection. It has to be admitted that the relationship of the parallel trade with the trademark owner has not been fully regulated by the European Union legislation and the law, therefore the practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union {{is one of the most}} important sources of law. And when trademark owner implementing his own right,marks the products with different trademarks in different Member States and thus, contribute to the market restriction of the European Union Member States. According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is objectively necessary to repackage or otherwise change the brand in cases where the parallel importer cannot provide the products to the market of the importing country in their original packages because the national rules governing trademarks differ. The aim of the Master thesis is to reveal when the parallel importer has the need to rebrand a trademark. It analyzes the rights of the trademark owner addressing disputes with the parallel importer. In addressing the legal issue the thesis present and thoroughly analyzes the decisions of the Court of Justice of European Union regarding product repackaging and change of the brand. The thesis provides the analysis of the national characteristics of the European Union Member States. It has been found out that the Member States have different legal rules on market access for the products protected by intellectual property rights. Master thesis focuses on specific cases of change of the brand. It describes the legislation regulating the doctrine on the trademark owner's rights. Further, it analyzes in detail the decisions of the German Supreme Court and the decisions of the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal. It distinguishes the circumstances for the need to change the trademark. Establishes the cases when and why the objective necessity to change the brand results. Revealed that parallel importer may change the trademark when the goods marked by the original manufacturer's trademark cannot enter into the market of the importing country for the risk of consumers being misled when, for example, the import country has a similar trademark of another manufacturer. Also the parallel importer may change the original trademark because when marking the products by different brand the owner of the trademark has contributed to the limitations of the markets of Member States. The parallel importer may change the original trademark because of the consumers’ hostility to the original trademark. It also discloses when the parallel importer may seek to change the trademark to gain commercial advantage. It should be noted that there may be cases where the parallel importer changes the trademark in order to take advantage of the trademark advertising already existing in the import state, and in this way guarantee a successfully enter to the market...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{shortages}} of medicines {{have become an}} issue in many countries. This negatively impacts on the quality and efficiency of the care of patients. The scientific evidence regarding drug shortages {{in terms of their}} extent and rationale is still scarce. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize, compare and evaluate potential solutions and legislative frameworks which exist within health care systems across a range of European countries, aimed at preventing or mitigating drug shortages. Methods: The survey was distributed among national health authority and health insurance company experts knowledgeable of the European pharmaceutical markets. It included questions pertaining to: 1) general characteristics of drug shortages; 2) alertness on drug shortages and description of information systems; 3) public service obligations; 4) regulations associated with the problem of drug shortages. Results: The findings are based on feedback from 16 European countries. In the majority of countries formal definitions of drug shortages currently don’t exist. Shortages have occurred in all countries throughout the last decade and have typically been increasing. The types of medicines experiencing shortages are generally well recognized, however the frequency and duration of shortages are varied and unpredictable. The notification-related obligations of Marketing Authorization Holders in cases which could lead to drug shortages exist in almost all countries. At least one institution per country is involved in national reporting system but access to information is often limited to the public. In the majority of countries, there exist formal obligations associated with supplying medicines to cover patients’ needs so as not to compromise patient care. A few countries have attempted to limit <b>parallel</b> <b>exports</b> to cope with drug shortages. Conclusions: Drug shortages have become an increasingly important public health problem.

40|$|Drug {{shortages}} {{have been}} identified as a public health problem in an increasing number of countries. This can negatively impact on the quality and efficiency of patient care, as well as contribute to increases in the cost of treatment and the workload of health care providers. Shortages also raise ethical and political issues. The scientific evidence on drug shortages is still scarce, but many lessons can be drawn from cross-country analyses. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize, compare, and evaluate the current systemic measures and legislative and organizational frameworks aimed at preventing or mitigating drug shortages within health care systems across a range of European and Western Asian countries. The study design was retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive and observational. Information was gathered through a survey distributed among senior personnel from ministries of health, state medicines agencies, local health authorities, other health or pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement authorities, health insurance companies and academic institutions, with knowledge of the pharmaceutical markets in the 28 countries studied. Our study found that formal definitions of drug shortages currently exist in only a few countries. The characteristics of drug shortages, including their assortment, duration, frequency and dynamics, were found to be variable and sometimes difficult to assess. Numerous information hubs were identified. Providing public access to information on drug shortages to the maximum possible extent is a prerequisite for performing more advanced studies on the problem and identifying solutions. Imposing public service obligations, providing the formal possibility to prescribe unlicensed medicines, and temporary bans on <b>parallel</b> <b>exports</b> are widespread measures. A positive finding of our study was the identification of numerous bottom-up initiatives and organizational frameworks aimed at preventing or mitigating drug shortages. The experiences and lessons drawn from these initiatives should be carefully evaluated, monitored and presented to a wider international audience for careful appraisal. To be able to find solutions to the problem of drug shortages, there is an urgent need to develop a set of agreed definitions for drug shortages, as well as methodologies for their evaluation and monitoring.

40|$|The general {{secretory}} pathway (Sec) and twin-arginine translocase (Tat) {{operate in}} <b>parallel</b> to <b>export</b> proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. Substrates are targeted {{to their respective}} machineries by N-terminal signal peptides that share a tripartite organization; however, Tat signal peptides harbor a conserved and almost invariant arginine pair that is critical for efficient targeting to the Tat machinery. Tat signal peptides interact with a membrane-bound receptor complex comprised of TatB and TatC components, with TatC containing the twin-arginine recognition site. Here, we isolated suppressors in the signal peptide of the Tat substrate, SufI, that restored Tat transport {{in the presence of}} inactivating substitutions in the TatC twin-arginine binding site. These suppressors increased signal peptide hydrophobicity, and copurification experiments indicated that they restored binding to the variant TatBC complex. The hydrophobic suppressors could also act in cis to suppress substitutions at the signal peptide twin-arginine motif that normally prevent targeting to the Tat pathway. Highly hydrophobic variants of the SufI signal peptide containing four leucine substitutions retained the ability to interact with the Tat system. The hydrophobic signal peptides of two Sec substrates, DsbA and OmpA, containing twin lysine residues, were shown to mediate export by the Tat pathway and to copurify with TatBC. These findings indicate that there is unprecedented overlap between Sec and Tat signal peptides and that neither the signal peptide twin-arginine motif nor the TatC twin-arginine recognition site is an essential mechanistic feature for operation of the Tat pathway...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to study}} {{the role played by}} SmvA pump in the efflux of {{quaternary}} ammonium compounds (QACs) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium). Methods: Mutants in the smvA, acrB and tolC genes were constructed by the red swap method. P 22 was used to transduce tolC to acrB and smvA mutant strains. The susceptibility of these strains to acriflavine and a variety of QACs was determined by MIC assays. Results: In comparison with the Salmonella Typhimurium wild-type strain, the smvA mutant was more susceptible to QACs than the acrB mutant strain. A tolC single mutant was more susceptible than an acrB mutant to QACs, acriflavine, ethidium bromide, malachite green and pyronin B. The tolC–acrB double mutant was as susceptible as the single tolC mutant to QACs. Additionally, the smvA mutant strain was more susceptible to acriflavine than the acrB mutant (MICs 5 31. 3 versus 125 mg/L, i. e. 4 - fold). Finally, the tolC–smvA double mutant (3. 9 mg/L) was approximately 10 times more susceptible to acriflavine than either smvA (31. 3 mg/L) or tolC (31. 3 mg/L) single mutants. Conclusions: It is the SmvA efflux pump, and not AcrB, that plays the major role in the efflux of acriflavine and other QACs from Salmonella Typhimurium. This apparently conflicting report {{is due to the fact}} that in Escherichia coli the smvA gene does not exist.

The expansionary effect is particularly evident with respect to anticipated persistent depreciation in the long-run.

40|$|The EU and the USA {{presented}} a joint framework to re-launch the WTO agricultural negotiations on August 13 th 2003. The paper makes proposals {{on how to}} deal with each of three major pillars: domestic support; market access; export competition. On domestic support it proposes substantial cuts by all members who use trade-distorting forms of support, recognising that those who subsidise more will have to cut more. Less trade-distorting domestic support should be allowed where: direct payments are based on 'fixed areas and yields or such payments are made on 85 % of less of the base level of production; in the case of livestock programmes payments are made on a fixed number of livestock units; such support does not exceed 5 % of the total value of agricultural production by the end of the implementation period; the sum of allowed support under the aggregate measure of support and de minimis levels are reduced. On market access a hybrid formula is proposed, marrying the gentle across-the-board cuts used in previous international farm agreements with a call for a more aggressive capping of duties in some areas. The importance of the concept of 'sensitive products' is recognised and a special safeguard provision is envisaged for developing countries to protect sensitive products from excessive imports. The framework also proposes lower tariff cuts and longer implementation periods for developing countries. On export competition the framework calls for a 'clearly defined parallelism between the disciplines imposed on export subsidies, refunds and export credits and provides partial elimination of export subsidisation on a list of products of interest to developing countries. Finally it provides a path for <b>parallel</b> reduction of <b>export</b> subsidisation for products on which such support is not eliminated and for the disciplining of the activities of state-trading enterprises. Comment: The EU/US framework has not been warmly received. The Indian representative said it was 'not feasible', adding that 'it does not take account of our farmers interests&# 133; and seems to be an attempt to prise open developing country markets without commitment by rich countries to open theirs'.
