40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{capacity}} of an opportunistic scheduling system in a spectrum sharing environment where multiple secondary users can share a frequency spectrum with multiple primary users as long as secondary users do not cause interference power exceeding a given threshold to the primary users. We consider three different power control schemes of secondary users: fixed <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> and infinite <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> schemes. Our numerical and simulation results show that {{the capacity of}} the adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme {{is similar to that of}} the fixed <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme in the low <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> region, while the capacity of the adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme is close to that of the infinite <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme in the high <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> region and is saturated beyond a certain point.

30|$|Each UE’s <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> can be regulated. However, the <b>transmit</b> <b>powers</b> {{have not}} been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of the UEs by switching between predefined <b>power</b> amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R

2500|$|Near-field or nonradiative region – This {{means the}} area within about 1 {{wavelength}} (λ) of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and {{power can be}} transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling (electrostatic induction) between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling (electromagnetic induction) between coils of wire. These fields are not radiative, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no receiving device or absorbing material within their limited range to [...] "couple" [...] to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on {{the size and shape}} of the [...] "antenna" [...] devices, which are usually coils of wire.
