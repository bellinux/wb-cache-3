5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest <b>possible</b> world, or the best of all <b>possible</b> worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best <b>possible</b> world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best <b>possible</b> world.|$|E

5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the <b>possible</b> explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a <b>possible</b> heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a <b>possible</b> option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a <b>possible</b> candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all <b>possible</b> combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of <b>possible</b> MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of <b>possible</b> alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E
