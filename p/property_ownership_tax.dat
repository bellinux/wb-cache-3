40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the use and effects of real property transfer taxes, especially in the U. S. This paper examines the variety of transfer tax programs currently in use in the U. S. and compares them to property taxes in terms of equity, efficiency, and revenue potential and stability. The next section examines the widespread use of property transfer taxes in the U. S. and other countries and compares them in terms of tax rates, tax base, tax authority, and use of revenues. In Section 3 we discuss the distributional impact of property transfer taxes including who ultimately bears the burden of the tax and whether the tax is regressive or progressive with respect to income. Section 4 looks at the efficiency effects of transfer taxes including the excess burden of the tax and its effect on household mobility. Section 5 examines the revenue potential of transfer taxes and their volatility, and Section 6 summarizes and concludes. <b>Property</b> Transactions, <b>Property</b> <b>Ownership,</b> proporty <b>tax...</b>|$|R
40|$|The French {{cadastral}} map depicts and identifies <b>property</b> <b>ownership</b> for <b>tax</b> purposes. It {{is the only}} continually-updated, large-scale plot map that covers all of French territory. The map is published annually in each French municipality and has been available free of charge {{to the general public}} since 2008 on the website www. cadastre. gouv. fr/, which has proved to be extremely successful. The computerisation of the {{cadastral map}}, which the Directorate General of Taxes started in 1993 in partnership with local authorities, made additional incremental improvements to the correlation between cadastral and land register information, which was a fundamental principle laid down during the major reform of real property registration in 1955. In addition to the cadastral map itself, the computerisation of all land, cadastral and mortgage, documentation has made the French cadastral and mortgage system more reliable, flexible and economical, and has contributed to maintaining a form of social order for 200 years in the area of land ownership. It has thus helped to consolidate a climate of trust. The computerisation of the system has also led to major productivity gains for the administration and offers new services to administration officers, land and real estate professionals, and to the general public...|$|R

40|$|In countries, such as Singapore, {{that have}} {{implemented}} vehicle congestion policies, {{recent years have}} seen a shift towards motor vehicle taxes based on car use. <b>Ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> {{reduce the number of}} cars on the road, leaving the price per trip largely unaffected. Use taxes such as fuel taxes and road use charges decrease the price of trips without necessarily penalising vehicle ownership per se. This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model involving trips from residential areas to a central business district, along with modal choice between cars and public transit. Car trips involve fixed costs but have lower variable costs per trip (including convenience costs) then bus trips. Using a calibrated numerical model, we investigate the relative merits of <b>ownership</b> and use <b>taxes.</b> We compare full internalisation of congestion externalities to optimal tax outcomes for the different tax types. In our framework, use taxes restore Pareto optimality since congestion damage rises with more trips. <b>Ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> only partially internalise congestion externalities. However, in terms of revenue-raising ability, the marginal excess burdens of <b>ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> in the neighbourhood of optimal taxes are typically lower than use taxes. This is because marginal increases in <b>ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> take away part of the surplus accruing to consumers who still choose to travel by car, and thus have less distortion at the margin. ...|$|R
