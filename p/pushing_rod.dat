40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} of aerospace relay directly influences the {{reliability of}} the whole system. The analysis and research on the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> are an important process of aerospace relay reliability design. In the past, most researches were done for electromagnetic systems and spring systems of aerospace relays. However, there was not any research on the position of the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod.</b> An analytical method for the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is presented in this paper. From four aspects, including the electromagnetic force and torque, work done by the electromagnetic force and displacement, the optimum position of a <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is investigated based on the analysis of a straight spring system. The conclusions can be used to direct the optimum design and assembling of aerospace relays...|$|E

30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} {{allowed us}} to obtain the most probable conductance values for a single-molecule junction by collecting thousands of breaking curves (see Fig.  1 c) and building conductance histograms. In this work, the conductance of the MBCJ devices was measured at room temperature applying a bias voltage of 0.1  V and measuring the related current (sampling rate of 2 KHz) by a battery-powered logarithmic amplifier capable of recording currents over a range of nine orders of magnitude. During the electrical tests, the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> was moved {{at the speed of}} 4  nm/s. To improve the reproducibility of our results, different samples were considered during various days.|$|E
30|$|The low-bias {{conductance}} and {{formation of}} single-molecule junctions were studied using the MCBJ technique. The lithographic MCBJ device {{consists of a}} narrow gold constriction patterned {{on top of a}} flexible phosphor-bronze substrate coated with a polyimide layer for insulation[29]. The layout of the MCBJ device clamped in a three-point bending configuration is shown in Figure  1 b. By driving the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> against the bottom part of the MCBJ device, the gold constriction is stretched until it breaks, leaving a pair of sharp electrodes separated by a nanometer-scale gap. Once the bridge is broken, atomic-sized gold contacts were repeatedly formed and broken by moving the electrodes towards and away from each other at a speed of 9 nm/s. Simultaneously, using a logarithmic amplifier the conductance G = I/V was measured with a bias voltage of 0.1 V applied across the electrodes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: To predict {{spinal cord}} {{ischemia}} after {{endovascular stent graft}} repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, temporary interruption of the intercostal arteries (including the aneurysm) was performed by placement of a novel retrievable stent graft (Retriever) in the aorta under evoked spinal cord potential monitoring. Methods: From February 1995 to October 1997, endovascular stent graft repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms was performed in 49 patients after informed consent was obtained. In 16 patients with aneurysms located {{in the middle and}} distal segment of the descending aorta, the Retriever was placed temporarily before stent graft deployment. The Retriever consisted of two units of self-expanding zigzag stents connected in tandem with stainless steel struts. Each strut was collected in a bundle fixed to a <b>pushing</b> <b>rod,</b> and the stent framework was lined with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sheet. The Retriever was delivered beyond the aneurysm through a sheath and was retracted into the sheath 20 minutes later. A stent graft for permanent use was deployed in patients whose predeployment test results with the Retriever were favorable. Evoked spinal cord potential was monitored throughout placement of the Retriever and stent grafting until the next day. Results: The Retriever was placed in 17 aneurysms in 16 patients. There were no changes in amplitude or latency of evoked spinal cord potential records obtained before or during Retriever placement. After withdrawal of the Retriever, all aneurysms were excluded from circulation immediately after permanent stent grafting. There were no changes in evoked spinal cord potential, nor were neurologic deficits seen after stent graft deployment in any patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that predeployment testing with the Retriever under evoked spinal cord potential monitoring is promising as a predictor of spinal cord ischemia in candidates for stent graft repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms.

40|$|A side-slide {{actuator}} and a corrugated diaphragm actuator will {{be analyzed}} and optimized this summer. Coupled electrostatic and fluid analyses {{will also be}} initiated. Both the side-slide actuator and the corrugated diaphragm actuator {{will be used to}} regulate the flow of fuel in a jet engine. Many of the side-slide actuators will be placed on top of a fuel injector that is still in the developmental stage as well. The corrugated diaphragm actuator will also be used to regulate the flow of fuel in fuel injectors. A comparative analysis of the performance matrix of both actuators will be conducted. The side-slide actuator uses the concept of mechanical advantage to regulate the flow of fuel using electrostatic forces. It is made from Nickel, Silicon Carbide, and thin layers of Oxide. The slider will have a hole in the middle that will allow fuel to pass through the hole underneath it. The goal is to regulate the flow of fuel through the inlet. This means that the actuator needs to be designed so that when a voltage is applied to the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> the slider will deflect in the x-direction and be able to completely block the inlet and no fuel can pass through. Different voltage levels will be tested. The parameters that are being optimized are the thickness of the diaphragm, what kind of corrugation the diaphragm should have, the length, width, and thickness of the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> and what design should be used to return the slider. The current possibilities for a return rod are a built in spring on the slider, a return rod that acts like a spring, or a return rod that is identical to the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The final actuator design should have a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> that has rotational motion and no translation motion, a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> thickness that prevents warping due to the slider, and a large ratio of the displacement {{on the bottom of the}} <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> to displacement on the top of the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The corrugated diaphragm actuator was optimized last winter and this summer will be spent completing the optimization of the coupled electrostatic and fluid flow parameters. It was found that Nickel is the best material to use for the diaphragm because it has a higher yield strength and allows for a larger stress, deflection and applied pressure. The parameters that were optimized were the wavelength and thickness of the diaphragm...|$|R
