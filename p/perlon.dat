25|$|The {{parts of}} a violin are usually made from {{different}} types of wood (although electric violins may not be made of wood at all, since their sound may not be dependent on specific acoustic characteristics of the instrument's construction, but rather an electronic pickup, amplifier and speaker). Violins can be strung with gut, <b>Perlon</b> or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or <b>Perlon),</b> Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E
40|$|Spanish Young Generation in Nuclear (Jóvenes Nucleares, JJNN) is a non-profrt {{organization}} {{that depends on}} the Spanish Nuclear Society (Sociedad Nuclear Española, SNE). Since one of rts main goals is to spread the knowledge about nuclear power,severa! technical tours to facilities wrth an importan!role in the nuclear fuel cycle have been organized for the purpose ofleaming about the different stages of the Spanish tuel cycle. Spanish Young Generation in Nuclear had the opportunity to visit ENUSA Fuel Assembly Factory in Juzbado (Salamanca, Spain), Where it could be understood the front-end cycle which involves the uranium supply and storage, design and manufacturing of fuel bundles for European nuclear power plants. Alterwards, due to the tour of Almaraz NPP (PWR) and Santa María de Garoña NPP (BWR), rt could be comprehended how to obtain energy from this fuel in two different types of reactors. Furthermore,in these two plants, the facilities related to the back-end cycle could be toured. lt was possible to watch the Spent FuelPools, where the fuel bundles are stored under water until their activity is reduced enough to transport them to an Individual Temporary Storage Facility orto the Centralized Temporary Storage. Finally, a technical tour to ENSA Heavy Components Factory (ENSA) was accomplished, Where it could be experienced at first hand how different Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) components and other nuclear elements, such as racks or shipping and storage casks for spent nuclear fuel, are manulactured. All these <b>perlonned</b> technical tours were a complete success thanks to a generous care and know-how of the wor 1 <ers in charge of leading the technicaltours. The unanimous opinion of the participants was that taking part in this kind of activities is a worthWhile expeñence which has exceeded their expectations...|$|R
2500|$|Strings {{were first}} made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut, which despite the name {{did not come}} from cats), or simply gut, which was stretched, dried, and twisted. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, strings were made of either gut, silk, aluminum, or steel. Modern strings may be gut, solid steel, {{stranded}} steel, or various synthetic materials such as <b>perlon,</b> wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver. Most E strings are unwound, either plain or gold-plated steel. Currently, violin strings are not made with gut as much, but many performers use them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance of Baroque music. Strings have a limited lifetime. When a violinist plays a string, oil from their hands and sweat can slowly damage the strings. As well, rosin from the bow can accumulate on the part that is bowed. Eventually, when oil, dirt, sweat and rosin accumulate, the string can become old and dirty. Apart from obvious things, such as the winding of a string coming undone from wear, players generally change a string when it no longer plays [...] "true" [...] (with good intonation on the harmonics), losing the desired tone, brilliance and intonation. String longevity depends on string quality and playing intensity. In the 2010s, a huge variety of strings are available.|$|E
